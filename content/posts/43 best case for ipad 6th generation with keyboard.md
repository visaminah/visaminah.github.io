-   ▸ You may still be able to use the iPad mini 6 **keyboard** case – but only if you have tiny palms and fingers. And a strong determination. What’s the reason for this determination, anyway? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note that some companies haven't confirmed that their **keyboard** cases are compatible with the newest iPads. Any case that fits a 2020 iPad should fit the 2021 iPad as well, but the 2021 iPad mini is a different size from the previous minis. Make sure the case you get fits the model you have.

-   As more features are added to the Apple iPad and iPad Pro, making them nearly as capable as a full computer, many people use them as primary devices for getting work done, both while at home and on the road. However, typing on a touchscreen can be rather frustrating, so there are **keyboard**s specifically designed for iPads that you can use to enhance your typing experience. Some of them come in folio cases, so you'll have to make sure it fits your specific iPad, while others are stand-alone **keyboard**s, so you can use them as long as they have Bluetooth support. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ▸ For typing, you will rotate the iPad mini 6 to landscape position. The height (now the width) of iPad mini 6 is smaller than the width of a letter size or A4 size sheet.

-   When connecting to an iPad, a **keyboard** case often uses a wireless Bluetooth connection, so you don’t have to mess with any pesky wires and cables. As the cases are wireless, however, some of them need to be charged separately from time to time or have their batteries replaced.

While the touchscreen of your iPad is still enabled when connected to the **keyboard**, having a touchpad mouse to control the cursor can be extremely useful. To save power, the **keyboard** enters sleep mode when it’s not used for 10 minutes. Additionally, the rainbow-colored backlights turn off when they’re not touched for four seconds, but they light up as soon as you begin typing again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This iPad **keyboard** case is likely the closest you’ll find to replicating a traditional laptop.
