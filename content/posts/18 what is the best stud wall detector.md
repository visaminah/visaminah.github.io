## 18 Things You Should Know About What Is The Best Stud Wall Detector | Zircon Stud Finder
-   Another great **stud** finder, this model comes with a range of features. It has over four scanning modes, including three different **stud** scans, a metal scan, and an AC scan. It can detect materials from wood to metal pipes, beams, rebar, and even live AC wire behind walls, floors, and ceilings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To estimate the placement of the next **stud**, mark the first **stud** you find and measure 16 inches from it. In that place, look for the same symptoms of a **stud**, or knock sharply on the wall with your knuckles and pay attention to any solid sound rather than a hollow one. If you do not locate evidence of a second **stud** 16 inches from the first, measure 24 inches from the first and examine again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Dewalt Stud Finder is good for wood and metal detection. You can eliminate the guessing and locate **stud**s with ease. While regular **stud** sensors identify a **stud**’s edge, this one locates a **stud**’s center, allowing for a more accurate read even when held at an angle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dimples can give you a clue of where drywall is secured to the edge of a **stud**. While these are sometimes visible to the naked eye, a flashlight can assist in illuminating any minor dimples in the wall. To attempt this technique, position the spotlights parallel to the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want a **stud** finder that’s small, compact and easy to bring with you, this is a great option. It can easily fit in your pocket, so it’s not hard to take with you on the go. It also comes with a powerful magnet so you won’t need any batteries to operate it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Look for outlets or nails in the baseboard. The baseboard is often nailed to the **stud**s, and outlets are typically nailed to the **stud**s’ sides as well. Electrical switches are also frequently positioned on the sides of **stud**s further up the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To determine whether or not you’ve located a **stud** without causing damage to your wall, Rothman recommends lightly tapping or knocking the area with your hammer. Tap slightly to the left or right if you hear an empty or a hollow sound. When the sound becomes muted, you’ve struck a **stud**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nowadays, there is an app for almost anything – including discovering **stud**s. The majority of **stud** finder applications are magnetic, which means they use the built-in magnetometer on your smartphone to locate metal items inside the wall. While this may assist you in locating a wall **stud**, it may also provide a false positive, as the app may identify other objects such as nails or electrical lines. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are still unable to locate the **stud** after drilling, there is one more technique you can try. Untwist a wire hanger to create a straight angle. Utilize your new gadget to explore the area behind the wall. When the wire makes touch with a solid object, you’ve discovered a **stud**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To save time, the sensor is calibrated. After it locates a **stud** behind a plaster wall, for example, it sounds an audible alarm and LED arrows indicate the location. The exact center marking channel makes it easy to identify the **stud**’s center. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike other **stud** finders, it can detect metal and wood **stud**s at ¾ inches deep. The **stud** finder can identify live wires at a two inch depth. It also has a feature that locates **stud** centers and other hidden materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Stanley **stud** finder is one of the most affordable **stud** finders of its kind. The **stud** finder is equipped with extra perks for DIY experts in need of an advanced tool. The **stud** finder has a clean LCD screen for information viewing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Often, DIY projects require you to hang something from a drywall surface at home. When you encounter such a project, you should be prepared. This is why owning **stud** finder is essential. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for something that isn’t expensive, this is a great **stud** finder. It can detect both wood and metal **stud**s that are up to 1.5 inches deep and will even let you know if it detects live electrical wiring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Electronic **stud** finders have LCD screens that offer easy visualization. With deep scan mode technology, many **stud** finders can detect drywall screws and wooden **stud**s. If you’re looking for live electrical wires or metal objects, use a **stud** finder equipped with a wire detection feature and multiple sensors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Project a flashlight against the wall at a steel angle. Scan the surface for a column of dimples and bumps. These imperfections are formed by nails that secure the wall’s surface to the **stud**s, indicating that there is almost probably a **stud** beneath them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the area where you believe you have discovered a **stud**, drive a small nail into the wall. If the nail does not penetrate the wood beneath the drywall or plaster, pull it out and replace it with a wire hanger. The hanger should be twisted. If you are looking in the correct position and are slightly off, the hanger should strike the **stud**, indicating location. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turn on the device and select the scanning mode of your choice Place the device flat on the wall and hold the button until the calibration is complete. You should be able to hear a short beep to let you know that it’s good to go. Continue to hold the button and move the device along the surface to scan it. When the **stud** finder detects that there’s an object, it will beep, and the corresponding data will be displayed on the LCD screen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
