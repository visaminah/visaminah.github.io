-   Grey couches are classic, versatile, and go with a wide variety of rug **colors** and styles. For a relaxed vibe, try pairing your cool grey couch with a rug with warm tones of coral and brown.

-   Sheer **gray** window panels give this mostly **gray** living room a romantic feel, and the patterned rug brings in just the right amount of modern.

-   When incorporating color into a monochrome **gray** room, remember that less is more. A neutral background makes even the smallest hint of color stand out, so use other decorative hues sparingly.

-   Are you looking for ideas to furnish your child’s room? Although charcoal is very versatile, it is definitely not suitable for a toddler’s room.
