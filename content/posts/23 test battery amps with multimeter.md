## 23 Tips for Test Battery Amps With Multimeter | How To Check Battery Charging Current With Multimeter
-   Cranking Amps – It is the maximum current that a fully charged battery can supply for 30 seconds without any voltage drop. It is a parameter for measuring the strength of the battery. The cold and the hot cranking **amps** show how the battery will perform in cold and hot weather conditions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some **multimeter**s – usually the cheaper ones – tend to have both the AC and DC voltage ranges sharing the same position on the dial selector. Unless your **multimeter** is specifically made for the automotive market, it will likely default to AC voltage. Don’t fret as you can easily switch between the two, usually via a ‘select’ switch either below the display or in the center of the dial. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, the rating on a label does not always reflect the true condition of the battery. As the battery ages, its total capacity decreases, as do its amp hours and ampere rating. To determine the current state of your car battery, use a battery tester or a digital **multimeter**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most meters today are auto ranging, meaning after setting it to DC voltage, you won’t need to do anything else. The other, older type is a manual ranging **multimeter**, where you need to select the correct range regards the projected value of the circuit you are going to test. Most of the manual ranging meters have a 20V range, which is what you need to test a car battery. The 20V range means it will measure between 0V and 20V. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **multimeter** will then display the current amperage of the battery. If the battery is able to provide enough power to start your vehicle, the amperage should be around 12 volts. If the amperage is lower than 12 volts, it may not be able to provide enough power to start your vehicle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So with the engine running (and being mindful about moving parts) conduct the same battery test as above with your **multimeter**. A healthy charging system should give a reading of between 13.8V and 14.4V at regular idle speed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Other than trying to start the engine to see if there’s charge, the best way to decipher a car battery’s status is to test it using a **multimeter**. Digital **multimeter**s are the best option for this since they give a more accurate reading, although you could also use an analog one. And even a cheap, category I (CAT-I) **multimeter** is fine as you are merely testing voltage, not amperage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tip: if you are a beginner looking how to use a **multimeter** to test a car battery to ascertain its voltage, consider getting one that has a dedicated battery tester range on it. The INNOVA 3320 is good for this. Other popular automotive **multimeter**s include the INNOVA 3340 and the top of the line Fluke 88V. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Select the DC volts position on your **multimeter** (or the 12V setting if you have a dedicated car battery test range). DC voltage is usually marked as a V followed by a short line with a dotted line beneath it. The wavy line after a V is AC (alternating current) voltage and is for checking the mains voltage in your house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the **multimeter** reads less than 12.6 volts, disconnect the battery and fully charge it using a battery charger. Then let it rest overnight. If it holds a charge when it's not connected to the car – something is draining the battery far faster than the computer memory and digital clock. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   4. Finally, read the number that appears on the **multimeter** display. This is the voltage of your battery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   WARNING! Once the **multimeter** is on Amps do not connect it directly across the battery and do not hit the starter button while testing for current Amps. This will cause the internal fuse in the **multimeter** to blow! A **multimeter** set on current is a very low resistance, almost a short circuit and will draw as much current as your battery will supply till something melts. Always plug the Multimeter leads back to volts when you have finished testing to avoid blowing the fuse next time you use your **multimeter**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, you will need to connect the positive lead of the **multimeter** to the positive terminal of the battery. Next, you will need to connect the negative lead of the **multimeter** to the negative terminal of the battery. Finally, you will need to turn on the **multimeter** and set it to the amperage setting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Load test: a load is applied to the battery while its voltage is monitored. You can do this by starting the engine and monitoring the voltage with a **multimeter** that has a Min/Max mode. This will automatically store the high and low voltages it picks up. The high voltage will likely be in the 14V area and is perfectly normal, while a drop under 9.6V during the process would indicate it can no longer effectively hold charge and needs changing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can use a **multimeter** to test the voltage of your car battery at home. This is a simple and easy way to check if your battery is healthy or needs to be replaced. Follow the steps above to get an accurate reading of your battery's voltage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The CA rating is the maximum current that a fully charged battery can deliver for 30 seconds at 32°F (0°C) without dropping below 7.2V. It is also referred to as hot cranking **amps** (HCA) or marine cranking **amps** (MCA) because it indicates how a battery will perform in hot weather or marine condition. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An amp, or ampere, is a unit of measurement for electrical current. Current is defined as the rate at which electrons flow through an electrical conductor. In this case, the conductor is your battery. Measuring **amps** is important for understanding how your battery works and troubleshooting problems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In short, you will need to set the **multimeter** to the 20-volt DC setting. Next, turn off the ignition and lights. Connect the red cable to the battery’s positive (+) terminal and the black cable to the battery’s negative (-) terminal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are using a **multimeter**, you can measure the volt of the battery. To measure **amps**, you have to know the ohm rating of the battery. Using Ohm’s law, you can find **amps** by dividing the measured volt by the ohm rating of the car battery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here, we check the charge, or voltage, of your car battery. This is achieved by measuring the DC voltage of the battery in parallel with the **multimeter**. If you are looking to test for amperage draw (parasitic draw) – testing **amps** in series – we cover that process in this guide. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, knowing your battery’s reserve capacity can help you determine whether the battery is suitable for your vehicle. A high-quality battery should be able to deliver at least 25 **amps** before the voltage begins to drop. Anything less than this indicates that the battery is of poor quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Capacity – The capacity of a battery is measured in Amp Hour. It represents how many **amps** of charge the battery can supply for hours until its voltage reaches the cut-off voltage. Generally, the cut-off voltage is 10.5V for a lead-acid battery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Normally, a car battery charger sends 2 **amps** of power per hour to the battery. Generally, it takes around 24 hours to charge a battery. You may consider this to be slow but slowing charging of a car battery is always preferred because it prevents overcharging and damaging the battery and reducing its lifespan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
