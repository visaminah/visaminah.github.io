## 48 Reference List: How Do You Figure Out Linear Feet From Square Feet | What is a Linear Foot and How to Measure It?
-   To calculate how much paint you need for a wall, you don’t need to know **linear** footage. Instead, you need to know the square footage. Not of the room, because that would be the floor. You need to know the square footage of the walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But in short, a **linear** foot is simply twelve inches that are in a straight line. Many construction materials are sold by **linear** foot. This includes boards and other oblong materials that depend on the length rather than the width. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **linear** foot is a unit of measurement of length. A piece of material measuring, for example 3 **feet** wide by 15 **feet** long would be 15 **linear** **feet**. The same piece of material could be described as 45 square **feet**; 3 **feet** wide x 15 **linear** **feet** which equals 45 square **feet**. Note: Sometimes the term "running foot is used to mean **linear** foot". - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Linear foot measures length only and is the simples form of measurement used in construction. It is one measurement, which is just length. Here are a few things measured by **linear** foot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – this is solid stone, as we already talked about gravel. Solid stone, marble, and other similar natural minerals are calculated in cubic **feet** because they are solid and surface area wouldn’t be useful knowledge. Boxes – there it is! Of course, boxes and containers are calculated by cubic **feet** because you need to know how much they will hold. This is how moving vans and even shipping containers are calculated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Square foot covers a surface area and is the most common type of measurement used in construction. It is two measurements, length times width. Here are a few things that are measured by square **feet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Divide the total number of pallets by two. Take this number and multiply it by the pallet length in inches. Divide this number by 12, and you’ll have the shipment’s **linear** **feet**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – flooring is usually sold by the box, but in general, it will show how much square footage it covers because you need to cover the entire floor, not just the perimeter. This is true for any type of floor. Paint – no matter what you’re painting, you will almost always calculate the square foot rather than the **linear** foot. This is because you need to cover a surface area. Even if it’s furniture, which is difficult to calculate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The difference is pretty simple. Square **feet** will calculate the total number of **feet** within the entire drawing. Linear **feet** will only calculate 1 edge of the print. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For Example, If your drawing was 28x57 (in).. In **feet** it would be 2.333x4.75 = 11.08 - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gravel – gravel is usually sold by the load or cubic **feet**. This is because it is usually poured into ditches, gaps, and patios. So the easiest way to figure how much gravel you need is to measure the cubic **feet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Armed with a comprehensive understanding of **linear** **feet**, you should be able to save money on your next shipment, avoid unnecessary fees, and complete your shipment preparation in an efficient manner. While the concept of **linear** **feet** is simple, its application in shipping is extensive. Understanding the ins-and-outs of its various uses can prove enormously helpful next time you plan a shipment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Older machines used to track by the **linear** foot. Sometime in newer machines, They will track both. The Xerox 6204 tracks both. Any Newer Oce' or KIP printer will only track in square **feet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are two general measurements used to sell materials. Square foot and **linear** foot. But another important measurement is the cubic foot, which measures the length, width, and height, rather than just one or two measurements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Alternatively, you can perform the calculations in inches, then divide the result by 144 (12 by 12) to determine square footage. For the 2×4 example, use the 3.5 inches, then convert the **linear** **feet** to inches. Multiply width times length, and divide that result by 144 to get the total square footage. This can be a useful method when measuring a room to estimate the lumber required for a floor or wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Linear means extending along a straight line. This is a length measurement used for calculating things like baseboard or door and window casing, counter tops, and wall measurements. For instance, to calculate the **linear** foot measurement to replace baseboards in your room, measure the length of one wall and the width of the other. Then multiply each measurement by two and add all four numbers together. So for a 10′ x 12′ room, you will add 10×2+12×2 = 44 **linear** **feet** and don’t forget to add a 10% overage for cuts/waste – in case you make a mistake with cutting a mitre the wrong way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cost estimation. Carriers want to give you the most accurate quote that they can, and in order to do that they need to know how much space you’re going to take up on the truck. Providing an accurate measurement in **linear** **feet** allows them to make that estimation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – boards are always measured by **linear** foot. The width and depth are also calculated, but the **linear** foot of the board is most dominant and how the boards are sold. When shopping, you ask for them in **linear** footage Molding – molding is a lot like trim. It goes on the seam between the ceiling and the walls. It is measured just like trim and doesn’t have chunks taken out because windows and doors don’t reach the ceiling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Measure the length of one wall first. For a 10×10 room, this will be ten **feet**. This is a **linear** measurement. Then, you take that same wall and measure the height. This is another **linear** foot measurement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cubic **feet** differ from **linear** **feet** in that it’s a three-dimensional measurement. That means that instead of measuring it by simply taking a straight measurement, you have to measure in three different dimensions. Once you’re able to furnish the cubic foot measurement, the carrier is able to assign you a freight class that matches the goods you’re attempting to ship. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the transportation industry, the **linear** foot rule is a standardized way to charge shippers for the goods that they transport. It applies to LTL, or less-than truckload shipments. This is an affordable shipping option that means your freight will be sharing the same truck space with other shipments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **linear** foot rule stipulates that shipments that take up ten **linear** **feet** or more are charged for 1000 lbs per **linear** foot. When you ship something, you need to check with your carrier and make sure that you’re not violating their **linear** foot rule. Doing so can lead to excessive penalties that can greatly increase your BOL (bill of landing). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Convert that number to **feet**, which is around 3×7. Do the same for windows. Let’s say you have two windows that are 3×5 for this example. Let’s use those three numbers to calculate our total in the next step. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **linear** foot is a measurement used in construction to determine how many certain construction materials you need. Calculating it is similar to calculating the surface area of a shape. There’s a reason this measurement is so important. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   **If you wanted to try to calculate how many square **feet** were a Linear foot print.... Take the Linear foot number and multiply it by 3. (Use 3 if you use 36" rolls)** - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To get square foot measurements you use your **linear** measurements and multiply them. So for instance, if you have a room that you’d like to replace the flooring in, you will need a square foot measurement to obtain the correct quantity of flooring. For example, if the room is 10′ long x 12′ wide, you would multiply these with each other and you will get the floor area as 120 sq/ft. Don’t forget to include an approximate 10% overage for waste/cuts to your 120 sq/ft. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – you may think that cabinets need to be measured by the square foot, and in some ways, they do. But they also need to be measured by **linear** foot because they go across the walls not in the center of the room. Trim – trim goes around the edge of walls and doors. So it needs to be calculated by the **linear** foot. Measure the perimeter of a room, door, or window to figure the **linear** foot of the trim that you need. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to calculating the **linear** **feet** of a room’s walls, you need to get that measuring tape out. Learning how to measure **linear** **feet** is quite easy. You simply measure the length of a wall. then, measure the length of the opposite wall in the same room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to freight shipping, many of the most common terms you come across have to do with volume. Volume is the measurement of three-dimensional space and is often connoted by terms such as “cubic **feet**.” This measurement attempts to capture the three-dimensional space that freight will take up. With these measurements on hand, carriers are able to better package all of the goods that they need to ship. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **linear** foot is simply a measurement of 12 inches. Essentially, it is a measurement of a straight line. It is typically used when measuring the length of a room, building, or another object with straight edges. In real estate, it is most commonly used to measure the size of rooms or tabletops for carpeting, furniture, and other decoration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although square **feet** and **linear** **feet** are measurements of different quantities, it makes sense to compare them in certain situations. Perhaps the most common is in building projects in which you have to cover a certain area, such as a floor, wall or fence panel, with lumber of a particular dimension. If the lumber is sold by the **linear** foot, which is often the case, converting the area you have to cover to the number of **linear** **feet** of lumber you need provides the information you need to estimate the cost of the project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So, if you have a measurement of 9 inches, the measurement in **linear** **feet** would be 0.75 **linear** **feet** (9 divided by 12). If you have a measurement of 6 inches, you would have 0.50 **linear** **feet** (6 divided by 12). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   People need to know how to measure **linear** **feet** because they need that information for numerous projects. It is useful to know the **linear** **feet** of a wall for painting projects or **linear** **feet** of a room to purchase carpeting. Linear **feet** can also be used for other projects, such as measuring fabric or calculating the amount of wood needed for a project. Knowing how to measure **linear** **feet** is a valuable skill that can be used for a variety of purposes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most paint covers about 350 sq **feet** a gallon. But you want to make sure you do two coats in most cases. So this room needs two gallons of paint as one gallon will do one coat. You can also buy pints for cheaper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can generally assume that each opposite wall is the same. Finally, you measure the other two walls. Length only, not height. Now, add all four lengths together. This number is the **linear** foot of the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – another thing that is poured is water. Water is almost always measured in cubic **feet** if in large amounts. There isn’t any other good way to calculate how much water is needed or present. Stone – this is solid stone, as we already talked about gravel. Solid stone, marble, and other similar natural minerals are calculated in cubic **feet** because they are solid and surface area wouldn’t be useful knowledge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A square foot is a unit of measurement of area. A piece of material measuring 12 inches by 12 inches is one square foot. To compute the number of square **feet** in a piece of wire mesh you multiple its width in **feet** times its length in **feet**. For example, a piece of wire mesh 4 **feet** wide and 3 **feet** long would be 12 square **feet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the width of the material in inches and the **linear** length in **feet** are both known, convert the width to a fraction of a foot, then multiply width times length to find square footage. For example, the square footage of a board 6 inches wide and 6 **feet** long is represented by the formula W (.5 ft) x L (6 ft) = 3 sq. ft. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With lumber this can be tricky, since the width is not always exact. For example, a typical 2×4 actually measures 1 1/2 inches by 3 1/2 inches, not 2 inches by 4 inches, so to calculate square **feet**, you must convert the 3 1/2-inch width into a percentage of 1 foot (in this case, divide 3.5 by 12 for a result of .29 **feet**). Rounding up is a good practice since there are slight variations in lumber sizes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are various ways to measure a **linear** foot, but before you’re able to measure it you first have to understand what exactly it is. In the simplest terms, a **linear** foot is 12 inches—the length of a ruler. If you live in the United States or Canada, and someone asks you your height, your response is typically conveyed in **linear** **feet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is completely different than square **feet**. For example, the square footage of a 10×10 room is 100. But the **linear** footage of a 10×10 room is forty because each wall is ten **feet** long. Make sure you don’t confuse the two. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Imagine a freight truck. Inside that large, rectangular cargo carrier is a set amount of space. After decades of shipping, freight carriers have figured out how to maximize the utility of that space by determining how many **linear** **feet** of freight (or cargo) can be stowed at once. Packing a freight truck is both art and science, and if you understand how to calculate the **linear** **feet** of the cargo, you’ll achieve maximum efficiency while making sure your shipment is delivered on time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cubic **feet** is actually another word for volume. So if you learned that in school, you can figure cubic **feet**. It is length times width times height. Here are a few things sold by the cubic foot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Linear **feet**, however, is a much simpler measurement. In fact, it might be the simplest – but most important – the measurement that you’re going to have to make as a shipper. The word “**linear**” means straight. When you’re asked to measure the number of **linear** **feet** that your cargo will take up, you’re being asked to measure how long, in terms of square **feet**, the total length of your shipment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – there it is! Of course, boxes and containers are calculated by cubic **feet** because you need to know how much they will hold. This is how moving vans and even shipping containers are calculated. Plaster – plaster and even cement are usually calculated in cubic **feet**. Because sometimes, you need to cover a thin surface, and other times you need to put it on **feet** thick. So it needs to be calculated by the cubic foot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Truckload or TL shipping is a more expensive option, but it’s great for people who want to make sure that their shipments receive special care. Instead of sharing the truck space with other shipments, FTL shipments take up the entirety of the truck. For this reason, measuring **linear** **feet** is a less significant calculation if you choose to ship this way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The lumber industry has a lot of terms that are often very tough to navigate especially if it’s the first time anyone considered buying wood. Most wood products are sold per piece or per square foot. Often a lot of people won’t know how to convert from square **feet** to **linear** **feet** and if they order amounts per the square foot then there will be a very big shortage of material. Luckily we do provide a handy dandy square **feet** to **linear** **feet** calculator that’ll do the hard work and a page that explains what lumber sizing is! But, have you wondered how exactly the calculation happens? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Linear **feet** are a measure of length, not area, so a key piece of information — the width — is needed to calculate square footage. The lumber industry typically sells boards by **linear** **feet** and doesn’t take the width into account, so it must be added to the equation. The key is to ensure consistent units are used throughout the calculation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
