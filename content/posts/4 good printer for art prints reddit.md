## 4 Reference List: Good Printer For Art Prints Reddit | Canon Pixma Pro 100
-   I've been designing posters and art **prints** for a while now and selling them online at places like Etsy.com. Until now I've been ordering the **prints** from an external supplier but I'd love to have the freedom to produce the **prints** at home at custom sizes immediately when an order comes in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Questions Answers Budget: any Region: USA Color or black and white: Both Laser or ink **printer**: ink New or used: new Multi-function: don't care Duplex Printing: not needed Home or business: home business Printing content: https://www.instagram.com/nishio__/ and https://www.artstation.com/artist/nishio Printing frequency: about 50 a month Pages per minute: don't care Device printing from: PC Connection type: wifi, usb - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I also want to have a variety of paper types to print on... so I guess that means I should stick with ink jet? Or can laser **printer**s print on a variety of paper as well? I used to buy drawing tablet paper from Michael's, cut it to size to fit the 9000 mk II and the print on that. I would often use an off-white paper that had a texture to it. I'm guessing with ink jet, the ink can absorb down into the texture and still work, whereas a laser print wouldn't work with textured paper? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Years ago at work I had Canon Pixma Pro 9000 Mark II that was a cover **printer** for a book binder. I would use that to print drawings and photos and was very happy with the quality. It's looking to me like that **printer** isn't made anymore, but something along those lines is probably what I want. Any suggestions? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
