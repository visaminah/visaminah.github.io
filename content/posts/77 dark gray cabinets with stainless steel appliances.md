-   As with any dark-colored **appliances**, lighter-colored smudges and marks will show against the black surface. Since this is inevitable, be ready to wipe up light or white marks with a microfiber cloth or a soft rag, along with warm water and mild soap. Black stainless steel can not be cleaned with popular home cleaners like Windex or natural options like white vinegar, as the ammonia or acidic content of these cleaners can damage the black coating over time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   If your kitchen is in a loft, consider mixing and matching darker tones that will highlight the exposed brick, wood beams, and other interesting textures in the room.

Another option is to paint your upper **cabinets** one color and the bottom another. Just be sure it matches your countertops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
