## 67 Fun Facts Best Budget Wide Angle Lens For Sony A7Iii | Best 3Rd Party Lenses For Sony A7Iii
-   The only possible knock on this **lens** (and pretty much any other wide-angle) is that you’ll have some distortion at the widest 16mm end. It’s hard to call that a true knock though, as it’s to be expected when you’re shooting that wide. Either way, it’s easy to correct in post. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And unlike most zoom **lens**es, the 16-35mm f/2.8 GM has received almost unanimous praise. Even many of the toughest Sony critics have raved about this **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Sony FE 16-35mm f/2.8 GM The ultimate wide-angle zoom **lens** for Sony photographers Specifications Focal length: 16-35mm (24-52.5mm APS-C) Maximum aperture: f/2.8 Aperture blades: 11 Weather seals: Yes Filter thread: 82mm Dimensions: 89 x 122mm Weight: 680g specifications Storage Size 32GB - 64GB Colour Black Condition New, Refurbished Today's Best Deals View at Walmart (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Best Buy (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Stunning optics + Fast and silent AF Reasons to avoid - Expensive - Heavy - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cameras that can swap out **lens**es, like those in Sony's mirrorless system, don't work with just any **lens**. You need to shop for one that's made for your camera. If you opt for the Sony system, you benefit from a decade's worth of **lens** development, which means there are oodles of optics from which to choose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** is impressive mechanically as well as optically. Its stepping motor autofocus system is very fast and virtually silent in operation, and comes complete with the usual electronically coupled focus ring, which enables very precise manual adjustments. Meanwhile, aperture control is based on an 11-blade diaphragm which remains very well-rounded when stopping down, helping to retain attractive bokeh. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I really can’t say enough good things about the 16-35mm GM. There’s a reason why this **lens** rarely leaves my A7III when traveling. It’s absolutely one of the best travel **lens**es on the market, Sony or otherwise. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Indoor shots and low light shots with the 35mm f/2.8 are outstanding. The f/2.8 aperture works wonders in low light. Night photos and video are going to be awesome with this **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As usual in ultra-wide **lens**es, the **lens** hood is an integral part of the barrel and protects the bulbous, protruding front element. As such, there’s no attachment thread for the direct mounting of filters. However, the new E-mount version of the **lens** adds a gel filter slot in its mounting plate, complete with a locking device, and comes with a template for cutting gel filter material to size. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Below, I differentiate different types of **lens**es by the size of their aperture, which is the hole that allows in light as measured by the f-stop. With a wider aperture, more light will come in for a better chance at getting great video indoors in dim lighting. The big trade-off with a wide aperture is you can’t focus on as many objects at different distances because the **lens** has a shallow depth of field. This will keep your subject very clear but the background will become blurry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike most up-market zoom **lens**es for DSLRs, this one has a widest available aperture of f/4 rather than f/2.8, which helps to make its size and weight a better match for the comparatively small A7 series bodies. As with most Zeiss-badged optics, the physical design looks minimalist, without any switches for auto/manual focus modes or on/off for the OSS (Optical SteadyShot) stabilizer. Even so, the metal **lens** barrels feel beautifully engineered and the build is dust/moisture resistant. Sharpness is good and very consistent throughout the zoom and aperture ranges although the corners become a little soft at longer zoom settings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony’s FE 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6 G Master OSS is undeniably a cracking **lens**, but if you want even more telephoto reach, the new 200-600mm delivers it in fine style and is better value. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s also incredibly useful for video. You’ll cover 99% of your travel videos or vlogs with this **lens** and it really can’t be beat for those types of applications. The autofocus is lightning fast and quiet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Designed to appeal to those shooting sports, wildlife and action with fast cameras like the Sony a6600, the 70-350mm f/4.5-6.3G OSS super-telephoto **lens** is an exciting new addition to Sony’s APS-C range. It promises high optical performance, with built-in optical image stabilisation, plus typical G master **lens** sharpness from corner to corner. Offering 5x optical zoom, the **lens** is still relatively lightweight and would be a great addition to any kit bag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **lens**, too, does not feature in-built image stabilization. Instead, the surface of the **lens** has Tamron’s BBAR (Broad-band anti-reflection) coating that reduces ghosting and flaring and preserves crisp image quality. In addition, this Tamron **lens** has an integrated new high-speed precision AF drive system with an RXD (Rapid extra-silent stepping drive) motor unit. The AF motor is fast, precise, and surprisingly silent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony Artisan and YouTube content creator Miguel Quiles has also used the new Sony 24-70mm f/2.8 G Master II and notes how it, combined with your Sony camera, makes an unstoppable combination. “What stands out to me about this **lens** is the overall package and how they play off of one another,” he says. “For a **lens** to be small and fast is fine, but if it’s not sharp and the AF performance doesn’t keep up then it doesn’t matter. In this case, this **lens** really gives you the best blend of ergonomics, IQ, AF performance, bokeh and everything else!” Watch the video below as Quiles goes through more of the improved features for the new **lens**: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Its built-in optical image stabilization substantially reduces the visible camera shake while recording videos or taking photos. Sony’s 24-105mm f/4 also features an auto/manual focus switch, a focus hold button, and an optical steady shot button, and it comes with Sony’s Direct Drive SSM (DDSSM) Auto Focus that is quick, precise, and silent. Therefore, the autofocus works as expected for a professional **lens**, making it suitable for recording films and capturing photos. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s a versatile **lens**, most suitable for travel photography and videos. The 24-105mm range is perfect for capturing landscapes and close-up portraits. You can also use it for wildlife photography, to some extent. However, it is more suitable for event photography, street photography, and portrait photography. This **lens** is available to buy online for just over a thousand dollars. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   4. Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 DG DN Art Cheap at half the price Specifications Focal length: 24-70mm Maximum aperture: f/2.8 Aperture blades: 11 Weather seals: Yes Filter thread: 82mm Dimensions: 88 x 125mm Weight: 950g Today's Best Deals Check Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Exotic optical path and build quality + Half the price of Sony’s G Master **lens** Reasons to avoid - It’s no lightweight at 830g - Distortion/vignetting can be noticeable - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's a robust, complete **lens** system that benefits from Sony's early bet on mirrorless, along with support from numerous third parties. Ultra-wide, macro, telephoto—it's all covered, in one form or another. But figuring out which **lens** is right for you can be tough, especially if you're just getting started with the system. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’m Photutorial’s founder and editor of the camera, graphic design, and photography coverage. I have owned cameras and used cameras for over 20 years, during which I got used DSLRs, mirrorless (now), and even film cameras. I researched Sony **lens**es when I was choosing between buying a Nikon or Sony camera. In my years as a promoter in tech stores, I’ve got to test loads of cameras and **lens**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony sells two types of mirrorless cameras. The a6000 series and ZV-E10 are built around the APS-C size, and its a1, a7, and a9 cameras use the larger full-frame format. Because of this, you need to be a bit careful and ensure that you buy the right **lens** for your camera. Sony consistently names its APS-C **lens**es with an E designation, while full-frame options get FE, but third parties don't always follow suit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This fairly chunky optic nonetheless only weighs in at a pretty modest 371g thanks to a predominantly plastic construction, but balanced really nicely on the Alpha A7R II we tested it with. The design is very clean - so much so that there's no distance or DOF scales, but those niggles aside, it's a cracking portrait **lens**. Focusing is nice and brisk while the nine-blade diaphragm delivers to really beautiful bokeh. Optically, there's little to fault it on either - it's incredibly sharp at the centre of the frame through the aperture range. If you can't justify one of the more exotic Sony portrait **lens**es, this is a great option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Get this **lens** if you truly want the best of the best. Especially if you plan on regularly shooting in low light circumstances. It’s a no-brainer if you think you’ll do a lot of travel shots at night, indoors, or if you plan on doing any astrophotography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With such a lengthy head start, Sony put those five years to good use. It designed and brought to the market a succession of impressive full-frame compatible **lens**es, while also ramping up its range of APS-C format **lens**es for its popular line of A6000 series camera bodies. Whatever type of prime or zoom **lens** you need for your Sony full-frame or APS-C format body, you’ll be able to find an own-brand Sony **lens** to fit the bill. The only catch is that sometimes the bill can be a little steep, so we've taken value into consideration as well in this in-depth guide to the best Sony **lens**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re headed ‘out there’ and need something a little more robust to take wide landscape shots, the Zeiss a fantastic option. It’s one of the oldest wide-angle **lens**es on the Sony e-mount system, but that doesn’t mean it’s been outclassed over time. The **lens** is like a cast iron pan, it’s not new, but it’s the best thing in the kitchen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Any video shooter’s wishlist of requirements for their kit of **lens**es can really be boiled down to three things: they create high-quality footage, they cover the focal range you need, and they don’t weigh you down. It can seem difficult to put together a kit filled with **lens**es that don’t sacrifice at least one of these requirements, but you can have it all in each of these Sony **lens**es built with video creation in mind. Sony isn’t messing around with these compact masterpieces – they’re built well, they perform well and they won’t overwhelm your kit – especially paired with cameras like the Sony ZV-E10 and Sony Alpha 7C. Video shooters and vloggers check out the list of **lens**es below for a closer look at why they each check the boxes for evolved video quality, complete versatility and unmatched mobility. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   5. Sigma 14-24mm f/2.8 DG DN Art Ultra-wide viewing angles with top-notch quality Specifications Focal length: 14-24mm (21-36mm APS-C) Maximum aperture: f/2.8 Aperture blades: 11 Weather seals: Yes Filter thread: N/A Dimensions: 85 x 131mm Weight: 795g specifications Colour Black Condition New, Refurbished Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Walmart (opens in new tab) View at Best Buy (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Great image quality + Robust, weather-sealed construction Reasons to avoid - Less ‘ultra-wide’ than Sony 12-24mm - Not a ‘zero distortion’ **lens** - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is not a cheap **lens** though, so it’s definitely not perfect for anyone on a tight photography budget. But if the price tag doesn’t scare you off, this thing is an absolute beast and one of the best **lens**es on the market, period. You’ll always find it in my camera bag (we’ve got travel camera bag recommendations too). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Tamron 28-75mm F2.8 Di RXD III (Model A036) **lens** is only compatible with Sony Alpha-E mount cameras. This **lens** has always been in great demand due to its convenient focal length range and constant F2.8 aperture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The Sony Zeiss 35mm f/2.8 is the first prime **lens** on this list and it’s rockstar. If you want the image quality of a prime **lens** in a versatile focal length, the 35mm f/2.8 is hard to beat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Helped by the inclusion of one aspherical element and five ED (Extra-low Dispersion) elements, sharpness and contrast are outstanding for a super-telephoto zoom and amazingly consistent throughout the entire zoom range, right up to 600mm. Color fringing and pincushion distortion are also very negligible at all focal lengths. Autofocus is super-fast and, unusually for a super-telephoto zoom, the physical length remains constant at all focal lengths. All in all, this is a fabulous **lens** for both full-frame and APS-C format Sony cameras. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like Sigma’s 24-70mm Art standard zoom for Sony mirrorless cameras, this one has evolved from a very popular **lens** that was designed for Canon and Nikon SLRs. Again, there are considerable differences in the construction of the E-mount version, starting with the optical path. The veritable feast of glass includes three aspherical elements, complete with a large-diameter, ultra-high-precision one at the front. Further back, there’s an FLD (‘Fluorite’ Low Dispersion) element and no less than five SLD (Special Low Dispersion) elements. Also like the standard zoom, the ultra-wide **lens** uses both Super Multi-Layer Coating and Nano Porous Coating, which give a noticeable reduction in ghosting and flare, compared with the older SLR **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With the new Sony 10-20mm f/4 G PZ **lens**, you can expect a clean and clear image from corner to corner at all zoom settings. The **lens** is the smallest and lightest in its class, making it nice and mobile for those long video shoots. While filming you’ll be amazed by how well the autofocus smoothly tracks your subjects in the frame. The electronic power zoom is also a game changer – it gives excellent responsive control and an adjustable zoom speed so you can set it for the specific shot you’re taking. See what creatives are saying about the **lens** in Hands On With The New Sony 10-20mm f/4 G PZ Power Zoom For APS-C Cameras. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Budget pick Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8 The best Sony a7S III **lens** for beginners Tamron has improved their standard zoom **lens** for mirrorless cameras with their new 28-75mm f2.8 Di III G2. This **lens** offers optically superior performance compared to other manufacturers, especially at the short end. $899 at Amazon $899 at Adorama - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sigma has certainly thrown the full weight of its technological expertise into the **lens**. It has a complex optical path of 19 elements. Of these, there are three aspherical elements, six top-performance FLD (‘Fluorite’ Low Dispersion) elements and two SLD (Special Low Dispersion) elements. In addition to Sigma’s usual Super Multi-Layer Coating, there’s a brand new Nano Porous Coating, to further reduce ghosting and flare. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It features a double linear motor system for precise, quiet operations that is ideal for film-making. The **lens** has a circular 9-blade aperture that creates a beautiful defocus effect. Like other **lens**es from Sony, it has a customizable focus hold button and an AF/MF switch. However, this **lens** does not offer built-in optical image stabilization. Most recent cameras from Sony now come with an image stabilization feature embedded in the body itself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s without a doubt one of the best zoom **lens**es on the market for overall image quality. Where other zooms drop off, the GM shines. And the best part: the 16-35mm GM’s sharpness is evident throughout the entire zoom range. It doesn’t matter if you’re shooting at 16mm or 35mm, you’re going to get crystal clear images. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sigma’s Art **lens**es have an uncompromising design ethic that goes all out for enabling artistic flair and creativity, no matter if they end up being quite large and weighty. The 24-70mm f/2.8 standard zoom for Canon and Nikon SLRs is typical of the breed but the new ‘DN’ version for Sony mirrorless cameras is more of a complete redesign than a simple tweak with a different mounting plate. It’s also about 200g lighter, making it more manageable on a svelte Sony mirrorless body, but is still pretty weighty at 830g. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just as with conventional SLRs, independent manufacturers have kept an eye on Sony’s progress and started designing prime and zoom **lens**es that compete with own-brand optics. Some of the latest from the likes of Sigma and Tamron deliver similar or even better performance than Sony’s own **lens**es, while undercutting them for price. Let’s take a closer look at the best buys to suit a range different requirements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   12. Sony FE 90mm f/2.8 Macro G OSS Big-up the little things in life with this macro **lens** Specifications Full-frame compatible: Yes Focal length: 90mm (135mm APS-C) Maximum aperture: f/2.8 Aperture blades: 9 Weather seals: Yes Filter thread: 62mm Dimensions: 79 x 131mm Weight: 602g specifications Storage Size 64GB Colour Black Condition New, Refurbished Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Best Buy (opens in new tab) View at Walmart (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Super-sharp for extreme close-ups + Useful as a fast, short telephoto **lens** Reasons to avoid - Expensive for a macro **lens** - Distance scale inactive for autofocus - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our pick Sony 24–105mm f/4 G OSS The best Sony a7S III **lens** The Sony 24–105mm f/4 G OSS is a great versatile **lens** for photographers using Sony’s full-frame a-series cameras. With a focal length range of 24-105mm, OSS (Optical SteadyShot), and modest size, weight, and price, this **lens** is a great option for photographers who want a versatile **lens** for their camera. $1,398 at Amazon $1,398 at Adorama - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On an A7III platform, you’d have to be comparing this **lens** to the Sony 24-70mm f/2.8 GM. That is definitely another incredible **lens** (and it’s also on this list), but I can’t quite justify it for travel over the 24-105mm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony 24mm f/2.8 G compact prime **lens** is so small and lightweight it gives creatives the chance to work in a nimble, quick and quiet way while producing incredible footage. The 24mm focal length is a favorite among many video shooters because you can include more of the environment in your shots, allowing you to tell a broader story in scenes while keeping all of that sweet sharpness. The sheer size and weight of the **lens** makes it a versatile option and when paired with a small camera like the Sony ZV-E10 or Sony Alpha 7C, you have a travel-friendly content creation machine ready to crank out impressively clear video results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If I had to pick only one **lens** to travel with my A7III, the Sony 16-35mm f/2.8 G Master would be it. Hands down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That f/2.8 also brings some seriously good bokeh to the table. It’s some of the best you’ll see from a zoom **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony Artisan Bob Krist has used all three of the above new **lens**es and says,“These three **lens**es have breathed new life into the APS-C format. They are precisely what serious APS-C shooters have needed. And the usefulness of these **lens**es to video shooters with full frame cameras cannot be underestimated because the APS-C crop on full frame video looks so great. This will make the zoom, especially useful for outdoor work where you usually have plenty of light and don’t need the super low light capabilities of Sony full-frame.” Learn more about the **lens**es in the video below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Putting a midrange **lens** like the Sony FE 55mm F1.8 ZA onto the A7III is a fantastic street photography experience as it’s a lightweight package that acts as a good ‘generalist’ setup. If you’re looking to take some landscape shots during your travel, then you might want to look into a **lens** like the Sony Zeiss 16-35 for a better wide-angle experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re taking a trip to London, Rome, or anywhere where midrange **lens**es shine, the FE 55mm F1.8 ZA **lens** is going to be one of your best bets. It’s a great midrange **lens** that’s lightweight and adaptive to pretty much anything you need during a day of city travel. An overall great choice for ensuring the best pictures of your big city vacation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This new **lens** from Tamron is an excellent upgrade from the original A036 and is very similar in price. Everything from the build quality to the autofocus to the optics has been improved, making the A063 an excellent choice for professionals. Although it doesn’t have all the features of the G Master **lens**, it’s still a great **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony FE 600mm F4 GM OSS The Sony FE 600mm F4 GM OSS is a big, serious **lens** for capturing distant action, but its price makes it purely for professionals and very serious enthusiasts. MSRP $12,999.99 MSRP $12,999.99 Sony FE 600mm F4 GM OSS Review - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Handling is excellent, with well thought-out controls that have effectively the same layout to those of the smaller 100-400mm **lens**. Three customisable focus-hold buttons are fitted around the **lens** barrel and there’s an autofocus range limiter. It’s enhanced in the 200-600mm **lens**, however, enabling you to lock out either short or long focus range and the optical stabilizer gains a third switchable mode. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Weight may also influence your decision if you prefer to use a smaller gimbal setup for video. You can get away with a heavier **lens** than the Vario-Tessar 16-35mm f/4 on something as small as a Zhiyun Crane, but you’ll be pushing the limits. The Vario-Tessar is still in a good weight class for most small-to-mid-size gimbals. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 70-200mm F2.8 GM II OSS is a high-performance telephoto zoom **lens**. The constant F2.8 aperture throughout the focal length range is an outstanding feat. Its large aperture and maximum focal length enable you to shoot distant objects even in low light conditions while simultaneously creating decent bokeh. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The older version of the same **lens** is a good alternative—Sony FE 70-200mm f/2.8 GM OSS. It’s around $500 cheaper than the v2, but it has a longer minimum focus distance and suffers from more corner softness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Those extra aperture blades also allow you to get some killer sunstars in your shots when you stop down. It’s a unique sunstar look, as the stars will have 22 points on them. Some love the look, while some still prefer the sunstars produced be **lens**es with fewer blades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Zeiss Loxia 2/50 4.5 The Zeiss Loxia 2/50 is one of the best modern manual focus **lens**es out there, and is worthy of being called Editors' Choice. $699.00 at Amazon See It (Opens in a new window) Zeiss Loxia 2/50 Review - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The other nice thing about the Sony A7III when it comes to shooting in the city is that the camera surprisingly small for a full frame camera. When you’re already pulling around photography equipment or backup **lens**es the size difference is negligible, but if you’re planning to use the Sony A7III as a ‘grab and go’ camera for street photography, it’s size is a saving grace. Even a couple of years after it’s release the small size means the Sony A7III is great in 2022. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The focal length of 28–75 mm is handy for everyday photography, but it’s ideal for portrait, street, and event photography. This **lens** is a good option for photojournalists and other media personnel. But you could use it to capture landscapes and cityscapes, too. It is available for purchase for under a thousand dollars. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Along with the incredible image quality, the other defining feature of this **lens** is its f/2.8 aperture. It’s awesome for low light shooting and getting mouth-watering bokeh in your portraits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony 24-105mm f/4 G OSS is another premium yet more practical **lens** than the Sony 16-35mm. The **lens** creates sharp images at any focal length with a constant f/4 aperture throughout the zoom range. It’s made of high-quality and durable plastic, while the weather seal is metallic and ensures the **lens** clicks tightly onto the camera. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The picture quality is impressive. The images are sharp not just in the center but throughout the frame. It is one of the finest and fastest **lens**es available for Sony’s full-frame cameras for under two thousand dollars. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Why the new Sony 24-70mm f/2.8 G Master II for video and vlogging? Not only was the newest iteration of the beloved G Master designed for all types of video applications, it’s as mobile as it comes in this class of zooms. When you use this **lens** you will find it to be smaller, lighter and faster, so it won’t bog you down on a long day of shooting. It’s also packed with a number of features for advanced video creation like its Linear Response Manual Focus and extremely quiet AF operation. All-in-all, it’s one of the most versatile **lens**es in the lineup and one any content creator will find useful for video. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A mount cameras have options for both full frame and APS-C sensors. Among the various sensor sizes, full-frame is considered to be a large format while APS-C is a medium format. While both A-mount and E-mount have **lens**es for portrait, landscape, and video use, only A-mount cameras using Sony Translucent Mirror Technology can take advantage of full-time phase-detection autofocus. These **lens**es have different diameters, so they are not interchangeable. However, with the proper mount adapter, it is possible to use an A-mount **lens** on an E-mount camera, but it may have limitations on its functions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is also a bonus for keeping your camera setup discreet. Whether or not we like it, huge **lens**es tend to attract more attention when you’re out and about. People can clam up a bit or even become a bit disgruntled if they think someone is potentially snapping super-hi-res close-ups of their face. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should also consider the **lens** family. Sony gives its better optics a G designation and reserves the GM (G Master) moniker for its highest-quality **lens**es.
