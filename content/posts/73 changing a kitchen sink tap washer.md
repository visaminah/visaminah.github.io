## 73 Tips to Changing A Kitchen Sink Tap Washer | How To Change A Washer On A Lever Tap
-   Visually check that the new **washer** is the same size as the old one and fit it into place. If you’re replacing the valve, repeat the process. You’ll need to tighten it as much as possible, keeping cloths over the shiny surfaces of the **tap** as you turn the nuts using your wrench. 8. Put the Tap Back Together Again - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use your screwdriver to loosen and then remove the **tap** cover from the rest of the assembly. This exposes the valve, which you then need to remove with a spanner. If the valve is stiff you can hold it in place with a wrench, taking care to use a cloth to protect the **tap** first. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   TIPS: Not sure the size of **tap** **washer**? The easiest way is bring your old **tap** **washer** to hardware store and ask for the exact same size **washer**. OTHER WAY, you can buy a pack (a collection) of rubber **tap** **washer**s. Surely it will have your **washer** size in the pack. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, remove the cap from the **tap** handle. Caps are typically red or blue. You can use a screwdriver to pry it off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally, mixer **tap** **washer**s should be flexible and waterproof. They are mainly made of polythene, nylon, rubber, or fibre. The materials used are bound to deteriorate with time, thus necessitating replacement. Before going into how to replace leaking mixer **tap** **washer**s, let's look at the different types. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tap **washer**s work by creating an impenetrable physical barrier between the spout and **tap** seat. Most of them are also designed in a way that they fill any irregular-shaped voids in **tap** settings. This makes them seal off the spout from the **tap** valve. They are made from easy-to-compress and squeeze materials to create a watertight seal. This makes it possible for the **tap** **washer** to seal off the valve opening effectively. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cartridge Taps look very similar to compression **tap**s and have one or two handles with a single water spout. Instead of a **washer** sealing the **tap** and stopping the water flow, a hollow cartridge is used. The cartridge itself contains all parts that are vulnerable to wear and tear, so they are what need to be replaced if you see a drip or leak. However, you won’t need to do this as often as you’ll need to put new **washer**s in compression **tap**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before beginning the **tap** **washer** replacement process, make sure that the water is not under pressure in the piping system. To do this, cut off the main valve of hot and cold water. In the next step, wash off all the liquid in the **tap**. The easiest way to do that is leaving the **tap** open until all the water flows out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Replace with a new **tap** **washer**, put the basin **tap** back together. Try not to screw the valve overtighten as you could damage the sink **tap**. Put the **tap** cover back the way it is. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A dual **tap** mixer features two handles on either side of the spout. One handle is for cold water while the other is for hot water. When removing the **tap** headgear, you may also decide to replace or check the **washer** in the two handles. This ensures you do not have to waste time later on replacing the **washer**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Exposure to air, water and repeated compressions will make the rubber start to crack, split or crumble. Not only does this cause dripping and leaking, but when water is run through the **tap** it may contain bits of rubber. They’re not toxic, but it’s not pleasant! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tap **washer**s could be worn by time, and they become less effective as well. In most cases, changing these old **tap** **washer**s are doing just fine. And you can do yourself too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do you have a leaking **tap**? If left unfixed, it could result in high water bills or property damage. A majority of leaking **tap** issues can be fixed simply by replacing the **washer**s. Not changed a **washer** before or need a refesher? In our step by step guide we will go through the process of changing a **washer** in just 5 easy steps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It could be a good idea to invest in **tap**s with ceramic disc cartridges. This type of **tap**s is known to be durable and resilient. So you will have peace of mind for a lot longer than using a compression **washer** **tap**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Look under the **tap** for an isolation valve to turn off the specific water supply, and if you can’t see one, switch off the water mains. Either way, open the **tap** to drain any water left in the pipes. If you’re working on a hot water **tap**, you’ll need to shut off the immersion heater and boiler too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’ve got a leaky or dripping **tap** on your hands, then the chances are you’ll need to replace the **washer**. That’s not difficult, but you do need to know what you’re doing. So, what does changing a **tap** **washer** entail? We’re so glad you asked! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Damage to the elements installed on the **tap** cartridge is probably the most common reason behind **tap** malfunctions. To fix it, you need to replace the **tap** **washer**. It’s not a complicated process. What’s more, you can do it without any help from an expert. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But even after turning off the mains, there may still be water in the pipes that can cause a big mess once you start to change a **tap** **washer**. So open up that pesky **tap** and let the remaining water run out. If the water keeps flowing, go back to the mains because it’s not all the way off! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also referred to as packing or sealing **washer**s, **tap** **washer**s are disc-shaped devices with a central opening or hole. They help seal off mains water flow behind a **tap** when you turn it off. The **washer**s are found in tool boxes or plumbing kits and provide a quick solution when your **tap** is leaking, dripping, or becomes difficult to open or close. As far as types go, there are hot water **tap** **washer**s, basin mixer **tap** **washer**s, kitchen **tap** **washer**s, mix **tap** **washer**s, outside **tap** **washer**s, and pillar **tap** **washer**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Regardless whether it’s a kitchen sink or a bathtub, **tap** **washer** replacement always involves the same action. You need to use a small element: a sealing ring. Before its installation, determine the thickness and size. Those parameters decide whether the new element fit and as a result, if the **tap** works correctly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I hope this simple guide gave you the confidence to change **tap** **washer**s yourself. Good luck and please share if you find this article might help someone. Thank you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nylon mixer **tap** **washer**s are the most popular option because of their high reliability. These **washer**s are resistant to wear, are strong, and feature low surface friction because of their internal lubrication. Internal lubrication also plays a massive role in making the **washer**s last longer. These **washer**s are lightweight and more cost-effective than most of the other types. In addition, they are not reactive to other substances and can withstand hot water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But back to **tap** **washer**s. As you can tell from our quick diversion into the different types of **washer**less **tap**s above, compression **tap**s are the least complicated **tap** variation. Having said that, they’re also the ones that require the most home maintenance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tap **washer**s need to be waterproof as well as flexible, and are usually made of nylon, rubber, polythene or fibre. The material means that they’re inevitably going to deteriorate over time and need replacing. Happily, this is a very easy task for even the most novice DIYer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Washers function by creating a physical barrier between the **tap**’s seat and spout. They also seal off the **tap**’s spout from the valve by evening out irregular voids between the seat and the valve. When a **tap** head is turned, a rotating screw forces the **washer** in the **tap**’s assembly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tap **washer** replacement is typically a quick and easy action. It does not require any specialist tools. You can fix a dripping **tap** yourself, without hiring a professional. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Locate your water meter – for some apartment owners, it could be in the carpark. The water meter **tap**, which might look like a lever or a standard **tap** handle, will turn off the water main.﻿ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In addition, nylon **washer**s are lightweight and because they are very cheap to manufacture, they’re sold at low prices too. If a **tap** is used on a daily basis and the **washer** will be compressed many times over a short period, nylon can be your best bet. These **tap** **washer**s are also reasonably chemically inert and so won’t react too much to other substances which can be especially helpful if they’re exposed to corrosive environments. And, because they don’t deform over a range of temperatures, they can withstand very hot water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Visually check that the new **washer** is the same size as the old one and fit it into place. If you’re replacing the valve, repeat the process. You’ll need to tighten it as much as possible, keeping cloths over the shiny surfaces of the **tap** as you turn the nuts using your wrench. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **washer**s are made of fire-hardened ceramics. Ceramic **tap** **washer**s feature two discs, one that remains stationary and the other that moves up and down and side to side. They are easy to control and move. Besides, they are the most durable and hardest **tap** **washer**s. Ceramic, a fire-hardened material is erosion-resistant and tough, leading to less friction when operating it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mixer **tap**s are standard in most new and renovated homes in Australia. Mixer **tap**s have a single faucet and a **tap** handle. Both hot and cold water is controlled using a single handle and comes out of the same spout. There are different types of mixer **tap**s, including wall-mounted, single lever, Monobloc, and pull-out. You can find mixer **tap**s in various parts of your house, namely the kitchen, basin, bathtub, and shower. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A standard type of water **tap** consists of two main parts, the **tap** **washer**, and the seat. When you try to turn on the water, the **washer** plays its role in directing water to the sink. It also helps build up pressure while the water flowing through between the **washer** and the seat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A properly working **tap** lets you use the kitchen and bathroom easily. Without it, everyday activities requiring water would become practically impossible. What to do when the spout is leaking, making you unable to use water? A **tap** malfunction does not necessarily mean the whole fitting has to be replaced. Thanks to spare parts, you can fix the problem quickly and easily, prolonging the device’s life for a long time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, because nylon is quite stiff, some professionals prefer to use it with softer metals like brass than on very hard metals. If the **washer**, the **tap** seat and the spout are all rigid, they can combine to create excess resistance. The **washer** will distort and turning the **tap** will be difficult. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Besides nylon, rubber and fibre, **tap** **washer**s can also be made of fire-hardened ceramics. They’re the most recent developments in what you might call **tap** technology, and the assembly consists of two discs. One remains stationary, while the other moves up and down and from side to side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also referred to as vulcanised fibre **tap** **washer**s, they are hard because they are treated using sulphur at high temperatures. When wet, they expand, making them stand out from other types of **washer**s. This expansion makes them the most effective sealant. Fibre **tap** **washer**s are also easier to compress than their rubber and nylon counterparts, making them less prone to damage when overtightened. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It can be easily done without using any additional tools. Then, remove the stem from the sleeve - to do this, you can use a fork spanner or a monkey wrench. Thanks to this, you have a full access to the cartridge, so that you can examine the **tap** **washer**. If the element is worn off or damaged, replace it: remove the screw, take out the old ring and replace it with a new one. Which type is the best one? You can choose a silicone **washer** - white or black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The valve might look worn or rough. Then changing **tap** **washer**s and valve together is recommended. If you are not sure, call a professional! But it’s not too complicated to do it yourself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turn off your water supply to this **tap**, that makes the job easier to do and prevent to flood your working area. A valve should be underneath the tab or in the cupboard below the sink. If there isn’t one, turn off the water supply at the main valve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Look under the **tap** for an isolation valve to turn off the specific water supply, and if you can’t see one, switch off the water mains. Either way, open the **tap** to drain any water left in the pipes. If you’re working on a hot water **tap**, you’ll need to shut off the immersion heater and boiler too. 5. Remove the Cover from the Tap - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the valve is worn, the new **washer** won’t seal effectively. If this is the case, you need to remove and replace the valve too. Unscrew it with the aid of a spanner if necessary and use it as a visual aid to make sure you buy a new one of the same size, either online or at a land-based location. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remove the **washer** from the base of the fitting, put a new one and carefully assemble back the whole element. Remember that the new seal has to be exactly as large and thick as the old one. Otherwise, the **tap** won’t work properly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Interestingly, no, not all **tap**s contain **washer**s. As with almost everything else in building - and the rest of the world - there are different kinds of **tap**s, and most of them are **washer**less. The types that contain **washer**s are called compression **tap**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After you have removed the old **washer** and the damaged O rings, it's time to replace the **washer**. Ensure that the new O rings are in position and the headgear well secured.

-   Mixer **tap**s have three distinct areas when doing replacement or repairs. Individual water control for cold or hot on either side is replaced by separate **tap**s. When repairing a mixer **tap**, the spout is usually the weak link; sometimes, you may find it leaking at the base. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you begin make sure you turn off the water supply. You can turn it off at the issolation valve which is found on the pipes under the sink or at the main stop **tap**. Once done run the **tap** until there is no water left. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The essential first step is to cut off the water supply. On all properties, this can be achieved by turning off the water main **tap**. With newer properties, there may also be an isolation switch under the sink or basin. This switch is a more accessible way to turn off the water to the affected **tap**, but many play it safe and turn off both their switch and their mains **tap**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When replacing **tap** **washer**s, you need to choose the ones that will work perfectly for your mixer type. They need to be identical and the same size as the one you intend to remove.
