Because it is so bold and vibrant, it also pairs well with other neutral color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ’When introducing colour accents to lighter greys, think about the undertones of the pairing first and then the contrast you wish to achieve. Ammonite a soft stony grey will team beautifully with **blue**s and greens such as Inchyra Blue or Hague Blue as both have the gentle undertones of nature, such as the delicate brown note found in Ammonite and the green in Inchyra Blue.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a great option if you want to keep your outfit casual and unique. The dark green shirt is a very bold, bright color but it doesn’t stand out too much. So it combines the best of both worlds when it comes to outfit **colors**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The same techniques mentioned above can be used when wearing sports coat and trouser combinations, though some men may be put off by the perceived difficulties of coordinating an additional article of clothing: pants in a different shade. If you begin with **blue** and gray, this is actually a piece of cake. Like the navy suit, the navy blazer is a staple, foundational item of menswear. Technically, a solid blazer has to be **blue**, so begin there and add gray pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Colors that go with navy **blue** are not hard to find. The primary reason is that this shade of **blue**, surprisingly, belongs to the neutral category.

-   So for somewhat of a similar reason as the light **blue** shirt, this color is appropriate for wearing to school or work because it’s also pretty understated.

-   If gray is the color of your walls, adding navy **blue** upholstery is the best way to spruce up the room.

-   When two deep shades combine in one space, the result is a moody color scheme with a luxe finish that eliminates the need for much else on the decor front.

While the **blue** walls establish a rich backdrop, the burnt orange sofa adds to the intensity. An aqua accent chair shaped like a hand, a checkered area rug, an assortment of mirrors, and a handful of potted plants complement the color combination while adding a little something extra to complete the eclectic scene. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just like yellow, orange is also the opposite of **blue** in the color wheel. It’s perfect for any shade of **blue**, including Navy Blue. And as Navy Blue is neutral, the appearance of something orange would give the whole outfit the zest it needs! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Those with dandy impulses and in a less conservative environment could go with brighter **blue**s, such as a **blue** wholecut Oxford or monk strap, paired with a light gray suit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Beyond avoiding sharp contrast, try adding complexity and interest to your **blue** and gray combinations by introducing textures and patterns. Sure, you can start simply with a white shirt, solid tie, and a plain worsted wool suit, but this gets boring fast. An easy way to add a pattern while remaining classic is to use a gray glen check tie in silk (or wool for winter) with a navy suit. For a gray suit, get a navy grenadine tie in either a large or fine weave (garza grossa or garza fina) to inject texture. In the reverse scenario, pick up a silver grenadine for a **blue** suit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The easiest way to coordinate **blue** and gray is to match the two in a suit and tie combination. It’s commonly said that when a man first ventures into the world of tailored clothing–or into the working world that demands such a dress code–he should begin with a navy **blue** suit. Using a gray tie with this navy suit is a surefire way to earn style points. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking forward to using navy **blue** in the living room of your home, then don’t forget to add wallpaper patterns and colorful fabrics. Another way to complement the navy **blue** hues is to use raspberry reds and emerald greens. This will add freshness to your space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A navy-**blue** colour sofa looks graceful and timeless when combined with white surroundings. If the **blue** and white combo isn't your cup of tea, there are other options available. You can try navy-**blue** with emerald green too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cool, calming, and oh-so-complementary, the color **blue** is truly unique. It's not too vibrant, yet it always manages to stand out regardless of the shade. From dining rooms to bedrooms to offices to kitchens, when it comes to decorating with the popular hue, no area of the house is off-limits — its versatility is just one of the many aspects that earmark it as a timeless classic. And while there are more shades of **blue** than we could ever count, there's something captivating about a bold navy and the way it commands attention with effortless ease. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even though the two shades can spruce up the interiors of your home, you must make sure to use them correctly. That’s because they can make or break the look of your home. Of course, you cannot paint all the walls of the kitchen and living room navy **blue** or white and expect them to make your space beautiful and welcoming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light wooden shades, be it on the floor or furnishings, look warm and have a unique appeal. For instance, in this spacious and bright bedroom, a light-hued wood-finish floor with its chevron pattern makes for a stylish statement. And as it is paired with a rich navy-**blue** wall cladding, the room looks interesting and full of personality. Don’t miss how the drapes complement the floor and the pendant lamps jazz up the wall cladding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is something magical about the navy-**blue** colour. Its dramatic presence and classic look make it a favourite among interior designers. Its dark tones grab attention quickly and help radiant colours to pop. Which is why it is often used in modern interiors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choose a color that contrasts with the navy **blue** shade of your pants. For example, if you’re wearing dark or black dress pants then a light or white colored shirt is ideal for creating an effective contrast. Make sure your shirt isn’t too flashy- otherwise it will dominate and take all the attention away from your outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is a great complement to navy **blue**, but it’s crucial to balance the two. Therefore, choosing lighter shades of brown when pairing it with navy **blue** is your best bet. Use lighter brown shades like caramel or tan instead of deeper ones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When paired with bright and natural accent pieces, navy **blue** accent pieces can grab the attention of your visitors. Hence, you can use complementary **colors** such as orange to brighten up the interiors of your space. Also, terra-cotta, coral, and lime green **colors** are excellent choices for pairing with navy **blue**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3.Many materials appeal I dark **blue** very special and valuable. Dark **blue** silk shines in a beautiful vibrancy and is therefore a good choice of evening attire. But also **blue** silk shines and appeals brighter than black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is the simplest option, and it’s a bonafide classic. Choose a **blue** that’s darker than the shirt. Navy is the most obvious choice. Experiment with texture here to add a little interest. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That’s all for today, folks. Navy **blue** and white are classic **colors** that add elegance, class, and sophistication to your space. Also, these two **colors** are highly versatile and can be paired up with almost every color on the color wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This room has quite a lot of sources of navy **blue** tone. Those include the wall, stepping stool, rug, and ottoman. Even the beautiful aircraft-themed wall prints also have some touches of the **blue** shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wondering whether neutral **colors** will be the perfect choice for bedrooms? Of course, they are one of the best choices to make your space stylish yet sophisticated. That said, pair chocolate brown with white and let the hues do their job. Unique and classic, white will add an understated charm to your space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And that’s why we are here to help you out. In the next section, we’ll walk through the hues that are apparently made for **blue** and white-based color schemes. So, let’s take a look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Socks are also a terrific option to coordinate **blue** and gray. As a rule, begin with the principle of matching socks to your pants, not your shoes. You can show some panache by wearing socks that contain the complementary color to your pants (for example, **blue** socks with gray trousers ) or, better yet, socks that contain both **colors**, like a light **blue** and light gray shadow stripe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The.combination between navy and soft **blue** is excellent for the bedroom area. There are two primary reasons why we can say something like this. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'Grey can be surprisingly versatile and will happily layer with many colours such as inky **blue**s, smoky greens and rose pinks,' explains Patrick O’Donnell on behalf of Farrow & Ball. Giving Sulking Room Pink, Inchyra Blue and Green Smoke as examples. 'However, if you want to keep the palette more monochromatic, layer tones of grey like Ammonite with Mole’s Breath.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Navy **blue** is one of those **colors** that works nicely in just about any setting, whether it be a home office, library, bedroom, or bathroom. It is your best option to avoid using the common neutral **colors** in your room. However, to improve the overall appearance of your room, you must combine this rich color with other **colors** because it cannot be used on its own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to **colors** that go with navy **blue**, white is as high-contrast and classic as it gets. While the pairing may typically be seen in the form of white walls and navy **blue** cabinetry, we're all for switching things up like Chango & Co. did in this powder room with a white vanity cabinet and wallpaper showcasing a navy and sky **blue** pattern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Though the Gentleman’s Gazette focuses on classic style, we’d be remiss not to mention the most popular article of casual clothing and probably the most popular **blue** fabric worn throughout the world–denim. We don’t specifically think of wearing gray with denim, but maybe we should take this page out of the classic menswear book and apply it to casual wear too. Blue jeans can easily be paired with a gray sports coat, provided the jeans are not overly distressed and the jacket casual enough, like something in an unstructured cotton or with sufficient texture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   White, when combined with navy-**blue**, renders a classic and clean look to any room. This colour combination is a sister of the black and white colour combination. The white colour gleams against its dark counterpart, which gives a room character. As you can see in the bathroom above, shades of white on the walls and sanitary wares have been paired with a navy-**blue** vanity counter for an interesting look. You can use the white and navy-**blue** colour combination on cabinets, closets and sofas too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Each color also has a color hex code. A hex code is a hexadecimal way to represent a color in RGB format by combining three red, green, and **blue** values in a particular shade of color. For example, navy **blue**’s hex code is #000080, and its RGB values are R:0, G:0, B:128. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adopting a navy **blue** color palette means balancing it out with a steady flow of earthy neutrals. Take for example this tiny workstation from Raili CA Design, where light wood finishes, warm leather, and verdant greenery bring out the essence of the backdrop. The shiplap wall paneling and woven desk chair add visual texture with a subtle hint of contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to home decor, you can't go wrong with gold and navy. The two make a perfect pair and there are a whole host of ways to rock the look in your own home. For example, we love the minimalist scene spotted in this Prague apartment, complete with a dark **blue** velvet sofa surrounded by accents flaunting a gold finish. And if you really want to kick things up a notch, throw in herringbone wood flooring, too. Swoon! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are also more casual ways to Navy Blue and White. You should opt for clothes with softer textures and put them together. By doing this, it’ll give you a new perspective on the different ways you can wear neutral **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A few ideas on using these two cool tones are to use them as accents, where you can add a navy **blue** or black throw pillow to a white couch. This will add some interest and contrast to your room. Alternatively, you can paint your walls black and then use navy **blue** as an accent color to create a dramatic look in your house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The brilliance and warmth of yellow shades contrast sharply with the rich tones of navy **blue**. You can pair yellow with navy **blue** to enliven the interiors of your space. That said, choose patterned or textured fabrics of yellow and navy **blue** color scheme. It will be the perfect way to add an energizing effect to your space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Among the many **colors** that go with navy **blue**, purple may not always be top of mind, but we urge you to reconsider. Establishing a balance between the two shades is key when integrating them into any space. Follow the lead of this drama-filled bedroom by Allison Crawford Design and put the powerful duo to work with the help of dark navy curtains and an eggplant wall color. Use warmer elements, such as light wood flooring and neutral bedding, to temper the intensity of the color combo. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fotor’s color palette generator﻿ is an on-line color matching tool supported by AI technology. You can get navy **blue** color at once using the Fotor's palette generator. At the same time, it will bring up the applicable **colors** for you to examine and choose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Navy **blue** is an elegant and sophisticated color, making it a perfect alternative to neutral **colors**. Also, since navy **blue** is rich, it must be balanced with other **colors** in any space. Read on to learn in-depth which **colors** go with navy **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Printed silk ties with **blue** and gray geometric patterns or knit ties with both **colors** in them are likewise excellent options. I especially like the versatility of striped ties with either a repp pattern or large block stripes for this purpose. If you get a tie with stripes of both **colors** you can wear them easily with either gray or **blue** suits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want your grey to remain cool and tranquil, watery shades of **blue** are the ideal colour to introduce. The grey retains an air of sophistication to stop the **blue**s becoming too coastal when layered together. Painted furniture, statement artwork and soft furnishings are a great way to add this deep **blue** without it overpowering. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And speaking of powder rooms, this tropical design by Zoe Feldman is another picture-perfect example of how to use navy **blue** in a small space. Here, a graphic palm wallpaper print in a soothing shade of light **blue** and forest green fits right in with the bold **blue** baseboards, window trim, and wall sconce. The greenery on the print allows the base color to pop while the lustrous brass fixtures tie it all together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most sophisticated method to combine gray and **blue** with a suit and tie, however, is to choose items that contain both **colors** together. For example, you can wear a navy suit with a gray windowpane pattern. By definition, Prince of Wales suiting fabric differs from a glen check because it contains an overcheck in an additional color, and a common version of this is a gray base pattern with the addition of a **blue** overcheck, giving you both in one shot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When navy-**blue** colour meets beige, a lot can happen. You can paint your walls with a soft beige colour and add a comfy navy-**blue** sofa to lend contrast and visual interest. Don’t forget to decorate the sofa with patterned or bright yellow or orange throw pillows. Adding a golden colour lamp next to the sofa will be a classic move. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Every hue has a color meaning that describes the feelings and emotions commonly associated with it. Understanding color psychology helps guide the use of color in your art projects. For example, use navy **blue** to project a feeling of solemn dignity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The opposite move–a gray sports coat with navy trousers–is rarer, maybe because it is generally more difficult to pull off a lighter jacket with darker pants. However, there’s no reason to be dissuaded, as long as your **blue** pants don’t look like the bottom half of a suit. Here, a pattern can be your friend and using a gray sports coat that contains a pattern, again the classic glen check or Prince of Wales, will enhance your chances of success. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The second suit a man should own when starting a business wardrobe is a gray one, but here the recommendations vary between a mid-gray and a charcoal. In either case, you simply take the opposite approach as your first suit and coordinate with a **blue** tie. The entire range of gray presents a neutral backdrop for any mid – to navy **blue** tie to work. And, the fact that both **blue** and gray are cool **colors** ensures they will pair naturally. Even if your gray suit contains warmer brown tones, you’ll have no issues because **blue** also combines perfectly with brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Today, I’m trying to exemplify many of the concepts we discussed. Most of my outfit elements have **blue** and gray in them; the largest of these would be my **blue** jacket and gray trousers. The jacket is a bit lighter than a standard navy, probably in something more like a medium to even a royal **blue**. It’s plain in color to ground the trousers which have a bit more texture in their weave. As mentioned previously, my shirt features a micro check pattern in light **blue** and dark gray, perhaps even almost black, but everything is working harmoniously within the color pairing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although pairing a gray tie with a **blue** suit and vice versa is nearly foolproof, there are some ways for you to make the most of this combination. For one thing, avoid too strong a contrast between the two **colors**, which is the general rule for any color coordination. So, if your suit is dark gray, avoid a really pale **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
