## 72 Unexpected Facts About Best Dual Temp Glue Gun | best dual temperature glue gun
-   4. Squeeze trigger to dispense **glue**. More **glue** is dispensed by squeezing trigger repeatedly. Continue **glue** flow by adding additional **glue** sticks. Note: Requires approximately 2 **glue** sticks for initial start up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The price point is also a con for me. The Cricut **glue** gun retail price is $39.99 and that is more expensive than all the other guns I tried today. If I was choosing which gun to purchase today I don’t think it has the features to make it worth the price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also get low melt and hot melt **glue** sticks. Like the names suggest, they melt at different **temp**eratures, depending on the materials you’re working with. Low melt **glue** sticks are also much safer to use, causing fewer burns or damage to delicate materials. High melt sticks melt at a higher **temp**erature and can be used to stick a wider variety of materials together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I am using a large silicone mat for this comparison. Hot **glue** won’t stick to the silicone so having a large surface to set your **glue** gun on or to work on is great. The hot **glue** will just peel off after it cools without causing any damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is something so elegant about this mid-size hot **glue** gun from Sizzix, which measures 11 x 14cm (4.3 x 5.5 inches) and uses 7mm **glue** sticks - the most common size for crafting with. Perhaps it is the on/off switch which lets you keep it plugged in if you want to for ease of use, or perhaps it is the precision nozzle for clean and accurate application. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This particular cordless design is especially convenient because it’s got an admirable battery life. The charging cord is also convenient because it connects with an average USB cord, making it simple to match with if the cord is ever lost or damaged. The **glue** gun also comes with 10 hot **glue** sticks all ready to go! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When the first **glue** stick is running out, the gun will auto-load the next stick. You’ll know it’s getting ready to load a new **glue** stick when it gets harder to squeeze the handle. I find shaking the **glue** gun helps the **glue** stick drop into place. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I do think more regular **glue** drips out after releasing the trigger than it did with the Cricut **glue**. So I will say, overall when using Cricut **glue** sticks there were fewer strings and fewer drips than using regular **glue**. But there are still strings and drips. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Glue backs up at inlet tube: Glue sticks may be the wrong size. Use only the recommended 0.27” diameter mini **glue** sticks. Note: Do not elevate front of **glue** gun. Always use side stands or attached stand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All diameters of **glue** sticks are also available in different lengths. If you use a lot of **glue**, you’ll want the longest hot melt sticks you can find. The longest I’ve used are 255 mm, but are only compatible with heavy duty hot **glue** guns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I do think that the tip on this Surebonder **glue** gun is less precise than the Lynn Lilly version. Looking at them side by side you’ll see that the Lynn Lilly version does have a finer point. I can’t get as thin of a bead as I can with the other two. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It has a light on the top. There is no on/off switch. When you plug it in, it is on. When the light is red, it’s not heated up yet, when it turns green it’s ready to put **glue** through. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Don’t be turned off by the cartoony packaging and kid-friendly design: This is the stealth pick of our list. Yes, it only has a low-**temp**erature setting, running 75 degrees cooler than a standard **glue** gun, but that makes this 10-watt tool perfect for delicate tasks like scrapbooking, fabric work, or balloon sculptures. Kids and adults alike will love this tool, which is reliable, light, well insulated, and easy to use. It comes with 10 AdTech cool **glue** sticks to get you started. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This particular **glue** gun actually comes as a part of a whole kit with more features, rather than just a carrying case. It’s got a heat mat for setting the **glue** on between applications, a pair of heat resistant gloves so you don’t burn your fingers while you work, and three little metal tools that come in handy for repairing the gun should anything go wrong. It also, of course, includes a bundle of hot **glue** sticks as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With this style of cordless **glue** gun, the base itself is what is plugged in. You do need to set it back on the base when not in use to keep it charged. If you have it off the stand for more than a minute or two you’ll notice the **glue** gun starting to cool down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Glue Stick Size: A **glue** gun needs to be fed a **glue** stick to melt. Glue sticks range in size from smaller sticks of about a 7-millimeter diameter to thicker sticks of up to 15 millimeters in diameter. Make sure you buy the right size **glue** stick size for the hot **glue** gun you select. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After years of using **glue** guns, I have learned to sort of twist the tip after applying the **glue** to get rid of strings. When not doing that, I don’t feel as though I’m seeing no strings right off the bat. I might say there are fewer strings but there will still be strings even with the Cricut **glue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After testing it I found that the **glue** strings are similar to the Cricut **glue** gun with regular **glue** and the Lynn Lilly version. I also found that it drips way more than any of the guns I’ve tested so far. It’s possible the difference in the tip is what causes the increase in dripping. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cricut claims that theirs with their **glue** drips less and has fewer strings. Over the years, there have been other **glue** guns that have claimed the same thing. I actually own a few of those and when I looked them up none of them are still sold. Since I still had some strings and some drips with the Cricut gun, it wasn’t that big of a benefit for me over some of the other features. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can apply the adhesive in beads or dots, or in a long continuous line using the responsive trigger. When not in use, you can rest the gun on the metal kickstand to keep your nozzle upright and the unit primed for use. Unlike the other **glue** guns reviewed here, this unit does not come with any **glue** sticks, so if you are ordering online, make sure you pop some of these into your basket too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The green and black version is similar. It has a different stand and is corded. It does come in full size if you like a larger **glue** gun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When using the Cricut **glue** sticks the Cricut **glue** gun did drip less and had fewer strings. It is super easy to use and if you have issues with your hands or hand strength the trigger is amazing, it’s really easy to. squeeze. It has a nice precision tip. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Xyron Multi Stick **glue** gun comes in two versions. This one takes the mini **glue** sticks but there is another version that takes the larger ones. The tip of this **glue** gun is pretty large but I can still get a pretty fine bead of **glue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I do want to say I am personally not a fan of super cheap **glue** guns. You can get one for a dollar at the dollar store and I just don’t feel those work properly and you’re going to get frustrated. A good quality **glue** gun can make a huge difference in your crafting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For something a little different, consider Westcott’s mini hot **glue** pen. The trigger sits on top of this slender tool, with a padded rubber grip perfect for long jobs. As with Westcott’s other models, the nozzle’s tip color changes from blue to red to indicate when it’s ready to use. Glue comes out in a consistent moderate **temp**erature, perfect for materials ranging in delicacy from silk to plastic. Glue sticks aren’t included, but this tool works great with Westcott’s all-**temp**erature mini **glue** sticks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For less than the price of some high-end coffee drinks, the Surebonder GM-160 Mini Glue Gun is a great high-**temp**erature hot **glue** gun for those who don't want to spend a lot of money on a **glue** gun. This hot **glue** gun uses **glue** sticks that are 5/6-inch in diameter and either 4 or 10 inches in length. Glue sticks are fed into the gun by inserting the stick into the chamber and pulling the trigger to advance the **glue**. Weighing only 5 ounces, the Surebonder GM-160 Mini High-Temperature Glue Gun is extremely lightweight for portability and ease of use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The power rating of most hot melt **glue** guns is measured in Watts. The higher the Wattage, the faster it will melt the **glue** and the hotter the **glue** will become. Inside the casing is a heating element, and when electricity is passed through it, it gets hot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hot **glue** from a **glue** gun is brilliant. Love or hate that distinctive smell, owning the best **glue** gun can open up whole new craft projects by giving you a solid stick that you just can't get with other adhesives. Want to attach heavy embellishments? A **glue** gun is perfect. Building up cardboard or MDF into 3D shapes? A precision **glue** gun makes this job a breeze. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Glue gun will not heat up: Make sure **glue** gun is plugged into a 120V electrical outlet. If **glue** gun still does not work, the internal fuse of the **glue** gun may be blown and the **glue** gun is not repairable. Do not use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even if you’re not actually carrying your **glue** gun anywhere, a case certainly makes it easier to store by keeping the cord contained and making the tool easier to, say, stack on a shelf. This **glue** gun also comes with 20 hot **glue** sticks, and the case has room for storing those together with the tool as well. This particular model is also quick heating and has an actual on and off switch, which some people prefer the kind of **glue** gun that simply heats when you plug it in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I own all the **glue** guns shown and even a few more. These are all my favorites that are still on the market today. But which is the best **glue** gun? Which should you buy? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are **glue** gun options on the market that have interchangeable tips. I don’t have an example of them but have used them before. You can get really complicated with **glue** guns. If you want more info on those other **glue** guns, they are included in my hot **glue** gun book. It is several years old but still has good information in it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   6. Do not pull **glue** sticks from **glue** gun. If changing **glue**, feed remainder of **glue** stick through **glue** gun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both of these versions take mini **glue** sticks. The pink and teal one is the Lynn Lilly version. It does come with a stand and has a little tray that catches any drips. It is cordless. The base is corded so you can remove it from the base and use it without a cord. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As the **glue** gun is heating up, it gets warm from the tip to about halfway up the aqua portion of the gun. So even though it has a silicone tip, the tip will still be hot. The handle portion does stay cool even when it is completely heated up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But the things that really sets this **glue** gun apart is its accompanying stand. You don't have to own one of these to use the gun – but you'd be missing a trick if you didn't. The optional stand gives you a totally stable spot the store and rest the **glue** gun, with a genius built-in heat resistant plate to catch any minor drips and splodges to keep your **glue** totally under control. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Cricut and Surebonder are the best **glue** gun for ease of squeezing the trigger. If you have trouble with your hands, I would suggest one of those. Next up would be the Xyron and I would rank the AdTech at the bottom or ease of squeezing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have to say I believe a good hot **glue** gun is the best investment you can make for any crafter. I believe this so much I co-authored a book on hot **glue**! I have used a lot of versions over the years. Different brands, different types, ones that are simple and ones with tons of features. I definitely have favorites and will talk about them below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Having a cordless **glue** gun is really helpful especially when I’m making videos. I can have it plugged in anywhere on my craft table and still use the **glue** gun if I’m crafting further away from a plug. You can get the cordless **glue** gun in the green and black version if you like that look better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now let’s test a variety of hot **glue** guns to find the best one for your crafting. I will be testing each on how easy the **glue** sticks are to refill, how easy the **glue** comes out, and how many drips or strings there are. I will also note any other features of the **glue** gun so you can make an informed decision. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **glue** gun itself is a good quality piece and comparable with the other options you’ve seen on this list. It’s single heat, but it heats quickly and has an on-off switch for safety. Rather than sending you the standard clear hot **glue** sticks that you saw before, however, this company provides you with metallic gold and solid black hot **glue** instead! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Installing another **glue** stick is the same as all the other **glue** guns. You’ll likely have to put the **glue** stick in and then push it down again after squeezing the trigger a couple of times. I think this is easy to squeeze the trigger and I can get a pretty good bead with it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For me, having a silicone mat in my craft room is a must. I keep my hot **glue** gun on one at all times and having a large one is nice when I’m working on something large. It helps protect my surface from any **glue** drips. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The price point for the Surebonder **glue** guns is $25 or less. For all the features included, this is a great price. The Lynn Lilly version is currently the **glue** gun I reach for the most. I really love that it’s cordless. If you don’t like the color combo you can find the same **glue** gun in the black and green version. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choose a set of hot **glue** sticks based on the type of **glue** gun you own. Some are meant for low-**temp**erature guns while others are designed for high-**temp**erature guns. There are packs that actually work with both and can withstand **temp**eratures that range between 230 and 380 degrees Fahrenheit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Insert 0.27” diameter mini **glue** stick into back of **glue** gun through the feeder tube. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gorilla’s name is practically synonymous with **glue**, so it should come as no surprise that the company puts out the mightiest pocket-size **glue** gun on the market. Its super-precise nozzle is paired with an easy-squeeze trigger, comfortable grip, and a wide base for setting it to rest. But its greatest advantage is the choice of low and high settings—hard to come by in a mini **glue** gun, whose functionality is typically pretty limited. This 12-watt tool comes with 30 mini **glue** sticks; when it’s time to restock, a variety of vendors sell Gorilla’s mini **glue** sticks in bulk. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Any time I have a project that uses a lot of **glue**, I use this **glue** gun. I like that I don’t have to refill it as often. The tip is fairly precise and it has a stand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I do like that it didn’t take long at all to heat up. When I squeeze the trigger **glue** starts coming out immediately. There is no need to keep squeezing the trigger to get it started. The trigger pull is also very smooth and easy which is also really nice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once I got the feel for using the Xyron Multi Stick, I really liked it. I reach for it almost as often as I do the Lynn Lilly **glue** gun and always reach for it when I have a lot of gluing to do on my project. Not having to add **glue** sticks regularly is a major bonus. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Cricut **glue** gun also has an auto-off feature. When it’s left not in use for 15 minutes, it will shut off. This is nice if you’re like me and sometimes forget to unplug your **glue** gun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The black and green version is a dual-**temp** **glue** gun so you can select high or low **temp**. The Lynn Lilly version only has an on-off switch. Both have an indicator light that lets you know if it is on. The light does not change when the gun is heated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wattage: Glue guns come at different wattage levels for melting the **glue** stick. In general, the higher the wattage, the faster the **glue** gun will heat up and melt the **glue** stick. Also, higher wattage means the **glue** stick will stay hotter for a longer period of time. Low-**temp**erature hot **glue** guns generally have a wattage of between 10 to 20 watts. High-**temp**erature **glue** guns range from 20 to 100 watts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I rank a stand, the ability to be cordless, and holding multiple **glue** sticks higher than a **glue** gun that didn’t have those features but offered fewer drips or strings. For my dollar, I would probably pick the Surebonder or the Xyron. They have the features I prefer in a **glue** gun. However, if you like the look of the Cricut version and you don’t mind laying it on the table it’s a great option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like the Cricut **glue** gun, both of these have a silicone portion on the tip and they get hot right up to the silicone portion. They both feel hot up through the barrel of the gun but the handle remains cool. Both have a precision tip that is similar to the Cricut **glue** gun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes less is more—at least that’s how we feel about **glue** guns. Granted, some heavy-duty jobs require a big-barreled model, but when it comes to detail work and smaller crafts, mini hot **glue** guns are our go-to. These devices are inexpensive, light, and for the most part easy to reload: Just be sure to buy 5/16-inch-diameter **glue** sticks rather than the standard 7/16-inch. Here are the five best small **glue** guns money can buy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not having a stand is the biggest con for me. I almost always have a small silicone mat on my table so that isn’t an extra step for me but I personally like my **glue** gun sitting up so that was a big drawback for me. To get fewer drips and strings, you have to use the Cricut **glue** sticks and even then it did still drip some. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This itsy-bitsy **glue** gun comes with big perks. It melts **glue** at a super-high **temp**erature, meaning it stands up to home improvement projects—metal, leather, wood, and ceramic are all fair game for this spectacular model. Elmer’s palm-size design is also safety forward, with a heat-insulated nozzle and emergency automatic shut-off feature. This 10-watt gun is picky about the **glue** sticks it will take, but it works great with Elmer’s-brand mini sticks (not included, alas). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’m going to show you a few of my favorites, what the features are, and do a few tests. The only **glue** gun in this post that I haven’t used yet is the Cricut version. I am going to plug it in and use it for the first time for this post. All the other guns are ones I’ve used before. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I do think it is a really good **glue** gun, it has a nice precision tip that allows you to lay a fine bead. It’s really cute and the trigger is nice and smooth. I would definitely wait for a sale before purchasing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   melt **glue** sticks at around 250 degrees F. They are a great option for overall craft projects and can be used with lighter, delicate materials such as fabric and paper. They're also a better option for kids as they are safer to use. Dual **temp**erature **glue** guns are the best of both worlds. You can switch the **temp**erature at which the **glue** stick melts to cater to your project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Younger crafters need a hot **glue** gun that is safe for them to use, too! The NEX&CO Kids Mini Hot Glue Gun is designed especially for kids. This low-**temp**erature **glue** gun only operates at 10 watts and comes with a variety of safety features, including an on/off switch, LED light indicator, no-drip nozzle, and comfortable grip. It also has three breathable silicone finger caps to help prevent any burns to little fingers and surfaces. The NEX&CO Kids Mini Hot Glue Gun uses 7-millimeter **glue** sticks and comes with a 60-pack of glitter **glue** sticks in a rainbow of colors to get them started. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Lynn Lilly version of the Surebonder **glue** gun you have probably seen me use the most. I really like the **glue** gun. I like the base and stand and that it has a place to collect any drips regardless of where I set it down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Helping your son with his science project? Get the **glue** gun. Need to affix sequins that fell off your dress? Get the **glue** gun. Fixing that piece of fabric sticking up from your headboard? Get the **glue** gun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Precision Pro **glue** gun is also corded and has a fine tip. Most of the **glue** guns I own have a fine tip. This one is almost identical to the project pro but maybe a little smaller. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These two **glue** guns are by AdTech. They drip about the same as the corded version of the Surebonder which was quite a bit. Overall, I think both have the same amount of **glue** strings as the Cricut when it has regular **glue** sticks installed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As I use this one, I do believe the tip is finer than the Project Pro. I am able to get a finer line with it. My favorite **glue** guns are always the ones with the finest tips. The tip on this one feels similar to the Surebonder **glue** gun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Low or High Temperature: For crafters, there are three main types of hot **glue** guns you'll be selecting from: High-**temp**erature **glue** guns melt **glue** sticks at about 380 degrees Fahrenheit. These **glue** guns are the best for projects where you need to bond heavier materials together, like wood or plastic. They are not the best pick for work on delicate fabrics and materials that might be burned by such a high **temp**erature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Consider any extra features the hot **glue** stick may have to offer. The Gorilla Hot Glue Sticks, Pack of 45, for example, can be sanded and painted. It’s also five times more durable than other brands. That makes it a better choice for important home repairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A hot **glue** gun is one of those tools that most homeowners should have on hand. Not only are they handy for making a few home repairs, but they are also invaluable when it comes to a variety of craft projects. Of course, you’ll need a good set of **glue** sticks to use in your hot **glue** gun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **glue** sticks you use in hot **glue** guns come in lots of different diameters depending on manufacturer, but the most common two sizes are 7 mm and 11 mm. The 7 mm sticks are ideal for fine work and delicate crafting, where the accurate placement of **glue** is more important than volume. 11 mm are more DIY and big craft oriented. If you need a lot of **glue** quickly, use the 11 mm ones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **glue** gun is a little harder to squeeze than the Cricut and Surebonder **glue** guns. The Cricut gun is really smooth when you squeeze it and the Surebonder guns have a similar feel. I do think the extra **glue** sticks are a bonus, especially when working on a project with a lot of **glue** requirements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
