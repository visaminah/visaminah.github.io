## 6 Things About How To Turn Off Copper Water Line To Fridge | Refrigerator Water Line Shut Off Valve Leaking
-   Refrigerator water pipes, whether **copper** or plastic, are subject to leaks. A braided metal water supply line is the only type that rarely leaks. But it’ll cost you heavily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If a water supply valve is already installed near the **fridge**, all you need to do is connect a ¼-inch waterline supply tube. But if there isn’t one, you’ll need to plan to run one from the sink or dishwasher. From the nearest connection, map the shortest path from there to the rear of the **fridge**. Your plans need to include where the waterline is going to run so it won’t be accidentally damaged. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Capping off the water line to a refrigerator is pretty simple. Disconnect the freezer pipe and clean it by turning the T-valve to halt the water flow. Flatten out the **copper** tubing and secure the cap in place with a twist. You can also close the water pipes to your refrigerator with a tap valve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Attach a water valve to the T-fitting. This will control the water flow and water pressure to the refrigerator. Be sure to put a gasket seal between the valve and the T-fitting. Attach the free end of the **copper** tubing to the valve. Now the refrigerator is connected. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Slide a new ferrule onto the end of the **copper** line and insert the end of the tube into the shut-off valve. Slide the nut over the ferrule and thread it onto the shut-off valve until it's snug. Use an adjustable wrench to tighten the nut. Test the connection for leaks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you’ve purchased a new refrigerator with an ice maker and/or water dispenser, or have a **fridge** with an unused one, running a refrigerator waterline will let you get the most use out of it. Newer **fridge**s use a ¼-inch flexible water supply tube to tap into the nearest source of water. This makes the process easier and more convenient than the ¼-inch bendable **copper** tubing used in the past. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
