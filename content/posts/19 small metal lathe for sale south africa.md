## 19 Tips for Small Metal Lathe For Sale South Africa | Metal Lathe For Sale Pretoria
-   The design of **lathe**s can vary greatly depending on the intended application; however, basic features are common to most types. These machines consist of (at the least) a headstock, bed, carriage, and tailstock. Better machines are solidly constructed with broad bearing surfaces (slide-ways) for stability, and manufactured with great precision. This helps ensure the components manufactured on the machines can meet the required tolerances and repeatability. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A metal **lathe** or metalworking **lathe** is a large class of **lathe**s designed for precisely machining relatively hard materials. They were originally designed to machine metals; however, with the advent of plastics and other materials, and with their inherent versatility, they are used in a wide range of applications, and a broad range of materials. In machining jargon, where the larger context is already understood, they are usually simply called **lathe**s, or else referred to by more-specific subtype names (toolroom **lathe**, turret **lathe**, etc.). These rigid machine tools remove material from a rotating workpiece via the (typically linear) movements of various cutting tools, such as tool bits and drill bits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The leadscrew will be manufactured to either imperial or metric standards and will require a conversion ratio to be introduced to create thread forms from a different family. To accurately convert from one thread form to the other requires a 127-tooth gear, or on **lathe**s not large enough to mount one, an approximation may be used. Multiples of 3 and 7 giving a ratio of 63:1 can be used to cut fairly loose threads. This conversion ratio is often built into the quick change gearboxes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The design of a CNC **lathe** varies with different manufacturers, but they all have some common elements. The turret holds the tool holders and indexes them as needed, the spindle holds the workpiece and there are slides that let the turret move in multiple axes simultaneously. The machines are often totally enclosed, due in large part to occupational health and safety (OH&S) issues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   They still work like all other **lathe**s by exposing a rotating workpiece to a stationary cutting tool. But wood **lathe**s are used specifically to work wooden workpieces. They are not suitable for workpieces made of harder materials, including metal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first fully documented, all-metal slide rest **lathe** was invented by Jacques de Vaucanson around 1751. It was described in the Encyclopédie a long time before Maudslay invented and perfected his version. It is likely that Maudslay was not aware of Vaucanson's work, since his first versions of the slide rest had many errors that were not present in the Vaucanson **lathe**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A bar feeder feeds a single piece of bar stock into the cutting machine. As each part is machined, the cutting tool creates a final cut to separate the part from the bar stock, and the feeder continues to feed the bar for the next part, allowing for continual operation of the machine. There are two types of bar feeds used in **lathe** machining: Hydrodynamic bar feeds, which rest the bar stock in a series of channels whilst clamping down on the top and bottom of the bar, and hydrostatic bar feeds, which hold the bar stock in a feed tube using pressurized oil.[9] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Anything from metals like aluminum, steel, and titanium to plastics, wax, and delrin can be used on a **lathe**. The different materials used must be within the size limitations of the machine (8″ diameter, 42″ length). The material used also affects aspects of manufacturing, like the speed the **lathe** rotates at. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The terms center **lathe**, engine **lathe**, and bench **lathe** all refer to a basic type of **lathe** that may be considered the archetypical class of metalworking **lathe** most often used by the general machinist or machining hobbyist. The name bench **lathe** implies a version of this class small enough to be mounted on a workbench (but still full-featured, and larger than mini-**lathe**s or micro-**lathe**s). The construction of a center **lathe** is detailed above, but depending on the year of manufacture, size, price range or desired features, even these **lathe**s can vary widely between models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With rapid growth in this industry, different CNC **lathe** manufacturers use different user interfaces which sometimes makes it difficult for operators as they have to be acquainted with them. With the advent of cheap computers, free operating systems such as Linux, and open source CNC software, the entry price of CNC machines has plummeted.[citation needed] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A gang-tool **lathe** is one that has a row of tools set up on its cross-slide, which is long and flat and is similar to a milling machine table. The idea is essentially the same as with turret **lathe**s: to set up multiple tools and then easily index between them for each part-cutting cycle. Instead of being rotary like a turret, the indexable tool group is linear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When a **lathe** is installed, the first step is to level it, which refers to making sure the bed is not twisted or bowed. There is no need to make the machine exactly horizontal, but it must be entirely untwisted to achieve accurate cutting geometry. A precision level is a useful tool for identifying and removing any twist. It is advisable also to use such a level along the bed to detect bending, in the case of a **lathe** with more than four mounting points. In both instances the level is used as a comparator rather than an absolute reference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The cross-slide (3) rides on the carriage and has a feedscrew which travels at right angles to the main spindle axis. This permits facing operations to be performed, and the depth of cut to be adjusted. This feedscrew can be engaged, through a gear train, to the feed shaft (mentioned previously) to provide automated 'power feed' movement to the cross-slide. On most **lathe**s, only one direction can be engaged at a time as an interlock mechanism will shut out the second gear train. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   CNC horizontal machining is performed using horizontally-configured **lathe**s, machining centers, boring machines, or boring mills. The equipment used typically consists of rotating cylindrical cutters moving up and down along five axes. These machines are capable of producing a variety of shapes, slots, holes, and details on a three-dimensional part.[6] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For even larger diameter and heavier work, such as pressure vessels or marine engines, the **lathe** is rotated so it takes the form of a turntable on which parts are placed. This orientation is less convenient for the operator, but makes it easier to support large parts. In the largest, the turntable is installed flush with the floor, with the headstock recessed below, to facilitate loading and unloading workpieces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wheel **lathe**s are machines used to manufacture and resurface the wheels of railway cars. When wheels become worn or compromised from excessive use, this tool can be used to re-cut and recondition the wheel of the train car. There are a number of different wheel **lathe**s available including underfloor variations for resurfacing wheels that are still attached to the rail car, portable types that are easily transported for emergency wheel repairs, and CNC versions which utilize computer-based operating systems to complete the wheel repair.[8] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turret **lathe**s and capstan **lathe**s are members of a class of **lathe**s that are used for repetitive production of duplicate parts (which by the nature of their cutting process are usually interchangeable). It evolved from earlier **lathe**s with the addition of the turret, which is an indexable tool holder that allows multiple cutting operations to be performed, each with a different cutting tool, in easy, rapid succession, with no need for the operator to perform setup tasks in between (such as installing or uninstalling tools) nor to control the toolpath. (The latter is due to the toolpath being controlled by the machine, either in jig-like fashion via the mechanical limits placed on it by the turret's slide and stops, or via computer-directed servo mechanisms on CNC **lathe**s.)[5] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vertically-oriented CNC machines utilize cylindrical cutters on a vertical spindle axis to create plunge cuts and drilled holes, as well as custom shapes, slots, and details on three-dimensional parts. Equipment used in this type of milling includes vertical **lathe**s, vertical machining centers, and 5-axis machines.[7] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **lathe** machine is a stationary cutting tool used primarily for shaping wood and metal, which are referred to as workpieces. The **lathe** machine removes unwanted parts of the workpiece to produce the desired product. The movements of a traditional **lathe** machine are manually controlled by an operator. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
