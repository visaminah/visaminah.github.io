-   The nibs/tips are replaceable as well. In fact, the makers **hand** out replacement nibs with the actual product. Feel free to replace them on your own. All you need is to do is to twist and turn the nibs a bit and you’re all good. Besides, the guys at Art-n-Fly are here to help if you need them to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I liked the fact that the tip is flexible. This felt like a real brush in my **hand**s. People can **draw** medium, bold, and thin lines as per the situations demand without switching to different pens. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Artists can **draw** with it like they do with normal markers. One thing to note is the fact that this product comes with a single fine tip instead of having two different kinds. After you’re done, cap the marker. Don’t forget to keep it stored horizontally so that the material doesn’t flow outward. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a given when you’re in the hunt for the professional markers that artists use. As you know by now, the type of art differs from person to person. For example, someone might be a good Manga artist. Some people are good at **hand**ling watercolor effects and architectural blueprints. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A caricature is a type of cartoon **draw**ing where something about the subject is exaggerated to be funny.

Use this **draw**ing idea to make a funny sketch of your friends, family members or even a pet or celebrity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   With these markers, I could re-edit my sketches after a week or so when the ink is dry. Yes, users can wet their sketches. But only if they use these on “Uncoated Paper.” The open time (it’s a period during which you can edit **draw**ings without spoiling them) for Copic is limitless as the makers say. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Symbols are popular **hand** tattoos for many reasons. People may choose symbols because they wish to share something about themselves with the world, such as displaying an affiliation with a group or organization. They offer many choices depending on what you want to get. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Steampunk is a type of science fiction where everything is steam powered. Think gears, flying contraptions, and all sorts of odd inventions. Prefer figure **draw**ing? You could also **draw** people in steampunk attire! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Very few markers can work their magic on fabric. This one works with fabric, wood, ceramic plates, and plastic.

People even go for bathroom decors with these as they’re permanent in nature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Brush Tip: To put it simply, imagine a paintbrush but in the shape of a marker. As you’d come to know in the buying guide, these tips are flexible.

-   This big, friendly cat is perfect for anyone who loves animals. With its big eyes and cute face, it's sure to bring a smile to your day. And who doesn't love cats? So why not add this furry friend to your collection of cool things to **draw**? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are using only one color ink on paper, you'll basically be working in two colors: the color of your ink, and the color of your paper. Each will play off the other. In pen and ink **draw**ings, the blank space is just as important as the markings you make with the pen. Therefore, you need to pay as much attention to what's going on in the background as you are to what you're doing with the pen. If you are more accustomed to working in color, this will require a different way of thinking and creating art than you might be used to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   People can create any effect they like when blending two colors together. I’ve seen artists creating the illusion of water-color painting using these markers. The ink is highly pigmented. You’ll notice greater depth in your **draw**ings. That’s one positive I’d take any day of the week. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s no one definitive answer to this question. It all depends on your personal preferences and what you want to communicate to others. Some people might choose to **draw** a simple design or symbol, while others might opt for something more complex or ornate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dot Tip Markers: Dot markers are generally for kids. These markers have sponge-like tips that stay moist. These tips are perfect when our kids are practicing **hand**-eye coordination and **hand** dexterity. I haven’t seen that many artists use these sharpies for their artwork. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What novice artists don’t realize is the fact that there’s a pointy side as well. I often used it to **draw** fine lines. But I must admit, the lines will not be as fine as you’d expect from a “Bullet” tip or “Fine” tip markers that you find available on the market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sharpie ink rests on the skin's surface, so the primary risk comes from solvent getting absorbed into the bloodstream. Tattoo ink, on the other **hand**, may pose a risk of ink poisoning from both the pigment and the liquid portion of the ink.﻿﻿ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   themselves. Another possibility is that they enjoy the feeling of the pen or marker against their skin. Additionally, some people may find that **draw**ing on their **hand**s helps them to focus and concentrate better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Solvent markers can work with any surface that you put them up against. This includes rock, paper, glass, wood and any other surface that you can imagine **draw**ing on. Sure, other markers are also adept to some degree but not as good as solvent markers such as oil or pastel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of my favorite things to **draw** is scenes from my favorite books and movies. I love getting lost in the world of a story and **draw**ing the characters and settings brings me even closer to the action. It's also really fun to imagine what the characters might look like in real life and to try to capture their personalities in my **draw**ings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using alcohol ink gives these products a resistance against fading. Meaning, your **draw**ings won’t get discolored easily. I’ve seen artists preserve their pieces for two to three years. That’s good longevity when you consider that they’ve used markers instead of paintbrushes, pencils or ball-point pens. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This specific pen does more than just blending two colors. I mean, the users have the flexibility of **draw**ing freestyle, shading, and layering when they need to. Use it well enough and blending produces “Gradient-like” effects that you see in digital **draw**ings. Intriguing, isn’t it? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Well, both the tips share just a single source of ink. Some of you might consider this a **draw**back since it will run out faster than usual. Yes, it’s true. The ink reservoir depleted faster when I put it to intense use. Yet, the single tank has its perks as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A rose is a beautiful flower that can be found in many gardens. Roses come in many different colors, but they are most commonly red.

-   If you're struggling with getting the proportions right, try using a reference grid. This can be created by **draw**ing evenly spaced horizontal and vertical lines across your paper. Once you have your grid in place, start mapping out where the different features of the character will go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Guys at Copic went as far as giving us replaceable nibs with this product. I don’t know about you but I’m a sucker for brands.

Say what you will but consistency and ink-types differ from one brand to another. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   FireAlpaca is a very easy-to-use **draw**ing tool that’s free forever for Windows and Mac users, or you can pay to remove the ads on Steam .
