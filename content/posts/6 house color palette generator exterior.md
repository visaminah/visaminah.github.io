## 6 Things About House Color Palette Generator Exterior | Exterior Paint Color Combinations Images
-   "Having thousands of **color**s and a wide variety of product selections at your fingertips with this free online tool provides an exciting view at how a home could look with modifications," says Kate Smith, chief **color** maven with Sensational Color. "This is a 'must use' tool for anyone in the building industry and for all homeowners thinking of making exterior upgrades or selecting products for a new home." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. “Painting” the **color** onto photo. The tech is ok. It does leave a white outer line around “painted area”, so that can be distracting. I also had an actual paint swatch on the wall, so it had a white line around that swatch too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   According to Smith, the tool serves as a valuable resource to anyone in the building industry. "Imagine being a builder and having the ability to share **color** **palette**s for home exteriors with clients in just a few clicks of the mouse," says Smith. "Or think about how a homeowner can decide on changes to the elements of their home exterior and then be able to share those changes immediately online with their builder. Whether making one modification to a home exterior or embracing a full revamp, this tool is a lifesaver!" - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   E. G.- I accidentally tapped on one **color** swatch a few times because no names are given (until **color** is selected) and I wasn’t sure “which black **color**” in that row that I had already looked at. I didn’t realize I had selected the same **color** until I clicked on it and then I could see the **color** name. I had to exit out of the picture completely and restart process just to choose another **color**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Taking photos and allowing app to access certain photos worked fine. When looking over **color** swatches, the names of **color**s weren’t available to see (you’re going on small **color** swatch alone). Once you click on a **color** and it takes you to your chosen photo, there isn’t anyway to “undo” or “page back” if you don’t want that **color**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Created by DaVinci Roofscapes to showcase different "top down" **color** options on home exteriors, the free visualizer can be found at www.davinciroofscapes.com/**color**/designer. Images can be saved to an online account, posted on Facebook or Pinterest or easily shared in a tweet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
