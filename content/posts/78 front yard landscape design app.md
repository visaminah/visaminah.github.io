## 78 Reference List: Front Yard Landscape Design App | Landscape Design Software Free Download
-   SketchUp Free is the lite version of the app SketchUp Pro and is perfect for those looking to put it to non-commercial use. SketchUp Pro is typically suited for architects, **landscape** designers, and construction planners who work in a more professional setting. SketchUp Free is the perfect gateway for personal users to get a good glimpse or trial of the software before purchasing it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Landscaping is a great way to transform the outside of your home. A beautifully manicured **yard** can give it added curb appeal and provide a beautiful place to entertain guests. However, when you’re trying to come up with your dream **landscape** design, it can be hard to picture what you’re trying to build. Luckily, there are some useful **landscape** design software programs that can help you plan out your dream **yard**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Creating a home you love means focusing on anything you want to be changed both inside and out. With landscaping design software tools like the ones we’ve shared here, you’ll be able to plan out the **yard** of your dreams. If you want to plan & visualize a back**yard** structure, check out our reviews of the top deck design software for more ideas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The program allows you to render and edit 3D models of your **landscape** design. It has a pretty low-level need for technical skill, so you can come up with and create ideas without being too overwhelmed by how to use the tool. However, it also doesn’t skimp on the features to make your **landscape** look exactly how you want it to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike some of the best **landscape** design apps, the experience starts off with an introductory lesson. It walks you through the software. It shows you how to get started and explains everything you can do. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The above apps are at least free to download, though many do come with additional costs. The following ones charge for downloads. But some at least offer free trials so you can see what you’re getting before paying. Here are some top **landscape** design tools for those interested in paid products. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Think about layering when placing plants in your front **yard**. Tall in the back, then mid height, and short in the front. It may seem obvious, but we find many people only do two of the three, leaving an empty void in the middle. A tall evergreen with a little perennial in front might look out of scale while a tall shrub with a medium one in front would look so much more finished with a little splash of ground cover in your garden beds below. For the best visual interest, remember this rule of three! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are looking for some low maintenance **yard** landscaping ideas, consider reducing your grass or adding artificial turf. No grass means you don’t have to store a lawn mower and it will save you hours mowing. Not only is artificial turf easy to maintain, it will look great year round. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is another program that has a wide, 4,600 item plant encyclopedia. This way, you choose the plants best for your **yard** instead of what just looks pretty. Aside from 3D models, you can also see your garden design in a color-coded blueprint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Microsoft Pix Camera looks like a simple photo capture app. But it allows you to take full panoramic shots of a **yard**. Then it includes Photosynth technology that you can use to add extra features to the images, giving you a realistic view of what the new design may look like. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Incidentally, you might be thinking that an app you download to your phone might not create the high-quality results you’re looking for. I thought the same thing. Then I found that many professional **landscape**rs use nothing more than the app on their phones to develop the most beautiful results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you already have a walkway leading to your front door, a lovely and simple way to immediately boost your curb appeal is to frame it with a pair of large planters. We love planters because you can choose from many styles and customize them for every season. Even if you don’t have a statement walkway up to your front door, adding planters on either side of your front door creates a focal point in your front **yard** and elevates the overall **landscape**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   PRO Landscape is a computer design software for **landscape** architects. It includes realistic photo imaging and CAD designs so you can see proposed ideas right on your screen. It’s also a licensed program, so you can run it on multiple devices or include multiple users in each project. The companion apps for tablets include tools for providing estimates and collecting payments on-site. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This tool is meant to be used by homeowners rather than professional contractors. This means that it doesn’t have a complex interface that takes a lot of time to understand how to use. Still, they don’t skip out on plenty of customizable features to personalize your back**yard** or front lawn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your front walkway (and driveway if in front!) plays a critical part of the beauty of your **yard** landscaping. If your front **yard** is smaller, a walkway is a great place to invest. Whether it makes a statement or simply tidy and neat, the walkway is truly a person’s first step onto your property. You don’t want loose stones or wobbly bricks! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I did some research and came across an eye-opening statistic. The American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) took a survey of its members and other **landscape** architects. They found out that 76% used a smartphone application for most or all of the analysis they performed on a site before they got started designing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The program starts with their “building wizard.” It starts you with a step-by-step guide of how to set up a **landscape** and how to start designing it. This feature is especially useful to newcomers to programs like these since it not only gives you tips but walks you through what each tool does and how to use it as well. It makes the whole press a lot less overwhelming compared to throwing the user in the deep end. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The iOS app is just $2.99 to download. The company also offers **landscape** and garden design sessions for $99 each. But those are geared toward homeowners. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is more of a catch-all design software rather than specialized. You can use it to build your home from the ground up.

You can also use it form remodeling, redesigning, and adding additions to your pre-existing home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As for viewing your plan, you have plenty of options with this software. In keeping with the theme of this list, you have a 3D option as well as a 2D option.

This allows you to nail design and really feel like you’re there to test it out before you even get the project physically started. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This iPhone/iPad app is really neat. Once you design a plan, you can place it on top of any photos you’ve taken of the area you’re working on.

You get more than 600 different **landscape** objects and items in the image library. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re totally refurbishing your lawn, you might need to add a patio. Maybe you want to build a massive outdoor cooking experience or a 20-foot waterfall. Most of us would wisely hire a professional **landscape** architect to help us in those situations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best app for **landscape** design depends on your needs and budget. If you’re looking for a free app for iOS, iScape is probably your best choice. If you need a professional software, Lands Design has more design features. SketchUp is ideal for those that want to create 3D designs beyond **landscape**s. PRO Landscape Home is one of the most versatile tools that’s available on multiple platforms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “If you’re DIY’ing it, iScape makes it easy to plan out what to buy and how to put it all together. If you’re hiring a **landscape**r, the app can help you explore ideas and share your vision.” - Forbes - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Planters are a great solution for a small front **yard**. They create small, contained designs that can be just as impactful as a bountiful garden. Choose planters that work with your home’s color scheme and style. For example, simple, repeating planters with one species work well with modern **yard**s, an eclectic mix of colors and shapes can be exciting in a cottage garden. A pot filled with succulents may be the perfect option to provide texture in a Southwestern front **yard**, accompanied by small rocks and cacti! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A front **yard** serves many important functions from a first impression to representing the personalities that live there. We all know the concept of “curb appeal” and want to present our homes in the best way possible toward the street and the world.

-   We often reserve programming and recreation to the back**yard** of a home.

We’ve even had clients add a great fire pit to their front **yard**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If season-long color is an appealing goal for you, try to select plants with different bloom times. If you really love lilacs, build out the flower beds to show them off and enjoy simple, structural greenery during the rest of the season. If you love vibrant fall foliage, opt for deciduous trees, but if you crave a little greenery in the depths of December, evergreens are a great option for you. Considering seasonality isn’t always intuitive, but it’s this step that can really make your small front **yard** **landscape** look professional. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
