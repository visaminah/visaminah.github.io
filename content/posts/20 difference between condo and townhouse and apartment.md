## 20 Things You Should Know About Difference Between Condo And Townhouse And Apartment | Condo Vs Townhouse: Which One Should You Pick?
-   Maintenance – The maintenance required for a **condo**minium is very minimal. Residents will only have to look after their houses and not the open spaces. The corporation or HOA owns most of the **condo**s as well as the communal and other spaces within the building. However, any **condo** fees will cover all maintenance work that might be required. (1) Overall, the money spent on maintenance fees is cheaper in a **condo**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – The cost of staying in **condo**s is cheaper compared to other real estate properties. Usually, fees for maintenance are divided between all the residents and the owners. Therefore, the cost of living in a **condo** is more affordable for most people. Safety – Condos have higher security for residents, as units are close together. Also, residents can pay for additional security services and gadgets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Across Canada, **condo**s and townhouses are the two main property choices that people opt for when buying homes. Both have different benefits and provide unique facilities to the homeowners. The decision of which is best for you will mainly depend on the type of lifestyle that you lead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **condo** is a single unit which is part of a larger complex, usually built in a low-rise or a high-rise building. A townhouse is a condensed version of a single family home, designed and built in rows, and sharing a wall with other townhouses. An **apartment** is a type of living space built within a building with not just an adjoining wall but also adjoining ceilings and floors with other **apartment**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **condo** or **condo**minium is a single unit property that is part of a larger unit or building. The word “**condo**minium” is made up of the prefix con, meaning “together,” and the word dominium, meaning “domain or property.” Hence, it is considered to be a “shared property” type of real estate with owners having possession only of the inside structure/unit and not the land. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Townhouse owners do, however, have a lot of responsibility when it comes to the maintenance and upkeep of their home. Detached homes, in general, are not as secure, as they have windows and doors based on a ground level with easy access. In the townhouse vs **condo** debate, this is one round townhouse can’t win. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Townhouses – with their windows and doors leading onto the street – are not as secure. Since these are individual properties, residents don’t have security services like those available in **condo**s. Buying your own security systems to protect your home can be expensive. Higher expenses – Not only will people have to pay a higher amount to get a townhouse, but people will also have to pay more for the services as well. Townhouse expenses are greater than **condo**s overall, due to being a single-family home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Finding a **condo** within a short walk of work is ideal! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Plus, the rate of **condo**s is rapidly increasing in Toronto. This mainly due to the demand and lifestyle benefits that a **condo** provides. However, at the end of the day, it is all about your requirements. If you are looking for a place where your kids can have their own space and enjoy in the backyard too, townhouses are perfect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – The number of amenities that a resident gets while staying in a **condo** is unrivalled. Facilities include gyms, party rooms, rooftop BBQ areas, open and green terraces, meeting rooms and yoga rooms. Cost – The cost of staying in **condo**s is cheaper compared to other real estate properties. Usually, fees for maintenance are divided between all the residents and the owners. Therefore, the cost of living in a **condo** is more affordable for most people. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Residents staying in **condo**s have to pay monthly fees for all the standard space amenities. This might be an issue for most residents since not everyone uses these spaces or amenities. Less autonomy – Condos in Toronto are subjected to the bylaws stated by the **condo** corporation. Due to this, residents might not be able to make changes to their homes. They might not even be allowed to decorate their home during holidays. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Condo owners only have access to the interiors of the property. The communal area, parks, amenities, etc. are usually owned by the Homeowners Association (HOA). As a result, **condo** owners are subject to HOA fees. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One advantage to owning a **condo** or a townhouse is the ability to remodel and re-furnish as needed or desired as long as it doesn’t cause any trouble with the neighbors.

They need to ask permission from their landlords if they wish to refurnish or make any changes in the living space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Most of the **condo**s in Toronto are in bustling neighbourhoods.

Continue reading this article and we’ll provide you with information on each as well as their main differences. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Condos are generally small, having only a single floor. However, **condo**s usually have more complete and high-end community amenities. Townhouses, on the other hand, are larger, having 2-3 stories, but are limited in terms of community amenities. Apartments either have just 1 level or multiple stories wherein community or shared amenities are also available. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An **apartment** is a type of living space that is usually inside a building. Apartment units often have adjoining walls, floors, and ceilings with other **apartment**s. Here, tenants share common areas or amenities and do not have any private yards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That said, while previously it depended solely on whether a family or an individual is buying the house – things have changed. For example, it used to be the case that **condo**s didn’t have many amenities. Nor did they have much open space like a townhouse. However, both options are much more accessible than ever before as homes for people of all lifestyles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
