-   If you're not loving the texture on your **walls** and wish to make a change, rest assured that there is a method for removing the plaster. This method of scraping the texture from the wall will take a nominal amount of time, but you'll be happy with the smooth surface that will allow for worry-free re**paint**ing. First, you'll need to gather the necessary supplies, which according to How to Build It, include a drop cloth, work goggles, a scraper, and a spray bottle, although a large sprayer would get the job done more quickly. You'll also need sandpaper, a wallboard knife, oil-based primer, and joint compound. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One thing that would be worth testing, but it only works on certain **paint**s and textures: use a heat gun and a wide spatula to scrape off the texture. Try this in a discrete corner and see if it is not easier than cutting with a sharp pull scraper. When the **paint** is acrylic it will often peel off fairly easy once heated up. Expect a few gauges and some drywall compound patching but the surface can come out quite smooth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the seventies, almost every homeowner wanted textured **walls**. It was considered cost-effective because it concealed imperfections in the wall. In addition to this, textured **walls** seemed more fascinating at the time and the ‘textured wall enthusiasts” claimed that it added character to the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I am looking for ideas on what to do with these textures **walls**. They are a pain to clean and if something hits them some of it chips off. Remove or **paint**? Any ideas would be helpful.

-   If you choose to actually scrap the surface flat, being careful to not gouge into the drywall too much, you could easily put a skim coat of drywall joint compound over the entire wall to make up for the little holes caused by pieces of the grit that popped out or small valleys that are left. This is easier to do than trying to float a coat over a rough surface because you are not raising the entire surface but rather filling in dents and picks. You will probably need to work hard on a first coat, pick up little misses or gouges with touch up work on a second and perhaps third coat. Then prime and **paint** the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
