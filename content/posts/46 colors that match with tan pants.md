You can smarten it up by losing the shirt and just doing the buttons up as well. We really like the texture of the shirt as well, you can see the lining and that a bit of a different dimension to the outfit that you won't get with a s**tan**dard shirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grey would not be my first or second choice as a color to wear with my khaki pants (or the sneakers on the picture above), but if you choose the right shade of grey, the combination can look alright. I would personally contrast the **colors** and wear a darker shade of grey shoes with a light shade of khaki pants and vice versa. Don’t wear a similar tone, and you will be fine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

These two **colors** are earthy tones, and that’s why they complement each other so well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark brown pants also look fabulously chic with a fashionable **tan** trench-coat. You can style these two ‘must-have’ garments in different ways to vary the look, too. Try them with a black T-shirt, dark brown narrow fit pants, black loafers and a black bag, for an extra touch of elegance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So if you choose dark coffee pants, you have a wide choice of light, medium or dark **colors** for your top.

For example, a black blouse doesn’t look good with white pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Business casual clothes last a long time and look fantastic. They are a perfect way to s**tan**d out with style in a classic, elegant outfit. Brown suits are traditional and proven garments in fashion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And the best way to choose your shoe color is to remember that lighter brown trousers look better with darker shoe color shades. So that means that **tan** trousers will look fabulous with rich, stylish burgundy shoes or ankle boots.

But in the summer you can wear white and **tan** footwear, of course. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black and khaki can be tough to pull off due to the severe contrast between the two **colors**. But, I think it works in the images above. In both these khaki outfits I added a splash of a third color—via the collar under the black sweater in the first image and the sneakers in the second. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **colors** on the shirt can be seen from a dis**tan**ce and the **colors** on the pants help it pop. The outfit is perfect for those who want to s**tan**d out. These clothes are an easy go-to when the weather is cold and you want to look stylish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When going for prints, use subtle **colors** while letting the trousers go for a dark tone. Avoid prints all together if you’re going for a job interview. They are too loud and distracting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, the good news: khaki is a versatile color. It goes with many different shades and you can pair it with both dark and light items. My favorite **colors** to wear with khaki are shades of blue and gray. Pastel also works well, and you shouldn’t look past bright bursts of **colors**—especially red. Finally both black and white work nicely with khaki. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown Trousers go well with a white or beige T-shirt. You can also pair them with a vibrant blue that makes both the colours s**tan**d out. You can add to that with a brown cardigan or jacket. You can even wear a brown sweater over the t-shirt you choose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In terms of color and shade, have a contrast between light and dark **colors**. Light shades for your shirt (like white, beige, sky blue and so on) work perfectly well dark tones for your trousers. In these case, **colors** like chocolate or navy for ins**tan**ce. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main color I avoid when wearing khaki is other khaki items. It just looks too Indiana Jones for my liking. I also steer clear of earthy **colors** like green, yellow, and orange. Having said that, these shades could still work as long as the other items in your outfit compliment them. And, as always, here’s a reminder that with a big of confidence you can get away with wearing pretty much anything. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A word of caution: Just because a light-colored shirt goes well with **tan** brown pants, this does not mean that you can wear any light-colored shirt with any type of **tan** pants. The **colors** still have to match each other. For example, you would not want to wear a light green shirt with **tan** pants that are a darker color, such as a deep brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When wearing khaki and red, I tend to balance the pairing out with light **colors** like white or gray rather than darker shades. Red is also a good way to add a bright splash of color, for example, by wearing a tie like in the image above. Shades of pink also work well with khaki. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, a lot of the old rules about what **colors** you can wear with brown have been cast aside; as everything depends on the tone or shade of the **colors** you want to match. Therefore, you can wear black with some shades of brown for a chic, contemporary look. So there’s no barrier to you teaming a black jacket, a black belt or a black shoulder bag with most shades of brown pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   S**tan**d out from the crowd and make your mark with a classic look. Dark t-shirts are essential pieces to any modern wardrobe. They help you create fabulous, timeless outfits that last beyond fleeting trends. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Green is a great color to wear with **tan**, as it is complementary. complementary **colors** are **colors** that are opposite each other on the color wheel. Blue is also a great color to wear with **tan**, as it is complementary, as well as calming. Finally, purple is a great color to wear with **tan**, as it is also complementary, and can add a touch of glamour to an outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To pull it off it’s impor**tan**t to keep the fit consistent. That means seeking out a pair of khaki pants with a straight, tapered cut and combining them with a shirt that’s equally relaxed. The shirt should look comfortable untucked, while the canvas sneakers keep the look firmly in smart casual territory. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In general, a light-colored shirt goes well with **tan** brown pants. This can be a white shirt, a beige shirt, or a light-colored shirt in a different color. A dark-colored shirt may be too harsh against the light color of the pants and may not look very good. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One combination to consider that works well for pants and shirts is to go with a good combination of contrasts. Using the same tones and **colors** may end up coming out as dull and unremarkable. The result is that you don’t s**tan**d out at all, making tonal outfits something to avoid. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When paired with a variety of other hues, brown looks surprisingly sophisticated, making it a great replacement for your s**tan**dard-issue black. It feels rich and luxurious with these complementary **colors**—what more could you ask for? That said, brown is notoriously polarizing. Many consider it to be an "ugly" color. But hear us out and give it a chance. It feels surprisingly fresh this season in particular, and it's an unexpected departure from other more beloved neutrals. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And gray cropped sweaters look great with **tan** trousers of all types plus white pumps for a zingy look. . . I could go on and on with all of the exciting, new color combinations and styles waiting for us to debut this year. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, my go-to **colors** tend to belong to the Autumn style color family. Darker Green style shirts, Burgundy, Teal, and even Navy can work pretty well too. They offer a complimentary effect as Khaki sort of belongs to that family as well. Again though, these don't have to be plain, they can be patterned if you are wanting to add a bit more Jazz into the overall outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tan shirt with brown pants is a fashionable combination. We have a range of sizes to choose from so you can find your perfect fit.

A fashionable, yet practical option for a casual Friday, these **tan** shirts are the perfect complement to brown pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gorgeous camel coats and smart gray jackets are two of my favorite outerwear **colors** to match with cream, **tan** or brown trousers. If your coat is camel, it will match perfectly with pants that are three tones darker. And in warmer weather, you can wear a light ivory or cream colored coat, as long as your brown pants are 3 shades darker to get the right balance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Orange and khaki are just two **colors** that weren’t meant to be worn together. It doesn’t matter if it is with shoes, pants, shirts, or any fashion accessories. It just doesn’t work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a soft, semi-formal look, wear pastel **colors** with your brown pants, whether they are a light or dark shade. Most light **colors** match well with brown, so choose the shade of your top depending on whether you have warm or cool undertones to your skin. For example, pink, blue, gray, lavender, apple- and mint-green and aqua are cool **colors** and **tan**, orange, burnt orange and mustard yellow are warm **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Almost all light **colors** are a good choice with brown pants, no matter how light or dark the pants are. Choose pastels for a soft, formal look. White is appropriate for the office but can get a bit boring after a while. Try yellow or **tan** to bring out the brown in the pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for a more casual outfit, try pairing **tan** khaki pants with a green or blue shirt. These **colors** will create a contrast that will make you look stylish and put-together. You can also mix and match shades of green and blue to create a unique look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tan is a great color to wear during the summertime, as it is light and airy. However, finding the right color to compliment **tan** can be difficult. Some **colors** that work well with **tan** are green, blue, and purple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not that there’s anything wrong with that. I have many many khaki-colored items of clothing including chinos and a jacket (well, a shacket actually). I wear them both all the time! But, it can get boring. This article will help you mix things up a bit by showing what **colors** go great with khaki. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A cream-colored shirt is a staple in any wardrobe. It can be dressed up or down and is easy to find in a range of **colors**. The cream color shirt is perfect for a day out or even a night out on the town. The shirt with brown pants, a neutral color that can be worn with a variety of **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Burgundy is probably my second favorite option for choosing a pair of shoes to wear with khaki pants. However, they look better with beige undertones than green, so you are advised (I still think they look alright with green undertones). Both **colors** are earthy tones, which complement each other boldly, making people notice your shoes. Try wearing something blue or navy on top, and you’ll have a killer outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
