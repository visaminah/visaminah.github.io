## 7 Fun Facts Off-Grid Tiny House Heating And Cooling | Free Heater
-   If you’re are like me, living in a southern state, then your AC is vital. The Florida summers are hot and humid, and I need a quality **cooling** unit. If you live in the northern region of the world, then you probably won’t need the most powerful AC. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The mini split systems are probably the best option for anyone willing to spend a little bit more money on their HVAC unit. Mini splits are very efficient, and take up little to no floor space in your tiny house. They are also equipped with **heating** and **cooling**, so there is no need for separate systems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sufficient insulation will also help reduce energy usage. In fact, good insulation can reduce your **heating** a **cooling** requirements by about 20%. And it is, of course, much better to choose an eco-friendly option such as Earthwool, that’s made from recycled materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Central air conditioners can be a great way to cool your tiny house without sacrificing floor space. If you are in the process of building your tiny home, then whole house **cooling** units are a viable option. All of the ductwork is hidden in the walls allowing for more floor space, and allowing for multiple zones to be heated or cooled in your tiny house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When making the move to a tiny house, **heating** and **cooling** is essential. Depending on your location and it’s climate, there are many different options to choose from. I live in Florida, so my **heating** unit is barely used, and is much smaller and less expensive than somebody’s **heating** unit in Michigan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you don’t want to spend gobs of money on a whole house **heating** and **cooling** unit, there are other ways to take the edge off in the summer. Like I said before, summers in Florida are hot and can be unbearable. If you live in one of the northern states, then you have a few options in the summer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Electric heaters are usually only practical on-grid, with continuous use of a generator, or with a truly enormous solar array. For off-grid tiny living, direct use of fuel for **heating** is often more practical than using it to drive a generator. Some of these options also offer ambiance that you can't get with an electric heat source. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
