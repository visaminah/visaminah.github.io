## 3 Tips to Kohler Motion Sensor Faucet Not Working | Motion Sensor Faucet Troubleshooting
-   The sensor on an automatic **faucet** is usually placed at the lip or base of the **faucet**’s spout. Instead of having a motion sensor, these kitchen **faucet**s use presence sensors, which are designed to detect the presence of a hand under the spout, Hunker explains. When the sensor detects hands under the spout, it turns the **faucet** on. Removing your hands will trigger the sensor to turn the **faucet** off again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   According to Houzz, touch **faucet**s normally start at about $350 for the cost. However, prices can reach $600 and more. You can find touch **faucet**s at Kitchen & Bath Classics, and where you buy the **faucet** and the kind you choose will determine the price. Installation shouldn’t be a big problem either, as most **faucet**s come with a complete installation kit. This generally includes a battery pack, according to Houzz. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The spout of an automatic **faucet** holds all the working parts. You can find spouts of different materials. Less expensive models are often made of zinc, while higher end **faucet**s are available in brass or copper. For durability and appearance purposes, you will likely find nickel or chrome-plated spouts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
