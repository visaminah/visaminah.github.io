## 10 Tips to Pen With Rubber Tip For Phone | Fine Rubber Tip Stylus
-   Tear off a small piece of cotton wool and feed it through the **pen** nib hole. With the cotton wool poking through the hole, push the ink cartridge back into the tip of the **pen** – this will help to secure the cotton wool. You may need to experiment with the amount of cotton wool you’re using, too much and you won’t be able to push the nib back in, too little and the **pen** nib won’t be covered and will break through the cotton wool. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   02. Reassemble the **pen** (Image: © Olly Curtis) Reassemble the **pen**, screwing the top back on and then the bottom. It’s better to have the tip of the **pen** fully secure and leave a gap at the bottom, otherwise the cotton wool will cause a bit of an obstruction. You can always trim the cartridge if it's poking out of the bottom and the **pen** won't screw back together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Below we'll show you two options for how to make your own stylus. One uses a cotton bud/Q-tip while the other uses cotton wool. The first DIY stylus (with the bud/Q-tip) is a lot easier to make, but the second option with a metal-cased/tipped **pen** will often work better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   04. Dam**pen** the tip of your stylus Now you need to dam**pen** the tip a little to make the **pen** conductive. Dip the tip in water and squeeze off the excess, you only need the tip to be damp, not soggy, and you don't want to get water on your tablet. That's all there is to it. You now have your very own homemade stylus! If it stops working and is dry to the touch, you can try dam**pen**ing it again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   01. Dismantle your **pen** and cover the casing in foil (Image: © Olly Curtis) Start by dismantling your **pen**. If the case of your **pen** isn’t made from metal, cover the casing in tin foil and secure this with tape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   03. Reassemble the **pen** and wrap in foil (Image: © Olly Curtis) Once secure, screw the **pen** back together. Wrap the tin or aluminium foil around the **pen** making sure the foil is making contact with the cotton bud tip. Use some tape to secure the foil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Part of the fun of building this DIY stylus is that you can probably find everything you need lying around your home, or at least at the nearest shop. All you need is a **pen** (a ballpoint or biro **pen** will work fine, it just needs to have a removable ink cartridge), a cotton bud, Q-tip or cotton wool, tin or aluminium foil and some tape. It's really that simple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Please note that we are not responsible for any damage that you incur to either your **pen**, cotton wool, tablet or yourself. Be sure to watch your fingers and your tablet carefully while doing your DIY, and you should keep the homemade stylus well away from any ports on your tablet. If it all seems a bit too DIY and you want to treat yourself to an actual stylus, see our picks for the best iPad stylus and best Android stylus. We also have a specific roundup of the best Apple Pencil alternatives. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   02. Insert cotton bud tip into **pen** (Image: © Olly Curtis) With the ink cartridge now removed from the **pen**, push the cotton bud into the tip where the nib normally sits. This can be tricky, so you may need to play around with the size of the remaining stem of the bud. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   01. Prepare your materials (Image: © Olly Curtis) Remove the ink cartridge from your **pen**, leaving a hole where the **pen** nib would be. Take your cotton bud and cut diagonally about 100mm from the end of one of the buds with a pair of scissors or a craft knife (carefully!). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
