-   Founders of interior design studio Interior Fox Jenna Choate and Mariana Ugarte comment that, “When a client loves **purple** tones we usually suggest a soft mauve as it feels fresh and neutral. In a previous project we used a really cool mauve floor tile as one of our modern bathroom ideas to offset the soft grey tones found in the veins of the marble. Of course, a pale mauve or lilac also looks equally fresh, crisp, and clean, when paired with a neutral shade of white or cool-undertone shade of cream.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark **purple** also works well with bright or dark **colors** that contrast with it. Dark yellows often pair well with dark **purple**, as do bright reds. You can also pair dark **purple** with blue tones, drawing out the cool tones in **purple**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Ruth Mottershead, creative director of paint brand Little Greene, is an expert in paint and pigment for decor. Speaking particularly of lilac, one of - if not the - most popular tone of pale **purple**. “Soft pastel tones such as ‘Hortense’ and ‘Lady Char’s Lilac’ are a gentle and calming pale lilac tone," Ruth says. "You can use a pale lilac by itself in a room for a pale and pretty scheme, or, thanks to their powdery pale finish, it’s possible to be a bit more daring and match lilac with a deep plum or aubergine color of **purple** (such as Adventurer or Grenache) for an impactful yet intimate living room atmosphere.” When you see how striking lilac can look when applied with Ruth’s decor advice (see image above), it is very tempting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   When you see this warmer shade of grey in practice, Joa's advice to keep with a warm grey or neutral shade makes great sense. People often make the decorating decision that a cool shade of grey will suit a **purple** room, but often this leads to a room looking too cold and gloomy, especially if it’s already north facing with a cool natural light source, or has no natural light at all. So, go for a warm grey like Dove Tail or Skimming Stone if you’re looking to combine it with a **purple** tone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We love this vintage color combination. Great for professional services looking to give off a sophisticated and traditional vibe. These **colors** would complement any artisinal services, as well as restaurants and cafes with a more traditional feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The people who wear **purple** are self-assured confident people. They are independent people who care more about their self-satisfaction and the need to express individuality. Purple can be worn to express oneself or to attract attention. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   White is a classic, safe option to pair virtually any color – **purple** included. It adds a clean and soft finish and will pair well with any shade of **purple** you wish to match. Wear a **purple** top with your favorite white skirt or pants, or switch it up and pair a white blouse with **purple** bottoms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Culturally **purple** is often associated with wealth and royalty. This must have been because the Phoenician **purple** dye used in ancient days was very expensive and rare and only the rich could afford clothes colored **purple**. The great Roman emperors Julius Caesar and Augustus wore **purple** as a sign of their wealth and royal power. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, pairing **purple** with **purple** can be a creative and nice combination with the right choice of shade. The same shade paired with the same shade needs more work as you would need to make sure the accessories make up for the lack of diversity. A safe choice would be pairing a slightly dark **purple** shade with a lighter one (twice lighter) would be a good choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   **purple** color scheme incorporates yellow. Purple’s cousins, magenta and violet, are complementary to yellow-green and yellow-orange respectively.

-   Beige can be a natural color that some might consider boring. However, it’s one of the best **colors** for dressing up or down. It’s a perfect neutral, so lavender walls with a pale beige rug or sofa would look great in a room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In short, yes it does. In fact experts say a considered grey shade can go particularly well with a **purple** hue, allowing for a two-tone color palette to be used to great effect. It’s all about the undertone, and working with the **purple** tone, not against it. Essentially, to get it right you need to look for a grey which has a warmer and softer characteristic to it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black does not always work well with light **purple** **colors**, however. It can sometimes make light **purple** **colors** look washed out or make them appear gray. Use caution when pairing such light and dark shades together, and consider adding an element of white to the look to help keep the light **purple** from looking dull. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Shades of **purple** vary widely, and some are more appropriate than others for the changing seasons. Pastel **purple**s are popular in the spring, bright **purple**s in summer, and earthy warm-toned **purple**s in the fall. Winter is an excellent time for cool, blue-toned **purple**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purple’s complementary color is yellow because **purple** sits opposite yellow on the color spectrum. This means that citrus shades are the perfect balancing color contrast for **purple**. Look to yellow’s close neighbors, orange and lime green, for more color palette options that bring out the best in **purple**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Scientific evidence, however, points to a much clearer definition of both **purple** and violet. While **purple** is a mix of red and blue, violet is considered to be a ‘spectral’ color. This means that violet occupies its own place at the end of the spectrum of light and has its own wavelength as a result. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purple is a rebel among **colors** – the result of mixing two **colors** from the opposite sides of the color spectrum – Red and Blue. Red is a fiery, warm color, and blue is a calm, soothing cool color. When you mix these two **colors**, you get **purple**. Purple is not the most popular color on earth, but those who like this color are very, very loyal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **colors** seem to work with **purple** clothes, as long as you match undertones and shade intensities between the **colors** you pair.

-   Purple and dark blue is a seriously stylish color combination that has an element of mystery and visual drama.

-   Purple is often associated with royalty and nobility. It is mysterious and strong. Although **purple** pieces have experienced a decline in recent years, they are slowly getting the attention they deserve nowadays as **purple** pieces are slowly being introduced again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Working with the color theory wheel is the best way to start when choosing your logo **colors**.

Understanding the relationship between **colors** and how they interact on the color wheel is the key to successful design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light **purple** clothes go with many different **colors**, depending on your mood. White, beige, and gray neutrals are all good color options as long as they have similar undertones to the **purple** you are wearing. For a pop of color, pair your light **purple** clothing with light yellow, light blue, or dark **purple** options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purple clothes go well with **colors** like white, gray, beige, blue, or yellow. Purple is not limited to these **colors**, however, and can be paired in seemingly endless combinations. The key is to always match the undertones of your **purple** to those of the **colors** you pair it with, keeping warm tones and cool tones separate from one another. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Burgundy and mustard are another classic fall color combo. Although the pair might seem unlikely to work together, they are a warm, vibrant duo that complements each other well. Both are earthy **colors** that add a touch of elegance and richness to any room or outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, you can also pair **purple** and white in other combinations that aren’t evenly divided.

Alternatively, a white pantsuit with a **purple** blouse makes a striking combination for everyday office wear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wearing a **purple** bottom of any shade can help with expressing and emphasizing what you want to emphasize. And so, the choice of shade is also crucial. Here are some **purple** pieces you might want to try and explore. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Analogous color combinations are two to five **colors** that sit beside each other on the color wheel. These **colors** generally create a sense of harmony and balance. Analogous color schemes are often found in nature, where one color dominates and the others support its depth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can never go wrong with black. Whether it’s **purple** or another color, black can be a very classy companion. A **purple** dress can be paired with a black scarf and a pair of black rock boots or strappy high-heeled sandals. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our brains are hardwired to react to and remember color combinations. If you close your eyes right now and think of three famous brands, chances are you’ll be able to conjure up the company’s logo **colors** right away. Starbucks: green and white. Ikea: blue and yellow. FedEx: **purple** and orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purple works quite well with warm neutrals like tan and taupe and these **colors** really provide the right kind of contrast for **purple** to work in a design. A tan and **purple** combination will make the **purple** appear quite striking but also make it appear more elegant than it would with a zany orange, for instance. If the **purple** you are using is also darker and more of an eggplant, a **purple** and tan palette begins to appear more rustic and harvest, like a Fall food tableau. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When in doubt, one of the best and simplest way to use **purple** is to combine it with other bright and vivid hues like mint, bittersweet orange, bright blue, and yellow. A color combination like this is energetic, happy, and quite pop. Similar palettes are commonly applied in design work for children and also for music festival artwork and installations.

-   It’s all about the pigment and the shades that you match together in a decor scheme, and whilst stronger shades of **purple** and green might clash and look somewhat too rich and sickly, paler shades in both the **purple** and green spectrums look rather wonderful together.

Think Palm Springs chic and you’re on the right track if you want the combination to have a more contemporary vibe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Black works well with dark **colors** of **purple** since it can make these dark shades pop. This can make dark **purple** **colors** look more intense than they normally would against other color shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Farrow and Ball Color Curator Joa Studholme explains in more detail, “Grey works particularly well with **purple**, but you need to make sure that the grey has a warm base," Joa says.

-   It adds to your fashion statement quite relevantly. Pearl earrings and ear crawlers can go very well with a **purple** dress on a formal occasion.

The machine should also fit the theme if the wedding takes place in a retro style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll want to stick to a pure white color, however. Off-white shades can have yellowish tones, which won’t always work with all shades of **purple**.

To ensure that darker shades don’t overwhelm an interior, especially when used on wall or floor tiles, an ombre effect can be a fun and interesting way to add what I call ‘quiet pattern’ and instant visual interest to a space.” Damla says , “You can achieve this by choosing a plain tile, such as our Herringbone tile which is a narrow cement encaustic tile, and building up lines of tiles in varying tones from light to dark either in the same colour or mixing in complementary shades.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We hope that you must have found the inspiration you were looking for in **purple**.
