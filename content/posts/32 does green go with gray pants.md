-   Great for a smart casual day outfit as it is quite a useful color to style. Light Blue shirts with light grey colored **pants** give the wearer a smart-casual look fitting for sunny days. Or even you can suit up with a light blue button-down, dark colored tie, and long overcoat for perfect business attire on winter days. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   From cotton candy to bright rose, pink is a surefire complement to gray. Pale hues of pink are better for spring and summer while darker shades look best in colder months or for festive nighttime affairs. You can look perfectly office-ready in a light pink buttondown, charcoal gray **pants** and black or oxblood leather shoes. For dinner and an evening of dancing, go for a top in a more dramatic and romantic shade of pink such as fuchsia. The color will make your look pop even under a jacket. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remember to style up the rest of the outfit too, you don't just want to be concentrating on a gray shirt and what **pants** color combination to go with. Are you going to wear a jumper over the shirt, perhaps a blazer? Then what shoes are you going to wear? A pair of loafers for somewhere that's a bit more sophisticated, chuck on a pair of Chukka boots for a place that's a bit more casual. Even a pair of Jordans for a much more casual setting, there are a lot of options available to you to explore with Gray **pants** as they are so versatile in nature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Plus, if you are after a lot more of a casual look that's easy to pull off but it is a classic go to, then you can't go far wrong with a Gray shirt and the ripped denim jeans look.

-   There are many color options to go with for dark grey **pants** matching shirt ideas. You can choose white, black, or burgundy shirts for a perfect formal look. Or you can go with floral print, striped or pink colored shirts for a smart casual look. Grey is one of those color tones that goes well with almost all shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   With wool trousers and a v-neck – Green doesn’t get enough respect in men’s style, and the **green** merino V-neck here ties together the earthiness of the grey wool trousers and brown leather boots. You could go with a white shirt here, or a more casual look, but a blue twill or poplin dress shirt works just as well. The Lands’ End Year ‘Rounder is a dress pant, but you could wear this look casually. Sure it’s an elegant/refined kinda casual – not something to wear while hitting a dive bar with pals, but maybe something to wear when you feel like kicking it up a notch for your significant other? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You must be shocked to see this option in the top 10 list of grey color **pants** matching shirt outfit ideas. But, trust the experts! You won’t be disappointed by trying out this look. Grey is always deemed to be such a dark color but its combination with floral print is an eye-opener. The floral print texture and light tones of the shirt will look fantastic because of their opposing tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No, I’m not referring to traffic-cone orange. Instead, we’re talking shades like burnt orange, rust, or coral. The warm hues of orange spice up the cool undertones of the **green** color. When pairing orange and **green**, the key is using the same tone for both to create a cohesive look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For the office and for occasions on which you don't wish to stand out, wearing more muted, monochromatic or neutral colors works best. Monochromatic colors are the colors that are different hues of the same color on the color wheel. For charcoal **pants**, this means to go a shade darker (black), or a shade lighter (light gray). Neutral colors are those that can be paired with anything; a white or ivory shirt will work as well as a black or gray one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The fiery combination of grey colored **pants** with different color shirts makes it a very versatile outfit option in the fashion world. Grey is a color that is not always the first choice but never fails to make men stand out, regardless of the occasion. So, go and get yourself one of these grey color **pants** with a matching shirt and be ready to shine wherever you go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red and Purple. These complementary colors should make a good mask (and actually do look good), but wearing olive **green** with red creates too much of a Christmas look, and pairing it with purple often ends up too flamboyant and Joker-like. Both these color combinations can be pulled off, but I wouldn’t recommend them for the average Joe to try. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You will love the combination of black and white and a pop of color. I like lime **green** and it’s a great popping color against the soft grays. You can also try another shade of **green** if you like. Play with different shades of gray for an ensemble in this color combination. You can even go for black for more edge, but a dark gray will be a softer option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wear a fresh white shirt over your grey **pants** and adorn a blazer over it. The color of the blazer can be either black, grey or a light shade of blue, to correlate with the rest of the attire. Tuck your shirt in, to get the foolproof office ensemble. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whichever option you choose to wear, the colors that go with **green** are much the same. Neutrals like white, gray, black, and beige work especially well. But you can also try brighter shades like orange, red, and even other shades of **green**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can go two ways when wearing **green** clothes. First are the safe shades, those like olive **green**, army **green**, and forest **green**. They look good, but are nothing out of the ordinary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Then, of course, there is black -- a classic color to wear with charcoal gray. You can pair charcoal flannel **pants** with a black cashmere turtleneck sweater in the winter. In the summer, team charcoal worsted wool slacks with a matte black, cotton-blend dress shirt. These looks work for multiple occasions, including after-work gatherings, dancing and Casual Friday office wear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
