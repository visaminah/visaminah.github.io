## 36 Interesting Facts Type Of Wood For Window Sill | How to Make Window Sills & Aprons
-   Solid **wood** stair treds needs to be maintained with products intended for **wood** surfaces. We recommend LIVOS for oiled floors: For cleaning - pH Neutral Cleaner TRENA No.556, for maintenance - every 4th to 5th cleaning a wax containing GLANOS Cleaner No. 559 and for renewal - Livos Parquet Oil Refresher Nr.1899-002. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first thing to do is to check that there’s enough room in the wall framing to allow a larger board to be installed at the base of the window. The **wood** on the inside of a window frame is called the window jamb. This **wood** is usually 3/4 inch thick. The new window **sill** is 1 1/4 inches thick so there needs to be a 1/2 inch more space below the window jamb. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here at Reddish, we offer windows, doors and conservatories available in both hard**wood** and soft**wood**. This is so that you can find the perfect material for your needs. For more information please give us a call on 0161 969 7474 or send us a message. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our wide range of length, width and thickness combinations makes us the leader in high quality solid oak window boards. Even with our extensive range of window **sill** profiles, we understand that not all window reveals are the same, meaning the exact width and length combinations that you need might not necessarily be as per our ordering options. Unlike our competitors we don’t like to leave you hanging, which is why we offer a free cut-to-size service no matter which style and size of hard**wood** window **sill** you would like. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another great option for a **wood** window **sill** is maple. Maple is a strong and dense **wood**, which makes it a great option for window **sill**s that will be exposed to a lot of moisture and weather. Maple also produces a beautiful **wood** color that can stand the test of time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The thickness options offer a little more durability and a little more weight to the **sill**, but they also cost a little more. The finished product for a 3/4″ **sill** is 6″ thick, and the finished product for a 5/8″ **sill** is 8″ thick. The finished product for a 3/4″ **sill** is also the longest at 10′ or 120″. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In terms of prices, unplasticised PVC is easily the most inexpensive choice for a window **sill**, certainly when compared to hard**wood** such as oak or Meranti, almost all of which are derived from trees which are known to grow particularly slowly. Thus, hard**wood** is the material of choice for homeowners who are willing to choose premium materials, focussing on elegant, traditional **wood** aesthetics and immense robustness. For anyone that may prefer uPVC, the wide range of colours and decorative **wood**-grain foils allows the synthetic material to mimic timbers - in purely visual terms, at least. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ultimately, the main purpose of the window board is two-fold, depending on its place of installation. When mounted as an external **sill**, it is meant to protect the window reveal from accumulating rainwater and from constant exposure to sunlight. On the other hand, mounted as an internal **sill**, it must provide a homely ambiance and a safe place to put decorative items such as potted plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thanks to the complex internal fibre structure of hard**wood**, only aluminium can compete with this type of timber in terms of sheer strength and longevity. However, while **wood** generally needs to be re-painted regularly in order to protect it against water, timbers are able to minimise the effects of exterior damage much more easily than aluminium. After all, re-painting a hard**wood** window **sill** is much easier than re-anodising a metal **sill** after its surface has been scratched. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After the new windows were installed and the spray foam insulation was cut back, we can start to measure out the window **sill** board. Cut it longer than you need so it can be trimmed later to final length. The total length will extend approximately 3/4 of an inch beyond the width of the window trim once it’s installed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In a renovation where we were replacing windows, we decided to step up the finish detail by adding window **sill**s. We built a new fireplace mantel so we wanted something that would complement that character. We were replacing the existing windows so this was a good time to redo the window trim detail. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our straight or spiral **wood**en stair treads are made exclusively of solid **wood** - in this case mainly oak, smoked oak, rustic, ash, alder, birch, maple and reclaimed pine - and can be optionally, for example, oiled, stained, left in their natural state or varnished or waxed in different colours. Stair treads from LIGNAU made of real solid **wood** are therefore ideal for the daily stresses and strains of everyday life and thus set stylish accents with different types of **wood** and **wood** tones. Due to the effects of the weather, stair treads made of concrete, aluminium, steel, stone or plastic are the preferred choice for outdoor use, whereas for indoor use, **wood** materials or solid **wood** specifically treated for this purpose are mainly used for the production of stair treads (straight or spiral). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All timber used in window manufacture is divided into two categories; hard**wood**s and soft**wood**s. Despite their seemingly simple names, there’s more to a hard**wood** than being ‘hard’ and more to a soft**wood** than being ‘soft’. In fact, rather confusingly, some hard**wood**s can be incredibly soft, and some soft**wood**s incredibly hard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Window **sill** molds are 3/4″ thick, and finished products are 5/8″ to 3/4″ thick. If you are looking for a traditional window **sill** that is made of marble, then the standard depths are 4″, 6″, 8″, and 10″. The maximum length of a one-piece **sill** is 10′ or 120″. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are various types of Cedar**wood**, although the most popular variety is Western Red Cedar. As the name suggests, it has a reddish colour.

For the latter reason, it is commonly used for decking, building exteriors and outdoor furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mahogany is another popular type of **wood** for window **sill**s. Mahogany is a beautiful **wood** that is popular for furniture and other **wood** projects. It is a very durable **wood**, and it is also a popular choice for window **sill**s because it is able to resist moisture and weather damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Strong, durable and highly resistant to abrasion, Beech**wood** is often used in the construction of houses. It has a white to pinkish-brown colour and a fine grain so it looks very attractive. Beech**wood** is also commonly used to build a variety of furniture and household items. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main function of interior **sill**s is practical. They are primarily used for storage and display. Potted plants, photos, and decorations are the most common. Therefore, interior **sill**s are installed to be completely level, putting special emphasis on stability in order to create a safe place to put decorations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Soft**wood** makes up about 80% of the world’s source of timber. Versatile, high performing and durable, treated soft**wood**s are suited to the demands of a range of projects and applications. They’re also incredibly fast-growing and one of the most sustainable types of timber available. This makes them perfect for use in timber windows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Measure the distance between the two vertical sides of the window opening and add 6 inches. The longer length of the **sill** allows you to notch the outside edges to protrude or overhang the wall on either side by 3 inches. Start by measuring the width and depth of the framing on the inside. The **sill** should overhang the front edge of the window frame at least 3/4 inch, but feel free to add up to 4 or more inches to the depth, depending on how much overhang in front you desire – you can make it look like a small shelf if you like. As Addicted to Decorating discovered, miter cuts are seldom necessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adding an apron below the window **sill** does two things. It covers the gap between the **sill** and the drywall. It also visually balances out the look of the window trim. Find a nice profile from a piece of window trim or baseboard. The apron should line up to the outside edge of the window trim Above the window **sill**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Assortment: Wild oak - the **wood** shows a different **wood** tone and texture. The grading is marked separately, here with firmly grown knots, knots with small cracks and holes, possibly ingrown bark. Splint-free top side. See also product photos. The **wood** is solid oak. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ordering is simple. Select the length and width of oak window board the next up to the size you need and add a note during checkout of the size you need the **sill**s trimming to. It’s as easy as that, you’ll receive your newly machined **wood**en window **sill** board at the size you asked for within days. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to window **sill**s, there are two general types: interior and exterior. While an afterthought to most people, they serve very different functions. Interior window **sill**s, for example, will not need to stand up to temperature swings, driving rain or constant exposure to UV rays. Their functions differ based on where they are installed and include: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Find the center of the window and the center of the window **sill** board and line them up. The first cuts will be to remove **wood** to allow the window **sill** to fit into the opening and touch the new window. Mark the sides of the wall studs where you will cut the board. Measure the distance from the window to the front edge of the drywall in several spots. Using the shortest measurement, subtract 1/2 inch and use this measurement for what to cut off of the window **sill** to create horns – the pieces that extend beyond the window opening, as shown in the video. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One popular type of **wood** is oak. Oak is a strong and durable **wood**, and it is also a popular choice for furniture and other **wood** projects. Oak window **sill**s are able to resist moisture well, so they are a great choice for areas that are prone to mold and **wood** rot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hard**wood**s generally come from broad-leafed, deciduous trees such as oak, beech and mahogany. The thing that defines a hard**wood** from a soft**wood** is the presence of special pores in the cellular structure of the **wood** itself. Their complex cellular structure gives them a great dimensional stability and durability. Hard**wood**s are used in everything from musical instruments, boats, tools and of course, windows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Timber windows are constructed using timber joinery techniques. Joinery is the process in which two or more sections of **wood** are connected. In most cases, those constructing timber windows will not be the ones who fit them. Here at Reddish Joinery, however, we build and install a selection of excellent timber windows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Accoya is a specially treated soft**wood** that has incredible levels of performance. The acetylation treatment process which Accoya is put through changes the cellular structure of the **wood**, enhancing its durability and thermal performance. This process provides the **wood** with additional weatherproofing and even gives it insect-repellent properties! With an estimated working lifespan of 60 years, Accoya **wood** can easily last longer if well maintained. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the most famous types of hard**wood**, oak has been the premium material of choice for timber windows for centuries. In fact, some of the earliest windows ever constructed were made of oak. With a high dimensional stability, great thermal and acoustic insulation and beautiful aesthetics, oak timber windows are generally suited to heritage properties and traditional-look homes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After cutting the window **sill** to size, the last step is to shape the edge profile. In the video, this was done with a router and a table saw using an advanced technique. You can purchase a router bit to create a similar profile. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A local joinery shop should be able to machine up a length of hard**wood** cill to the correct profile. Although if the damage isn’t too serious cutting out and splicing/scarfing new timber would be much more desirable imo than disturbing brickwork etc caused by the renewal of the cill. Wood harder and filler can also work well to arrest rot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Level up the widow **sill** into position to measure and cut the window jamb parts. Assemble the window jamb and temporarily secure it to the window **sill** with screws, driven in from the bottom of the window **sill**. With this assembled and set in the window opening, you can determine where to cut off the window **sill** horns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since weather protection is unnecessary inside, the materials are chosen based more on appearance than toughness. UPVC variants can be customised using stone or **wood**-grain pattern decorative foils. Low maintenance requirements are common for all these materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If a window **sill** needs to be longer than 120″, it will be sent in two parts and have a seam. Window **sill** molds are 3/4″ thick, and finished products are 5/8″ to 3/4″ thick. If you are looking for a marble window **sill** that is thicker, then the options are 3/4″, 5/8″, or 3/4″ thickness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The application of new technical achievements in the manufacture of **wood**en products significantly shortens the order lead time and ensures impeccable quality. Special modern technologies of **wood** processing exclude the appearance of deformation changes arising from excess or too low level of moisture in the room. In order to increase the service life, **wood** is treated with specific protective compounds and septic tanks, which eliminate the possibility of premature destruction and "aging" of natural organic matter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
