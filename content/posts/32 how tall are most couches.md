## 32 Unexpected Facts About How Tall Are Most Couches | 13 Fantastic Couches for Tall People
-   This height is often the best option for **tall**er individuals as well because the knees are able to bend at an angle that is more comfortable. Shorter individuals may not be comfortable sitting on a high-backed sofa. However, lying down can be quite comfortable and a high profile sofa can be comfortable for sleeping on for shorter individuals. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sense and practicality is the last essential to consider for the sofa. If you have any family pets, a leather sofa is ill-advised as their claws may acciden**tall**y rip through the material. On the other hand, if you opt for a sofa that uses fabric, ensure you have a spot cleaner on hand for any unexpected stains that shouldn’t be vigorously wiped off with a cloth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The standard three-seat sofa size is about 84” (152cm) wide, 40” (102cm) deep, and about 33” (84cm) **tall**. Loveseats or 2-seat sofas are smaller, at 52” (130cm) wide and 33” (84cm) deep, with a height that’s about equal at 33” (84cm). Sofas are classical furniture pieces. Sofas and beds are the biggest furniture purchases among contemporary furniture. Buying the wrong set of sofa is just horrible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Webbing offers a more affordable and lighter-weight option to spring-based suspension systems, but you’ll be trading away the comfortable bounce that springs and coils offer. Some furniture upholsterers reject claims that any webbing is on a par with properly ins**tall**ed eight-way hand-tied springs in the durability department, citing the “price and skill” associated with its use. Webbing may work fine across a dining chair or armchair, but stretched across the expanse of a sofa frame, the straps may not be as durable as a sinuous-coil setup. It’s probably best to purchase this style of sofa only from a manufacturer with a warranty that covers the webbing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Keep approximately 16 inches from the edge of the table to the sofa and at least 28 to 30 inches to the TV cabinet or furniture opposite the sofa. A table should be two-thirds the length of your sofa for correct proportion.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If eight-way hand-tied spring suspension is the equivalent of a finely prepared eight-course meal, drop-in and pocket-coil spring suspensions would both rate as microwave dinners: quick, cheap, and ultimately inferior. Drop-in coils ins**tall** as a single self-contained grid of springs, and they tend to squeak due to the metal-on-metal configuration. Pocket coils, which look identical to those that go into innerspring mattresses, can deform over time because they don’t distribute weight as evenly, leaving an indentation in the seat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

If you have any family pets, a leather sofa is ill-advised as their claws may acciden**tall**y rip through the material.

-   There is considerable debate over which stuffing is best for sofa cushions. Many people like overstuffed **couches** or deeply cushy cushions.

-   Pay attention to making your sofa fit your family. For instance, a **tall**er person will appreciate deeper seating. If someone has bad knees, shallow seating and a tight back make getting up from a seated position easier. Households with pets or small children may prefer a sofa that's low to the floor; little ones can climb onto it with relative ease. If you have overnight guests frequently, a sleeper sofa might be a good option, especially if you don't have a separate guest bedroom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   High-resilient (HR) foam is a step up from polyurethane, making for a comfortable and long-lasting cushion. Some experts recommend a hybrid cushion of HR foam wrapped in down and feathers, combining durability and comfort. Costly **couches** often use goose down mixed with feathers, but you will pay dearly for this luxury, and the cushions will need to be plumped frequently. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your sofa table height should be equal to or a few inches below the top of your couch. If your sofa is an inch or two **tall**er that the table that is okay, but don’t go much over.

-   A **couches** height can be increased in many different ways. Fitting higher risers is a great solution. More DIY options include placing the couch on a raised platform, fitting castor wheels, adding additional pillows, adding a foam pad, or simply standing it securely on pavers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The springs that hold up the cushions on a couch come in three levels of quality. The least expensive (and least durable) options don't have springs and only use webbing or mesh. Avoid these **couches** if your goal is a quality piece of furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The size of your room and your comfort as well should determine the ideal height of the sofa. For instance, if your ceiling is 8-foot, you wouldn´t like to give the feeling that the ceiling is higher than it really is, that being said always pick a low-height sofa.

-   Stylish sofas or **couches** with high-quality materials can cost several thousand, depending on the designer or retailer.

-   If you are trying to determine which sofa option is best for your home, start by determining who is the **tall**est person in your household.

Meaning they are always guaranteed to fit through a door which makes it a stress-free and much more manageable experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Traditionalists extol the virtues of eight-way hand-tied springs. The time-consuming technique requires a furniture maker to strap and hand-knot individual hourglass-shaped coils with cord across the seat’s frame. When ins**tall**ed properly the hourglass springs supposedly ward off sagging and squeaking. But Alicia Engman, principal designer and owner of custom furniture maker Hammer & Heels, said eight-way springs are “overrated,” citing that they’re outdated and expensive to repair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This elegant mid-century modern inspired sofa comes in easy-to-clean linen fabric. The frame is durable and has solid wood pyramid legs in matching black. This is a great compact sized sofa for a small space that will work for a **tall** person. It has a 36" back and is a full 72" long. It has a total weight limit of 450 lbs, but that is split between the seat spaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sofa legs and feet are mostly made of wood, offering an opportunity to inspect a sofa manufacturer’s eye for grain and finish consistency. Check for uniformity in height and if the stain finish matches between feet and frame, and inspect each piece to confirm that it is securely fastened by getting down to the ground and giving each piece a pull, wiggle, and twist. Also ask if there are any unins**tall**ed feet available for closer inspection. Avoid sofas with legs attached directly into the frame with screws—they’re susceptible to loosening over time under the duress of shifting bodies. Instead, look for legs and feet attached using thick threaded hanger bolts secured with T-nuts, which you can easily adjust or replace. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
