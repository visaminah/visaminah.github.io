-   If the **paint** has dried then scrape off as much of it as you can.

They can cause skin and eye irritation, they can burn the skin as well as causing headaches, drowsiness, nausea, dizziness and loss of coordination if not used very carefully. Because of this, we recommend that you use our specialist Graffiti Go product which is a safe graffiti remover which has been formulated from the most advanced, innovative water-based technology not using any solvents, as well as being better for the environment than most other hazardous solvents. Also, be aware that some caustic chemical solutions can cause surface failures or can change the colour of your bricks resulting in long term damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Once you’re done removing the **spray** **paint** and repairing the damage caused by scraping your wall, re**paint** it. The **paint** sticks to the wall much better. It also creates a smooth finish and a natural appearance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Protecting your furniture should be your priority when removing **spray** **paint**. You can use different ways to remove **spray** **paint** from your furniture without damaging them. Below are the safest and easiest ways: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Which type of stain remover to use will depend on the type of **spray** **paint**. Since most **spray** **paint** is acrylic, use dish soap and vigorous rubbing to get as much of the stain out as possible. Next, use a dry cloth on the stain by rubbing it thoroughly. This will help remove more of the stain, while also driving the soap deeper into the fabric so it's more effective. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Aside from using a scraper, you can also use steel wool soaked in the stripper. This will help you remove every bit of **paint** residue that may be left in the wood. Soak medium-grade steel wool in a small amount stripper and use this in hard to reach areas. Old rags or abrasive scouring pads are also great alternatives. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Baking soda is another solution you can use to remove **spray** **paint** from furniture. Dissolve the baking soda in water and put it on fire to simmer. Pour it on the surface or dip the affected area into the pot. The solution will soften, enabling you to scrape it off quickly. Remember to use a blunt object to scrape the **paint** carefully to avoid damaging the surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Marker pen and permanent marker pen can be used by graffiti artists if they want a quick and easy way of leaving their mark. Permanent marker pens are often used in public toilets, on walls and doors, on play park equipment, mirrors, gates and paving and it looks horrible and unsightly. Even though it’s more likely to be a smaller area compared to graffiti **spray** **paint** you will want to remove it quickly and easily. Permanent marker pens are also often used by children around the home, on surfaces they shouldn’t have used it on and in these situations it can be devastating if your walls have been marked, a table has been drawn on or your sofa has been marked. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are trying to remove **spray** **paint** from wood floors, use a brush. Work the **paint** off in small sections by scrubbing with a stiff brush. Use mineral spirits or lacquer thinner to dissolve the dried **paint** and then rinse the area thoroughly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This will save you from harming the surface of the concrete. If you have opted to use **paint** thinner to remove **spray** **paint** from concrete, keep a towel handy to dab the area when the thinner gets to work.

-   For exterior siding, a pressure washer on a low setting can remove most of the **spray** **paint** without damaging the wall.

-   You may have to use strong-smelling or irritating chemicals to remove **spray** **paint** from some surfaces. Ensure that the room you’re in is well-ventilated.

Read and follow the safety precautions and disposal requirements on the product you’re using, and follow safety procedures if you use a ladder, power tool, or pressure washer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moisten a soft, clean rag with acetone. Rub the acetone-soaked rag over the spot to remove the rest of the **paint**. Switch to a clean part of the rag after each swipe to avoid reapplying the **paint** to the floor. Go over the area with a clean, dry rag to remove the residue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Butter Wet Carnauba Wax is another excellent alternative as it contains carnauba oils that will break down the **spray** **paint**. The wax won't scratch or damage the **paint** or clear coat on vehicles while effectively removing the **spray** **paint**.

Gently rub the area with a rag until the stain is gone. For mesh-type shoe fabric, blot the rag instead of rubbing it to avoid spreading the **paint** around. Use white vinegar, dish soap, and water with a rag on the soles to remove the **paint** without damaging the rubber. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A power washer or a pressure washer is a great cleaning tool for a variety of tough surfaces like concrete, and it also uses far less water than a regular garden hose. The power washer and pressure washer differ slightly in that the power washer uses heated water and pressure whereas the pressure washer uses only pressure to clean. As you might have guessed, the added heat from a power washer will be more effective when it comes to removing **spray** **paint** from concrete. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Act fast when you first spill the **paint** and try to clean it before it has a chance to cure. This will reduce the amount of elbow grease required to remove **spray** **paint** from concrete. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To remove **spray** **paint** you will have to peel it layer by layer. When **spray**ing **paint**, you tend to move the **spray** bottle up and down or from side to side to apply **paint** resulting in a layered application. You will be doing a lot of peeling and definitely scraping with this project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For dried-on **paint** on skin, soak your hands in warm soapy water before scraping the dried **paint** away with a plastic scraper. Soak again and use a scrub brush to remove the rest of the **paint**. Wash with soap and lube up with lotion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Once you have removed the **paint**, rinse the concrete with water and a sponge or, if you are outside, a garden hose will work too. If you have opted to use a wire brush, be very careful, as this could damage the surface of the concrete.

-   Pour your white vinegar on a clean cloth and smear it on your furniture. Ensure that you cover all the parts with **spray** **paint**. Allow it a few minutes to sit and dissolve your **paint**. Use a blunt object to scrape the **paint** off. Repeat the process until all the **paint** comes off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Industrial **paint** removers are concentrated and contain harsh chemicals. It is thus not advisable to use it on soft materials.

-   Another simple DIY method of removing **paint** from wood is by using baking soda. Similar to vinegar, sodium bicarbonate or baking soda is another versatile household item. It is widely used for baking, cooking, and cleaning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spray **paint** can be removed from wood safely and effectively with denatured alcohol. Spread the alcohol on the affected area using a clean cloth and then rinse it with warm water.

-   Some graffiti is pure vandalism, some is a bonafide creative expression and most is a little of both. Whatever the intention of the artist, however, graffiti turns a sedate wooden fence into a more-or-less garish visual attraction, and if the fence is unfinished, it isn't easy to remove. Graffiti artists usually use cans of heavily pigmented **spray** **paint**, and because it dries quickly, the pigment tends to remain on the surface of the wood. This means you should be able to remove most graffiti with a power washer, but you'll have to use sandpaper on whatever doesn't come off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sanding can work well on stubborn **paint**. However, be careful to apply just the right amount of pressure whether you are doing this manually or not. As it is abrasive, you can potentially damage your woodwork. Seek expert advice if you can, there is a proper way of sanding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Many objects will have crevices where it’s difficult to get the **paint** off. Let the Citristrip sit there longer to make it easier to wipe away the **paint**. Toothbrushes work great for these parts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this method, boil some water in a pot that you do not use for cooking. Then, add about a half cup of baking soda. Apply this to the **paint**ed wood and leave for 15 minutes. Once the **paint** is soft, you can start scraping or brushing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dried **spray** **paint** is removable from surfaces using various methods. Using industrial **paint** remover is one of the easiest methods. Spread the remover on the surface, allow it to dissolve the **spray** **paint** then wash it off using warm, clean water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the worst things that can happen to your property is vandalism. If people **paint** on your walls, you have to go through the process of re**paint**ing that section. That’s exhausting, but it’s nowhere near as troublesome as getting rid of vandalism on glass windows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can use acetone to remove **spray** **paint** from your furniture safely. Acetone dissolves **spray** **paint** by reacting with the surface molecules. Pour a large amount of acetone onto a piece of cloth. Apply the solvent to the wood surface. Ensure that it is a generous amount. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spray **paint** dries within minutes, so cleaning it up is seldom as simple as wiping it before it sets. Water-based **spray** **paint** usually cleans up with soap and water, but it’s less common. Most **spray** **paint**s are oil-based and require stronger methods of removal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Try vigorously washing your hands in warm water with mild soap. Sometimes fresh **paint** will scrub off.

-   We tried this lead test out on this dresser and found a mix of results. The white **paint** didn’t have lead in it, but the layers underneath did. (Paint used before 1978 most likely has lead in it.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How to Remove: For latex **paint**, rub with denatured alcohol and a clean rag. Oil-based **paint** requires mineral spirits. Wipe thoroughly with clean water and dry after the **paint** is removed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes home improvement projects go wrong and you end up with **spray** **paint** or **paint** in places you wish you hadn’t but there are ways of removing it. If you wipe the **paint** when it is still wet you can sometimes remove it but you need to be quick and try to do it so you don’t spread the **paint** further and then wash with warm soapy water. Quite often you don’t realise you have **paint** on your skin so it’s usual to have dried by the time you have seen it. Before you try to remove any **paint** always check the product’s packaging to see if it’s water or oil-based **paint** as this will determine how, and what products you should use to remove it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Goo gone Graffiti Remover is the ideal product to use for this process. Cover the affected area with a generous amount of the solution and leave it to sit for a few minutes. Use a clean cloth to clean the solution which will have dissolved the **spray** **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Try using a common **paint** thinner, WD40, lacquer thinner or acetone or even a light penetrating oil with a microfiber cloth. This often leaves grease on the surface and you will need a degreasing product to remove it. If this doesn’t work you can try rubbing it gently with steel, a bronze brush or light sandpaper. If you try to remove it this way, always be aware that the surface of the metal may get damaged in the process leaving it looking dull, scratched or discoloured. If none of these work, then you can try removing it by jet washing the surface but be aware this isn’t often a successful removal method. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vinegar also works the same way as acetone. It softens the **spray** **paint** to make it easy for you to scrap it off. For baking soda, dissolve it in water, simmer it, pour the water on the furniture, allow it to soften then scrape it off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A putty knife is an example of a **paint** scraper that should work to scrape off dried **spray** **paint**. Scraping off the **spray** **paint** involves taking off a layer of the **paint** under the **spray** **paint**. It means you’ll be stripping the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How to Remove: Loosen the **paint** with a stiff brush and a **paint** scraper. Vacuum up all debris, then apply a chemical **paint** stripper. Lastly, clean with a pressure washer to remove all traces of the **paint** stripper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ensure you soak a clean rag in any of the above products. Then, smear it on the dried **spray** **paint** for a couple of minutes. Scrub the acetone away when it starts getting loose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That’s why you should ensure the compatibility of your solvent product. After you’re done with this technique, make sure to give the glass a thorough cleanse. That way, the loose **paint** will wash away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using generous amounts of the solution when removing **spray** **paint** from your furniture is advisable. However, too many solutions can damage your furniture. The excess solution will also be difficult to rinse if left on the furniture. If left on the furniture, it may damage your furniture further. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using vinegar may be cost-effective, but it can be more time consuming than other methods. It may not be the best option if you can’t stand the smell of vinegar. This is method is great for small **paint** stains on wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most chemical removers won’t remove graffiti from limestone due to the graffiti’s pigment and the limestone’s porous surface. Just a small amount of **spray** **paint** will bond and stain limestone and you can often think it has been removed, however, it will show up in different light. A lot of chemical removers need the limestone to be jet washed to remove the chemical, however, intense pressure can damage the limestone surface by removing its protective top layer. Soda and sand-blasting are sometimes used to remove graffiti from limestone however these can cause irreversible damage to its protective top layer which will always be visible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Perhaps you’re wondering how you’ll get **spray** **paint** out of your wall. These six steps will help you get **spray** **paint** off the wall, ensuring it goes back to looking as good as new. We’ll also briefly discuss how to remove **spray** **paint** from other surfaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Knowing how to remove **spray** **paint** from brick or concrete is often necessary to combat graffiti. When removing **paint** from concrete or masonry, be sure to avoid acidic solvents. There are several ways to remove **paint** without causing damage to these hard but porous surfaces, and here are four to try below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spray **paint** is convenient, but it can be messy. We all know about the dreaded over**spray** and drips that can leave you with a coating of **paint** on unsuspecting surfaces. Worse yet, your home or business could be the target of unwanted graffiti. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can try using a pressure washer to remove graffiti coating from masonry but don’t ever use a narrow or small tip as it can etch the surface of the masonry leaving an outline where the graffiti was. Sand-blasting is another option; however, this is something you would need a professional to do and it can be costly. You can try using a wire brush or steel wool to remove it from masonry, however, you need to be very careful not to damage the surface. If these don’t work then you can **paint** over the masonry but be aware that you may think a couple of coats have covered it but if it’s a light colour it can show through eventually, or in certain lighting. Also remember, you will need to re**paint** the whole surface rather than just where the graffiti area is to ensure you don’t end up with patchy colours all over the surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For small amounts of over**spray**, gently rub on a few drops of acetone nail polish remover. Use caution, as the solvent will damage the car’s **paint** if you rub too hard. For a gentler solution, try dousing the area with white vinegar and wiping it off with a rag. If you have some lubricating **spray** around, you can try **spray**ing on small amounts and wiping it off with a rag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should remember that acetone-based solvents aren’t ideal for fiberglass cleaning. With that, you should try using **paint** remover at full-strength, rinsing it carefully to avoid deforming it. Depending on the graffiti type, you might need to work your way up on the type of solvent you’ll use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are easy home remedies that you can try to remove **paint** from wood. Each with its own benefits and disadvantages. These are how they generally work and what you can expect: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I actually chose to mix in a cream **paint** instead of a white **paint**. I wanted the wax to recreate the color of the raw wood before it was sealed. And I felt like the pure white would be too bright and too much of a contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With a **paint**brush, apply the **paint** stripper or solvent to the **spray**-**paint**ed areas of concrete. If you are using a **paint** stripper, let it sit for 30 minutes or longer. The **paint** may begin to bubble, which is a good indication that the **paint** stripper is beginning to lift the **paint** from the concrete. However, tougher **spray** **paint** may require a bit of persuasion, in which case use a stiff-bristled brush to scrub the area in a circular motion until the **paint** is removed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. Using a **paint** brush, spread the Citristrip over the piece in a thick coat. Follow the instructions on the Citristrip, letting it work for about 30 minutes. Test a section in 15 minutes. When the **paint** bubbles, you are ready to scrape it off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you’re through scraping the wall, it’ll be left with a bit of mess. Repair the mess you’ve made after scraping off the **spray** **paint**. Repairing it is as crucial as getting rid of the **spray** **paint** on your wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If there is still some **spray** **paint** left on the wall after you have scrubbed it with a graffiti remover, apply a layer of WD-40 to it. Let it sit for 20 minutes before wiping it off. It will loosen any excess **paint** and make cleaning it even easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spray **paint** will come off the furniture using the correct solutions and procedures. Safe ways to remove **spray** **paint**s include using acetone, alcohol, industrial **paint** remover, and baking soda, among other methods. You need to know how to use all the possible solutions since mistakes can damage your furniture. Knowledge about the nature of the material is essential to help determine the safest method to use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can try wiping the plastic with a light penetrating oil, again this will leave grease on the surface so you will need a suitable degreasing product to remove it. If it’s a small area sometimes a magic marker can remove the graffiti coating. We advise you not to use **paint** thinners on plastic as it can soften it, causing it to misshape, discolour or can result in a permanent stickiness on the surface. You can try **paint**ing over the plastic if neither of these options works, however, the best way to remove graffiti from plastic is by using our specialist Graffiti Go Product. Simply, apply, wait, wipe and wash off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s not just the **paint** but the surface. If you’re removing **spray** **paint** from a wall, make sure you use a product safe for the wall’s surface. You may need to research this one. Abrasive products can damage the wall’s finish, and some chemicals can react with wall materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your skin should be your priority when choosing a solution to work with. If you have sensitive skin, you must pick a mild solution to remove **spray** **paint**. A harsh solution may be dangerous and may harm your skin. You can also choose a **paint** removal that requires no use of solutions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Scrub the affected area with warm, soapy water in a circular motion. This should begin to loosen the **paint** from the surface. Then, rinse the concrete with fresh water and dab on the concrete with a clean towel to dry the area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The more porous the concrete, the better it is for the **paint** to penetrate and grip onto, as it increases the strength of the bond between the **paint** and concrete. However, this also means that the more porous the concrete, the more difficult it is to clean. Concrete that has been sealed can be a lot easier to clean, as the sealer makes the concrete less porous. Some concrete sealers have even been designed to resist stains. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blotting helps absorb the **spray** **paint** on the carpet. It’ll prevent further damage. You can also use a stiff brush on the area to help loosen any dirt or other materials that may be stuck in the carpet fibers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Maybe you were a little shy with the **paint**er’s tape, or maybe those pesky neighborhood vandals have been at it again. However it happened, unwanted **spray** **paint** can be very tricky to remove from concrete surfaces. This article will help you better understand the nature of these two materials, as well as guide you through the different methods of removing **spray** **paint** from concrete. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nail polish remover is another good alternative as it contains acetone which is very strong and very effective for **paint** removal. Simply soak a cotton ball with the nail polish remover, then rub the stain, which should easily remove the **paint**. Mineral spirits can be used in the same way you would use nail polish remover. It's not as harsh as the acetone in the nail polish remover, but whichever one you use, again be sure to wash the stained area clean with soap and water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The nature of the material making your furniture should determine the method you should use to remove **spray** **paint**. Some methods, such as the use of industrial **paint** remover, are harsh. Such methods are therefore not ideal for furniture with soft materials. Furniture with soft materials demands mild solutions to remove **spray** **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Make sure to soften the **paint** before scrubbing it off. Use a brush to remove the dried **paint** and residue. Finally, use a mild cleaner or soap to clean the area and achieve an even finish - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most importantly, time is of the essence when it comes to cleaning any kind of **paint** stain. While there are no guarantees you'll be able to completely remove a stain or get it out in time, you'll increase your odds by acting quickly and following some simple basic steps for **spray** **paint** removal. This article will review some of these to hopefully help you clean up nicely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the **paint** is stubborn, use a brush with soft bristles. Be careful not to damage your furniture in the process. Dipping the furniture in the pot or pouring the solution again if it fails to come off is safe. You should follow the same procedure until the **spray** **paint** comes off completely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should be able to find one at your local hardware store. A dust shroud links up to a vacuum cleaner to remove the dust while you work. Prevention is better than cure! Properly masking areas when **paint**ing can prevent **spray** **paint**ing accidents. Alternatively, sealing your concrete will not only make it last longer, but it will also make it easier to clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vinegar, acetone, baking soda, and denatured alcohol are powerful solutions that remove **spray** **paint** from furniture without damaging the finish. Use a clean cloth dabbed in any of these products. Spread the product on the furniture, focusing on the **spray**ed parts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The original plan was to give the dresser a fresh new layer of dark grey **paint**. But the old finish was in really bad shape. So we planned to strip off the old **paint** to give the new **paint** a good solid base. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your wall should appear brand new if you’re through with all these processes. If you had decided to apply **paint** on the **spray** **paint** on your wall without removing it, it would have taken many coats to conceal the **spray** **paint**. But, it would still be visible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many products in the market. They promise to remove **spray** **paint** and other types of **paint** easily. But not all work as advertised. Do a quick test first to ensure you’re using a product that will do the job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Prevention can save you time and money in the long run. Rain Guard’s Anti-Graffiti Coating is a very effective preventative coating that will make cleaning **spray** **paint** off concrete a lot easier, as the coating itself resists graffiti and will last for up to five years. This product is non-yellowing and therefore will not alter the look of your concrete surface. You can use this product on porous surfaces like concrete, stucco, and brick. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use a broad flat **paint**brush to apply the stripper. This way, you will be able to apply this evenly over the surface for the best coverage and the best effects. Brush the stripper in one direction only. Let this remain on the surface for 20 to 30 minutes. You will know that the stripper is working when you bubbling and warping of the **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Baking soda is the ideal DIY solution to remove **spray** **paint** from your furniture. It is safe for your furniture and your skin. It is also available in your house and does not require professional knowledge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spray **paint** out of a can creates a fine mist that can end up almost anywhere in the room where you’re **paint**ing. To avoid over**spray** and mistakes, cover everything nearby, including your skin. Wear protective clothing and a respirator when using **spray** **paint**. Use drop cloths and tape plastic or paper sheets over everything not being **paint**ed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Is the graffiti from latex or oil-based **paint**s? If so, make sure to get a stain-killing primer for outdoor use. After it dries, you can use methods to remove regular **paint**s. Consider investing in a sealer coat after you finish as a deterrent to future vandalism attempts. If the marks are new, try working your way up from the weakest solvent first. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   When using **paint** removers, remember to always practice safety. Working with these can get messy. Read the product label, instructions, and wear protective gear such as gloves and goggles. Improper use of chemical strippers can be hazardous. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Motsenbocker’s Lift Off Spray Paint Graffiti Remover comes highly recommended, as it works on a variety of hard, porous surfaces like concrete. It is also water-based, which makes it a great alternative to using nasty chemicals. This product is safe to use on a wide variety of surfaces and is effective at removing most **paint**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spray **paint** or aerosol **paint** is most commonly found in pressurized containers. The **paint** is released in a fine mist through a valve, applying multiple layers in fast succession. This is a much quicker technique than other application methods such as **paint**brushes or rollers. Spray **paint** also provides a more even coating and tends to dry much faster than other **paint**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the **paint** is hardened, you can try to soften it with a soft cloth or sponge. You could also use a mild detergent and water mixture if necessary. Once the **paint** has softened, you can carefully remove the unwanted material with your fingers or a cloth dampened in acetone (nail polish remover). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you have dialed in your pressure washer and selected the nozzle according to the manufacturer’s instructions, give the concrete a good blast. It is best to test it on an area of the concrete that is out of sight – from a distance at first – and then moving closer incrementally as needed. Move methodically and slowly from top to bottom in a sweeping motion. Continue going over the affected area to remove all the **spray** **paint**. A degreaser or a detergent can be used in conjunction with a power washer to help lift the **spray** **paint** from the concrete. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paint removers are also known as **paint** strippers and chemical strippers. These can be in the form of liquids, gels, or pastes. Since these are specially formulated to remove **paint**, these work more effectively than home remedies. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Regardless of how careful you are when **spray** **paint**ing, over**spray** is going to happen.

If you do need to remove **spray** **paint**, there are a few methods that can be used to remove it from your hands or skin, your clothes, glass, plastic, and even your car. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Detailing clay is another option to remove **spray** **paint**. Detailing clay is a polymer abrasive that will remove anything sitting on top of the **paint** on your vehicle, but won't scratch or damage the vehicle's surface. Before using, wash and dry the vehicle to remove any surface dirt. Using a piece of clay about the size of the palm of your hand, put it in a zip lock bag and set in warm water to soften it. Once it's pliable, knead the clay while flattening it to about the size of a pancake. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

This effectively abrades and smoothens surfaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   If the wood the graffiti is on is a **paint**ed surface or sealed with stain or a sealer then you can try removing it by wiping it with a white or mineral spirit.

If the wood has no protective layer and it is bare wood then you can try lightly sanding the surface, following the grain of the wood. Power washing can sometimes remove it, however, if it is softwood then it can take the top surface off and splinter. If none of these methods works then you can try giving a couple of coats of **paint** or stain to cover it up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Leaving the solution on the surface for 30 minutes before rinsing will allow the TSP to work its magic on the **spray** **paint**.

-   If the **spray** **paint** stain on clothes is still wet, quickly soak it in a sink to get the stain wet. Remove it from the sink and then begin blotting the stain to remove as much of the stain as possible. Do not rub the stain at this point. Doing so only pushes the stain further into the fabric while spreading it around. After blotting out as much of the stain, it's time to use a stain remover. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the **paint** is still wet then you should soak it up using an absorbent cloth, when you are doing this try not to wipe the **paint** as it will spread. When you have removed as much as you can with the absorbent cloth you could use a solvent like white spirit to remove the rest. White spirit has a patent smell and will leave a grease residue so you will need to use a degreasing solvent to remove it after. This removal process is time-consuming but our specialist Graffiti Go product will do the job quickly and efficiently without multiple treatments as well as being water-based, non-toxic making it much safer to use compared to other products. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

When the **paint** has lifted, you can wash down with warm soapy water. Using a **paint** remover will mean you will need to **paint** your whole garage door a couple of times, however, if you use Eco Solutions Graffiti Go it will lift the graffiti leaving your door looking as good as new. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
