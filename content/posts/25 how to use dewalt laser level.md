## 25 Tips to How To Use Dewalt Laser Level | Dewalt Green Laser
-   Warning! Laser Radiation Exposure. Do not disassemble or modify the **laser** level. There are no user serviceable part inside. Serious eye injury could result. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   DW088 DW088CG Light Source Semiconductor **laser** diode √ Laser Wavelength 630 – 680 nm Visible 510 – 530 nm Visible Laser Power ≤1.3mW (each beam) CLASS II (2) LASER PRODUCT √ Working Range 165’ (50 m) (with detector) √ Accuracy (Level) ±1/8”per30’(±3mmper9m) √ Indicators Flashing Indicator: battery low √ Flashing Laser: tilt range exceeded √ Power Source 3 AA (1.5V) size batteries (4.5V DC) √ Operating Temperature 20°Fto115°F(-10 °Cto45°C) √ Storage Temperature -5°Fto140°F(-20°Cto60°C) √ Environmental Water Resistant √ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The DeWalt 12V Green Cross Line Laser has what’s known as a “self-leveling” **laser** system. The guts include a pendulum system that literally floats the **laser** and keeps it in near-perfect level. The vertical and horizontal cross lines can be operated independently. You get +/- 4 degrees of play. After that, the level will flash to tell you it’s no longer accurate to level or plumb. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The DW088 **laser**s are precision instruments. Therefore, if the **laser** is not positioned on a stable (and motionless) surface, the **laser** will continue to try to find level. If the beam will not stop moving, try placing the **laser** on a more stable surface. Also, try to make sure that the surface is relatively flat, so that the **laser** is stable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We stock a wide range of **laser** levels, so whatever your line of work, you can complete jobs and projects with exact accuracy. If you’re after a beam **laser** pointer or a self-levelling cross line **laser**, we have the products you’re looking for. For those working on construction sites, the Dewalt green rotary **laser** kit may be the ideal option, including green **laser** glasses, battery, charger and toolbox. We stock both green and red **laser** levels, depending on your working conditions and working range. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the **laser** unit is heated above 120 ºF (50 ºC), the unit will not turn on. If the **laser** has been stored in extremely hot temperatures, allow it to cool. The **laser** level will not be damaged by pressing the on/off button before cooling to its proper operating temperature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since I had access to a standard tripod, using the included 1/4-inch threaded mount proved to be simple. This allowed me to mount the **laser** at the exact height I needed to level out our break room counter. Compare that to an alternative process—using a two-foot level and constantly checking and rechecking the small bubble vial. Instead, I got a nice bright line for the back of the plywood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2) It sure would be nice if it was brighter. I had hoped it would be an improvement over my earlier generation **laser** in this respect, but it's not. As I think about it, projecting a line beam over a wide degree range certainly requires more energy than projecting an equally bright dot, but it has made using it outside during the day a bit of a challenge. There is a $100 **laser** detector that you can buy for this thing that will allow using it over a much greater distance in daylight (the advantage of the DW88 vs DW87), and I'm waiting for one of the vendors I found who sells this detector to get one back in stock. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, if you need to strike a beam that’s not level, it can do that as well. If the **laser** is between 4° and 10°, the beams blink constantly to let you know. When you’re more than 10º, the green beams will give you a triple flash that repeats every several seconds. This is handy for when you’re laying out stairs or something where you need a line that’s not level or plumb. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The DeWalt DW088LG 12V Green Cross Line Laser runs off a DeWalt 12V MAX 2Ah battery. This is the same battery that runs DeWalt’s compact 12V impact drivers. Like the DeWalt red **laser** cross line products, an aftermarket AA battery adapter is available (but not included). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   A flashing red indicator light indicates that the batteries are low and need to be replaced. The **laser** may continue to operate for a short time while the batteries continue to drain, but the beam(s) will quickly dim. After fresh batteries are installed and the **laser** is turned on again, the **laser** beam(s) will return to full brightness and the red indicator light will stay off. (A flashing **laser** beam is not caused by low batteries; see Out of Tilt Range Indicator.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The DEWALT multi-line **laser** is a professional 3 way **laser** level accurate to +/-3mm/m. The level features 3 button controls, an adjustment dial for fine alterations and a battery indicator to make use as easy as possible. The DEWALT line detector helps find the levelling line, especially in places where detection would be difficult on its own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The housing on the DeWalt DW088LG has nice over-molding. While it looks cool, it’s not just for show. That housing gives the DeWalt DW088LG an IP65 rating. That means it can completely withstand dust, and it handles low-pressure water jets from any direction. You can basically use this $350 cross line **laser** in the rain without too much fear of damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may have noticed that the human eye sees green more easily than red. Then again, you may not—in which case just take our word for it! Just several years ago CST Berger would have been the only game in town for green **laser**s. Now, Bosch, DeWalt, Johnson Level, and others are getting into the game. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   s long as the **laser**s are properly calibrated, the **laser**s are selfleveling. Each **laser** is calibrated at the factory to find level as long as it is positioned on a flat surface within average ± 4° of level. No manual adjustments must be made. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The **laser**s are designed to self-level. If the **laser** has been tilted so much that it cannot level itself (average > 4° tilt), it will flash the **laser** beam (Fig. D). The flashing beam indicates the tilt range has been exceeded and IS NOT LEVEL (OR PLUMB) AND SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR DETERMINING OR MARKING LEVEL (OR PLUMB). Try repositioning the **laser** on a more level surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Stay alert, watch what you are doing and use common sense when operating a **laser** tool. Do not use tool while tired or under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or medication. A moment of inattention while operating power tools may result in serious personal injury. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This 3 Line Green Laser Level features a green beam for clear visibility on the jobsite. This **laser** features a second plumb line that forms a 90-degree intersecting line on the floor and ceiling, great for installing lighting or cabinetry. A built-in magnetic pivot bracket mounts easily on metal surfaces for added convenience. This **laser** also features a micro adjust knob for precise alignment of 90-degree intersecting lines over greater distances. Includes 3-Line Green Laser Level, ceiling bracket, 4 (AA) batteries, and blow mold case. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **laser**s are equipped with a 1/4” x 20 female thread on the bottom of the unit. This thread is to accommodate current or future DeWALT accessories. Only use DeWALT accessories specified for use with this product. Follow the directions included with the accessory. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The DW0860 Laser Wall Mount offers more mounting options for the DW088 **laser**s. The wall mount has a clamp 7 at one end which can be fixed to a wall angle for acoustic ceiling installation. At the other end of the wall mount is a screw hole 8, allowing the wall mount to be attached to any surface with a nail or screw. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So all that is to say that a child would find this an easy tool to use. It’s a great design. You’d think it’s impossible to screw something like this up, but we’ve seen cross line **laser**s (and similar products) with toggle function switches that cycle through modes. Dedicated buttons are far, far better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The DW088 **laser**s are equipped with a red indicator light 2, as shown in Fig. B. The red indicator lights are located to the left of the on/off buttons (3, 4). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With the **laser** off, place it on a flat surface. This model has two ON/OFF buttons, one for a horizontal **laser** line 3 and one for a vertical **laser** line 4. Each **laser** line is powered on by pressing its ON/OFF button. The **laser** lines can be powered one at a time or at the same time. Pressing the ON/OFF buttons again turns the **laser** lines off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
