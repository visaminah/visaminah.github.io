-   First, define the primary color for the base of your look. Typically, the base color is assigned to a suit, shirt, or jacket. From there you can then build out the rest of the **colors** from that base. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next up, is a fall outfit inspiration, including the color brown in a stylish way. For ins**tan**ce, you can go for a black flared skirt and a short grey blouse with a cropped leather jacket in a brown color. This figure-flattering combo works great when you wear it in the chilly weather. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This combination might be the most difficult but, at the same time, the most effective. Combining these **colors** in men’s clothing, you need to tread subtly. The same rule applies here as for the combination of red and blue, and you can limit yellow or red to small accent pieces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s imperative to combine **colors** that complements your natural complexion. After all, the main essence of dressing up is to emphasize your facial features from the practical side, making it more expressive.

-   As mentioned, you can team olive pants up with clothes that have yellow hues in them. Browns and **tan**s, for example, accentuate olive green’s earth tone. This is great for professorial outfits and outdoorsy styles. Think green trousers with a **tan** button-down and tweed jacket, or olive jeans with a brown flannel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   T-shirts in solid **colors** go a long way in making outfits! Of course you'll want at least one in black, white and gray, but also add pretty **colors** to the mix. Basic tees pair easily with all your other basics and non-basics. Have brown long sleeve T-shirts for the fall and winter and short sleeve for the spring and summer!

-   The advantage of neutral shades is that they can be perfectly combined with other **colors**. But don’t get carried away with one hue or a shade. Otherwise, the image can turn out to be too dull, unless monochromatic is what you’re going for. An ideal outfit consists of 2-3 shades, and keep in mind any more than that can lead to the opposite result. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you like the look and feel of wearing a neutral all over, then cream or white may be a better option. They are brighter **colors** and don’t have that ‘drab’ feel about them. I actually really love an all-cream or all-white outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s also much easier to combine monochrome **colors** than printed ones. And the closer the **colors** are in the color wheel, the easier they combine. For example, a base color and two adjacent sides are excellent solutions. And an even more effective move is a combination of shades located opposite of each other. But here, you need to be confident in your knowledge of color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **colors** pair so well together because of the high contrast between the maroon and white.

-   What Pants Suit Cream Color Shirt? The color cream has a wide range of matching **colors**, like khaki and black. A navy blue, pink, purple, maroon, black, or sea green color. If you are choosing cream pants for your dark shirt, make sure you select the right shade of red, green, or blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For ins**tan**ce, have a look at this double-breasted, blazer pant outfit. It helps you create an office-ready look with minimum effort. It works with the slick black formal pants and white blouse perfectly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Combine blues and greys to create a shirt that feels cool in tone. Because there are so many **colors** in the realm of blues and greys, and because we have so many types of blue and grey shirt **colors** to choose from, your possibilities are endless for this color combination. Design a blue and grey shirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Our Light Olive and Stone Grey both serve as fantastic backdrops for your neutral design. Design a shirt with neutral **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Layering, when done right, is an excellent way to build brown aesthetic outfits. A great idea is to pair different **colors** of jackets over simple brown outfits to add an eye-pleasing contrast. Black, beige, burgundy, and navy blue jackets make an appealing contrast with lighter shades of brown. Whereas pastel-shaded jackets go well with outfits in darker shades of brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What Color Goes With Sand Pants? The **colors** white, off-white, and brown complement beige chinos very well. Blue is also a good color to pair with the pants, from lighter shades to navy ones.

-   As always with tailoring, you’ll need to consider the cut (take it to a tailor), but the shade is just as impor**tan**t. If you want to go for a full suit, dark brown will get the most wear – and it’s not a flash-in-the-pan fad buy, either. “Brown has always been a classic choice in menswear tailoring,” says Danny Ching, a menswear designer who has worked at the likes of Aquascutum, Hardy Amies and Dunhill. “With new ways of styling tailoring, it has re-emerged amongst the countless grey and navy suits men continually wear to work, social events and weddings.” Timeless yet not overdone? That’s menswear gold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you like colorful dress shoes, just follow the color wheel rule and avoid red shades. Crimson suede monks pair well with gray trousers and a red tie, but would be too loud when worn with green pants. Whereas **tan** Norwegian shoes work perfectly well as pictured below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even before you buy a brown clothing piece, you should consider what **colors** match with brown clothes to make a worthy purchase. To create some feisty looks, go for fuchsia, mint, yellow, or orange shaded clothing with brown leather jackets. These outfits look quite peppy and are perfect for occasions where you want to give off spunky vibes. Depending upon the season, you can choose to wear leather jackets or jackets made with denim, suede, or polyester. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is impor**tan**t to choose the right shape of the nail for this shade - it is better to use it for short and flat nails to make them visually long. On long nails, such a manicure also looks good if you use as little decor as possible. You can combine khaki color in manicure with black, pistachio, white, gray, white, silver, beige shades. Although combinations are not limited to them - many girls wear bright and bold manicure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Particularly since brown tailoring is hard to mess up. “Brown is a rich, versatile colour that helps to enhance and enrich contrasting colours that it’s paired with,” says Ching. “Given its neutral underpinnings, it can be styled with virtually any hue, though it tends to work particularly well with shades of blue and green.” Also try tonal **tan**s and dark neutrals including black. And because brown is slightly more casual, it works nicely with knitwear when you want to dress your suit down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both blue and brown are relaxing hues which can create incredibly eye pleasing looks when paired together. While deeper shades of brown goes well with royal blue, navy blue, and indigo, light brown shades can accompany both dark and light blues. For ins**tan**ce, a combination of a navy blue printed chiffon top paired with brown leather flare pants looks amazing. You can wear a cream blazer and offwhite pumps with this outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   White and black aren’t the only options that can make a decent contrast with brown. You can also go for a **tan**, olive, beige, cream, or even gold shades to build graceful neutral outfits. Some grey hues also work well with brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The art of combining **colors** is a crucial nuance. After all, even the most expensive things can look ridiculous together and spoil the impression it’s meant to have, just like flashy, tasteless outfits. To avoid these mistakes, you need to master the basic rules of color combinations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best **colors** to combine with brown are gold, white, pink, yellow, green, and orange. Brown can also be combined with other shades of brown such as chocolate brown, **tan** and beige. Brown can also go well with navy blue or light blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Street casual style isn’t too strict, but minimalism prevails, so muted shades are preferable to bright ones. You can safely combine neutral and more expressive **colors**, for example, grey and burgundy. The most popular here will be blue, black, brown, and white to refresh the outfit as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For example, it could be a tie. Combining big things in two **colors** can connect a red polo shirt with mustard yellow, dark trousers. That could also be yellow shaded loafers and a red blazer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Stylish women with a knack for fashion emphasize on the do’s and don’ts of color ordination in their outfits and deem it an essential part of styling. It is a known fact that the **colors** of your clothes exhibit your personality. Also, not every color is meant for everybody, unless you know how to carry it with flair. For ins**tan**ce, not everyone is capable of making brown outfits work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By choosing different **colors**, textures of fabrics, patterns, you can add some variety even to the strict classic style of men’s clothing. Furthermore, many variations are permissible for modern business attire. But to look elegant in any situation, it’s necessary to combine **colors** and fabrics correctly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to get all #menswear on us though, it’s time for some brown sky thinking. Higgins recommends going double with your brown to give things a more trend-led feel. “Rev up some classic **tan** shoes by combining them with light brown tailoring. Seen from the likes of high-end designers such as Gucci and Camoshita to high-street giants Zara and Massimo Dutti, tonal brown looks are surprisingly easy to wear – just make sure your brown shoe is a lighter or darker shade than your suit.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Byczok also stresses the impor**tan**ce of using a variety of textures. “Even something as simple as adding a suede shoe into the mix can work wonders. I actually think there are a few fabrics that actually work better in brown. Suede, leather and corduroy, for example.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A colorful blouse with a peplum bottom will help you look stylish while you are out on a shopping spree. The blouse has a multicolored striped pattern on it while the denim shorts have blue, black, and white patterns on them. Wear sandals with these if you don’t want to overdo the **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What Color Pants Go Well With A Tan Shirt? You can’t go wrong with a **tan** shirt and black chinos, both of which are great must-haves for any menswear wardrobe. Finish this outfit off with black and white athletic shoes to show off your styling savvy. If you’re on the go, wear this **tan** shirt and navy jeans to prove your expertise in men’s fashion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Again, never wear green pants with red or anything in the red family. This includes pink, magenta, and salmon. You’ll also want to steer clear of **colors** that are too close to red on the color wheel. True orange with green is only appropriate on St. Patrick’s Day, just as primary red with green is only appropriate on a holiday sweater. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All those shades, from chocolate to cereal hues, mean that tonal outfits work well. “Tonal outfits are a great way to look fashionable without trying too hard,” says Byczok. “Try wearing a darker, chocolate-coloured suit with lighter shirt and **tan** shoes. Or, if tailoring isn’t your thing, try a darker brown shade pair of slim fit chinos with a camel coat and knitwear of a lighter shade.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown knitwear won’t just pair handsomely with your wardrobe staples – it can get a little more lively with the right treatment. “If you’re looking for a more trend-led way to wear brown knitwear, take a leaf from Mother Nature and team with moss green trousers to nail two of this season’s most impor**tan**t colours in one outfit,” adds Tarling. Stick on a pair of white lace-up sneakers and job done. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
