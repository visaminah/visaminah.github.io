## 9 Things You Should Know About What Color To Stain Cedar Posts | Minwax Stain Colors On Cedar Wood
-   Feeling like an expert on this subject, I have another important tip to make about **stain**ing Cedar wood . Most **stain**s are either Transparent, Semi-Transparent, Solid Transparent, or Solid wood **stain**s. The higher up you go with the list, the more solid content you will have in the product, thereby covering up the wood grain more. Going from the most natural being Transparent, showing the most Cedar wood grain, to Solid body **stain**s, covering up grains to non-existent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I get asked that 100's of times each year, can I **stain** Cedar. Having a natural, unblemished piece of Cedar wood, allows you to apply a various number of products made just for Cedar. The answer is yes you can, but be careful. The **stain** you put on this wood will soak in, changing the original color, leaving it tinted differently for many years to come. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best way how to keep Cedar wood looking natural is using the least amount of tint colorant particulates in a **stain** as you can. These **stain**s are of the Transparency line with any manufacture you are looking at. Most have a Transparency **stain** named Natural. However, don't expect your Cedar wood to look exactly the same as before, after **stain**ing. Especially if you are using an oil **stain**, as this will certainly darken the wood, until the actual oil has time to cure and dry back out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Having a clear finish for your Cedar, your best protecting oil **stain** is Linseed oil based. A **stain** having the most Linseed oil in it. There are many **stain**s out there to choose from, some with Linseed oil part of the **stain** formulation, some not. But the one that sticks out the most, having the highest amount of Linseed oil for a clear finish is Super Deck sold by Sherwin-Williams Paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best clear Cedar finish **stain** for outdoors is Linseed oil, hands down. Linseed oil is the primary ingredient in any oil finishes, which dries clear. You can find other clear water-based **stain**s, but will not last nearly as long as a Linseed oil based **stain** will. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Coming back to Denver, doing my research, looking at all the most popular **stain**s sold, the one that stood out having the most Linseed oil was Super Deck. Having used this product on my own outside deck, it looks just as good today, as it did almost 20 years ago. When you learn something on your own, knowing the best, you want to share it with others, which I'm doing here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using an oil natural **stain**, will darken the new Cedar wood, giving it an almost ''Wet look'' for many hours up to days or weeks. Again, if you are unsure of the intended appearance, I strongly suggest you test a smaller piece of Cedar wood first, using the **stain** you contemplating using throughout the wood project. Make sure the end result is what you are expecting, being as natural as you wish. Again, test the **stain** on a sample piece of Cedar first. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Back in 1999, I was invited up to Yellowstone National Park to participate in a walk-about with other potential contractors, looking over a painting/**stain**ing project the National Park Service needed. After looking over Lake Yellowstone Hotel, we moved to the other, looking over that one. The second project we needed to give numbers for was Old Faithful Lodge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When working with Linseed oil using rags to **stain**, you Must lay them out, hanging them up after use like on a clothesline. If not, the properties of Linseed oil will ignite within hours if rags are not laid out. I've personally heard of this happening on several occasions, with the person **stain**ing being unaware, unfamiliar of combustibility. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
