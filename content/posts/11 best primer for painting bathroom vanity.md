## 11 Things About Best Primer For Painting Bathroom Vanity | Paint Or Replace Bathroom Vanity
-   – a foam paint roller is excellent for getting a smooth paint finish when **painting** flat surfaces. Topcoat – General Finishes High Performance Topcoat is my absolute favorite sealer. It is easy to work with and gives a very durable finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – if needed to protect adjoining surfaces. Paint – I used General Finishes Milk Paint in the color Persian Blue. This is one of my favorite paints for **painting** both furniture and cabinets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With the floor and **vanity** done, I’m allllmost there! Next, I’m removing the mirror, replacing the light fixture, and swapping the shelves out. This means I’ll have lots of holes and drywall repair ahead of me. I figure I might as well prime and paint the walls so everything looks clean and even. I’m planning to use the same KILZ Mold & Mildew primer and then I’m going to paint the walls white (the color “Snowy Pine” by BEHR). Stay tuned for those updates in the coming week! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our second floor was added in the late 90s, so this bathroom is at least 20 years old…and it shows. The wood **vanity** has seen better days and the wood, itself, was not in the best shape. But instead of replacing the entire **vanity**, I wanted to give it a facelift on a budget and that’s where primer and paint came into play. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – I used in the color Persian Blue. This is one of my favorite paints for **painting** both furniture and cabinets. High quality paintbrush – These are my favorite paintbrushes for getting a smooth finish on cabinets and furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As with most **painting** projects, there’s a lot of prep work that you’ve gotta do before you get to the **painting**. We will be using this **vanity** every single day, so I wanted to make sure we ended up with a finish that lasts and lasts. So don’t skimp on the first few steps and rush right to the **painting**…take your time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The primer dried in an hour (so fast!) and I was ready to start **painting**. I used BEHR PREMIUM PLUS Paint in the color “Starless Night” in a satin finish. Be sure to buy roller covers that are meant for **painting** cabinets. They’re smoother and will leave a nice finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Last week, I showed you our new stenciled bathroom floors. Because of that project, our guest bathroom was already looking 10 times better and it motivated me to keep going with the improvements. Next up? Painting the bathroom **vanity**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I mean, can you even?! It’s crazy how different the room looks after these two quick projects. It only took me one day to paint the bathroom **vanity** and it was so worth the time and effort. That old wood is now gone and the new look is sleek, clean, and fresh! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is actually the first time I’ve ever hand painted cabinets. Can you believe that? We sprayed our office built-ins, so I never got a chance to paint the wood with a roller and brush. It’s something I’ve always wanted to tackle and I was excited to learn how to paint a bathroom **vanity** for this project. I learned a lot along the way and have plenty of tips and tricks to share. Let’s dive right in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Primer is essential for any good **painting** project and I chose KILZ Mold & Mildew primer for this. It’s a water-based primer, sealer, and stain blocker designed for humid environments. This bathroom sees a lot of action with Finn showering here and Rory taking her baths in here, so I knew I would need to use the right product for this moisture-filled space. By using this as a base on the **vanity**, it ensures that the paint won’t peel and I’ll have a finish that lasts…no matter how steamy this bathroom gets! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
