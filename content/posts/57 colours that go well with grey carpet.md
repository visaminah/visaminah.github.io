-   If you’re wanting to go for something a little more neutral, choose any rug that’s a lighter or darker shade of **grey**, black or white. Don’t be afraid to experiment with patterned rugs in these **colours** either. For a truly cosy and warm feel, go for a shaggy rug – ideal for both living rooms and bedrooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re lucky enough to have industrial elements to your home, leave them in! For example, exposed brown beams add a whole lot of character to a room. And **grey** and brown is a timeless colour combination that won’t date. You can also add touches of yellow and mustard for colour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **grey** TV cabinet can be the real hero of your living room. A detailed design, like diagonal timber slats, adds detail to the room, in keeping with the geometric design of your cabinet. A **grey** armchair would also fit right in next to a **grey** wall. And metallic touches can bring brightness to the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Team a **grey** carpet with luxe velvet upholstery in mink – it’s perfect for styling a boutique hotel look and will set off your best sofa perfectly. Try a **grey**-on-**grey** (or self-stripe) carpet or rug, which enhances that smart feel. Keep the seating area to within the surface area of the rug, almost making a room-within-a-room space that’s cosy and inviting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **grey** carpet will allow you to experiment with wall colour without having to change your flooring – it’s such a great neutral base that can run throughout your home, taking on a different feel depending on the wall colour it’s paired with.

Pink and **grey** living room ideas are another winning colour combo, and pink walls will work brilliant with **grey** underfoot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Warm **grey**s have a yellowish undertone, while cool **grey**s may have a pink or blue shade. It's easy to spot the difference.

-   With so many shades of **grey**, you certainly don’t have to stick to just one and in fact, by using a few different shades it will add dimension and layers to it.

-   If you want a romantic and sweet home, then try a sweet orange as your main color palette. Orange is all about joy, fun and optimism, and it brings creativity to a calm environment. The orange lines, which are both decorative and cleverly guide the movement of the interior, inject a touch of fluidity and vitality into the entire home.

Being honest with yourself is preferable to wasting time thinking about **colours** that you'll probably end up disliking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grey carpets are a style staple these days, chic and practical especially for busy households with kids and maybe pets.

-   Carpeted floors are renowned for their insulation and comfort qualities, so placing a rug on a carpet may seem like overkill. However, while your carpet does allow for a warm and welcoming room, your carpet should play the part of a decorative feature. Placing a rug on a **grey** carpet has the potential to transform sections or even the entire room (depending on both the room and rug’s size) and become a focal point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have an exposed concrete wall, don’t be afraid to embrace it! In fact, it can actually add a whole lot of character to your **grey** living room.

-   Upgrade or Startup: Which Is It For You? To begin with, if you're moving into a newly built house or remodelling from scratch, you may have a few more alternatives and paths to explore than those wanting to change the carpet while keeping existing furniture and wall **colours**. While there are lots of carpet **colours**, designs, styles, and patterns available for practically every house design, beginning from scratch provides you with a clean slate to work with. However, when it comes to carpet, wall **colours**, furniture, linens, and decor, it might be difficult to know where to begin. If you haven't decided on any interior design elements yet, we advise selecting a general colour scheme and a furniture sample or piece before deciding on the floor and then painting.
