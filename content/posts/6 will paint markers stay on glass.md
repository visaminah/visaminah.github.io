## 6 Interesting Facts Will Paint Markers Stay On Glass | Sharpie Oil-Based
-   This might seem like an oxymoron since acrylic **paint** is water-based and enamel **paint** is oil-based, but it’s actually more of a best of both worlds situation. Acrylic enamel **paint**s bond to a wide variety of surfaces—glass included—and form a hard shell that helps ensure your color stays in place. Acrylic glass **paint**: This type of glass **paint** is purely acrylic-based, but it’s different from your standard acrylics, which don’t readily adhere to the smooth surface of glass. Look for acrylics that are specifically intended for glass and tile, since these have chemical additives that allow the acrylic base to stick to a non-porous surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What type of glass **paint** you use will depend on a few different factors. Markers, for example, are great for fine detailing, but not so great for the type of surface coverage that you might want if you’re **paint**ing on glass jars or vases. Meanwhile, solvent-based **paint**s can produce stunning results, but they’re not ideal if you’re glass **paint**ing with little ones or somewhere where you don’t have great ventilation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best types of brushes for glass **paint**ing are soft-bristled and pliable varieties like acrylic or watercolor brushes. Foam brushes in a variety of sizes and angles are also good to have on hand. Applicator sponges: In addition to brushes, you may choose to use sponges as well to apply **paint** to glass. This provides you with a different visual texture, though you’ll still want to use brushes for achieving complete coverage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This type of glass **paint** is purely acrylic-based, but it’s different from your standard acrylics, which don’t readily adhere to the smooth surface of glass. Look for acrylics that are specifically intended for glass and tile, since these have chemical additives that allow the acrylic base to stick to a non-porous surface. Solvent-based **paint**: A fancier name for oil-based **paint**, this type of **paint** contains high levels of organic compounds that bind to glass better than their traditional water-based counterparts. You’ll get a super-saturated color with solvent-based **paint**, but keep in mind that these **paint**s are more toxic (and much harder to clean) than acrylics. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes. Use a rag dipped in warm water to soften the **paint**, then gently scrape it away using an old credit card. (A putty knife will work too, just be careful not to scratch the glass.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Knowing how to seal **paint** on glass is just as important as using the right supplies. If you want your **paint** to last for the long term, use a permanent variety of **paint** or coat your finished piece with sealant. Go with a gloss finish instead of matte, since this will provide you with a better finished look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
