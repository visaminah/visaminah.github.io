## 31 Fun Facts Printers That Can Print On Thick Cardstock | Laser printer that can handle 17 cardstock
-   A lot of print manufactures will proudly tell you how fast their printer can print. And that's great if you need to print a lot and are up against the clock. But what is the best printer for **cardstock**? This is quite often overlooked in product descriptions and it can be frustrating to find that your brand-new printer will only print on 90gsm paper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not always! If your printer tray is underneath where the paper comes out, then the card will need to feed through the rollers, and the card will need to bend almost in half to get through the printer mechanism. This means that the printer rollers will need to grip onto the card firmly so that it doesn't slip. The excess pressure caused by the thicker weight card means that a lot of **printers** just can't do this. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's safe to say that having a good printer is essential for the small business owner, and for crafters, makes things a lot easier. The first thing you need to consider is what you will use your printer for. Perhaps, like me, you'll use it for a bit of everything, or specifically, perhaps you want to know the best printer for 300 gsm card? Maybe you're looking for a greeting card printer or a good all-rounder and the best printer for **cardstock**. Maybe you're after a small craft printer that can print photographs for your scrapbook pages? Whatever the reason, we've got you covered. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 2 Select the appropriate paper type from the “Paper Handling” or “Tray Settings” menu on the printer’s menu panel, if applicable. On some **printers**, pressing the "Checkmark" button opens the menu, and you can use the arrow keys to navigate to the appropriate submenu or scroll through a list of choices. The Checkmark button also functions as the “Enter” key to enable any selections made. If your printer doesn’t have a menu panel, disregard this step. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Brother MFC-J4340DW Printer is a (relatively) compact A4 printer, scanner, copier and fax machine all rolled into one. It takes up to 150 sheets of paper in the main tray, but also has a manual feed for speciality papers and **cardstock** as well as a 20 sheet automatic document feeder. You can also print directly from USBs, which is a brilliant feature for crafters (picture all those Create & Craft USBs stuffed full of digi papers). This printer prints on **cardstock** up to 220g/m2 (grams per metre squared, which is another way to write GSM), as well as glossy paper and photo paper, and envelopes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To get around this, some **printers** have a second feed at the back. This is often just a flap that can be folded down, where you can manually feed the card through, one sheet at a time. Having this second feed at the back of the printer means the card does not need to bend in half to get around the rollers, and therefore can be gripped better by the printer mechanism. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Print quality and ink is a big one. 300dpi (dots per inch) at 2480 x 3508 pixels is the recommended print resolution for printing on A4, so you will want a printer that can handle this. If you're looking at A3 **printers**, then at 300dpi again (remember, its dots per inch so you do not need to double this to 600dpi when printing at A3) you'll want a printer that can handle 3508 x 4961 pixels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like laser **printers**, copiers have fixed paper trays and can only handle thin papers. If you try to use construction paper in a copier, it might deposit debris on the internal parts, resulting in jams, poor-quality copies, and even damage to your copier. Because of that, you should avoid using construction paper in a copier machine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Laser **printers**, on the other hand, have fixed paper trays. That means they’re not able to adjust for thicker papers. As a result, laser **printers** can only handle thinner papers, such as copy paper and laser paper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like we often say, to hoover something – when we really mean vacuum, it’s not unusual to hear someone say they’re going to xerox something when we really mean to photocopy. Founded in 1906, Xerox has had well over a century to establish itself in our language. And so, included in the line-up for best **printers** for hot foiling, is the Xerox B325 multifunction printer. If you want to do away with computers altogether (I definitely feel like that some days!) and want to create hand-drawn hot foil projects, then all you need do is photocopy your creation with a laser copier like this one, and the copy will be ready to be foiled. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Inkjet- Inkjet **printers** use tiny nozzles to spray ink onto the paper. This liquid ink will soak into the paper and may need some time to dry to avoid smudging. Inkjet is the most common form of home printer, and responds well to most paper types, but may not work, or work as well, on certain coated and reflective papers where ink is not readily absorbed and can easily smear and smudge. Inkjet **printers** are especially successful at printing on textured card stocks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Find the paper size that you want to print on. Some **printers** have different paper sizes that can be used in different combinations like 8×10 inches, 8×12 inches, and 8.5×11 inches but you’ll need to find the paper size that you want to use as well as check if it’s available in your printer’s selection of printable media types. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can use construction paper in a printer, but only if it’s an inkjet printer. Laser **printers** and copier machines don’t work with thicker paper. If you try using construction paper in a laser printer or copier, the paper could get stuck and jam the machine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This black and white machine prints onto a variety of different media types, including plain paper, **cardstock**, transparency, envelopes, thick envelopes and more, so you can foil away without worry. And of course, it hooks up to your computer too, via ethernet or wireless if you do want to print out digital designs to use with your hot foil machine. It also scans and faxes as well as all the usual functions you would come to expect from an established brand like Xerox (although it does not offer automatic double-sided scanning). It comes with a pre-installed starter cartridge with a yield of 1200 pages. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can print on **cardstock** paper. Cardstock is commonly used for prints, invitations, and greeting cards. Most **printers** can handle **cardstock** without problems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You want to try and get high-quality **cardstock** paper. That’s because thicker paper requires different settings and you might need to set your printer up for it. That’s why it’s important to know that not every printer is capable of printing on **cardstock** with an inkjet printer - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Technology has advanced a lot since the turn of the millennium, and **printers** are no different. Most now offer wireless connectivity and automatic software updates as well as computer-free printing via smartphone and USB connectivity. If you have a new mac without the USB ports or are planning to use it with a tablet or smartphone, then a wireless printer is the way to go (or you'll need to get a USB adaptor). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Laser- Laser **printers** use a toner cartridge filled with powder and heat to create a virtually waterproof, plastic-like ink that sits on top of the paper. (Flush with the paper. Words will not be raised.) Unlike inkjet ink, laser ink does not soak into the paper, so it is dry right away and allows for printing on some surfaces that inkjet cannot print on such as metallic, pearlescent, and reflective paper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Check if the printer supports thick paper or **cardstock**. If it does, then you should be able to use construction paper. If not, you’ll need to use a different printer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can put any type of paper in a printer. But, that doesn’t mean every type of paper will work well. For example, construction paper is too thick for most **printers**, so it’s likely to jam or produce smudged prints. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This A4 card is 220 gsm in weight, which is an ideal weight for going through your printer. It's sturdy enough to feel luxury, but not too thick that it can't get around the rollers. There are 50 sheets in the pack, and it's good value for money. There are over eight thousand reviews for this **cardstock** on Amazon, most being 4.5 or 5-star - check 'em out! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Printing on **cardstock** with an inkjet printer doesn’t always work. Even if your printer is capable of printing on **cardstock**, the quality of your paper might be too poor for a good print. If you want to print on **cardstock** with an inkjet printer, you should try and find a high-quality paper stock that’s specifically designed for this purpose. Most **printers** are not designed to handle thicker papers, so it’s important to avoid them when printing on **cardstock**. Here are some tips on how to get the best results when printing on **cardstock** with an inkjet printer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thicker paper -- such as matte paper and **cardstock** -- is generally more durable than plain paper, which makes it a good choice for printing documents and images that will get a lot of use. In businesses where instructions need to be printed for specific devices or rules lists need to be hung up, thick paper is an especially good option. Laser **printers** and inkjet **printers** both support printing on thick paper. Before printing with your laser printer, configure the paper type setting in the print options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We hope you've enjoyed our round-up of the best **printers** for card making. Card makers could think about investing a Cricut machine with the help of our guide. If you're after more tech gadgets to help you out in your crafting, check out the best drawing apps for iPad, the best drawing tablets for beginners or the best daylight lamps for those long winter nights. If you are wanting to try making some cards by hands, be sure to check out these lovely paper cutting templates. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To get the best results when printing on construction paper, it’s important to use the right ink. For most **printers**, that means using dye-based ink. Dye-based ink is designed for use on absorbent surfaces like construction paper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What type of printer do you need for foiling? If you're looking at using your printer for use with hot foiling systems, then you'll want a different printer altogether - a monochrome laserjet. As you're foiling your designs, you'll be covering up the ink with foil. So, although you can get colour laserjet **printers**, I do not recommend them for hot foiling. It's much more economical to go for a good monochrome (black and white) laserjet printer that prints onto card. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I'm looking for a printer that can print on thick **cardstock** paper. Printer must be sub $200. I found this but I see no mention of it in the details or manual. In general I'm having difficulty finding one. Suggestions? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Speaking from the perspective of an artist and designer, most creatives are less interested in how many pages a printer can spew out in a minute and more interested the quality of the print, and what type of card it can print on. It may seem obvious, but the main thing you want to look for (aside from budget) is whether or not it can print on **cardstock**. If you do a lot of hand-drawn art that you want to scan in (and perhaps sell as prints for a side hustle), then you'll also want one that has a scanner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can not use inkjet **printers** for foiling, as the ink on your printed page needs to react to the heat of passing through your foiling machine. The ink in inkjet **printers** is not heat-reactive, so you'll need one that uses laser printer ink for the foil to stick to. This is why the paper from laserjet **printers** feels nice and warm when it comes out of the machine! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you put thick paper in a printer, it might jam or damage the printer. Most **printers** are designed for use with thinner papers like copy paper and photo paper. If you use construction paper, **cardstock**, or other thick papers, your printer might not be able to handle it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   HP **printers** can handle a wide variety of media types, including card stock. In most cases, you can feed card stock from any paper tray you wish. The key to successfully printing business report covers, posters and other items on thicker paper stock is to select the appropriate media type before sending your job to the printer. When you indicate a media type, the intake rollers adjust to accommodate the paper, reducing paper jams and increasing print quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
