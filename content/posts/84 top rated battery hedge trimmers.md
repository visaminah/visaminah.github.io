-   Trimming your **hedge**s is an essential part of maintaining a tidy-looking yard . Whether you're growing boxwoods as a low foundation **hedge** or larger shrubs as a screen for backyard privacy , there are plenty of tools available that make **hedge** trimming much easier. Since there are so many **hedge** **trimmers** on the market, with gas-powered, corded electric, and cordless options, it can be tough knowing which ones to go for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Weighing in at under a kilogram, this compact **hedge** trimmer is the best cordless **hedge** trimmer if you want a lightweight option, making it a good bet for gardeners with mobility problems or arthritis, or those who tire easily. Unlike our first two picks, it’s not big **hedge**s that let this handheld trimmer shine – rather, it comes in extremely handy for shorter **hedge**s and more detailed work, such as keeping shaped boxes looking sharp. With its ability to be use single-handed, and its petite quick-charging battery, it’s a handy option to keep around for smaller jobs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another factor to consider is handleability. Choosing a model that is too heavy or is not well balanced will make the trimmer very difficult to use. You also want to look into the handle and the type of trigger. For example, safety triggers are good, but can be tricky to use while maneuvering the trimmer. If you are not able to use the **hedge** trimmer correctly, it will affect more than just your strength, but the performance of the trimmer as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1. Bosch AHS 50-20 Lithium-Ion Hedgecutter Best cordless **hedge** trimmer you can buy: with a powerful and protected blade, this **hedge**cutter lets you get the closest of shaves Specifications Best for: Thick **hedge**s Battery or petrol: Battery Battery life: 50 minutes continuous cutting Power: 18V Weight: 2.5kg Blade length: 100mm Today's Best Deals View at B & Q (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at ManoMano UK (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Really powerful + Blade tip protector for a close cut Reasons to avoid - Charger is huge - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

It's quite a bit heavier than the Bosch, though, which is why it's not our top pick. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The tradeoff, however, when you step up to a heavy-duty, long-bar trimmer is anywhere from a pound to two pounds of increased weight. That may not sound like much, but you can definitely feel it on a hot day, particularly if you’re kneeling down or bending. Unless you’re trimming a wide **hedge** with access only from one side, use a trimmer with a bar that’s 22 to 24 inches long. For wide or very tall bushes, use a trimmer with a bar 26 inches and longer. Note, again, that increased bar length adds to trimmer weight and to the cantilever effect produced when you trim with your arms extended. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   These tough tools, which generally require both oil and gas to run properly, tend to work harder than their electric counterparts.

Electric **hedge** **trimmers**: Though they don’t provide quite as much oomph as gas-juiced models, electric **trimmers** are usually lighter, making them easier to wield at chest height or higher. Lower-priced corded models offer uninterrupted use but less mobility because they’re plugged into an outlet—a potential problem for larger yards if the gardener doesn’t have a lengthy extension cord. Cordless **hedge** **trimmers** use a battery to allow total freedom of movement, as long as the batteries are recharged or replaced regularly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The WORX PowerShare 20” **hedge** trimmer is number 7 on our list. This 20-inch dual-action steel blade is very lightweight and compact. It is perfect for the novice **hedge** trimmer.
