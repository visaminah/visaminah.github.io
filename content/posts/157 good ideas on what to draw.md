Then, add two pointed shapes for the ears and a curved line for the mouth. Next, **draw** two long lines for the neck and four legs. Finally, add some scales to the dragon’s body and wings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you’ve learned how to **draw** Mickey Mouse, consider moving on to more of the popular Disney characters, which you can find online tutorials for as well.

You could also learn to **draw** Mickey Mouse as just a face and then add on the body from there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

This is understandable, especially if you’ve developed your art skill quite a bit. We’ve compiled a list of some of the most creative things to **draw**, you can find them listed below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To **draw** a house, start by **draw**ing two parallel lines for the house’s base. Then, add a triangle on top of the lines for the roof.

We’ve chosen each of these **ideas** to give you the perfect mix between fun, inspirational and challenging. You can choose to use the list in any way you like. Here are some recommendations: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rainbows are easy to **draw** and a great excuse to pull out the colored pencils. An easy way to remember the order of the colors is the acronym Roy G. Biv: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drawing with your child is a great way to entertain them. Use the above **draw**ing **ideas** to jump-start the process and get them thinking creatively. Not only will they love engaging in these **draw**ing activities, but they’ll learn valuable lessons like fine motor skills and problem solving along the way! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just imagine water as a series of layers. The base is only graduated tone and the rest is added in stages, one upon another. You **draw** the main shapes and lift out areas as you go. That’s the simplified explanation, but it’s essentially how you do it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I love the simplicity of this leaf. Simply pick up a leaf from the ground and use it as a reference for your **draw**ing. Of course, you can also use this picture for reference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you have an outline on your paper in regular pencil, you may be tempted to go right in and cover them with dark charcoal lines. But this is the opposite of what you want to do. In reality, you will want to shade the background first, then go back and create the smaller, darker details. You’ll want to start with the darkest parts of the **draw**ing first, then continue with the lighter details. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you love the look of water color paintings, but don’t have the time to actually watercolor, water color crayons are the way to go. You **draw** with these just as you would a regular crayon but then go over with a water filled paintbrush. This blends the crayon lines together to create a nice watercolor effect without all the hassle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To use the Tombo effectively you need to sharpen the tip by slicing the end with a craft knife. The sharp edge will slice across the paper and make a line. It works most of the time. If you make a mistake you can **draw** over it and start again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When your mind is dry on **ideas**, it can be difficult to get the creative juices flowing again. Professional artists recommend zooming in on one detail in a room and starting there. You might just be surprised by what you find! For example, instead of sketching a room as a whole, commit to sketching one certain aspect like this artist did on Design Bolts when they just focused on the eye of their subject. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It teaches you proportion and perspective. If you’re interested in **draw**ing as realistically as possible, focusing on the human form is an excellent idea. You can focus on particular areas of the body, bodies in motion, facial expressions, clothing, and the proportions of the body as a whole. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can use it to learn about spaces. Think of each box as a **draw**ing in its own right. Draw the contents of each box and the big picture gradually appears. It’s like a puzzle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you’ve mastered the Jiggly Puff above, it might be time to try something slightly more difficult but still very easy. Follow these instructions on Classy Wish to try your hand at sketching the cutest snake you’ve ever seen. The curved lines you **draw** here will be very similar to those you use for Jiggly Puff, but you’ll definitely want to attempt this with a pencil so you can erase it and try again as you go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, for a more technical approach, you can **draw** using a grid to get precision results. I use this method to **draw** hyperrealistic **draw**ings. It is by no means essential, I use it to play safe because I **draw** commercially. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you find the cruise ship above to be too challenging, you might want to take a step back and try this next easy thing to **draw**, a simple sail boat. You can follow the instructions on iHeartCraftyThings, but basically you will start by **draw**ing the bottom of the boat and continue from there. This is a great **draw**ing to personalize as you go by adding design to the base of the boat or the sail as you please! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes when searching for something easy to **draw**, you need to revert back to inanimate objects. These can be easier to create because you don’t have to worry about them looking alive.

And if you are still struggling, they even have a printout you can use to guide you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And if you are still struggling to get excited, go back to **draw**ing life. Draw your favorite insects buzzing around. Try **draw**ing a butterfly, that’s tougher than you think. You have to **draw** it well enough for the lack of color not to matter, plus you have to get the symmetry right. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Practice **draw**ing fur, or hair, by **draw**ing them in the direction of growth. Don’t **draw** parallel lines, make sure they cross each other at random. Add stray whisps of hair to add authenticity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Well, if you’re a beginner, **draw**ing from a reference is necessary. You need to learn how things from reality transfer onto the page. You need to analyze proportions, perspective, and light. However, you can’t become overdependent on images and spend your life copying other people’s art. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remember to choose the right **draw**ing exercise for your particular skill level. If you choose something too difficult, you’re going to become frustrated and disheartened. If you choose something too easy, you will get bored and hinder your advancement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Try printing out a photo of anything your child is interested in. Maybe their favorite vacation spot, their favorite animal, their favorite car — anything can work.

This activity gives children a starting point if they’re not in the mood to create something from scratch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many beginners freak out at the prospect of **draw**ing water. There really is no need to get anxious. Drawing water is nowhere near as hard as you imagine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Endless subject matter and endless room for error. In many ways learning to **draw** landscapes is a way to build your confidence early on. Practice **draw**ing trees, if you get that right the rest should be easy enough. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   These **ideas** don’t require much explanation. You can choose from the list and find references online or in real life. And hey, there’s no reason adults can’t try these. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s a reason that kids are always doodling cartoon characters, and this is because their unusual body shapes are much easier to **draw** than humans. For example, try your hand at **draw**ing Jiggly Puff because you will just need a circle for his body. Then you will simply add things to the circle to add additional features like his ears and feet. Don’t be afraid to start with a pencil and erase until you have an adorable Jiggly Puff like this one on Do it Before Me. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Art is not easy, if it was, everyone would be making money as an artist! But this doesn’t mean that you can’t want to improve your artistic abilities.

-   Crayons, colored pencils, charcoal, oil pastels, markers. Use whatever **draw**ing medium you have on hand! Add paper and a kid and voilá, you have art in the making. Note: the underlined, orange text is a link to learn more about the art idea. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   It is helpful to look at familiar subjects and **draw** them in counter-intuitive ways. Negative spaces are the spaces around, and in between, an object.

-   Let’s finish this list with a few training exercises. Let’s start with learning to see in a different way. Drawing what you see and not what you know is the key to success.

To get an idea of what something symbolistic could look like, take a peek at this **draw**ing on Our Art World where hands are depicted as holding the earth and everything on it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mermaids are a popular choice among easy **draw**ing **ideas** for kids. To **draw** a mermaid, start by **draw**ing a round shape for the head.

Finally, add some details like hair and seashell clothes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not only are hand-**draw**n family portraits a nice **draw**ing prompt, they make great gifts as well! Work with your child on **draw**ing everybody in the family.

-   When blending charcoal in your **draw**ings, it can be tempting to use your fingers to get the job done. This is a bad idea though, because not only does it create a mess on your hands, but your hands also have oils on them that can affect the way the charcoal looks. Instead, you will want to grab a paintbrush, some tissues, or a specific charcoal blending tool for use with your charcoal **draw**ings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Colored dot prompt (JDaniel4's Mom). This is so fun and is an extension project for the picture book, An Orange in January. Essentially, kids paste a large colored circle onto a paper and use it as a **draw**ing prompt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you live near the sea, **draw** the beach or the cliffs. Draw them in the landscape. Forget about close-ups, **draw** the vista and the sea in the distance - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   For those that haven’t noticed yet, charcoal supplies can be a bit pricey. And thus, you will want to not use them until you are ready to fill in your **draw**ing.

This will make it easier for you to make adjustments as needed, as well as save your hard-earned dollars! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Drawing on a mirror is fun for kids because it’s so much different from what they’re used to.
