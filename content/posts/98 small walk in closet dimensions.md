## 98 Tips for Small Walk In Closet Dimensions | Walk-In Closet Size For One Person
-   The #1 problem most people are ‘stuck with’ in their current **closet** are fixed hanging rods in the wrong location. As we talked about earlier, they’re set too low for double hang sections and too low for an efficient amount of space above the top shelf. This lack of adjustability results in ‘**walk**-in dead’ spaces. This equals a screwed-up **closet**. This is blunt, but true. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The new **walk** in **closet** size would be 113″x117″ (or 9.42’x 9.75′, almost a perfect square!). We’ll be gaining 33 square feet (!!!) for the new **walk** in **closet** interior by walling up the second **closet** access point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Closets have come a long way in the last hundred years. In the early 20th century, many homes had very small reach-in **closet**s, if any at all. People didn’t own many articles of clothing. A generation or two later, **closet**s were bigger but still not very impressive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Single Shelf-and-Pole: To accommodate long coats and dresses, a section of Single Shelf-and-Pole should be installed in every **closet** (**closet**s for children are often an exception). To keep dresses and coats from dragging on the floor, install Single Shelf-and-Pole at least 66 in. from the floor—take the measurement from the bottom of the shelf (that puts the pole at about 64 in. from the floor). For exceptionally tall people, increase the height to keep long clothes off the floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   (bulbs between 4000K up to 5500K) in order not to change the color of the clothes or change the combinations when dressing. If there is also a mirror in your **walk**-in **closet**, surround it with low-energy light bulbs. They will allow you to perfectly illuminate your outfits while you measure them to choose them, like a real atelier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A custom **walk**-in **closet** is a room in all respects. It helps you because it facilitates season changes, but it can become a delusion if it is not organized to the millimeter. You may find yourself not knowing where to put your things. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even for a smaller **walk**-in **closet**, a window can add a wealth of natural light and airiness to the space. But if you plan to use the space as a dressing room, a beautiful window is a must. The soul needs light to thrive, after all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Today, most people have a lot of clothing, shoes, and other wardrobe items. Homeowners want elegant storage solutions to accommodate their needs. A **walk**-in **closet** is usually the minimum requirement for adults’ and children’s bedrooms today. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So, what are the dimensions of a **walk**-in wardrobe? How do you design one for your home? What layout should you use to make the most of the space available to you? We’ve answered all these questions and more in this comprehensive guide. If you’re looking to install or renovate a **walk**-in **closet**/ wardrobe in your home, be sure to read through our advice first.

Give us a call today! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When organizing a master **closet**, it’s best to make the most of all the space you have. This usually means, you’ll want plenty of storage. We suggest aiming for a bit more storage than you think you’ll need so that you don’t run out of drawers, hanging space, or shelves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wall hung **closet**s (ones which are mounted onto the wall) are nice because they use less material and are budget friendly. Their primary drawback is they can’t be as deep as floor-based **closet**s. Therefore, they hold less. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Top Shelf: The top shelf should run completely across the **closet**, and around all three walls in a u-shaped **closet**, so the same 84-in. height determines the second or top shelf over a Single Shelf-and-Pole, too (see diagram, above). In most 8-ft. **closet**s, 12 in. of space remains between the top shelf and the ceiling, which is enough room for shoe boxes, hat boxes and other storage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When thinking about **closet** layout, determine what types of storage you want to use and where it best fits the space. If it is a two-person **closet**, for example, you may want to create parallel features on each side. Hanging racks, cubbies, and drawers that match on the left and right. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Costs depend on several variables. Dalla superficie, dai sistemi utilizzati, dai materials, from the internal compartments. An average price is around 1500-2000€ for complete structured **closet**s. There are inexpensive solutions with sticks in aluminum and drawers at much less. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   DO NOT repeat the mistakes of **closet**s past. Don’t design hanging space which butts against hanging space in the corner. This creates a ‘Bermuda Triangle’ corner (although I’m not sure a triangle can also be a corner…but in this case it just might be true). Solve this problem with the design strategy below. Put shelving on the wall adjacent to the hanging. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **closet** has a minimum width of 13’ | 4 m with adjustable depth to fit diverse floor plans. Clearance aisles of 36” | You must maintain a .91 m around the central peninsula. Further maybe with the choice of integrating additional doors that connect to a master bathroom etc. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A split layout is a **closet** with more framed walls separating the **closet** into two or more sections. These dividers create "islands" within the **walk**way that can be used as display space, shoe racks, storage baskets, or clothing racks. This type of layout offers the most storage variety because each section has its own hanging rods, shelves, and drawers. These wardrobes are also known as "two-door" **closet**s because two entryways can be used to separate the **walk**way into multiple sections. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Five or six years later, I was glad when the custom home business came back with a roar. But I wouldn’t trade what I learned from those 200-plus unit buildings, not a bit of it. Our approach to every high-end custom job—from the big ones to the little ones, and our profit margins—still depends on the lessons learned from production work. And installing **closet** shelving is a perfect example. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A starting point to sharing a **closet** (without concocting a plot which will land you in jail) is creating a ‘Mason/Dixon’ line separating his and her (or her and her or his and his) spaces. This dividing line can be a section of shelving or drawers. That way you can at least keep your side neat. And if you want more ideas to make the most of shared **closet**s read Storage Wars: 7 Essential Tips to Win the Battle of the His and Hers Closet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **closet**s use the back wall of the **closet** along with the side walls to maximize storage space and are specifically designed to enhance the storage space. You can shape these as L shaped or U shaped layouts. Here, two or three consecutive sides of a central clearance space take up the storage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The key to solving this problem (irrespective of whether you use a wood, laminate, or wire shelving system) is adjustability. Make sure your rods and shelves can be moved up and down. This gives flexibility to change your **closet** layout and use every inch of space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lighting: Decide if you want to use lighting in your **closet**, how much light, etc. Also, check that there are electrical outlets nearby. If you plan on using full-length mirrors, that will also need to be accounted for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you have a bare minimum, average **closet** size, huge, or oversized **walk**-in **closet** included in your home’s blueprint, each set of dimensions is easily maximized with the help of custom **closet** design. Any “stock” **closet** blueprint, no matter how large, isn’t living up to its full potential. With the addition of perfectly fit shelves, rods, cabinets, and shoe storage, you can transform any size **closet** into the functional space your expanding wardrobe needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As it is in any project, you’ve to understand what you are getting into and why. Identify your needs first. This will guide you well towards shaping the end product. If your storage needs do not run high, there is no point in going for a **walk**-in project. Similarly, if you don’t have enough space, getting a **walk**-in **closet** will be counterproductive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   People think corner shelves look so nice. And I’ll grant you they do look nice. However, here’s 3 reasons you need to do without corner shelves…especially in a small **walk**-in **closet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’re trying to balance what you need vs. what you can afford in your **walk**-in **closet**. However, it’s hard to know how to get costs down so you can afford to do the job. Well, here’s simple Closet Economics 101 you need to know. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unless you’re wanting to include a chaise lounge or are simply dedicated to having space to twirl on the hardwood floor in sock feet, that space is essentially wasted. One way to remedy this first world problem is to center your custom **closet** design around a center island. You’ll gain valuable storage space with drawers and cabinets as well as another useful work surface– perfect for folding clothes, planning outfits, or displaying knick-knacks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **closet**s are usually 1.8-2 m (6-6.5 ft) wide and can vary in design and depth based on your needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The only shelf in a **closet** that won’t align horizontally with other shelves is the Single Shelf-and-Pole, because it’s set at 68 in. from the floor. The 16-in. space between the Single Shelf-and-Pole and the top shelf can be divided again by an additional shelf, which creates a perfect location for a few pairs of shoes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When researching a **walk**-in **closet**, you have LOTS of questions. After all, this isn’t something you do every day. And this is why you can (and should) ask lots and lots and lots of questions. Whether you’re getting assistance from a professional **closet** designer (like me or one of my staff… sorry about the shameless plug) or trying to find somebody who knows anything about **closet** systems in the aisles of a big box store, don’t be afraid to ask questions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In case you plan to add double hanging rods to the **closet**, align them at around 40 and 80” on a vertical wall. Similarly, you should consider a 3’ **walk**ing space as the ideal standard. If you are looking for additional dressing space in the **closet**, 4’ is perfect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This standard **walk**-in **closet** layout involves two long walls of parallel hanging space, with one short wall at the far end. This room couldn’t exactly be described as “generous,” as plenty of spouses discover when attempting to maneuver during the morning rush. Whether you’re dividing the room lengthwise between partners or you’ve come up with some other configuration of wardrobe elements, it’s easy for this space to become stuffed. An experienced **closet** company is your best bet for transforming this space without adding even more clutter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Idea 3 – If you want a fancy system, two-tone your **closet** – Most **closet**s are white not only because they make dark **closet**s brighter, but also because white is the cheapest color to buy. If you want a little style, without getting too crazy with your budget, opt for a two-tone **closet** like below. It’s fashionably fun, at a budget friendly price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Size: The size of your **closet** is also very important. You need to make sure that you have enough space from one end to the other and from the top of the **closet** to the floor. According to our guide, a standard **walk**-in wardrobe should be at least 61 cm (24 inches) deep and 183 cm (72 inches) long. With this much space, you'll have plenty of room to store all your clothes and other belongings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We’ve designed hundreds of these long rectangular **walk**-in **closet**s in the past year alone. Our clients are usually excited about including open shelving and double hanging rods that will instantly multiply storage volume. If our clients want drawers included in their design, the short wall is the perfect space—it prevents drawers on opposing walls bumping into each other (or you) in the middle of the **walk**way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most wood and wire **closet** shelves are 12” deep. And while these shelves work OK if you have small feet and you’re storing shoes on them, most people aren’t using their shelves for small shoes. They’re using shelves for bulky jeans, sweatshirts and sweatpants. These bulky clothes hang over the edge of 12” shelving. They make your **closet** look messy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A single-sided is the smallest master **closet** size. Your perfect single-sided master **closet** is at least 4 by 5 feet. A standard-size single-sided **closet** has storage space on one side. It’s considered just big enough not to be regarded as a reach-in **closet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With good design control and a story pole, a single carpenter can lay out all the **closet**s in a typical home in less than one hour, and even make a cut list, too. Whenever possible, we try to keep linen shelves the same width, so they can be cut in packages. The same with Double Pole arrangements, especially if there are several **closet**s of roughly the same size. That way, only one special measurement needs to be made in each **closet**. But I’ll save that subject for another day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For this **closet** type, you need to utilize your space reasonably. Half of your space can be used for hanging your clothes, while the other half is clearance space. The remaining room should be enough to **walk** in, access your clothes, and dress. Here are some **closet** organizer ideas that will help you make the most of your space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many people feel like their **closet**s are too small or that they're not laid out very well. If this is the case for you, don't worry, you're not alone. Many people have trouble with their **closet** layout, especially when it comes to maximizing the space they have. There are many factors to consider: dimensions, shelving, storage, and more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First off, there are two types of **walk**-in **closet**s: Standard and Custom. A Standard **closet** is just that: standard. It's the most common type of **walk**-in, and it meets the minimum size requirements. However, a Custom **walk**-in is any **walk**-in **closet** that doesn't fall into the standard measurements. It's a little more high-end and can be designed to fit your exact preferences. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Seating areas, counters with coffee machines, wine bars, charging stations, etc. can be incorporated into your **closet**s, depending upon your lifestyle. The idea is that you can make the **closet** need-savvy. You do not have to restrict it to the role of showcasing a wardrobe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Focus on storage elements that organize everything in the best ways, like drawers and baskets. These elements are also apt at making the most of the limited space in the **walk**-in **closet**. You should opt for a design with a narrow floor plan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **closet**s are usually 1.2-1.5 m (4-5 ft) deep and occupy about 61 cm (24 inches) of total depth, and this leaves 91 cm (36 inches) of space from the back wall to the edge of the door as a **walk**way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your **closet** design can either be C-shaped or U-shaped. If you are going for a C-shaped wrap-around, you will need extra space since the storage stretches to the door wall. So you can work with a minimum dimension of around 11 by 7 feet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No matter how high-end a home, the **closet**s always share a lot in common—at least the ones outside the master bedroom. After all, there are only so many possible configurations. The three most common types of shelving arrangements are (see image, above): Double Pole, Single Pole, and Linen Shelves. We try to include a little of each in every **closet**, and we use 15 1/2 in. dividers to separate and help support the shelving. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As plenty of DC-area townhomes and single family residences were designed with these small and square **closet**s, we’ve grown very comfortable making this kind of space uber-functional. We usually recommend our clients install multiple banks of double hanging rods, especially if they’re splitting the **closet** between his and hers. Also, more than anywhere else, it’s important that you install shelves all the way to the ceiling to maximize wall space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But the best value from your luxury **closet** will be the enjoyment you get from having a beautiful place to store your clothing and accessories. Living in a cluttered, messy space is stressful. Having adequate space for organization and smart design brings peace of mind. Especially when you tailor the space to meet your specific needs and desires for luxury. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can tweak some details to fit your taste. For instance, if you have enough floor space, you could add a sitting area in the middle of the **walk**way. You could include a dressing table on the back wall, as shown in the example above: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Walk-in **closet**s come in three common dimension ratios: small and square, long and narrow with double hanging space, and large with an overabundance of free **walk**ing space. Each of the three layouts comes with its own challenges. Homeowners get to know firsthand the quirks of their particular **walk**-in **closet** size and are often shocked and excited to discover that there is a way to improve the functionality and flow of these often-neglected rooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You attempt to put up the third section. You step back and start spewing ‘French words’ even Old Man Parker from A Christmas Story hadn’t uttered. Your modular **closet** section is landing smack dab in the middle of the outlet (or register grate, or light switch…you name it). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   New construction homes are often equipped with **walk**-in **closet**s that are nearly as large as the master bathroom. If you happen to own an older home that comes with this amount of storage luxury, you remember what it felt like to **walk**-in the door for the first time and realize you’ve got an entire dressing room at your disposal. The main challenge with the “oversized” **walk**-in **closet** is that most of the square footage is open, unused floor space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **walk**-in **closet** is a separate room where you store all of your clothes, shoes and accessories. It’s usually built onto your bedroom - making it easy to roll out of bed and get ready in the morning. It can be big enough for you to store all your clothes and accessories or big enough for you to get changed in it as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another option would be closing up the bathroom access to the **closet** and creating a door from the bedroom into our **walk**-in **closet**. That was certainly an option. But we decided against that because - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This shelving arrangement is a catchall—it’s not meant just for bedding: shirts, sweaters, sports clothing, and even toys will end up on these shelves. To keep **closet**s uniform and easier to install, we keep to the same layout—12 in. on center for all but the bottom two shelves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A wrap-around **closet** has storage spaces on the three sides of the **closet** and the doorway on the remaining wall. A perfect wrap-around master **closet** size is around 10 by 10 feet, equivalent to 100 square footage. You get 7 by 7 feet of wall storage space and a 3-by-3-foot **walk**way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Double rods are common in **walk**-in **closet**s to provide hanging space without sacrificing too much floor space. This is a great way to add extra shirt length storage for tall items. Double rods are typically placed 102-203 cm (40-80 inches) from the ground. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The standard width of a **walk**-in **closet** can range anywhere between 5 to 12 feet or more. This allows space for a 3-foot hallway into the **closet**, even after storing or hanging items along the **closet** walls. A **walk**-in **closet**’s standard depth can range anywhere between 5 feet (for a square room) to 17 feet (or more for a room style **closet**). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An online photo view does not guarantee the feasibility of a **walk**-in **closet**. You must always compare your measurements with the dimensions of the furnishings. It is not always feasible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your needs will dictate the design. For instance, you could use 2 feet of storage space on each side and 3 feet of central clearance space. You can add extra features like shoe storage to make the most of your master **walk**-in **closet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most people don’t realize they have a ‘feature wall’ in their **closet**, but everyone does (even if their **closet** is a disaster today). You see your feature wall is the best visible wall when you enter your **closet**. This is the wall which can shine (even if you need to go more ‘budget’ on the other walls). This is the wall which can make you actually proud to enter your **closet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These simple design rules apply to even the most complicated **closet**s, from reach-ins, like the one in the previous illustrations, to elaborate **walk**-ins, like the one below. Just remember one thing whenever you turn a corner with shelving: All **closet** poles require a minimum 24 in. clearance before the next divider, otherwise there won’t be enough room to slide clothes into the corner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Laying out and installing **closet** shelving used to be simple—you just installed a single shelf and pole in every **closet**, about 66 in. from the floor, so a dress wouldn’t drag on the carpet. Maybe people didn’t have so many clothes back then. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This article covered the dimensions and layouts of the perfect master **closet**. You can use or reference the four main **closet** layouts discussed above. They include the single-sided layout, double-sided layout, and office **closet** layouts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Anyone who has the space for a **walk**-in **closet** is very lucky - for a lot of homeowners, this is the ultimate luxury! But planning one isn’t always the easiest. In fact, creating **walk**-in **closet** designs for a master bedroom can take a lot of time, patience and hard work. To help you make the process a little smoother, we’ve put together some tips you can follow to get started. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **walk**-in **closet** is, essentially, a small room. You generally open a door and enter the **closet** entirely, surrounded by shelves and clothes hanging systems. Some homeowners choose to have separate his and hers **walk**-in **closet**s so each person has their own space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Large **walk**-in **closet**s do not have to feel cluttered. A little bit of an intelligent organization can make a huge difference. Instead of stacking boxes or bins on top of each other, carefully place them side by side so that they look like shelves. Tidying up can do wonders for your **walk**-in **closet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A dressing room is a room with a door that is used as both a **closet** and dressing area. It may have a vanity with lighting for make-up application and hairstyling. It likely has furniture, a built-in island, and a full-length mirror. Some even include a home office space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to installing **closet** shelving, if your crew isn’t following a manual of practice—a system that simplifies repetitive tasks, eliminates needless steps, and speeds installation time—then you’ll never enjoy the profits that can be made in **closet**s. Once the exterior doors are in, before installing any interior doors or trim, we like to get the **closet** shelving in place, if it’s paintgrade. It’s just easier to work in a **closet** without the doors in the way, and besides, that way we don’t have to worry about banging shelving into new doors. We wait to install the baseboard until all the shelving is in, too, because the baseboard has to be cut around the dividers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you don’t have much space, a 4 by 4 feet **walk**-in **closet** space is the minimum. Experiment with the design of your small **closet** to make the most of the space. You can use the L arrangement to create extra storage space. Alternatively, if you don’t have enough space for **closet** shelves, you might need a master **closet** with hanging rods. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Single Pole is meant for dresses and long coats. It must be installed at least 66 in. from the floor, farther for tall clients. To secure the pole and the rosettes, we use 1×4 cleats to support all **closet** poles. For linen shelving, we use 1×2 cleats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, for us this layout felt awkward. Not only did it force us to have our bed on the far wall, facing the bedroom entry doors (because that’s the ONLY other wall available for a bed!), but even the fact that the sliding doors were in a corner felt awkward. It might be convenient for the person sleeping on that side of the bed next to the **closet**, but we couldn’t see the person who slept on the other side really needing to **walk** all the way around to the other corner to get dressed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You need a minimum of 26” of floor space to give space to the hangers. Therefore, they will not interfere with your **walk**ing area. Consider placing rods at 72” on a vertical wall for hanging long garments. You can also add more shelves above the 72” to create more vertical space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **closet**s are mid-size **closet**s with contents placed along two walls, split by an interior clearance space. Double-sided **closet**s’ widths also vary between 6’-6.5’ | 183-198 cm for mixed storage or 7’ | 213 cm for two sets of comfortable hanger rods (24” | 61 cm each). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It may be a good decision to include a built-in dresser when designing a **walk**-in **closet**. Because they are quite different than bathroom vanities, add ons like customized shelves, cabinets, and shoe storage transform your **closet** into an excellent functional space. Another important aspect is to inculcate an open feel upon entrance through the strategic placement of storage units. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   A **walk**-in master **closet** gives you plenty of space for your clothes and other essentials. To build that perfect master **closet**, you need to consider the size of the room, your budget, and the storage requirements. With the right design, you’ll have a **closet** that makes your life easier and adds value to your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many luxury **closet**s have open shelves. This certainly allows for the most flexibility. If you plan to keep your accessories and clothing stored and want to easily see everything at a glance, this is a great choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A better option is a **closet**-organizing system. These storage units have an array of compartments, each designed for specific pieces of your wardrobe. The compartments range from individual shelves and bins for sweaters and tops to small drawers for lingerie and accessories to cubbies or racks for shoes, bags, and hats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So, while you may want the fancy **closet** with the wood Shaker style drawers you need to Get Smart (just like the old detective show) with selections which will work in your teeny-tiny **closet**. You need ideas which don’t break the bank. Here’s 3: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here’s a **closet** mistake which is as common as white on rice. This mistake is your top shelf is set too low, which doesn’t allow room for double hanging (that’s an industry term for one set of hanging clothes on top another). For most 8’ high small **walk** in **closet**s your top shelf should be 7’ from the floor (or 84” high). When you move up the top shelf to 84” you’ll have room for 2 sets of hanging clothes below. This INSTANTLY doubles your desperately needed hanging space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No **closet** design is successful without identifying (and working around) switches, outlets, soffits, and windows. Don’t buy anything until you’re sure it’ll work in your space. If you don’t want to sweat these small (but critical) details, hire a pro who will be responsible to figure out the ‘zigs and zags’ of your **closet** and work around them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

So whether you're starting from scratch or just looking to improve your current layout, read on for expert advice! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Walk-in **closet** design ideas start with dimensions and a floor plan. How big should a **walk**-in **closet** be? The minimum is about 5ft x 8ft. But your **closet** can be as big as you like. Once it becomes the size of a spare room or larger, it would be a dressing room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The mirror will never fog up. You won’t disturb anyone sleeping in the bedroom. Just plenty of space and time for yourself. And it makes a fantastic focal point for your dream **closet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It made much more sense to keep all our clothing in one place. One **closet**. One place to go to get dressed or undressed. We like the simplicity of that. (See more in our post “How to Nail Your Closet Layout the First Time!”) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The tricky thing with a custom master **closet** is getting the dimensions right. A good **closet** makes life much easier by providing a space to store your things. It feels like it naturally fits your room. Get the dimensions wrong, on the other hand, and you’ll bump into things constantly. Plus, you might end up with storage space issues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The original sliding door **closet** dimensions (by itself) were 41″x117″ (or 3.4’x9.75′). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The double-sided **closet** occupies two sides of the **closet**. Most double-sided **walk**-in **closet**s are in the 5 by 6-foot range. Generally, you’ll have two storage spaces on opposite walls. If you do this, you’ll typically have a centrally placed door that leads to an unoccupied central area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are some fun ways to make the most of your available space. For example, you can integrate a **closet** and a home office into the same space. The multipurpose “cloffice” has become increasingly popular with the remote work trend. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Walk-in **closet**s, and long reach-ins, pose a problem when it comes to shelves sagging, too. The best solution is another design strategy: eliminate mid-span supports on linen shelves by limiting their span to 32 in., then let the **closet** poles run longer. After all, metal supports for single and double pole are easy to install, but installing supports for linen shelving isn’t so easy, and there are a lot more shelves! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can use standard **closet** dimensions as the main point of reference. The average **closet** size is 5 by 5 feet deep. That gives you a comfortable space, sufficient storage units, and just enough to **walk** in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can play around with the design to accommodate a desk or workspace in your **closet**. The empty back wall for the single-sided and double-sided layouts is the best position for your office space. You can create a workspace at the center of your **walk**-in **closet**, but it’s not optimal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

So keep this checklist handy while you're re-arranging your **closet**: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The small and square **walk**-in **closet** tends to vex homeowners the most. We call these “bare minimum” **walk**-in **closet**s, because they hold hanging storage on only two adjacent walls and offer just enough **walk**ing space to turn around in. In truth, you’ve got barely any more storage space than you would in the average reach-in hall **closet**—and a deep reach-in might even be preferable. But we all have to work with the minimum **closet** dimensions we’ve got! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   L-shaped **walk**-in **closet**s are usually 1.5 m (5 ft) wide, while U-shaped layouts are slightly larger at a minimum width of 2.1 m (7 ft), using 61 cm (24 inches) of standard hanger rod depths for sizing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
