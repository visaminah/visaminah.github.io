## 51 Tips for Does Blue Go With Grey And Black | What Color Does Blue And Grey Make?
-   Grey is one of those ‘colours’ that is said to not actually be, a colour. Grey is a scale between white and black without any bona fide colours being added to it. True colours are those that can be created by blending any of the three primary colours, and no matter how much **blue** you put with yellow or the countless dabs of red you add, you’re never going to get a **grey**. Hence why, if we’re being picky, you’d say that **grey** is technically a shade rather than a colour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fashion insiders have shown us a range of colors that work. From head-to-toe navy for a monochrome look to a subtle pop of burgundy to unexpected colors like electric green, their stylish looks prove exactly how to pull off an outfit with navy **blue**. Some of these I’ve tried out before, but others are inspiring me to try some new color pairings. Ahead, see 11 chic ways the fashion set wears navy **blue** and shop pieces inspired by their looks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since **blue** and gray are both cool colors, the combo can make interior spaces feel cold and uninviting in a hurry; unless, of course, you pair the duo with a warmer accent, such as wood. In this bathroom by Raili Clasen, light wood cabinets sandwich a light gray floating sink. Blue details — like the flooring, faucet, and even the trim on the pendant light — add an unexpected and fun pop to an otherwise serious color scheme, as well as complement the **blue** undertones that are oftentimes found in gray. "In this case, we used **blue** as our accent color because it does not clash with the solid gray." explains Clasen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here's another **blue** and gray bedroom design for the win, but this time, it's from the team over at Arent & Pyke. The color scheme, while still moody, offers a slightly lighter approach thanks in part to the mustard yellow headboard, sky **blue** duvet cover, and jute rug. The gold and rust-colored pillows add additional warmth and interest. Black window trim and a matching blanket at the foot of the bed, plus the dark hardwood flooring, add a modern edge and punctuate the space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best way to choose gray colors is to understand the underlying tones. Warmer shades of gray will go better with warmer colors, while cool grays go better with navy **blue**, cool greens, and whites. If you can recognize the color temperature or tone, it will make it easier to choose the rest of your color palette for a room. Charcoal gray is a good choice if you are looking for a darker color, it is not as intense as black or a dark **blue**. Gray can also be the perfect backdrop for adding a variety of patterns, textures, and accents, do not be afraid to experiment to find the look you are going for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your wardrobe is built on a foundation of neutrals like mine is, chances are you have plenty of navy pieces stocked in your closet. After all, beyond black and white, navy **blue** is one of the most versatile shades you can wear. While it’s a foolproof classic worn on its own, it also complements an array of colors. So what are the colors to go best with navy **blue**? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're looking to add a pop of color to any room, you can't go wrong with a vibrant shade of orange. And bonus: The hue will work especially well with **blue** palettes since orange is a complementary color (meaning it's on the opposite side of the color wheel). Keep in mind that a little goes a long way, as proven by this bedroom design. Here, a citrus-hued throw and patterned accent pillow warm up the cooler charcoal gray walls and light **blue** headboard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black and white colors combined do make a gray and are known as neutral gray. However, this does tend to make a dull and flat, basic gray. Sometimes, the simple addition of white and black can create a muddy and less appealing gray color. So, what colors make gray brighter and cleaner? Try adding orange and **blue** for a warm and cool hue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black and white are technically not colors as they are used to create shades and tints of various other colors. A basic neutral gray is the combination of equal amounts of black and white. The shade can be determined by the amount of black or white. For example, more white will create a lighter shade of gray and vice versa. Using this neutral gray, you can also influence the color temperature by adding a little bit of red to create a warmer hue and **blue** for a cooler shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grayish **blue** color combinations are delicate and inspiring. They often play with pastels and deep color shades. Temperature balance is as important as contrasts the gray-**blue** creates with vibrant hues. Perfect for peaceful interior design, the Blenched **blue** blends harmoniously with pastels in bright and expressive color combinations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The exterior of the home is one of the best places to use a darker **blue** gray paint color. It will make a dramatic statement without going overboard. And because the exterior of the home is outside and has more square footage to cover, it can handle a darker shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A simple combination of black and white is a neutral color, however, when using complementary or primary colors, you can affect the color bias. Cooler grays lean more towards **blue** undertones, while warmer grays lean towards orange and yellow or red undertones. So, a cool gray can be a blend of white, black, and some **blue**. The specific hex code for cool gray is #8C92AC. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you know me, you know I’m a fan of **blue**. I gravitate towards the color all the time. Whether it involves shopping for clothes or furniture, my eyes are almost always drawn to **blue** colors first. The same goes for paint colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The entire range of gray presents a neutral backdrop for any mid – to navy **blue** tie to work. And, the fact that both **blue** and gray are cool colors ensures they will pair naturally. Even if your gray suit contains warmer brown tones, you’ll have no issues because **blue** also combines perfectly with brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To sum it up, a **blue**-gray paint color is gray with **blue** added to it. Some of these livid colors are more **blue** than gray and others are more gray than **blue**. These cool toned colors can also be considered slate colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bright colors are the name of the game in this moody living room by Jessica Helgerson Design. Here, dark wood millwork and a charcoal gray accent wall provide a neutral backdrop for the more vibrant pieces of home decor. The **blue** velvet sofa and matching club chairs compete for attention with a fuchsia lounge chair, pink throw pillows, and a large pink and **blue** work of art. A dark gray area rug adds to the dramatic scene, while simultaneously anchoring the bold setup. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grayish **blue** combined with all other **blue**s in monochromatic but exciting palettes. The contrasts make the color combinations feel light and bright. Blues can bring vibrancy and create depth. All **blue** pastels and vibrant turquoise, royal **blue**, and cobalt tones are perfect for color combinations with the pale grayish **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Whether it's coastal-chic, boho, or midcentury that you're aiming for, pairing certain shades with the neutral combo can either make or break your space. That being said, there are a few things to keep in mind when finalizing your colo palette. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Light purple and **blue** color combinations are charming. Deep purple, violet, amethyst, grape, and pale **blue** tones look sophisticated and elegant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can mix complementary and primary colors to create gray. For example, red and green, purple and yellow, or orange and **blue**. However, to lighten these colors, you will need to add white. If you use red, green, and yellow, you can also lighten the gray color using a lighter hue of yellow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But what happens if you add too much of one color, for example, **blue**. Simply add in colors that lean towards warmer or lighter colors. Add in identical, tiny amounts of white and orange to your **blue**-gray paint. The orange will make it brighter, while the white will lighten the color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Calm and soothing light gray-**blue** are whispering and romantic. The quiet **blue** color tone Bleached Coral reminds of **blue** skies, white sails, calm water, and morning fog.

-   If you really want to amp up the drama of a **blue** and gray color scheme, a dark color like black is definitely the way to go.

The gray accent wall showcasing Cole & Son's Nuvolette wallpaper draws all attention toward the bed, which is topped with earthy brown linens and a black blanket. The navy **blue** walls add to the moody vibe and provide just a hint of color. Herringbone wood floors, decorative ceiling trim, and swanky lighting complete the scene. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’d think twice before painting your entire kitchen **blue**. According to a study published in Appetite, people tended to drink and eat more when they were using **blue** cups and plates. I find this fascinating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blues and reds look bright and exciting together. The contrast of the cool tone and warm shades make any heart beat faster. Red color shades glow on the light **blue** background shimmering with the inner light and warmth. The darker red, the icier **blue**, and the contrasts are more energetic and beautiful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In my opinion, the bedroom is the optimal place to use these colors. Since **blue** promotes calmness and relaxation, it’s perfect for a bedroom. Blue grays are great because they have a bit of color to them while being on the neutral side. And that makes sense for a bedroom paint color since you don’t want your paint to be overly colorful or vibrant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many people avoid combining **blue** and gray in their homes for fear the color combo will make their living space a bit cold and uninviting. But this couldn’t be further from the truth.

-   With so many shades of gray and a plethora of **blue** tones, the combinations are seemingly endless when selecting one of each for your color scheme. Additionally, **blue** and gray palettes pair well with a wide variety of accent hues and fit in with just about any aesthetic — hence the duo's popularity in the world of interior design. The subtle combo has the ability to bring depth and color to a room without overpowering the space. Instead, **blue** and gray offer a sense of calm and tranquility. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light grayish **blue** provides an attractive background color. The combination of grayish-**blue** with other hues creates beautiful contrasts. Bleached **blue** is a versatile color. It is balancing the warm colors and enhancing the calming effects of cool tones in color schemes. Pale grayish-**blue** is an excellent color design choice for creating relaxing, bright, and modern interiors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Misty, North Star, and Evening Shadow are all similar in LRV. Misty and Evening Shadow are very similar both more of the gray side of these livid colors. Whereas, North Star has a touch more **blue** in it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, Smoke is slightly more of a teal gray. Teal is still a shade of **blue** so I had to sneak it in here. You know I love my teal colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
