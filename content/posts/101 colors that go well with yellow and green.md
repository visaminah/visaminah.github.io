## 101 Tips for Colors That Go Well With Yellow And Green | colors that go with red yellow and green
-   The effect of disturbance and disarrangement as if something is wrong, but you are not sure what exactly. On the one hand, it has no distinct mood, and it’s hard to notice something. On the other hand, when you do notice the **colors**, it has no point of visual interest. You would probably want to skim the piece and move on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mixing color is not as simple as grabbing the closest blue and **yellow** and making the perfect green. There are multiple ways of going about mixing green from these two **colors**. If you have a growing collection of paints in your studio, try gathering all of your **yellow** and blue shades together. You will likely be surprised as to the number you have of each. While **yellow** and blue are the correct answer on a general level, we need to look a little closer to control the green we produce. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An accent color is used to highlight or accentuate a scheme of **colors**. In this case, green color schemes. If you are wearing a black dress to a party and want to liven up the outfit, you can accent the dress with a gold necklace, diamond earrings, or a pair of red shoes. Essentially, what you are doing is adding color to make your outfit pop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   01 of 19 Colors that Go with Green Ed Gohlich The most popular color to represent the environment, green comes alive in a multitude of hues. Whether you prefer seafoam-green or deep-shade fern, the hue is fresh, lively, and always in style. It pairs well with a wide variety of **colors** including neutrals like brown and gray, as well as vibrant shades of **yellow**, blue, pink, and more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pair geometrics with primrose **yellow** for a vintage look with a modern twist. Keep the scheme contemporary cool with a backdrop of grey walls and furniture, then add warmth with hints of **yellow** in geometric prints and accessories. Wood cube tables and copper details complement the retro vibe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can alter the exact shade of your green by changing either the **yellow** or blue shade you are using. Just like **yellow** **colors**, blues range from cool to warm relative to the other available blues. If we were to rank the most common blues from cool to warm, the list would be as follows: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Today, we look at **colors** that are pleasing when paired with **yellow**.

-   11 of 19 Cottage Color Scheme Paul Dyer Celery + Olive + White Taking cues from cottage style, this charming kitchen features simple Shaker-style cabinetry and open shelving. The palette includes red, olive, and stained wood, but this kitchen exhibits a fresh take on the deeper **colors** replacing darker green with light celery on the walls. The darker shade of olive is limited to the kitchen island, and white paint brightens up the cabinetry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A combination of grey and **yellow** offers a pleasing gender neutral nursery decorating idea. This colour combo often needs pattern to bring it to life. There are plenty of mid-century-style graphic prints around, but also try softer florals and stripes. Use on wallpaper, curtains, rugs and cushions – but keep window treatments casual and free from fussy trims. Stick to a plain block colour on fabrics, or opt for shutters in white or grey. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   18 of 19 Mountainside Color Scheme James Yochum Teal Fog + Summery Stripes Taking its color cues from the foggy mountains in the distant views outside the window, this cozy breakfast nook embraces the scenery with its smoky teal-green walls. In keeping with the outdoorsy theme, the wooden chairs are Adirondack-inspired with their chunky wood slats. Striped fabric covers the table introducing carefree stripes in **yellow**, coral, teal green, and blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like the triadic combination, the tetradic color combination involves **colors** that are equidistant apart. Except these color combos use four **colors** instead of three. You can find a tetradic combination by placing a square on the color wheel and choosing the **colors** at each corner, or by choosing two opposing sets of complementary **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Describing his painting, The Night Café, to his brother Theo in 1888, Van Gogh wrote: "I sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions. The hall is blood-red and pale **yellow**, with a green billiard table in the center, and four lamps of lemon **yellow**, with rays of orange and green. Everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and greens."[19] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Green and **yellow** is another combination that is as appealing as blue and **yellow** and is inspired by nature. Much like those lovely **yellow** flowers on green branches, this energizing duo looks best when your room is lit with a flood of natural light. Dark shades of green generally combine best with different **yellow** hues and provide the right visual balance while anchoring the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for a green interior paint color scheme, you’ll find that it has mass appeal. It brings out nature’s elements and can be paired with neutrals with hints of green. Try pairing green with pea green or olive green to create a sophisticated space. But you should also remember that green is versatile and can be combined with many different **colors**. If you’re looking to add a pop of color to your room, consider using green interior paint with hints of **yellow**, blue, or orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And there’s no better way to do that than with a dash of zesty **colors**. Two of my favorites are **yellow** and green. I love working with these hues — by themselves and in tandem — because they are just so incredibly versatile and uplifting. If you love bright **colors**, there are plenty of options with these two. On the other hand, if you favor softer, more muted **colors**, you’re also in good hands with this combo. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Complementary **colors** are pairs of **colors** which, when combined or mixed, cancel each other out (lose hue) by producing a grayscale color like white or black.[1][2][better source needed] When placed next to each other, they create the strongest contrast for those two **colors**. Complementary **colors** may also be called "opposite **colors**". - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Having read this far in the article, you will intuitively know that adding warm **colors** like reds, **yellow**s, and oranges to your green will warm them up. Using an orange shade like cadmium orange is a fantastic way to warm up your green. We also love to use **yellow** ochre to warm up green tones, particularly if we want a more earthy green. Yellow ochre is an earthy color, so it will naturally make your green lean slightly towards brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Add texture by combining furniture and accessories in different finishes from wood and metal to marble and wicker. 'You can introduce a pop of **yellow** with more than just accessories,' advises Ideal Home style editor Michela Colling. 'Use it to paint a fire surround or go for a bold **yellow** armchair.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vincent van Gogh was especially known for using this technique; he created his own oranges with mixtures of **yellow**, ochre and red, and placed them next to slashes of sienna red and bottle-green, and below a sky of turbulent blue and violet. He also put an orange moon and stars in a cobalt blue sky. He wrote to his brother Theo of "searching for oppositions of blue with orange, of red with green, of **yellow** with purple, searching for broken **colors** and neutral **colors** to harmonize the brutality of extremes, trying to make the **colors** intense, and not a harmony of greys".[18] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light green shades are an essential part of any painting that incorporates green. Whether you need to create variation in the leaves of a tree or add a highlight where the light hits a green surface, you really need to know how to make lighter tints of green. If you want to know what **colors** make mint green, look no further than a lovely green shade and some white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As we have already mentioned, **colors** have different moods and associations, and they influence us even more when we are placed in a room filled with certain hues. For example, a living room with marigold orange walls would bring a sense of coziness and playfulness. On the contrary, a bedroom with navy blue decor would create a refreshing and calm ambiance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hue – The terms “color” and “hue” are often used interchangeably by artists and designers. For all intents and purposes, this will get you by but the words “color” and “hue” actually mean different things. In general, “color” is used to refer to all, well, **colors**, including black, white and grey. While “hue” refers to the origin of the color we see. It is the base of the color we see and is always one of the six primary and secondary **colors** on the color wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Radiance, sunshine and golden glint – **yellow** is a color that represents hope, a new beginning and symbolizes all things auspicious in cultures across the globe. In the Oriental world, it was a color used on front doors to ward off evil and negative forces and in modern homes, it is a hue that ushers in freshness and rejuvenates even the dullest of interiors. We all love a hint of **yellow** in the room, but when one wishes to use it in a more extensive manner, which **colors** work with it the best? Colors that go with **yellow** range from trendy neutrals like gray to those as bright as red, orange and green. It depends largely on your taste, style of the room and its overall ambiance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   15 of 19 Rustic Color Scheme James R Salomon Artichoke + Weathered Wood A fresh shade reminiscent of artichokes offers the perfect green to complement the rustic wood ceiling and kitchen island in this country house. Playing off the vegetable's **colors** and fibrous texture, this kitchen celebrates the more weathered side of Mother Nature in this barnlike atmosphere. Partnering with the rough-hewn theme, an expansive wall of windows looks out to the wooded view. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are so many questions to answer before we start mixing. Do you want to know how to make neon green paint, or what **colors** make lime green? What two **colors** make green anyway? We will answer these questions and more in good time, but we need to start with the basics. Starting at the very beginning, you can make a basic green color by mixing **yellow** and blue. If you are very new to color mixing, a color mixing chart can be helpful. When you combine the **colors** opposite each other on the wheel, you will create the color between them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Consider the grass mentioned above. Imagine the grass to be green, and well maintained – a manicured, healthy, backyard lawn. Chairs are strategically placed around the lawn – red and **yellow** and orange chairs creating pops of color against a green background. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The traditional color wheel model dates to the 18th century and is still used by many artists today. This model designates red, **yellow** and blue as primary **colors** with the primary–secondary complementary pairs of red–green, blue-orange, and **yellow**–purple.[3] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These simple color combos are variants of the split complementary color scheme. The **colors** in this composition are found equally spaced on the color wheel. Take an equilateral triangle and place it on the color wheel. The **colors** at each point come together to make the triadic combination. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   12 of 19 Restful Green Color Scheme Edmund Barr Seafoam Green + Rainy Day Blue The palest **colors** in the seascape artwork set the tone for this room's soothing look. Grayish cloud-blue covers a Chesterfield sofa, and a blue-striped rug underfoot makes a quiet statement. Other pieces are mostly white save accent pillows in patterns of blue and green. For a complete turn of the tides, an animal print ottoman dominates the center of the room. Because the juxtaposition is a singular piece, it makes a big statement and adds a jolt of energy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This colour combination doesn't mean you have to opt for a modern decor. The richness of ochre/mustard **yellow** makes it ideal for a country, contemporary or retro setting. Adding rich pigments to a grey colour scheme helps to make even the coolest temperature of grey feel as close to cosy as it can. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At about the same time as Young discovered additive **colors**, another British scientist, David Brewster (1781–1868), the inventor of the kaleidoscope, proposed a competing theory that the true primary **colors** were red, **yellow**, and blue, and that the true complementary pairs were red–green, blue–orange, and **yellow**–purple. Then a German scientist, Hermann von Helmholtz, (1821–1894), resolved the debate by showing that **colors** formed by light, additive **colors**, and those formed by pigments, subtractive **colors**, did in fact operate by different rules, and had different primary and complementary **colors**.[15] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Learning how to combine **colors** is a skill that everyone should be able to master. Now that you know how to combine green and **yellow** and what goes well with these two **colors**, you can start relating it to other areas in your life, such as design, beauty, fashion, home goods, etc. With **colors**, the possibilities are endless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Knowing how to create darker shades of green is just as important as knowing what **colors** make light green. Whether you want to create variation in the shrubbery or emphasize dimension by adding shadows, darker shades of green are an indispensable part of any painting. You need to know what two **colors** make dark green. There are so many circumstances in which you will need to create a variety of dark rich greens. While using black is the easiest way to darken your green **colors**, just like with lightning, you run the risk of creating dull and monotone paintings if that is the only method you use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tone – This is very similar to “tint” and “shade,” only instead of being a hue with white or black added to it, it is a hue with only grey added to it. The grey that is added to make a “tone” must only consist of black and white, no other **colors** (many **colors** that are considered grey actually have a base that is a hue). Toned **colors** tend to be viewed as more sophisticated than pure hues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Complementary **colors** exist directly across from one another on the color wheel. These **colors** have high contrast to one another and can make your design boldly stand out with high contrast. However, if used improperly, they can be very visually jarring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best solution would be to use a toned-down right shade of one of the **colors**. As you can see in the picture, the neon cyan color was switched to dark indigo blue. In this way, you will be able to use neon pink as a statement color and don’t overstimulate the viewer. Moreover, in such vibrant color combinations, the neon would be powered by the lightness or, in our case, the darkness of other **colors** to make use of its best qualities. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As with orange, you can replace the **yellow** in our green formula with raw sienna. Again, these greens may not be as light or bright as they would be with **yellow** because raw sienna is a much warmer color. We suggest experimenting with different shades by mixing raw sienna with a range of blue **colors**. Raw sienna and pthalo blue create a lovely deep bluish-green while mixing raw sienna with Prussian blue makes a more earthy green tone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a light, almost lime green shade of green, try adding a little cadmium light **yellow**. You can add a warmer **yellow** to make your green lighter but warmer. As with all things color mixing, you need to run some experiments for yourself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A hit of vibrant **yellow** can lift darker grey tones, making the mood more uplifting rather than too brooding. The darker tone of the grey allows the saturation of **yellow** to really pop. This colour combination is ideal for a bathroom to invigorate the senses. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The RGB color model, invented in the 19th century and fully developed in the 20th century, uses combinations of red, green, and blue light against a black background to make the **colors** seen on a computer monitor or television screen. In the RGB model, the primary **colors** are red, green, and blue. The complementary primary–secondary combinations are red–cyan, green–magenta, and blue–**yellow**. In the RGB color model, the light of two complementary **colors**, such as red and cyan, combined at full intensity, will make white light, since two complementary **colors** contain light with the full range of the spectrum. If the light is not fully intense, the resulting light will be gray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For an even more striking effect, combine purple and **yellow** with different shades of gray. Light shades of purple will add a fresh, relaxing feel to a room, while deep, dark hues will evoke drama and contrast. Try tan furniture with purple and **yellow** for a bold effect. If you don’t like tan, go for a more neutral base like wood. It will make your space more inviting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally, white is the most common tint used to make **colors** lighter. When it comes to tinting green, white does not quite hit the mark on its own. Adding white to green often produces a shade similar to sage but lacking depth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, it’s crucial to evaluate the environment in which the combinations are used. A warm and cool tone mixture doesn’t work well in the interior design, and vibrating **colors** are extremely deceiving in web design. Making sure that your chosen qualitative color scheme transmits the message you intend them to and in the most comfortable way possible for the viewer is the safe path for the designer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a variation of the complementary color scheme. However, instead of two **colors** directly across from each other, this combination is made up of one color and the **colors** on either side of the complement. This strategy adds more variety than complementary color schemes by including three hues, without being too jarring or too bold. Using this method, we end up with combinations that include both warm and cool hues that are more easily balanced than those of the complementary color schemes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While we are considering color temperature, we should take about creating warm and cold green shades. As you know, color temperature is a key consideration when mixing any color, particularly for greens. If you want to paint a landscape, you can use different temperatures to communicate to the viewer whether it is cold and wintery or bright and sunny. For the remainder of the article, the green that we are using as a base example is a mixture of ultramarine blue and cadmium **yellow**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to combine a bright **yellow** accent with a deeper shade of **yellow**, try a rich hue like navy blue or purple. Those hues are perfect for a room with gray walls, while pink and purple make a nice pairing. Light **yellow** also looks great with electric blue, lilac, or light purple walls. And if you’re looking for a more subtle way to use this sunny color, try a black bamboo chair with a velvet cushion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let me explain: dark **colors** usually don’t have the most pleasant associations – death, depression, blood, you name it. So, a couple of them in one place emerges the viewer into the darkest feelings that they personally associate with these **colors**. And not just one, but all together as an unidentified heaviness. That’s why dark with dark color combinations are best avoided. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re not sure which color you should choose, try wearing a purple dress shirt with blue jeans. It will add a touch of class and sophistication to your style. In addition, navy and teal are very soothing. You can also pair purple with other **colors** that are calming or uplifting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the case above the photoreceptors for red light in the retina are fatigued, lessening their ability to send the information to the brain. When white light is viewed, the red portions of light incident upon the eye are not transmitted as efficiently as the other wavelengths (or **colors**), and the result is the illusion of viewing the complementary color since the image is now biased by loss of the color, in this case red. As the receptors are given time to rest, the illusion vanishes. In the case of looking at the white light, red light is still incident upon the eye (as well as blue and green), however since the receptors for other light **colors** are also being fatigued, the eye will reach an equilibrium. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Disclaimer: This article is just an opinion piece only, and it’s not intended to offend somebody’s taste or choice of color. The way you see **colors** might be different from the way we see them. Thank you for understanding! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can make a vibrant light green shade by mixing a lot of light **yellow** with some blue. If you want to know how to make mint green paint, you simply add a little white to this light green. You can also lighten any green shade by adding a little more **yellow** or white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All **colors** come from some combination of primary **colors**. The three primary **colors** are red, blue, and **yellow**. These three **colors** are essentially the parents of all the other **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You might be wondering, how come cool and warm **colors** make a bad combination. We all know the rules of complementary **colors** and how they look good together. Green goes well with magenta and blue looks great with **yellow**. And I agree with that – complementary **colors** make a great base for color palettes if you know how to use them properly. However, let’s move to a more specific sphere – interior design and see how complementary **colors** react in the environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Complementary **colors** sit on opposite sides of the color wheel, which will clash when used together in design. However, this contrast can work to your advantage when combining these two **colors**. They look great together when used sparingly in an art piece. A beautiful bouquet of **yellow** and purple flowers will give you a splash of color without overpowering the room. Consider pairing this bold color with a neutral color, white or gray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although purple works well with many **colors**, it can be tricky to know which ones to wear. It is best to stick with the neutrals when mixing a color with an intense tone of purple. You should pair lighter shades of purple with pale, neutral **colors** to avoid clashing. In addition, if you plan to wear a purple dress, make sure it’s paired with neutrals in the same tone. If you’re wearing a purple dress or shirt, a pink or white dress will look perfect with the color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In 1704, in his treatise on optics, Isaac Newton devised a circle showing a spectrum of seven **colors**. In this work and in an earlier work in 1672, he observed that certain **colors** around the circle were opposed to each other and provided the greatest contrast; he named red and blue, **yellow** and violet, and green and "a purple close to scarlet".[8] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These color combinations tend to be quite vibrant, even when toned down, tinted, or shaded. The **colors** can come across as playful, or adolescent. Because of this, you will want to be careful with the balance of these **colors**. Choosing one as the main color and using the other two as accents is a strong place to start. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The effect that **colors** have upon each other had been noted since antiquity. In his essay On Colors, Aristotle observed that "when light falls upon another color, then, as a result of this new combination, it takes on another nuance of color".[7] Saint Thomas Aquinas had written that purple looked different next to white than it did next to black, and that gold looked more striking against blue than it did against white; the Italian Renaissance architect and writer Leon Battista Alberti observed that there was harmony (coniugatio in Latin, and amicizia in Italian) between certain **colors**, such as red–green and red–blue; and Leonardo da Vinci observed that the finest harmonies were those between **colors** exactly opposed (retto contrario), but no one had a convincing scientific explanation why that was so until the 18th century. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Complementary **colors** can create some striking optical effects. The shadow of an object appears to contain some of the complementary color of the object. For example, the shadow of a red apple will appear to contain a little blue-green. This effect is often copied by painters who want to create more luminous and realistic shadows. Also, if you stare at a square of color for a long period of time (thirty seconds to a minute), and then look at a white paper or wall, you will briefly see an afterimage of the square in its complementary color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   09 of 19 Analagous Color Scheme John Gruen Emerald Green + Summer Sky Analogous **colors**, which are hues next to each other on the color wheel, are always a good choice when choosing a scheme. Here, jewel green is mixed with paler greens and combined with blues such as sky, cerulean, and sapphire. Graphic patterns are used in restraint to maintain the restful atmosphere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It does not sound like an obvious combination on the face of it, but pink and **yellow** combine delightfully well, especially in the girls’ bedroom and in shabby chic spaces with a contemporary touch. You can opt for mellow shades of **yellow** and hot pinks like fuchsia to create a fusion where pink visually dominates the setting. Since both these **colors** are often used in moderation, you might want to use a white room as your canvas for the experiment and start out small. Once you are comfortable with the duo, branching out is far easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We have harped on endlessly about how trendy gray is as a neutral color and so we will spare you the lecture once again. But gray continues to replace white in homes across the globe at a fervent pace and even if you are not entirely removing white from the setting, adding a bit of gray to the **yellow** zest does give the space a more sophisticated and curated look. Dark and deep shades of gray can be combined with light **yellow** hues while dark **yellow** shades can be easily combined with light grays and those ever-popular bluish-gray **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the whole, it’s not about the color itself; it’s about the things that are associated with this color and how it works in specific color combinations. As we have discussed, neon pairs and vibrating color combos are just too aggressive to the viewers’ eyes, so that instead of attracting their attention, these **colors** put them off. As for the only dark color combinations, the associations, and feelings that these **colors** evoke come into the play. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Orange and blue became an important combination for all the impressionist painters. They all had studied the recent books on color theory, and they knew that orange placed next to blue made both **colors** much brighter. Auguste Renoir painted boats with stripes of chrome orange paint straight from the tube. Paul Cézanne used orange made of touches of **yellow**, red and ochre against a blue background. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purple complements many **colors**. Yellow, orange, and green are complementary **colors** of purple. They are also complementary **colors** of the opposite color, pink. You can wear a purple dress shirt with blue jeans to give a more manly look. Black, gray, and teal are also complementary **colors** of purple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In some other color models, such as the HSV color space, the neutral **colors** (white, grays, and black) lie along a central axis. Complementary **colors** (as defined in HSV) lie opposite each other on any horizontal cross-section. For example, in the CIE 1931 color space a color of a "dominant" wavelength can be mixed with an amount of the complementary wavelength to produce a neutral color (gray or white). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At the very beginning of your color mixing journey, learning how to mix **colors** is an essential step. Green is one of the more complicated **colors** to mix because there is so much variation. You may think mixing green is as easy as mixing **yellow** with blue, but things are not so simple. In this article, we will break down the process of making different shades and tints of green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are plenty of ways to pair this vibrant hue with the right accessories. Black is an ideal choice because it matches almost anything, including **yellow**. Dark blue works well with **yellow**, too. This neutral color goes with almost every other hue. The best way to combine black and **yellow** is to wear a black shirt with a **yellow** tie or vice versa. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Forest green paint is actually fairly easy to make. You can start with almost any shade of green, made by mixing **yellow** and blue. To darken the green, you can add a tiny amount of black. You can also try adding a little bit of purple if you do not want to use black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So, if you cannot use **yellow**, what two **colors** make green? You can simply replace the **yellow** with orange to make a range of different green shades. We suggest using a cooler orange, so one that is closer to **yellow** than it is to red. Depending on the exact shade of green you want, you can mix a single orange shade with a range of blues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can create a bright and vivid green shade by blending a cool **yellow** with a cool blue. If you want to paint life-like scenes, you will need more than vivid green. An essential part of mixing green **colors** is knowing how to mute them. If you want to mute the green a little, add a small amount of the complementary color, red. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue is a color that never disappoints. Even with **yellow**, blue and its many shades look absolutely stunning when combined correctly. Blue and **yellow** combination also brings brightness to a room without going overboard.
