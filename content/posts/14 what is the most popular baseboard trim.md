## 14 Interesting Facts What Is The Most Popular Baseboard Trim | How To Choose Baseboards
-   Hardwoods such as maple and oak are the priciest option for **baseboard** materials, but their quality and elegance make them worth the splurge. Costs vary based on the profile and the type of hardwood used. Like pine, these are also prone to warping—don’t forget to check your pieces before purchasing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Different **baseboard** profiles offer different thicknesses. While it’s probably not a forethought in your **baseboard** journey, it’s still important to consider. Not just to be picky—still, by all means, do be picky with your **baseboard**s—but also to complement the **trim** around your door (called the door casing). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Medium-density fiberboard, also known as MDF, is composed of wood, resin, fibers, and other materials. Since it boasts a more consistent texture than wood, manufacturers can sculpt it into a wide variety of shapes, from simplistic to ornate. Likewise, it’s extremely easy to cut, so it’s an excellent option for DIY **baseboard** installs in kitchens, living rooms, and bedrooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Shoe molding is in the same league as quarter round **trim**, but with a slightly different shape. Rather than being a perfect quarter of a cylinder, it is still curved but broader. Like quarter round **trim**, it’s meant to accent and soften the edges of **baseboard**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As the name suggests, this **baseboard** style sports a completely flat profile. It comes in a range of height options, typically falling between 3 and 5 inches tall. The flat shape makes it versatile enough to suit any style of home decor and very easy to clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Pine is another budget-friendly **baseboard** material that comes either primed or unprimed, giving you free rein to paint or stain.

There’s also a possibility of cracks or warping, so be sure to examine all pieces thoroughly before you buy. Keep in mind that wood materials are not an ideal **baseboard** material for bathrooms unless you plan to stain it thoroughly to reduce moisture build-up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re in the mood for something fancier, sculpted **baseboard** **trim** is the ideal pick. This **baseboard** profile features a variety of scalloped or stepped designs on top, moving down to a flat base at the bottom.

-   You may know your **baseboard**s as the crevice-creating **trim** that you always forget to clean . Or you may have never heard the ambiguous-sounding term before. Either way, **baseboard**s are rarely thought about, let alone talked about. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Baseboards also protect drywall from mop water, overturned drinks, and other spills that would otherwise cause moisture damage. They also provide a solid stopping point for dirt and debris.

-   MDF also comes primed and ready to paint, which can be good or bad depending on your plans.

However, homeowners looking to stain their **baseboard**s will have to choose a different material. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Quarter round **trim** is used in tandem with **baseboard**s. It features a flat back and a front shaped like a perfect quarter-slice of a cylinder.

Grab some paint strips from your local hardware store and let your creativity run wild. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
