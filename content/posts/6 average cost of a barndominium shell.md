## 6 Tips for Average Cost Of A Barndominium Shell | Barndominium Cost Calculator
-   Modern **barndominium** interiors are customarily open concept, but that doesn’t mean **barndominium** design stops there. One of the biggest advantages of pole barn homes is how easily these buildings can be customized. A popular customization involves adding a second level. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Barndominiums take significantly less time to build than traditional homes. Instead of the approximate 7 to 12 months for stick framed homes with traditional foundations, **barndominium** homes take 3 to 8 months on average. There are a number of factors that can affect the timeline of a **barndominium** build; however, most post frame constructions are much quicker than other builds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Barndominium floor plans take open concept living to the next level. That’s because **barndominium** design is founded around the natural openness of pole barn interiors. Originally used as barns and agricultural buildings for farmers during the Great Depression, modern **barndominium** interiors embrace the minimalist design of their barn forefathers with open concepts, tall ceilings and exposed trusses. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Living in the Intermountain West, the outdoors is a huge part of everything we do; creating livable outdoor space comes as second nature. Pole barn homes make this an easy customization, as lean-tos make wonderful covered patios that can be enjoyed nearly year-round. While more of a Southern tradition, a **barndominium** with a wrap around porch can provide 360-degree views for sunrises, sunsets and family star gazing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As mentioned above, the average price to build a stick framed home is $100 – $200 per square foot. Pole barns, on the other hand, **cost** $40 – $55 per square foot on average. While this price range only accounts for the building’s warm shell (exterior), concrete floors and a variety of accessories, the most expensive part of building a home is the framing. The savings of post frame construction can be substantial for most home builders. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to exterior treatments, **barndominium**s are not as flexible as conventional builds. Pole barn homes can be finished with metal siding, vinyl siding, or cedar wood and batten, as well as Hardie board. And while stonework can be incorporated in a wainscot, most **barndominium**s keep the exterior design simple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
