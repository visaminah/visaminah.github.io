## 49 Unexpected Facts About How Much Does It Cost To Get A Car Painted | Car Paint Job Cost Estimator
-   So I recently bought a used car from a local dealership and it's a model I've liked and wanted for a long time (2011 Infiniti FX35); it runs great and the interior is pristine; it's got around 157k miles (mostly highway) and is in really great shape except for the exterior paint, which looks like it got caught in a hurricane of gravel or something. There are small chips all over the paint job that expose the metal underneath, mostly on the front hood and fenders but there's at least one on every panel of the car (including the rear). There's also a deep scratch on one of the rear doors and a rash on the other side. With all this, I don't really see much choice than to have the whole car re**painted**. I bought the car at a few hundred below KBB value (around $12,000) and knew about the paint condition, but I didn't realize at the time how expensive repainting this car could be (I've never had to deal with repainting before) and thought it would only add $1,000 or so to the **cost** of ownership to get it fixed (I was stupid). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   When you search how much it **cost**s to get a car **painted**, you’ll find a broad range of prices depending on where you look. Most national chains will offer to repaint a vehicle for around $500 if you just need a basic paint job. However, professional paint restoration can **cost** anywhere from $2,000 to $4,000. High quality paint jobs for luxury models, restoration, or customization can **cost** upwards of $5,000 in most cases. There are many factors that go into the final car paint job **cost** too, including labor, the type of paint, and the type of vehicle you drive through Beverly Hills. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . In this price range, a shop typically uses an inexpensive synthetic enamel paint with a minimum number of coats; they might not paint areas like the door jams or inside the hood; and, in some cases, they may simply mask off rather than take off removable trim and parts (which can result in harsh masking edges or paint in unwanted areas). CostHelper readers report paying for a basic auto paint job at an average price of ; about a third of these readers say they are unhappy with the results. Expect to pay $1,000-$3,500 for a more thorough paint job using higher-quality, brand-name paint, with **cost**s varying depending on the make, model and condition of the vehicle (the amount of rust and number of dents or scratches), and whether any interior or engine-area painting is included. In this price range, the process typically includes additional prep work (sanding, removing rust spots and dents) and ends with three to five applications of clear coat car paint[1] to protect the base paint color and to create a smooth, glossy final look. CostHelper readers report paying $1,000-$1,800 for a mid-quality paint job, at an average **cost** of $1,316 ; most are happy with the results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   : If your vehicle has damage like dents, scratches, or rust, then you will have to pay more in order to have those imperfections repaired before the vehicle can be **painted**. Finishes: Some services will offer to add a finish to your vehicle after a paint job. Typically, a wax finish won’t **cost** you too much more and is well worth the extra **cost**. Other finishes like ceramic coating will **cost** more, but they also offer longer-lasting protection for your vehicle’s paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your time is valuable! Make sure you budget enough time to paint your hood. If you have never **painted** a vehicle before, allow for extra time to practice before you actually start painting. Depending on the amount of prep work needed, and your amount of experience, it will probably take you 10-30 hours to repaint your car hood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "We see it all the time," said Perez, the owner of Ralph Perez Body Repairs in Seminole Heights. "We give a guy an estimate for $3,000 (for a paint job) and he goes nuts because he's seen those commercials and he thinks it should only **cost** $200." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   : Paint quality will also affect the average **cost** to paint a car. Higher quality and long-lasting paints are more expensive, but they’re usually well worth the **cost** since you’ll have to repaint your car far less often (if you ever need to paint it again). Repairs/Restoration : If your vehicle has damage like dents, scratches, or rust, then you will have to pay more in order to have those imperfections repaired before the vehicle can be **painted**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I've heard and read some horror stories about Maaco paint jobs, but most of them seem to focus on their low-grade $599 special; I've seen fewer reports and reviews about their top-of-the-line paint package. I LOVE the car and hope to keep it for a VERY long time, but I'm not stoked about paying like 90% of its current worth for a body-shop job (and even then there are no guarantees of how it will look). Even paying the $2,800 to Maaco isn't my favorite idea but I realize it's an investment and I'm willing to do it if it's worth it. I understand that it's a big job and sort of see why the body shops charge this much, I just don't understand how there's such a huge difference between Maaco's price and the local shops. I realize that to some extent you get what you pay for and that the body shop job would likely be better, but will it really be FOUR TIMES better to justify the quadrupling in **cost**? Maaco claims they'll do the same sanding and prep work and the paint can't be THAT much lower quality to justify 3-4 times the **cost** for the project, right? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The average car hood is about 5 feet by 6 feet or 30 square feet. If you just need the basic paint materials listed above, your final **cost** per square foot will be $4.16-$5.00. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Clear coat will give your hood a glossy finish and add durability. It also **cost**s around $20 a quart. You will be able to apply about three coats of clear coat to a hood per quart of clear coat. Sandpaper: You will need a variety pack of sandpaper to wet sand your hood. A huge pack like this **cost**s about $15. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I've shopped around and got several quotes; local body shops have generally been quoting anywhere from $8,000 to $11,000 to strip all the current paint and apply the new finish; they all promise to basically restore the showroom look. One local shop said that the major problems are only on the front of the car and offered to just strip the front down and repaint the front panels and blend it in with the existing paint, and quoted me $3,900 for that work. A local Maaco gave me a quote for their "Best," top-level paint job at under $2,800, including (they say) stripping the current paint, doing prep work, and applying a base coat and separate clear coat, carrying a 5-year warranty. (They'd do their mid-grade paint job for like $500 less, but I think I'd rather pay the additional for the best paint they have). I should note that the car is currently **painted** black and I'm planning to keep the same color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, up to a point. Specify a neon-pink car on special order and you may limit the buyer base come resale time. It’s also fair to say that metallic cars tend to be more in-demand than ones with solid paint finishes. It can be the case, though, that the paint options on a new car are all fairly ‘safe’ choices, partly as depreciation is such a large factor in a car’s monthly repayments that car makers may not see the point in offering finishes that a) will seldom be chosen and b) may negatively impact a car’s resale value, thus pushing up finance **cost**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   : The size of the vehicle will also affect how much your paint job will **cost**. A compact or midsize sedan will **cost** less to paint than a full-size SUV or truck, for example. Paint Color : Your chosen color will also affect your car paint job **cost**. Standard colors like black, gray, and white are much cheaper than specialized colors. Additionally, you’ll have to pay more if you choose rare colors used by premium automakers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before selecting a shop, look at recently **painted** cars in its parking lot, to see the quality of work done; ask which level of work was done on each vehicle. DoItYourself.com lists tips for finding an auto paint shop[8] . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A high-end paint job may take several weeks, up to months. It will **cost** anywhere from $800 up to $8,000. A custom, showroom quality paint job for an entire vehicle can **cost** up to $20,000, according to a survey done by CostHelper Cars. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   If there is a lot of damage to be repaired, or the hood needs to be replaced, the paint job will **cost** more. The same is true if there is a lot of rust on the hood. Rust needs to be completely removed before the vehicle can be **painted**. Color change: A complete color change is more **cost**ly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The original paint also generally needs to be completely removed in order to completely repaint your car as well. The body shop that you go to for service will also bill time for significant preparations to be able to paint your car properly, like covering windows, tires, and interiors. The mechanic may also have to temporarily disassemble parts of the vehicle too depending on what all you’re getting **painted**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best thing about them is firstly they are **cost**-efficient plus they offer driver easy and reliable services. They transform the car in the way you would wish and start loving it even more.

-   Paint job on roof of car Amount: $0.00 Posted by: a user in Lancaster, OH. Posted: May 21st, 2018 12:05AM I was looking to have the top of my Honda Civic **painted**. It has sun damage on it and Iâd like to get to it before it gets to far gone. How much would this **cost** to have done? Was this post helpful to you? yes no Report prohibited or spam - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By investing in a color-changing car wrap, you'll be giving yourself a more efficient and **cost**-friendly way to get the color you're looking for. Maybe the paint has chipped on your current paint job. Perhaps it's starting to show its age. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a scratch or ding in your car, spot painting can save you time and money. The **cost** will vary based on the size of the area and the necessary prep work. But it typically **cost**s much less than painting an entire car. Be sure to let a professional handle spot painting to ensure that the area blends in well with the rest of the car. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For older vehicles, the **cost** of a professional paint job may be excessive. In these cases, you may wish to try painting the vehicle yourself.

-   It's possible to get a car **painted** for a whole lot less, Perez said. Maaco Auto Repair and Body Works, for example, offers full paint jobs for as little as $229.95. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   : “You get what you pay for” is a hard rule here. Professional vehicle paint jobs will be immaculate, but you’ll also have to pay more for the service.

Vehicle Size : The size of the vehicle will also affect how much your paint job will **cost**.

-   So I'm looking for advice as to what I should do. Before anybody says "Do it yourself!", I work 50-60 hour weeks at the office and have no equipment for doing this kind of project. I don't really have the cash on hand for a $10k paint job and I'm not stoked about pushing the total **cost** of a 10-year-old car up to $22,000. Any experience with the more expensive Maaco jobs? Is there any reason I should consider paying $10,000 for repainting a $12,000 car I just bought? Are there any other options I haven't thought of but should be looking into? TIA for any info or advice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   What are some of the reasons behind the fluctuations in the **cost**s of painting a car? The materials that are involved in the painting process aren’t cheap, including the actual paint itself--automotive enamel is significantly different from other types of DIY paints you may be familiar with. Plus, the amount of paint that will be needed to paint the entire car usually comes out to quite a bit. With all this in mind, you’ll need to look at painting your car as an investment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
