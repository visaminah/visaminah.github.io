## 14 Tips for Wall Mounted Toilet With Tank American Standard | American Standard Wall-Hung Elongated Toilet
-   Bathroom design doesn’t have to be ho-hum. If your style is sleek and modern or more traditional, if you embrace the clean look of white or crave color, or if you have a brand-new home or are working on a historical renovation, there is a **toilet** for you. And finding it can be just as fun as choosing other furnishings. If you want to know the difference between a standard **toilet** vs. a wall-mounted **toilet**, you’ve come to the right place. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most obvious difference, of course, is that a wall-mounted **toilet** hangs on the wall and a standard **toilet** sits on the floor. With a standard **toilet** the **tank** is exposed, sitting atop the bowl. Conversely, the **tank** of a wall-mounted **toilet** is hidden inside the wall, in a frame that’s attached to the studs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Maintenance: Everyone, a time or two, has taken the lid off a **toilet** **tank** and untangled the chain so the flap will close. But if your wall-mounted **toilet** needs repair, the knowledge you grew up with won’t fix it. In Geberit wall-mounted systems, however, removing the flush plate provides access to all the parts necessary for simple repairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not so easy to clean: A standard **toilet** gathers dirt in all its nooks and crannies. Spiders like to build their webs between the **tank** and the wall. Getting a mop behind the base is tricky and the seam around the base is a perfect hiding place for germs and dirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Easy cleaning: With a wall-mount **toilet**, there’s no reason to worry about what lies beneath. Unlike a standard **toilet**, a wall-mounted **toilet** opens up the entire floor for easy cleaning with a damp mop.er, compared to the standard 1.28 gallons required of a new water-saving standard **toilet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Water savings: If you have an older home with original plumbing fixtures, replacing your standard **toilet** with a wall-hung model can save thousands of gallons of water per year. Also, Geberit in-wall **toilet** systems offer built-in dual-flush: a full flush for solid waste and a reduced flush for liquids. The reduced flush uses less than a gallon of wat - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’re probably already wondering if a wall-hung **toilet** will support your weight. Geberit in-wall **toilet** systems are guaranteed to hold up to 880 lbs. (400 kg.) without deforming the frame or damaging the wall. Any properly installed Geberit system will easily hold the weight of the bowl and the person seated on it without sagging. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   American Standard offers a wide range of water closets. Whether you call it a **toilet** or a bathroom sink, American Standard has something for everyone. Our range of **toilet**s are made up of superior quality and are suitable for any place. Easy to install and maintain, these bathroom **toilet**s will definitely add value to your home and bath. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Maintenance: Everything that makes a wall-hung **toilet** work is accessible behind the flush plate, which can be removed without tools. The only downside here is that most of the parts won’t resemble what you’ll find in a standard **toilet**. If you ever need replacement parts, you probably won’t be able to pick them up at the local home center or hardware store. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sweating: When the temperature in the home is warmer than the water in the **toilet** **tank**, condensation forms on the outside of the **tank**. If this condensation is heavy, the water droplets can cause damage to the flooring underneath and mildew to form. Geberit wall-hung **toilet** **tank**s are made of seamless plastic that’s insulated to prevent sweating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Installation: Installing a wall-mounted **toilet** can intimidate do-it-yourselfers, though it’s not impossible for the skilled homeowner. (Geberit offers easy-to-follow installation instructions and spec sheets for all their **toilet** systems.) The **tank** and frame go inside the wall so you need to order the right size frame for your walls, either 2x4 or 2x6, and you’ll need to create an opening in the studs where the frame can fit. You’ll also need to move the plumbing lines for supply and wastewater. If you’re replacing an existing floor-mounted **toilet**, you’ll need to close up the hole in the floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vintage American Standard complete wall mount **toilet** in a light brown beige color, **tank** with lid and round bowl. 3.5gpf, 1950s or 60s era model with Cadet style **tank**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unsightly **tank**: We’re so used to having the **toilet** **tank** in the room with us that we hardly notice it. But there’s no reason it should be there, any more than the water heater should be in the same room as the shower. A standard **toilet** **tank** sits in the bathroom, taking up valuable space and collecting dust, when it should be out of sight and out of mind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Space savings: Most building codes require at least 21 inches of space in front of a **toilet** . The wall-hung **toilet** saves 9-12 inches of space because the **tank** is hidden in the wall. This makes it the perfect choice for tiny homes, small apartments, powder rooms — anywhere extra space is hard to come by. Geberit makes models to fit walls with - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
