## 10 Shocking Facts About Strong Drill Bits For Metal | 
-   Measure and mark the hole, then use a center punch and hammer to make a slight indentation. Drill bits tend to wander when they first start **drill**ing. Therefore the dimple helps the **drill** bit become more steady. The dimple also serves as a reference for where to **drill** your hole. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Carbide **drill** bits are typically harder than cobalt **drill** bits, although both are suitable for **drill**ing stainless steel and other hard **metal**s. However, Carbide **drill** bits retain their sharpness for a longer period than cobalt **drill** bits. They can also be utilized at a faster cutting rate and withstand higher temperatures than cobalt **drill** bits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In computing for the RPM, for example 1"-diameter tool must run at 30 sfm. Based on the equation above, at 30 sfm: (30 ร 3.82) รท 1 = 114.6, this means you have to use 115 RPM to **drill** a 1 inch Rockwell C 40 to 45 steel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Carbide **drill** bits are the toughest **drill** bits available and best for **drill**ing hardened steel. Carbide is a compound made from tungsten and carbon. Carbide **drill** bits are typically composed of steel that has a carbide tip. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, it would be best to exercise caution when using carbide-tipped **drill**s since they can be brittle despite being the hardest. Because of their great strength, they are extensively employed in industrial applications. They can cut through concrete, masonry, tile, and hardened steel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **drill** speed is critical for **drill**ing hardened steel. Drilling at high speeds causes high temperatures, which will damage your **drill** bit. Therefore, **drill**ing hardened steel should be done at a low RPM and feed rate. Feed rates are typically at least 50% lower than for lesser hardness steel. Speeds generally are 30% of that of a non-hardened material. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are short on time, the best **drill** bits for hardened steel are carbide-tipped bits. They are the most suitable **drill** bits for hardened steel due to their robust and heat-resistant properties. However, there are other options such as titanium and cobalt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rockwell hardness testing is a standard method for determining the hardness of **metal**s and polymers. Rockwell hardness is measured with a device known as a Rockwell hardness tester. The tougher the steel is, the higher the number on the RC scale. The higher the RC number, the slower the **drill** speed should be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When **drill**ing through hardened steel, you must ensure that your **drill** bit is made from tougher materials. Carbide bits are the strongest **drill** bits material and can cut through hardened steel. But if they are not available, titanium and cobalt **drill** bits can also be used. However, **drill**ing with either of these bits will take longer than **drill**ing with a carbide **drill** bit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Make sure the piece of **metal** is in a flat and secure area. Holding the **metal** with one hand while running the **drill** with the other is not a good idea. It is better to secure the **metal** with a clamp. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
