## 16 Tips for Does Chrome Spray Paint Work On Plastic | Painting Plastic Chrome
-   Although it may seem heavy and limit your movement ever so slightly, it is vital to ensure that you wear both long sleeves and trousers during **spray**ing. Chromium used in the ingredients of chrome **spray** **paint** can begin to irritate the skin when exposed and cause a number of skin reactions. Keep in mind that chrome **spray** **paint** can stain clothing, so ensure that you wear old clothing that you do not mind getting dirty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The possibilities when experimenting with chrome **spray** **paint** are endless. It is an ideal, cost-effective alternative to adding a modernised touch to a number of different items. Regardless of what you’re **spray**ing, it is imperative to ensure that you have implemented the adequate safety precautions to ensure that you do not inhale any harmful toxins and do not run the risk of a fire. Always make sure that your skin, eyes and mouth are covered and that you are only using **spray** **paint** in a well-ventilated area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spray **paint** should only ever be used in a well-ventilated area, whether this may be through the use of a **spray**ing booth or merely stepping into the great outdoors. Failing to use **spray** **paint** in a well-ventilated area comes alongside a plethora of different safety hazards. Not only do you run the risk of inhaling toxic fumes, but also dramatically increase the likelihood of a fire. Any **paint** fumes that are left to come into contact with an electrical discharge will quickly ignite a fire. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You would be surprised by the number of household appliances that can be upscaled using a touch of chrome **spray** **paint**. Full items can be **spray**ed or merely small sections. The **paint** is ideal for appliances such as toasters, kettles, ovens and even radiators. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The foundation of all sleek **paint** jobs is a smooth, clean base. With this in mind, it is imperative to begin the application process by thoroughly cleaning the surface, entirely removing all dust, debris and grime. Use a clean, warm and damp cloth to gently scrub the surface to lift all dirt; preferably a microfibre cloth. Microfibre cloths are made using a combination of nylon and polyester to create a super soft material filled with fine fibre to grab dirt. We suggest using circular motions to ensure that all dust grips to the cloth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Due to the versatility of chrome **spray** **paint**, you most definitely are not limited to the wide variety of different items you can transform. Whether you opt for adding a touch of chrome to your vehicle’s exterior mirrors or aim to revamp vintage furniture, chrome **spray** **paint** is capable of fulfilling the role. Below are just some of the many opportunities when considering the uses of chrome **spray** **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Chrome effect is a relatively new addition to the world of **spray** **paint**ing. While chrome **spray** **paint** has a similar texture to those of an aerosol, it produces a silver nitrate which is capable of offering a 98% reflection rate. During the **spray**ing process, a clever response occurs between the **paint** fragments and chemicals in the solution, therefore, producing a higher reflection rate than any other **spray** **paint** type. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many assume that any form of gloves is capable of shielding your hands from **spray** **paint**; however, this isn’t the case. It is essential only to use rubber gloves as plastic gloves, unfortunately, are not able to handle the corrosive substances used in chrome **paint**. If you are unable to find rubber gloves, those made from neoprene or PVC work equally as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Last, but most definitely not least, it is time to **spray** on your chrome **paint**. As the surface has been adequately prepped and primed, this should be the most straightforward step in the application process. To ensure that you achieve an even finish, it is important to hold your **spray** can at least 10 inches away from the surface and continuously move to avoid lots of **paint** building up on one area. Only once layer should be required when using chrome **spray** **paint**; however, a second can be added as and where you see fit. If you do opt for **spray**ing a second layer, ensure that the first is fully dried before beginning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light fixtures are often the last component of the home that is updated and tends to go many years unchanged, collecting dust. If you still like the appearance of your light fixtures, however, they are beginning to appear outdated, then re**spray**ing them with a chrome coating is a fantastic idea. The Country Chic Cottage website has a super easy tutorial on how to **spray** **paint** light fixtures to maximise results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I fear that you may be disappointed with the results. You will not get the shine of chrome on polished metal, unfortunately. For that, you would need the plastic to be plasma **spray**ed with suitable metal and then polished to a very good finish before chrome plating. The plasma **spray**ing is not as hot as you might think, and many plastics will survive, but polishing will generate lots of heat so I don't think it is practicable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are using professional **spray**ing equipment as opposed to canned **spray** **paint**, then there is also **spray** primer available to purchase. On the other hand, if you are sticking to traditional canned **spray** **paint**, then we suggest using a large, flat **paint**brush to **paint** a thin layer on primer onto the surface. When **paint**ing on primer, we do suggest opting for a second coat once the initial layer has dried. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While **spray**ing the entire vehicle chrome may only be suited to drivers with a bolder personality, many opt for **spray**ing small segments of their car to add a modern touch. One of the most popular uses of chrome automotive **spray** **paint** on a vehicle is to renew alloys and add a fresh layer of colour over the top. It is ideal if you have a small scrape which you hope to disguise as opposed to purchasing brand new alloys. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We suggest opting for a jet black base coat, which again, can be **spray**ed or **paint**ed depending on the method that is best suited to you. Generally speaking, **spray**ing on a black coating will only require one coat, whereas **paint**ing will benefit from two or three layers. Always ensure that you allow at least 24 hours for the black base coat to dry before you continue to apply your chrome **spray** **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **spray**ing mask is one of the most common forms of protective clothing you see people wear when **spray** **paint**ing. Wearing a face mask is even more important if you suffer from health conditions that affect your breathing such as asthma or have severe allergies. A **spray**ing mask covers both the mouth and nose to ensure that no dust or harmful chemicals are inhaled. Masks can be picked up from online retailers such as Online Safety Supplies and Frontline Safety. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A primer is a key step in any **paint**ing process to guarantee the longevity of your outcome. Priming a surface not only creates an adhesive base for the **paint** to stick to but also allows you to smooth out any uneven surfaces for a seamless finish. You will need to ensure that you purchase a primer made specific to the item you wish to **spray**. If you’re unsure, then we suggest visiting a reputable DIY shop and asking a member of staff to recommend the best primer to fit your requirements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
