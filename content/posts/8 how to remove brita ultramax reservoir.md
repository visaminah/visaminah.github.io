## 8 Fun Facts How To Remove Brita Ultramax Reservoir | How To Take Apart Brita Pitcher Handle
-   The most important thing is to never fill your pitcher above the Max Fill line. If you don’t have a Max Fill line, then fill the **reservoir** to just below the top. While it’s not the end of the world if you overfill your Brita pitcher filter, it’s best to avoid doing it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brita pitcher filters are all designed the same. They have a **reservoir** on top that you fill with untreated water. This water flows via gravity through the filter into the pitcher below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most Brita pitcher filters have a Max Fill line to let you know how much water you can put in the pitcher. Brita warns against overfilling because water will spill into the handle and leak out of the pitcher. Overfilling also makes it difficult to pour water from the pitcher because the **reservoir** is on top and unfiltered water can spill into your glass. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Overfilling also makes it difficult to pour water from the pitcher because the **reservoir** is on top. If you don’t hold the lid in place, it is possible that the lid and **reservoir** can come loose and spill all of the unfiltered water. Fortunately, the lid fits fairly snug, so this usually won’t happen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When we had each water filter pitcher in hand, we focused primarily on performance. We measured how long it took to filter the water from the moment the tank filled up until it was safe to pour into our cup. We rated the water filtration product’s design based on the size of the **reservoir** tank compared to the pitcher. In other words, if the tank is significantly smaller than the overall pitcher, it takes much longer to refill. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Avoid filling above the MAX FILL line. The purpose of this line is to help you avoid overfilling the **reservoir**, which can cause water to spill into the handle and leak out of the pitcher.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Completely open the Fill Lid. Fill the **reservoir** with water all the way to the labeled “Max Fill” line. Shut the Fill Lid. Do not keep the Fill Lid open for longer than 5 seconds unless you are filling the **reservoir** with water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have tons of space, this filter should definitely be on your radar. It holds an enormous 18 cups, so it doesn’t make sense for a pint-size, apartment-style fridge, but compared to others of the same size, its square-shaped design made it easier to stack in the fridge or push against a counter. The **reservoir** tank to overall size ratio was great, and of all of the larger-size dispensers, this one was the fastest to fill up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
