## 5 Tips for How To Turn Curtains Into Blackout Curtains | How To Attach Blackout Lining To Curtains With Hooks
-   Once the **blackout** lining is fixed along both sides of the **curtains** you can fix it at the bottom of the curtain in the same manner. You’ll then be left with the extra hem fabric hanging loose below the lined curtain. To finish this off you’ll need to add a second layer of hemming tape to the hem fabric and the lining to join the hem together and create a neat and professional finish that you’ll be proud of. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you have got your **curtains** to the right size you can cut out your lining to fit inside the hem at the bottom and sides of your **curtains**. One of the easiest ways to do this is to place your lining fabric over the top of the back of your **curtains** flat on the floor and hold it in place with sewing pins. This will then let you check the size and make sure that your hems overlap the lining. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Night Time is a woven **blackout** curtain that can be used as either a stand-alone curtain or as an add on to your existing ready mades. Black yarn has been woven into the fabric to prevent the majority of light from shining through. The front and the back of the fabric are identical in colour and the finish is soft, with a silk-like feel, which is why this product is suitable as a stand-alone curtain or as a lining. The eyelet option can be combined with an existing Stuart Graham ready-made on a single rod. See below for a step-by-step instruction guide on how it’s done. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you can line your **curtains** you’ll need to hang and measure your **curtains** to work out if they need to be taken up at all. Ideally, you want your **curtains** to sit around 4 to 12 inches from the floor, 6 inches below your window sill or ½ an inch above your window sill. A lot depends on the position of your radiators and whether you want your **curtains** to be full length and trail to the floor or would like them to hang slightly higher. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the easiest ways to join your **blackout** lining to your **curtains** is with the help of something called fusible hemming web. This can be used for joining two fabrics together. Simply place the hemming web tape between the two fabrics and then using a standard iron press together until they are bonded. Start by working from the top of the curtain to the bottom keeping the hemming tape and fabric in place with the help of sewing pins. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
