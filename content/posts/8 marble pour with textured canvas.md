## 8 Facts Marble Pour With Textured Canvas | Acrylic Pouring Marble Effect
-   Below is the **canvas** example I created‚Ä¶.the only difference I noted was that you get the texture from the **canvas** on the surface while the Art Block is smooth. I also added gold glitter through this one which looks beautiful when the sunlight catches it. This would be a wonderful addition to your desk. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The pouring medium is self-leveling so once you place it on a flat surface to set it will level out and make a smooth finish. But make sure your surface is completely level or you will find the paint will continue to move across your **canvas** (potentially ruining your artwork). It takes about a day to fully cure‚Ä¶..and resist the urge to touch! I left mine for about 9 hours then removed the masking tape and then left it to finish curing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once all of the paints have been thinned out by the water and dish soap, you will take your final cup, and pour all of your paints together into the cup. Don‚Äôt hesitate to get creative and pour different amounts of each color into the final cup. Inconsistency with the paints can create a more visually appealing mixture for your **marble** art! Tip: do NOT mix the colors together, simply pour them into the cup. Do not shake or stir them together. If you do mix them, this will cause the colors to blend into each other and become a mucky mixture rather than a distinct color pattern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you have a lot of the **canvas** covered pick up your baking tray, while using your fingers to hold the **canvas** in place and tilt your art work so the colours swirl and spread across the surface. This gives you the ‚Äúmarbling‚Äù effect we are after. Now is a good time to tell you this is when it gets a bit messy! You may want to wear gloves as the ‚Äúpaint mixture‚Äù will drip over the edges. Work quickly as the ‚Äúpaint mixture‚Äù will start to skin quickly. (It took me about 10mins from pouring to completely cover the Art Block) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As a final tip for anyone who wants to actually give this a try, I would suggest using less colours to do your first attempt. I found when I did the green one on the **canvas** I could control the results more as I had less competing colours. I used a dark and light green, white and tiny bits of black, along with the sprinkling of gold glitter and because the greens blended well together the colours were easier to manipulate. Just a tip from me to you üòâ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, just leave your **canvas** to dry and once that‚Äôs complete, proudly display your new art piece to your dorm, apartment or home! (As an FYI, **marble** art takes a long time to dry due to the large quantity of paint used to create it. You may want to let it be for a full day depending on your paint thickness/amount of paint used.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For the one I created here I used my Art Block base, which you can find the tutorial for here. You can also do this on a **canvas** and I will show you a finished one on **canvas** at the end, just so you know you can achieve the same result. I taped the edge of my Art Block off first as this medium will drip down the sides and the masking tape once removed leaves a nice clean edge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Few things are more pleasing than colorful swirls of paint oozing over a **canvas** and creating alluring **marble** art. What isn‚Äôt nearly as delightful, is looking at the price tag of most **marble** art. Luckily, this form of decor isn‚Äôt difficult to create on your own and can be made after just one trip to your local craft store. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
