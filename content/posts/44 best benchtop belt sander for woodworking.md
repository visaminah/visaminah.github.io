## 44 Tips to Best Benchtop Belt Sander For Woodworking | 8 Best Belt Sander Reviews: Ultimate Wood Finishing Power Tools
-   Like the WEN, the BD4600 is a standard-size **benchtop** **sander** with a 4" x 36" belt and a 6" disc. In terms of power, it has just a bit more juice, though, with a 4.6 amp motor that turns over at about 3,600 rpm. It's been know to perform slightly better on hardwoods than the WEN does. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Warranty is another factor that you have to take into consideration. The best bench **sander**s are relatively simply-made tools, and thus you would expect a good one to last a very, very long time. Anything with less than a 2-year manufacturer warranty is likely not worth wasting your money on, though really good products (like this Porter-Cable) will have a 3+ year limited warranty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes you’ll see combination bench **sander**s with a belt **sander** and a spindle **sander**. The spindle **sander** is a small-ish cylindrical **sander** that’s most often used for smoothing edges on curved boards. If you have a use for it, it’s irreplaceable as you can’t sand a curved edge with a flat belt **sander**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. Ridgid EB4424 SThe Ridgid EB4424 is an excellent performing and very well-made bench **sander**, but it's not the standard belt/disc combo like the other two above. It's an oscillating/edge-specific **sander**, meaning you can't use it for sanding flat surfaces like the faces of cabinet doors, etc. It's a fantastic option if you'll be using it mostly for rounding edges or sanding curved pieces of wood. Expand to see more Key Features: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spec-wise, this **sander** is nearly identical to the WEN 6502; it runs a 4" x 36" belt with a 6" disc **sander** on a 4.3 amp, 3,600 RPM motor. If it were cheaper, it'd easily get our nod for #1 pick. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our top pick for the best belt **sander** is the Makita 9403 Belt Sander. Makita is well-known for its quality and easy-to-use power tools so you know you can trust its belt **sander** to deliver a solid working performance. With loads of power and an intuitive design, this best-in-class **sander** is an essential sanding tool for both professional and DIY woodworking enthusiasts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, you certainly don’t want to overlook dust collection. We ensured that each pick on our selection of the 10 best had at least some sort of dust port or collection mechanism. Naturally, **benchtop** sanding is a mess that produces a ton of sawdust, so unless you prefer being covered head to toe, you’re going to want something with a functional (a lot of the ones we’ve seen in the past are borderline useless) collection mechanism. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Why we like it: Although the Bosch ROS20VSC orbit **sander** is light weighing just 3.5lb it packs a mighty punch and it’s definitely not too lightweight to handle heavy duty jobs. Although the Bosch ROS20VSC orbit **sander** is light weighing just 3.5lb it packs a mighty punch and it’s definitely not too lightweight to handle heavy duty jobs. Editor’s Rating: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A lightweight **sander** can also pose a problem if you need to work continuously for an hour or more and the motor can overheat. So for smaller jobs or working in a tight spot choose a lightweight belt **sander**. For large industrial or DIY projects, choose a heavier and tougher **sander**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The disc and belt **sander** tables can be adjusted to 45° to work on contour sanding and detail work. It has a motor that has 1/3 horsepower at 110 volts. The belt’s dimensions are 1″x30″ and the disc is 5″ in diameter. It also has a removable belt platen and idler roller guard and two dust ports. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Handles are extremely important for any type of power tool. Belt **sander**s usually come with 2 handles, 1 large handle at the back and a knob style handle at the front, which gives you optimal control over the tool. Ergonomic handles that are comfortable to hold and give you a good secure grip, will make your sanding tasks so much easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Bosch ROS20VSC orbit **sander** comes with a microfilter system with a contractor bag and a vacuum hose adapter. It weighs 3.5lb and has the dimensions of 9″ x 5″ x 6″. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although the belt **sander** is a bit heavier at 8.68lbs, it is well balanced, which helps you to maintain precise flush sanding against vertical surfaces. The GALAX PRO features 2 ergonomic handles, a solid back handle, and the 3-position front handle that can be adjusted to a comfortable position to suit your tasks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You also get a durable working table, a T-square and mounting parts for your **sander**. On the side, you will find a yellow knob to adjust your sand belt when you need to. The disc is strategically situated so it doesn’t obstruct the movement of the belt on top of the unit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And lastly, nowadays, with the immense amount of online resources, the obvious thing not to forget about is the general customer reviews and feedback. These are the people actually out there, spending their hard-earned money on these tools and getting their hands dirty using them, so you can expect that they’re going to be the ones that provide the best, most accurate overall information as to whether a **sander** is or is not a good performer and a good value price-wise. In addition to looking over actual manufacturer specifications, consumer feedback was one of our most important criteria when compiling the Top 10 list – every **sander** included has been very well-received by the general consumer market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The discs can be changed fast and easily & don’t require any tools. You don’t have to mount the unit or use any added components to get it working. Since you’re controlling where the machine goes, you’re able to reach those stubborn places you wouldn’t be able to with a mounted **sander**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Kalamazoo runs smoothly and has a powerful motor for all your heavy duty projects. The belt is especially good for knife making; for the handle and the blade. You’re able to use this **sander** for virtually any project as you can use the belt on other soft materials other than wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   8. Rockwell RK7866 Concluding our list of the Top 8 best bench **sander**s is the Rockwell RK7866. Many people love this standard-sized 4" x 36" **sander** for its easy belt-changing ability. Expand to see more Key Features: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tightening the **sander** is made easier with the handy adjustment knob that makes sure the belt remains in the correct position. Its tool-free belt tracking design maximizes operator control and convenience. The lock-on switch allows you to work easier for longer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1. WEN 6502 The WEN 6502 is hands down our top pick for the best bench **sander** for DIY'ers. Make no mistake here; this is by no means a commercial-grade tool. On the contrary, it's specifically designed and manufactured for light work and with DIY'ers in mind, most of which are assumed to have a rather limited amount of garage space. Expand to see more Key Features: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That’s all depending on what you want your finished product to be. Benchtop belt **sander**s are commonly used for refinishing projects, where old paint or varnish needs to be sanded of boards. In this case, it’s common to use a coarse grit paper like a 36-grit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As for what they’re used for, bench **sander**s are typically used after the jointer/planer, wherein edges and faces on roughly milled lumber stuck need to be touched up before being worked with. Or, they can be used to sand down a board to a particular thickness, round edges, smooth surfaces, etc. – there’s really no end to what you can do with a good bench **sander**, hence their criticalness to the woodworking shop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Why we like it: The Makita BO5041 orbit **sander** is used by many hobbyists, carpenters and professional construction workers as it is versatile & it’s a powerful handheld power tool. The Makita BO5041 orbit **sander** is used by many hobbyists, carpenters and professional construction workers as it is versatile & it’s a powerful handheld power tool. Editor’s Rating: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bosch manufactures **sander**s that are easy to use and maintain. The ergonomic design ensures you don’t experience hand and wrist fatigue as you work. It’s light in weight which helps you control the movement of the **sander** to give a clean and smooth finish to your work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The belt and disc **sander**s are both your standard sizes, at 4" x 36" and 6", respectively, and the 4.6 amp motor registers in at 3,600 rpm - plenty of juice for light work such as touching up 2' x 4's, or smoothing out softwoods like pine and balsa. However, it will tend to bog down or even stall if you try and push its limits with heavier pieces (like 4" x 4" posts) or harder materials like walnut or maple. Most folks who work with premium materials or with larger pieces like full-size fence posts know they will need to make the jump up to a more powerful unit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Makita BO5041 orbit **sander** comes in an all blue outer construction with black details. The handle is made with a non-slip black rubber grip for stability and safety. There are dials that are easy to locate which help you change the speed of your disc **sander**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Why we like it: The JET J-41002 is a heavy duty **sander** designed to deliver a super smooth finish to any surface you’re working on. This versatile machine can sand, grind and prime those hard to reach areas on any outside surface.

This versatile machine can sand, grind and prime those hard to reach areas on any outside surface. Editor’s Rating: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Why we like it: This is the most heavy duty **sander** on this list which is important if you want minimal vibration and no wobbling for those bigger tasks. This is the most heavy duty **sander** on this list which is important if you want minimal vibration and no wobbling for those bigger tasks. Editor’s Rating: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another reason this one didn't get our top pick is that it's just a bit pricier than the WEN. All in all, though, it is a good intermediate pick between something like the Ridgid edge **sander** and the WEN. The inclining disc **sander** table adds an extra element of functionality if you plan on doing angle edge sanding along with horizontal/vertical/inclined belt sanding for wide, flat faces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Power is, of course, another thing that you want to look at when considering your **benchtop** **sander** options. For typical DIY choices, we look for something with a 110-volt power supply. Larger commercial or industrial **sander**s might have a 220-volt source (like the plug on your air conditioner unit, refrigerator, etc.); having an additional 220-volt wall plug professionally installed in a typical garage or workshop would be inconvenient and unnecessarily costly for a DIYer. A 4″ x 36″ belt **sander** can obtain plenty of power from a standard 100-volt outlet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, another thing we keep a keen eye out for is adjustability. The belt **sander** on any **benchtop** **sander**, no matter the size or brand, should be fully adjustable and used in vertical and horizontal positions or any inclined position in between. Often, when you’re using a bench **sander**, you’ll find yourself in some really awkward/strange positions, and you’ll need to be able to adjust your belt accordingly to get to the surface or edge that needs sanding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Why we like it: The Rikon 50-112 belt disc **sander** may seem expensive because of its quality construction but this unit is actually moderately priced for what you get.

Editor’s Rating: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The large worktop covers more area and is designed for additional stability and the locking button allows for continuous operation. You can use this belt **sander** for a variety of projects. Its belt tension lever makes it so easy to change the sandpaper and the toolless adjusting knob ensures easy belt tracking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   6. Porter-Cable PCB420SA TThe 4" x 36" Porter-Cable 420SA is a well-built bench **sander** that has one of the better warranties of all the picks on our list and is a popular choice because of the larger 8" disc **sander** disc. Expand to see more Key Features: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The sanding belt’s dimension come at 4″x 36″ which tilts to a 90° angle with a 2.25″ belt roller. The disc **sander** is 6″ that comes with a 6.25″x9″ table. The 1/2 horsepower motor that works on 120 volts gives the belt speed of 1900 SFPM and the disc speed of 3450 RPM. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to stationary **sander**s, weight and construction materials make all the difference in the world in terms of vibration. Generally, bench **sander**s of this price range are made out of a light gauge steel or even plastic frame, but the WEN 6502 is full-on cast iron (though beware, they also make a steel base one for about $10 less… make sure to go with the cast iron). The tool is rock solid at a hefty 44 lbs, and exactly the kind of beef that you want to see in a good bench **sander**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   7. JET J-41002 The JET J-41002 is by far the best performing and best quality **sander** on our list, but it's also the most expensive. Expand to see more Key Features: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Rockwell RK7866 has a sanding belt with the dimensions of 4″ x 36″ with a 0° to 90° angle adjustment. The disc **sander** is 6″ and has a 0° to 45° adjustable work table. The 4.3 amp motor has 1/2 horsepower that powers up the sand belt and disc. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ease-of-use is another key criterion used in the evaluation of any belt **sander**, although this one is a bit harder to quantify. The engineering of some tools, bench **sander**s included, is just not good and not well-thought-out. Plenty of tools in the past that are just uncomfortable, awkward, or downright painful to operate. Thus, we always make it a point to incorporate “user-friendliness” and general ease of use into the consideration of whatever tool we’re operating or reviewing. Each of the top-10 picks above for the best bench **sander**s were simple to use, comfortable, and convenient to operate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Why we like it: The Black + Decker orbit **sander** is a handheld device which means it’s fully portable and can be used for indoor & outdoor projects.

Editor’s Rating: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While not an absolute staple item like a table saw or a cordless drill, a good bench **sander** is an excellent supplement to any power tool arsenal. It is a great way to add a level of convenience and functionality to your DIY garage. And, of course, if you plan on setting up a proper woodworking shop, making the investment in a quality bench **sander** is a necessity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   5. RIKON Power Tools 50-151 The Rikon 50-151 is a slightly different option than any others, with a fixed 1" x 30" vertical belt **sander** and a slightly smaller 5" disc **sander**. Expand to see more - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This handheld power tool has a 2.5-amp motor that’s powered by 120 volts. The dial allows you to change the disc speed between 7,500OPM and 12,000OPM. The dimension of the disc **sander** is 5″ and can be changed using the integrated hook & loop system. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
