-   As with everything, even an all-rounder like this **printer** has some disadvantages too. For one, it's heavy and not portable, despite it being a wireless **printer**. It can be extremely difficult to bring it to and from your office or home. Plus, the running cost isn't as cheap compared to other devices. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you need something that will print big, look no further than 11x17 **printer**s. Especially in design and architecture, having a top-tier wide format **printer** by your side is life-saving. No longer will you have to suffer the agony of not seeing your creativity on paper, but you won’t have to worry about missing details or lines on your design! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since it’s meant for photos, it naturally doesn’t excel in black and white printing. Although you’ll get legible prints, it lacks the clarity that other **printer**s on the list provides. It also has a higher running cost, but it will work beautifully with low-volume printing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You get different results, whether you use an inkjet or **laser** **printer**. Inkjet **printer**s are generally accepted to be better at printing photos, so you might want to look into it if you run a photo gallery.

-   If you have been searching online for the best 11x17 color **laser** **printer** that prints big documents, then you may have found the choice limiting. The reason for this is that most office **printer**s are inkjet-based for 11x17 printing. Large **laser** **printer**s are very expensive because they need a bigger drum and toners but they are superb for specialist printing like architect drawings or for technical drawings that require a high level of resolution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best for: Just about every large format print job you could think of. This tabloid **printer** has the best reviews, and we agree entirely.

-   First, you need to ask yourself these questions. Color or black and white? Do you want two-sided printing? How much printing will you do?

-   For one, color ink costs a lot more than black and white ink. So if you use large format **printer**s for spreadsheets and data reports, investing in a b&w **printer** would make more sense. You’ll save money with your ink choice, but you’d also get a faster print for more efficiency. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

You can also print from a smartphone, tablet or computer remotely on to the M750 through the HP ePrint printing app. Pros: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Speed: You would think that a tabloid **printer** would take longer to print out, not this Canon. With a print speed of up to 14.5 PPM, you won’t wait long for your Excel document to be on your clients' or boss's desk. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hidden costs are costs associated with your **printer** usage that are less easy to identify. Wait time is a good example as you might not get as much done if your **printer** couldn’t print the volume you need in a day. Optimal print quality (or the reprint time needed to get the best results) also matters as you’d be wasting money and paper if your **printer** doesn’t give you the desired results. If these are issues you foresee, get **printer**s with built-in tools that help you minimize these problems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There will always be a need to print out large documents at acceptable PPM. For instance, designers and architects might need to print out clients' drawings. A product designer could benefit from technical drawings or a complete Excel spreadsheet being printed to greater output. That’s when a larger color **printer** comes into consideration. Take a look at our best 11x17 **printer** reviews for 2021, where we feature good quality **printer**s at affordable prices. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For an optimal level of performance and speed, you have to figure out what your system is. There’s no point in getting a fast-performing **printer** if your **printer** sits idle most of the time. Conversely, there’s no point in having a **printer** that can’t process new files while printing if you own a print-heavy office. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Resolution: We like the Optimum Image Generating System that is inbuilt with the Pro-100. It automatically selects rich color ledger-sized formats for you without messing with **printer** settings. The results are amazing with retina-like printouts on photo paper and HD quality sharp, defining text and line drawings on normal paper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choose an inkjet if you need high-quality photo printing. If you require excellent photo print quality then opt for the Canon, alternatively, for a fraction of the price we recommend you buy our 2021 best buy 11x17 inkjet **printer**, which is the HP 7740. It’s a good all round **printer** that can handle everyday printing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A smart business owner would consider the cost. But a wise business owner would consider the value. Basing your decision on price alone isn’t the smartest decision as you aren’t considering all the hidden costs associated with the cheapest **printer**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Flashy touchscreens and advanced features might sound great on paper, but they can soon become redundant if your employees don’t know how to use them. Worse, they might even get demotivated by how unresponsive the machine is and actively avoid using it. Train your employees to use the **printer**’s features. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Printers are annoying. All of them. But if you want to keep your annoyance to a minimum, we recommend a **laser** **printer**: Not only do **laser** models print sharp text and crisp graphics, but they also run more reliably than inkjets and won’t clog if they sit unused for weeks between jobs. The best **laser** **printer** is the powerful, versatile HP Color LaserJet Pro M255dw . It’s easy to set up and simple to use, and it produces great-looking results, both in color and in black and white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another all-rounder and a perfect choice for businesses and offices is the Epson Workforce Pro WF-7820 **printer**. It's great for tabloid (11x17) printing as it comes with supertabloid and borderless tabloid printing, which maximizes paper space, plus it won't change the formatting you did on the computer. It even comes with a wider format and can print on 13x19-inch papers. Furthermore, it's also a fast **printer**, so you can print quite a few documents each day. You can get all that and more for a relatively cheaper price than its competitors on the market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Furthermore, you would need good **printer**s in your day-to-day office operation for scanning or large format printing. With 11x17 **printer**s, you can print up to A3 size (tabloid size) for your bigger designs. Effective wide format **printer**s also print much faster, bumping your office’s efficiency up a notch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Brother MFC-J6545DW **printer** can do everything you need it to do: print, copy, scan, and fax tabloid pages, so it's also a pretty good consideration for its all-roundedness. When it comes to its printing capability, it does produce high-quality printed documents and can do so quite fast enough, meaning you can print a good number of tabloid pages a day. The company has also reengineered the ink cartridges so it can hold more ink. This means that it has a low running cost. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Global supply chain issues have made it more difficult to find some of our **printer** picks, and have caused the price of others to jump. As of this writing, our budget pick is out of stock, but all Brother L2300-series models will get you similar print performance with slight speed or feature differences. The HL-L2370DW is a particularly close relative that seems to be more readily available at the moment. If you’re considering oth er **printer**s in this series, just be aware that the letters after the number indicate key features: D for duplex printing and W for wireless. Some models drop one or the other, so be sure to check before buying. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Connectivity: Print from your mobile phone via Wi-Fi network, Apple AirPrint, or Google Cloud. You can also connect the Expression Photo HD XP-15000 to your wired local network via high-speed USB / Ethernet cable. Although quite lightweight for a tabloid **printer** it’s best to find a suitable spot in the home or office on a quality **printer** cart. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   At 22 pages per minute, it's not quite as fast as some larger **printer**s, but the first page is out in about 10 seconds, and it's compatible with any way you prefer to print or scan, including plenty of mobile and wireless options.

It stands out from the competition with an easy-to-use, smartphone-style touch interface and 21st-century mobile and PC software that makes daily use far less frustrating than on other **printer**s we’ve tried.

It’s fast, topping out at around 17 pages per minute, and it can print on envelopes, labels, and other odd-size media thanks to a handy bypass slot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, one of the most obvious cons of this all-around **printer** is its graphics outpost, which could do better. As with most wireless **printer**s, you might also have some problems connecting it to devices from time to time, according to customer reviews.
