However, choosing the perfect shade can be a daunting process. When you can’t make it to the **paint** store and leave with your pockets stuffed with color swatches, there’s now a **paint** color app for that! Many apps, in fact, to make finding the right shade and even ordering **paint** online easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Scroll through popular **colors** and get suggestions for shades based on the mood you want to set in the room. A color match option allows you to match **paint** **colors** to items around you by uploading a photo from your camera roll. You can save favorites or share them with friends. Easily order your choices by purchasing through the app or finding a store location close by. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Typically, we all tend to get a bit stressed out when it comes to selecting a **paint** color. We may go to the store and bring home hundreds of **paint** chips to look at. Or, we may **paint** a wall with a sample or two of **paint**. But for some of us, this process is still very hard to visualize the entire room or house exterior **paint**ed a certain color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   From siding and shingles to fences, decks, and outdoor furniture, choosing the perfect stain color can be a challenge.

These easily accessible tools may be able to assist you in making a more confident decision. Or make it a little less scary to go for that more daring **paint** color! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. “Painting” the color onto photo. The tech is ok. It does leave a white outer line around “**paint**ed area”, so that can be distracting. I also had an actual **paint** swatch on the wall, so it had a white line around that swatch too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With more than 3,500 **paint** **colors** to choose from, having the opportunity visualize them in your space before you **paint** is a good idea. You can explore **paint** color combinations with the sample room designs provided or upload your own photo to use as a canvas. With the upload option, you can define up to five surfaces to **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Easily upload photos of your project to get started on the Paint My Place **paint** color app. Not affiliated with any one brand, this app allows you to try out **paint**, roof, and fence **colors** from a variety of different brands. If you’re looking for endless color options, the paid version offers more than 50,000 **paint** choices from 32 brands, including some of our favorites such as Benjamin Moore, Valspar, PPG, and Sherwin Williams. A variety of **paint** “tools” and the ability to modify opacity allow for a precise virtual **paint**ing experience. Save, email and share your color choices with friends, your interior designer, or a local **paint**er or **paint** retailer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   McCormick Paints lets you choose a standard generic interior home image of a bedroom, hallway, kitchen or dining room and then change the color around on the walls. You can also upload your own photo to its Color Visualizer, which we suggest as that's ideally what you want to see, how **paint** looks in your own space. You can even add **paint** to trim, like window frames and doors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Taking photos and allowing app to access certain photos worked fine. When looking over color swatches, the names of **colors** weren’t available to see (you’re going on small color swatch alone). Once you click on a color and it takes you to your chosen photo, there isn’t anyway to “undo” or “page back” if you don’t want that color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thankfully, a wave of house **paint** color apps is making the task easier by letting you **paint** your wall virtually or match a **paint** color to a photo. Even better, these room **paint**ing apps are free and Android- and Apple-compatible. Here are our top picks for the best **paint** apps available. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With Sherwin-Williams's Color Snap, you can create color palettes and match **colors** to a photo on your phone. The great thing about the app's color-match feature is that it will automatically pick out the **colors** in the photo that it can match and create a palette with those **colors**. The app also allows you to click on a certain color to match, and the palette will include a selection of complementary **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What we liked about this site's app was the fact that the actual **paint** swatches gave us the chip, color and number so we could order the exact color of **paint** if we chose. We also had options to look at all **colors** available, pick from a select palette, or even match **colors** from an existing photo. You can order your **paint** directly from the app too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This simple app allows you to snap a photo of your space and upload it quickly, then use a **paint** bucket to test out different color options. A color picker allows you to swap out shades easily or use multiple **colors** at once to try out an accent wall—a tape tool lets you draw a line to help prevent bleeding into the areas you don’t want to “**paint**.” When you’re happy with your design, a shopping cart icon directs you to Walmart to purchase Glidden brand **paint**s and **paint**ing tools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tip: While these color visualizers are extremely useful for choosing a basic color direction, you will still want to visit the **paint** shop to get some **paint** samples of your chosen **colors**. Most **paint** companies offer larger sized **paint** chip samples which are much more useful than the small chips. I recommend requesting at least 2 of each sample so you can position them in a shadowed and sunnier part of the room to see how the color changes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Then finally for another option in visualizing color we have a complete Photoshop rendering of an actual living room using a clients chosen **paint** chip **colors**. This allows you to see how the current room **colors** mesh with your **paint** choice. And might even encourage you to go a little more bold once you see the final look. I particularly find this helpful to show clients how the ceiling color will look. Too often people are apt to ignore this important aspect of the design scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The newest version of ColorSnap® Visualizer for mobile integrates a cutting-edge augmented reality (AR) experience called Instant Paint. This feature provides a fast, seamless way to visualize any of our 1,700 **colors** on walls—in real time. Easily create custom palettes, save **colors**, try different color options and share results in a variety of ways. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many users noted that the **colors** look much different on the screen than they do in person. This is fairly universal with digital **paint** samples. The brightness and resolution of your screen can make the color's appearance vary from digital to physical. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are limitations on the number of areas you can try the virtual **paint** process on in a room. In one kitchen, for example, we could **paint** some cabinets, not all. But the app is certainly fun to play with, and a decent starting point if you're a Sherwin-Williams fan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This app works on smartphones, both iOS and Android devices, and can help you virtually add **paint** to almost anything from a wall, to a piece of furniture. You start by taking a photo of the thing you hope to **paint**, and from there you can pick **colors** from 25 different brands from Benjamin Moore to Farrow and Ball. (A personal favorite.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Color inspiration is all around you. Match **paint** **colors** to items from your space or anything else that inspires you. Simply take a picture or upload one from your camera roll to find the closest Home Depot **paint** color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, you can also purchase **paint** from The Home Depot directly in the app and never have to leave the house at all. (Not a bad option in today's environment.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting a home is a lengthy job. Aside from the work of actually putting **paint** on the walls, you have to test out which color feels right to you. That often means heading down to a store, getting samples, **paint**ing those on to a surface and waiting to see if the drying color suits you or not. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Glidden’s **paint** color app opens with a “designer tip” before taking you to its main features, which include options to browse **colors**, find inspiration, color match, or take an interactive quiz. The color quiz helps you to select a palette with the option of having free **paint** swatches sent to your home to test in your space and lighting. As an added bonus, the app offers palettes inspired by different design styles ranging from mid-century modern to bohemian to glam. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paint **colors** represented are approximations and are not exact matches. No guarantee is intended and approval or final color selections and color placement are the responsibility of the property owner or the owner's agent. Purchasing 8 oz. Perfect Palette Sampler color is highly recommended. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Behr’s ColorSmart app boasts “designer-coordinated color combinations” that you can preview in room scenes and on exteriors. To help you find the perfect shade, it allows you to color match from an uploaded photo. Or, if you have a color in mind to trial, simply scan the barcode on the back of a Behr **paint** swatch or brochure. Want to get a friend’s opinion? Save and share color projects on your social networks. Once you’ve made a decision, the **paint** color app will help you locate The Home Depot store closest to you to make your purchase. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These apps simplify that entire process by using digital technology, to virtually apply **paint** to whatever surface you choose: a wall or even the exterior of your home — all without cracking open a can of **paint**. While there are apps and devices that can help you match a color to a can of **paint**, these apps actually let you apply the **paint** directly to your wall. Some of these are from major **paint** companies, and clearly make use of their line of **paint**. Other are single apps you can download to your smartphone that can give you more of a sense of color. All, however, are free. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
