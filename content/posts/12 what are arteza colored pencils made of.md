## 12 Things You Should Know About What Are Arteza Colored Pencils Made Of | Arteza Colored Pencils 24
-   Another option is oil-based binders. The binders in these **pencils** are different from wax-based binders. The difference in mark and layering is noticeable, especially if you are accustomed to a wax-based experience. Oil-based **pencils** layer nicely and provide rich color, just like their wax-based counterparts. Wax bloom is less of an issue with these **pencils** since they are oil-based. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These charts are compiled with the assumption that the colored **pencils** are to be used as a traditional drawing medium. Once considered more of an obscure medium for fine drawing, colored **pencils** have seen a recent surge in popularity. This new popularity is due in part to adult coloring books, new products and techniques, and a collection of highly-skilled colored pencil artists that are able to share what they create with folks around the world through the internet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, there are other considerations, but these four qualities are important to me. Unfortunately, no one pencil on the chart is the best in all of these categories. Prismacolor Premier **pencils** are easily layered and burnish easily, yet the core is very soft and brittle. Polychromos **pencils** feature a strong core, but Premier **pencils** are better for layering and burnishing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first factor is obviously the price. For the most part with colored **pencils**, you get what you pay for. I understand that not everyone can afford the top quality **pencils**, but you’ll see the difference in your work, if you can afford it. The range in price reflected in this chart is pretty wide – but so is the range in quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Traditional colored **pencils** are held together by a wax-based or an oil-based binder. The binder affects how the **pencils** behave and what they are capable of. Most colored **pencils** are wax-based, but a few options exist for oil-based **pencils**. (More on the binder of colored **pencils** can be found a little further down this page.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The top choice for oil-based colored **pencils** are the Polychromos **pencils** by Faber-Castell. They get my top recommendation because of quality and price. You’ll get excellent results with this brand without paying too much. Oil-based **pencils** are not recommended for beginners, but are perfect for more experienced colored pencil artists. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The top choice in the chart below are the Prismacolor Premier colored **pencils**. They are super soft and buttery. They layer and burnish nicely. The only drawback is that they break easily, which can cause frustration for some. But this is a small price to pay to get high quality results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No matter how you plan to use colored **pencils**, the quality of the pencil remains indifferent. In other words, there isn’t a perfect brand for adult coloring books compared to traditional drawing. If a pencil is of high quality, then it is considered high quality for both coloring and drawing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since experimentation can become very expensive, I decided to put together a couple of comparison charts for you to help you make an informed decision about which colored **pencils** to buy. The pencil brands are sorted based on the binder used. Binder is the material that holds the pigment together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not all “colored **pencils**” are colored **pencils**. There are many specialty **pencils** that some people mistaken for traditional colored **pencils**. Watercolor **pencils**, for example, are different than traditional colored **pencils** and the manner in which they are used is also different. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My recommendation for children and young artists are Prang Colored Pencils. These **pencils** are great for those on a budget or for those just starting out. There are lots of color options and the **pencils** are medium soft. They are difficult to blend and layer, but for the price – you can’t do much better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Are you looking to purchase colored **pencils**, but are overwhelmed by the options? There are a lot of options out there for you. It can definitely be a little intimidating, especially if you’re not really sure what you’re looking for. It’s important to realize that what’s considered to be “the best pencil” to one artist may not be the best to another. There is so much variety in brands and forms of colored **pencils** that you have to find the brand that suites your style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
