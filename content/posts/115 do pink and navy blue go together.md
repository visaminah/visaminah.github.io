Flattering colors are thought to have the opposite effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Yet, looking at objects is about more than just wavelengths. When we look at something, certain wavelengths are absorbed into the object, depending on that object’s properties. The color that doesn’t get absorbed reflects back toward us, allowing us to see that color. So, a red apple would absorb orange, yellow, green, cyan, **blue**, and violet light, but then reflect red light at our eyes, allowing us to see the red color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Printed silk ties with **blue** and gray geometric patterns or knit ties with both colors in them are likewise excellent options.

-   Purple is made up of red and **blue** and therefore comes in many different shades with both warm and cool undertones.

Stick to warm colors with red-toned purples, and use cool colors with **blue**-toned purples. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink and yellow just make sense together. If you’re not a fan of the soft, delicate look that pastel **pink** and canary yellow gives off, consider hot **pink** and bright yellow.

-   The split complementary colors of true **pink** are directly beside **pink**’s complimentary green. These colors are very light, pastel **blue** and green.

-   Instantly electrifying, this color combination is unique and playful. The warm yellow and purple are sandwiched by the cool **blue** and green to create a bright color combination.

-   Blue and **pink** are two very different colors, but they often look nice together, especially in lighter tints.

-   Shades like deep purple, maroon and hunter green are as strong as dark **blue**. And, when these colors are paired together, they tend to compete with each other and lose their impact. Instead, try picking contrasting colors that stand out in the neutrality of deep navy **blue** - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, we have a beloved classic— sky **blue** and bubblegum **pink**. The playful and bright bubblegum **pink** paired with a cooling and cheerful baby **blue** communicates a wholesome adolescent joy. This color pairing is ideal for parenting brands, childcare logos, or children's fashion, products, or toys. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Orange may be your last consideration when faced with the question “what colors go with **pink**?”. The combination of **pink** and orange is a very controversial color combination. People tend to either love it or hate it. Contemporary, edgy, and fun designers love to pair hot **pink** with tangerine orange, and when they do they tend to go full out: Hot **pink** walls with bright orange velvet furniture and décor, with no neutral color pallet cleanser in between. This is a great option if you want to be loud and make a statement, but you might tire of this specific combination quickly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Playful and energizing, this vintage color palette has cold shades of **blue** that are balanced by warm shades of apricot orange and dusty red. It’s great for bubbly personal branding that has a vintage flair. The accent neon **blue** is a great way to draw attention to specific messaging or elements in your designs! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This sweet spring color palette is bubbly and refreshing. Like spring blooms and sunshine, it has a light **pink** and fuschia color pair accented by a deep yellow.

-   Complementary color combinations are the colors that sit on opposite sides of the color wheel. Combining these colors creates an effect of high contrast, catching the eye and leaving quite an impact. Examples: red and green, yellow and purple, orange and **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Channel a hot summer’s day with this relaxing beach palette. The hues are instantly soothing and reminiscent of vacations and carefree days. The neon **blue** is balanced by the more muted sand and orange hues and accented by the sunny yellow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Beyond avoiding sharp contrast, try adding complexity and interest to your **blue** and gray combinations by introducing textures and patterns. Sure, you can start simply with a white shirt, solid tie, and a plain worsted wool suit, but this gets boring fast. An easy way to add a pattern while remaining classic is to use a gray glen check tie in silk (or wool for winter) with a navy suit. For a gray suit, get a navy grenadine tie in either a large or fine weave (garza grossa or garza fina) to inject texture. In the reverse scenario, pick up a silver grenadine for a **blue** suit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bohemian and classy, this color palette is dark and luscious. It uses natural hues of cabernet red, ash beige, and walnut wood to create warmth. The jade **blue** adds a cold accent to level off the warmth in the palette. This palette is a stunning option for interior design and decor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A fresh take on a retro color palette, the Prussian **blue** and orange are complementary colors, accented by the mustard yellow. This warm color palette is great for retro designs that need a modern flair. Retro designs are trending in 2022, and this color combination is a great way to achieve the look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The contrast of these colors balances each other’s shortcomings. This is why we see **pink** bridesmaids’ dresses, especially at outdoor weddings. The photos look great with the **pink** dresses and natural green scenery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Today, I’m trying to exemplify many of the concepts we discussed. Most of my outfit elements have **blue** and gray in them; the largest of these would be my **blue** jacket and gray trousers. The jacket is a bit lighter than a standard navy, probably in something more like a medium to even a royal **blue**. It’s plain in color to ground the trousers which have a bit more texture in their weave. As mentioned previously, my shirt features a micro check pattern in light **blue** and dark gray, perhaps even almost black, but everything is working harmoniously within the color pairing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink and orange go together because they’re analogous colours. When placed side by side, they give off warm, earthy vibes. Like **pink** and brown, this colour combo is comforting and looks good in the bedroom! Check out these **pink** and orange bed covers that look so inviting we just want to get into our pyjamas! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another reason for purple’s popularity has been its flexibility. Purple is made through a combination of red and **blue** and can be created in various tones and intensities. This makes it a color that can be tailored to fit many different styles, skin tones, and seasons – making it a go-to choice for designers all year long. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Green and red have similar issues with tone. Green will generally only work with purple if it is cool in tone, even bordering on **blue**. Bright red will work with many shades of purple, but other tones are often hard to match. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The easiest way to coordinate **blue** and gray is to match the two in a suit and tie combination. It’s commonly said that when a man first ventures into the world of tailored clothing–or into the working world that demands such a dress code–he should begin with a navy **blue** suit. Using a gray tie with this navy suit is a surefire way to earn style points. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purple clothes go well with colors like white, gray, beige, **blue**, or yellow. Purple is not limited to these colors, however, and can be paired in seemingly endless combinations. The key is to always match the undertones of your purple to those of the colors you pair it with, keeping warm tones and cool tones separate from one another. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The same techniques mentioned above can be used when wearing sports coat and trouser combinations, though some men may be put off by the perceived difficulties of coordinating an additional article of clothing: pants in a different shade. If you begin with **blue** and gray, this is actually a piece of cake. Like the navy suit, the navy blazer is a staple, foundational item of menswear. Technically, a solid blazer has to be **blue**, so begin there and add gray pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink and gray is quite the obvious color combination, because gray, as a neutral, is a great match with **pink**. However, because gray is neutral and **pink** is very soft and feminine, you might want to buffer these two colors with pops of another color. Green, which is the complementary and contrast color for **pink**, comes in handy in this case. All shades of green tend to match with **pink**, seeing as green is also a very natural color, but makes more of a statement than neutral colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue is a primary color while **pink** is a tint of red, which is also a primary color. So, when you mix **blue** and **pink** together, you get a secondary color. The result is similar to a mix of **blue** and red, only much lighter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, **blue** is a primary color, so creating it is a bit more tricky. With subtractive mixing using the CMYK color model, you can create a perfect **blue** color. According to that color wheel, which is mostly used for ink, magenta and cyan can mix together to create **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   People with "Summer" coloring are usually natural blondes, although extremely pale-skinned brunettes with pale **blue** eyes are also sometimes considered Summer's. Usually a Summers skin tone is very fair; either porcelain white, or pale with **pink** cheeks. Darker blonde Summer's with slightly darker skin may be able to pull of slightly darker colors than a regular Summer. A darker Summer may want to try burgundy, deep royal purple, and some of the colors that overlap with the other winter colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The combination of **pink** and green is a beloved choice in interior design because green is a contrast color to **pink**. Specifically light, dust **pink** walls and accessories combined with emerald green furniture are placed in front of it. Green plants against light **pink** walls are also a great, contemporary duo. This color pair works well collectively because they are each other’s complementary colors on the color wheel. Aside from being complementary colors, **pink** is seen as a very synthetic color, whereas green is seen as the most natural color possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red, yellow, and **blue** make brown, so having yellow mixed in can make your purple look not quite as pretty. So, if your purple doesn’t turn out as expected, you might want to try a different type of **blue**, red, or **pink**. When in doubt, try mixing various **blue**s and reds together to see the different purples they make. Sometimes, you’ll get a result that’s even better than what you expected. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To start our list, we'll go for a trendy color combination, royal **blue** and peach. These two colors form a triadic combination, with the royal **blue** creating a bold sensation, balanced perfectly with peach's playfulness. This color combo is ideal for logo design or as accent colors for a web template or design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Supercharge your designs with this powerful neon color palette. The deep cobalt is analogous to the lapis lazuli **blue**, but the balance is jolted by the radioactive green and light lemon. This color scheme is bold and daring, made for projects that want to establish trust, and associate with revitalization. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The triad colour scheme combines three colours of equal distances from each other on the colour wheel. An example would be **pink**, **blue**, and yellow. For the rectangle scheme, simply imagine drawing a rectangle on the wheel. The four corners represent your colour palette. For example, **pink**, red-orange, **blue**-green, and indigo. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another classic color combo known for its duality is baby **blue** and white. This serene combo communicates ease and trustworthiness, invoking the feeling of looking up at the sky on a sunny morning. Baby **blue** and white are the perfect color combo for brand colors in the healthcare, childcare, or non-profit industries. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The jolt of the electric **pink** is balanced by shades of **blue**, creating a bold and versatile palette. Opt to use the electric **pink** as an accent color, or make the **blue**s accent colors to leverage the charge of the **pink**. This palette works for retro 90’s logo design or bold projects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although **blue** and gray is usually a conservative combination, one of the boldest things you can do for your overall outfit is to wear these colors as footwear. Dark navy Oxfords are the best choice with a suit since they resemble a standard black business shoe with just a hint of added color, but they are difficult to find. Those with dandy impulses and in a less conservative environment could go with brighter **blue**s, such as a **blue** wholecut Oxford or monk strap, paired with a light gray suit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Funky and unique, this color palette is well beyond the color comfort zone. The mix of **pink**, purple, and green is striking and groovy. It’s original and fierce, but versatile enough to give you options for which color you want to use as an accent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like with orange, the name **pink** came from a namesake, although not a fruit, but in this case, a flower. This fact alone is an indication of the connotation of the color **pink**. Pink is associated with femininity and everything that goes along with it: softness, sweetness, politeness, sensitivity, and romance. These characteristics are only related to a very soft **pink** though. Pink is a very interesting color in the fact that, depending on what color it is combined with, it can completely change the meaning and feel of the color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Exhilarating and strong, the electric **blue** is partnered with the fluorescent green to create a stand-out color pair. The pale yellow is a pacifying accent that still contributes to its overall electric look. It’s ideal for small designs that need to make a striking impact. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Power and authority: Dark navy **blue** represents power and responsibility. Police officers often use **blue** or navy **blue** for their uniforms. The slang term "boys in **blue**" refers to police officers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The words purple and violet are often used interchangeably for the same color, but despite popular belief, they’re actually two slightly different colors. Purple is described as a 50/50 mixture between **blue** and red, while violet contains a bit more **blue** than red. When looking at the colors side by side, it’s easy to tell the difference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink and purple can go together if you choose similar color tones. Pink and purple share the color red in common, meaning that you can pair together red-toned shades of each to make a good match. Pastel purples and **pink**s also go well together since both are light in color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Designers find **pink** a challenging color with which to design and decorate, mostly because **pink** is seen as an “unnatural color”. The reason for this is that **pink** does not appear in nature very often. We see a few references to cherry blossom trees during spring, and the only **pink** animal that comes to mind is a flamingo, but aside from that, **pink** is not very evident in nature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Triadic colors create a perfect triangle on the color wheel at 60-degree angles. These combinations are usually very interesting, but straining to the eye. In the case of true **pink**, however, the triadic colors are very soft, light, and pleasing to look at. Of course, these colors darken, depending on what shade of **pink** is used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll also want to pay attention to the undertones of the greens and purples you mix. Pairing a warm-tone green like an olive green won’t work with a **blue**-toned purple like periwinkle. Stick to colors that are both cool or both warm to make good combinations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Analogous color combinations are every two to five colors that sit beside each other on the color wheel. These color combinations create a sensation of balance and harmony. Typically one of these colors sits in the background, while the other more dominant color sits in the foreground.
