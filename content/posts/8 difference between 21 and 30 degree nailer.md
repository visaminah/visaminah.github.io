## 8 Reference List: Difference Between 21 And 30 Degree Nailer | difference between 21 and 30 degree nailer
-   I’ve been waiting for a long time to test one of these battery-powered framing **nailer**s out. For quite awhile the only thing on the market has been cordless brad-**nailer**s or trim-**nailer**s, but nothing for full-sized framing nails. Well, DeWalt has changed the game yet again! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I was able to run the tool from a standard 20v lithium ion battery pack, as well as the new Flex Volt 60v lithium ion batteries. This does not mean that the **nailer** will operate at 60 volts, it simply means that the 60-volt batteries are backward compatible with the smaller 20-volt tools. For instance the 9 amp/hour 60volt battery pack will sense the tool is a 20 volt tool and will still operate, only on 20 volts rather than 60 volts. This means a 9 amp-hour battery will last you a very long time under the same load. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for a cordless pneumatic **nailer** that’s perfect for fences, decking and framing, the DeWALT 21 **degree** Framing Nailer is a great choice. It is a bit heavy, but considering the size of the nail you’re driving and it’s cordless, this is a win for DeWALT. This kit comes with a carrying case, charger and 20v Max battery. You can pick up your DeWALT DCN21PLM1 Nailer now at The Home Depot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main upgrade on this model from the last DeWALT Cordless Framing Nailer is that instead of a 30 **degree**, we’re now going with a 21 **degree** angle. That means you get a more compact model that can load up to 49 nails at a time. You also get a wide variety of options with fasteners lengths of 2″ and up to 3-1/2″. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not only will this **nailer** simply shoot a nail, it allows you to adjust the sensitivity of the driving force so you have control over how deep the nail will penetrate. There is a small adjustment knob near the mouth of the nail rack that puts more or less tension on the driving spring that opens and closes when shooting a nail. There’s also an AWESOME second feature that gives you even more flexibility in driving force – that is a speed selector just like a drill has. There are 2 power levels numbered “1” and “2”, and just as you’d imagine “1” means lower power while “2” means more power. This helps when you’re nailing soft vs hard wood, or a combination of the two. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First off I noticed that it is a 21 **degree** **nailer**. This means that it will only accept 21 **degree** racks of nails. For those out there that don’t know, there are other racks of nails that have different angles, like the popular 30 **degree** **nailer**s would use. I have no preference either way, so for me the 21 **degree** setup is fine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When I picked this framing **nailer** I was surprised to feel it is a little lighter than most pneumatic **nailer**s. Not by much, but the compact size of the tool makes it feel lighter in the hand as well. There’s a lot of thought that went into this nail gun so lets break down the features. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After racking a pack of nails, I slapped in a battery, compressed the nose piece against a board and pulled the trigger. There was not the immediately satisfying kaboom, but a hiss like the **nailer** was charging and then the satisfying kaboom. What I didn’t realize is that the depth setting and power were cranked all the way up, so that delay was actually intentional (and adjustable) for maximum driving. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
