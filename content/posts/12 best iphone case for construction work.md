## 12 Things You Should Know About Best Iphone Case For Construction Work | Mous Limitless
-   Tasks that require workers to be in close contact (within 6 feet) with customers, visitors, or members of the public. Entering an indoor work site occupied by people such as other workers, customers, or residents suspected of having or known to have COVID-19, including when an occupant of the site reports signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Note: Employers may consider delaying this work following the guidance below. Category not applicable for most anticipated work tasks. Note: Most **construction** work tasks are associated with no more than high exposure risk; see the work tasks associated with lower, medium, or high risk on this chart. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All Keebos phone straps are adjustable, which is why they’re such a popular item. But Clear Voyage phone straps are also detachable. The tough straps are like the kinds of straps you’d see on a seat belt, so they’re extremely durable. They’re the perfect choice for **construction** workers. The strap is adjustable too, so if you need to make it longer you can. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Last year we put out an article on the best phones for workers in the **construction** industry. While the advice in that report still stands, we realize that not every business can afford to go out and buy 5 to 10 of the roughest, toughest phones on the market. For them, we wanted to review another set of options: rugged phone cases. Whether you’re an employer looking for the best phone to provide your workers, or a worker who would rather pull your hair out than replace another phone screen, the products on this list of phone cases that will protect whatever phone you have from whatever work you do. From **construction** to HVAC to plumbing, here’s a list of indestructible cases that live up to the name: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're looking for the best budget iPhone case, the Speck Products Gemshell case is a solid choice. With slim but sturdy clear polyurethane **construction**, this case has you protected for a significantly low price. The button **construction** doesn’t take any thumb bending to use. The bevelled front lip offers solid screen protection. It’s available for other generations of the iPhone, outside of the iPhone XR. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You already take care of everything on the job, right? So let Keebos take care of your phone. We believe that the Keebos Clear Voyage phone case is the best Samsung phone case for **construction** workers. (Have an iPhone? Then you’ve got even more options. You can have a Clear Voyage or an all-black Voyage case!) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **construction** workers are unlikely to need PPE beyond what they use to protect themselves during routine job tasks. Such PPE may include a hard hat, gloves, safety glasses, and a face mask. However, under OSHA’s PPE standards for **construction** (29 CFR 1926 Subpart E), employers must consider whether their hazard and risk assessments, including **construction** site job hazard analyses, indicate a need for the use of more protective PPE. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The OtterBox Symmetry Series brings much of the rugged design of the Commuter case into a far sleeker body. If the large size of the Commuter is too much for your pocket, then the Symmetry is a good bet (especially since it’s also available with antimicrobial **construction**). While the bezel depth around the camera does suffer, the case still offers quality drop protection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Aside from drop-test certifications, it's important to consider the **construction** of the case. Some cases have rubber flaps that cover the charge port and silent toggle, while others leave those areas exposed. Certain types of cases have a screen cover and lens covers integrated into the case, while others leave the glass exposed. However, many of those "exposed cases" include a bezel that keeps the glass from resting directly on a flat surface. This essentially provides an extra layer of protection for the camera or screen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Spigen (left) and the Otterbox Defender (right) are compared. The Spigen uses absorptive foam in its **construction** but is notably slimmer in profile. Credit: Amber King - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fancy a case that looks like it’s straight out of Black Mirror, and offers drop protection of up to 20 feet? This case from Supcase ticks both boxes, and with its dual-layer **construction**, rubberized grip, and shockproof TPU bumper, it offers serious protection for your iPhone. The built-in screen protector ensures 360-degree protection, so no more smashed screens should you drop your phone. It’s compatible with Apple MagSafe and most other wireless chargers and features a handy built-in kickstand — there’s even a rotatable holster clip, so you don’t need to sling your phone in your bag or pocket. We’d opt for the eye-catching Cerulean version (pictured), but this case also comes in black or red. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Keebos are the best phone case for **construction** workers because they’re versatile and durable. They have adjustable straps, wallets, and finger grips to ensure you won’t drop your phone from the ladder. We think that our Clear Voyage phone cases are best suited to **construction** workers. Read on for more information. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the indoor **construction** environment, when work is determined to be essential or emergency work, and a person (e.g., coworker, visitor, resident, subcontractor) suspected of having or known to have COVID-19 is present at the worksite in close proximity to where workers would be working: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
