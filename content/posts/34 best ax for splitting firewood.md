## 34 Shocking Facts About Best Ax For Splitting Firewood | Fiskars Super Splitting Axe
-   So, which is better, a splitting **ax**e or maul? There isn’t a clear answer. It’s all about personal preference. It also depends on the size of the wood you’ll be splitting, and how much of it you’ll be splitting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Everyone is trying to achieve the same result: splitting wood with no injuries. Many experts suggest the same method of swinging an **ax**e. That’s a traditional one-hand stationary position at the base of the handle. Your other hand should start the swing near the head of the **ax**e. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This S**ax**on Splitter from Helko-Werk may be the best **ax**e for splitting wood. It’s a heavy-duty **ax**e that’s best for splitting large rounds and challenging logs. The head of this **ax**e will give you powerful strikes without getting stuck or pinched up in the wood. It will remind you of a maul in terms of power but gives you the feel, balance, and control of an **ax**e. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Additionally, we gave a wide variety of options. We included both splitting **ax**es and splitting mauls because, as you’ve seen, there are benefits to each one. We even give a few hatchet options for those who prefer hatchets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To choose our top options for the best **ax**e for splitting wood, we made sure not to choose any that have below a 4.0 out of 5.0-star rating on Amazon. If users aren’t a fan of the **ax**e, then it probably isn’t the right choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Hi-Spec steel **ax**e is a hatchet that could be considered the best **ax**e for splitting wood. This **ax**e is ideal for gardening or landscaping. It can also be used for DIY projects and camping. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Hi-Spec **ax**e is strong enough to withstand harsh working conditions, including severe weather. It’s well-balanced to give you m**ax**imum control and reduce strain. The **ax**e has a sharp edge to reduce cutting time in logs and timber. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **ax**e has a 26-inch handle and weighs 2.1 pounds. It has 4.5 out of 5.0 stars on Amazon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you raise the **ax**e over your shoulder in one motion, you build momentum up then down, and your top hand will slide down to meet your bottom hand. This method generates power and speed from your wrists. If you have ever used a sledgehammer, you most likely follow this same position - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A felling **ax**e should not be used to split wood. Generally, if you try to split a medium-sized piece of wood with a felling **ax**e it will just get stuck in the wood and you will be lucky if you can get it out. The felling **ax**e is designed to cut the fibers of the wood not split them apart. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most importantly, you’ll want to determine if you want an **ax**e, maul, or hatchet. You may even decide that you want all three so that you can use each one for different needs. Remember, always practice the proper safety methods when using your **ax**e, and keep your blade sharpened. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a few **ax**es from Fiskars on this list. This one is the best option for taller individuals and people who prefer a longer **ax**e. It’s best used for splitting medium to large-sized logs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another option for the best **ax**e for splitting wood is the Trail Boss Axe from Cold Steel. This **ax**e features a European-style head with a 4-inch blade and a 4.5-inch cutting edge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   from his pacific northwest home, jacob witzling shares his multi-bladed **ax**es with designboom and illustrates what led to the creations: ‘I’ve been splitting **firewood** since I was 8. growing up in new hampshire where the winters are cold, we used wood for heat. my brothers and I had chores of course, and one of them was to haul wood inside and fill the bin. another was to keep kindling (small pieces) chopped and ready to start the next fire. I began experimenting with different ways to split the kindling to make the experience more enjoyable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The long handle on this **ax**e helps give power while cutting. This **ax**e is made of hickory and hand-forged Swedish steel. It also comes with an edge cover made of leather. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for the best **ax**e for splitting wood, you may not be sure if you should choose an **ax**e, maul, or hatchet.There are so many **ax**es out there in a variety of sizes. They all serve a different purpose, whether that’s chopping, splitting, or kindling. It can be challenging to decide which one will be the best for splitting wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The blade of a chopping **ax**e is slimmer than a splitting **ax**e, and sharper, as it’s designed to cut cross-way through the fibers of the wood. Using a chopping **ax**e properly consists of cutting a horizontal log with many fast, downward strokes. On the other hand, a splitting **ax**e has a much thicker blade and it’s not as easy to maneuver as a chopping **ax**e. At the end of the day, it comes down to what tasks you need to perform. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   jacob witzling continues, explaining the process of fabricating the multi-bladed **ax**es, and what drove the jump from four to six blades: ‘fast forward 30 years, I was sitting around the campfire splitting kindling, when my brother ethan said ‘what about a multi-bladed **ax**e?’ I started thinking of ways it could be done. I went to my welder and good friend raymond dickinson and lived in his shop for a couple days while we prototyped different configurations. the first one that worked really well was based on a hydraulic splitter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you landed on this article, you’re most likely looking for an **ax**e to split wood. When you’re splitting wood, you’ll want an **ax**e that offers a one-strike split with a swing. That way, you can split logs with minimal time and effort. Plus, you won’t have to strain your hands too much. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **ax**e has a 31-inch handle length and weighs 8.5 pounds. It has 5.0 out of 5.0 stars on Amazon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We don’t recommend using another type of **ax**e for a different job. Instead, you should get a splitting **ax**e if your main goal is to split wood. However, we are aware that some situations (namely emergency survival ones) might not let you have the luxury to get a proper **ax**e. In such cases, yes, you can chop wood with a splitting **ax**e, but be careful how you use it so that you won’t damage the blade or, worse, yourself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Each Camper’s Axe comes with a heavy-duty nylon sheath. The **ax**e is made from solid American steel and is made in the U.S.A. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like other Fiskars **ax**es, it combines advanced blade geometry, excellent weight distribution, and an ultra-sharp edge. That allows you to have more one-strike splits with less effort and hand strain. This **ax**e also has a textured non-slip grip that will improve your control. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’ll be splitting large chunks of wood, then you may want to choose a splitting maul. Because it’s heavier, you’ll get greater power, so you’ll spend less time working on it. But, if you are a bit smaller, then you could find a maul challenging to use. Plus, if you’re splitting small pieces of wood, then an **ax**e could be the better choice. These are easier to swing and are lightweight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We touched on this slightly, but it’s important to consider whether you’ll be splitting small logs or medium to large-sized logs. If you’re splitting small or medium logs, you might consider a traditional wood-splitting **ax**e. You might look at a smaller **ax**e that’s still powerful. It will give you both power and speed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you are handing off an **ax**e to someone, you should ideally place the **ax**e down, and they can pick it up from there. If you decide to hand it off, make sure the other person has a firm grip on it before you let go. The best way to determine this is to ask them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As for your stance, you should have your legs spread slightly wider than your shoulders. They should be square to the wood you’re cutting. Many experts recommend against sticking a leg forward because if you miss, the **ax**e will go right for your leg. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’ll be splitting medium to larger sized logs, you’ll want to either choose a maul or an **ax**e with a longer handle. That will give you a better power-to-weight ratio. It will also increase your swing speed and give you more power. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can avoid **ax**e injuries if you’re smart and careful. However, an accident could still happen. If that’s the case, determine whether or not you need to go to the hospital, and figure out the best way to get there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As for a splitting maul, it’s basically a larger sledgehammer with a pointed **ax**e head. It usually weighs between six and eight pounds. That can be a disadvantage to a maul because it’s heavier when compared with a splitting **ax**e. The fact is, you’ll use more energy and get tired much faster. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For very large chunks of wood, the splitting maul is a great choice, as its heavier weight will give you additional power. However, smaller users may find the heavier weight of the maul difficult to swing. For smaller pieces of wood, or splitting around the wood’s edges, a splitting **ax**e is the better choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Fiskars **ax**e has a 17-inch handle and weighs 2.18 pounds. It has 4.8 out of 5.0 stars on Amazon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s the largest **ax**e from Gerber and is meant for m**ax**imum power when you are splitting logs and chopping roots. It has a weighted stainless-steel head and black PTFE-coated blade. These can easily split more massive logs in one try without sticking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many people prefer a maul for splitting wood. The reason for this is because a maul is meant to split wood, while an **ax**e is generally designed for cutting wood. Because of that, we included a few mauls in our list of the top choices for the best **ax**e for splitting wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
