-   It's up to you if you want to paint **quarter**-**round** before installing the trim—there's no right or wrong way. Most carpenters like to finish the long trim pieces before measuring, cutting, and installing them—either by painting or applying stain and varnish. This is considerably easier than trying to finish the **quarter**-**round** or shoe molding after it is nailed in place. Some touch-up work will be needed after the trim is installed, but this can be done with a brush. The only downside of pre-finishing is that you may have nail holes you'll need to fill in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   PS When updating this blog post, I found an amazing new **quarter** **round** product. It not only adds dimension to your baseboard, it also hides messy wires lying a**round** your house. This is known in the industry as a “cable raceway” which really helps with our growing collection of electronic devices. The molding is super easy to install as there's sticky tape on the back because … you don't want to be nailing hidden wires. You can find this product on Amazon (comes in white and oak) and please let me know how you plan to use it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But as we compare shoe molding vs. **quarter** **round**, we can notice some differences as well. Although both moldings have curved edges, their curves have different sizes, and this makes a huge difference. If you need molding with a well-**round**ed edge, you should choose **quarter** **round**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These include a miter saw to cut the shoe molding, a coping saw to create inside corners, and a finish nailer (or pinner) to attach the molding. Because shoe molding is small and easy to damage, this is one case where a finish nailer or pinner is preferable to a hammer and nails. Start in a corner and work your way a**round** the room in one direction. This makes it simpler to cut the coping joints you’ll need for the inside corners. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Carpenters like to use these bottom trim pieces because they reduce the need for complicated baseboard scribe cuts. Professionals like to attach shoe molding with a nail gun rather than with glue. Nailing ensures a snug, consistent fit and allows you to access the area underneath the trim if necessary. If you're new to trim installation, the best tool for nailing shoe molding or **quarter**-**round** is an electric brad nailer. This tool will automatically set or recess the small finish nails you need for **quarter**-**round** trim, and can greatly speed up your work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As kitchen cabinet refinishers, we get asked this question quite frequently. There is no right or wrong answer and is more a matter of personal preference.What is **quarter** **round**?

-   Make the appropriate cuts to the trim with a miter saw to fit the wall. When fitting trim a**round** corners or edges, remember to cut at an angle. For **quarter** **round** trim, nail the trim into the wall in 10” increments with a nail gun. When installing the baseboard, nail the trim to the wall in 16” increments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’ve been looking at baseboard finishing trim, you’ve probably discovered **quarter**-**round**, too. As the name implies, this type of molding is one-**quarter** of a **round** dowel (split a dowel down the middle, then further split the halves, and you’ll have **quarter**-**round**). While **quarter**-**round** can be installed along the bottom of baseboard, trim carpenters and homeowners tend to prefer the sleeker look of shoe molding, which is taller and narrower than its curved counterpart. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Quarter **round** is essentially ¼ of a perfect circle. Picture a dowel rod or a wood clothes hanger rod, and cut it into perfect fourths. You’ll have a 90 degree angle corner on one side with a perfectly circular radius on the other. This means that the distance from the 90 degree corner to either edge of the radius will be the same. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Quarter **round** molding is most often used to cover the gap between baseboards and flooring. My first experience came when remodeling a 100 year old Victorian. We tried but didn't quite get the floors level between our new kitchen-dining-family room and the family room next to it. That's when our builder recommended adding molding (**quarter** **round** or shoe molding). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   PS In my handyman business we used this molding for lots of repair projects. For example, we used this molding to tame older linoleum flooring that was started to curl up along the edges. When my house flooded last year, the paint started curling up from the bottom of the kitchen cabinets. My insurance company paid to replace the cabinets but if you're not as lucky, **quarter** **round** molding will rescue you! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Shoe molding and **quarter** **round** look very similar, and some people would say they are almost identical.

-   Both types of trim moldings start as long **round** dowels that are then rip-cut and milled into their respective shapes. They are stocked in very long lengths and racked vertically at the home improvement store or lumber center. This extra-long length is so that you can use full-length pieces to cover most walls. Although you can join shorter pieces to cover a long wall using scarf joints, most carpenters try to avoid this since full-length pieces give the wall a smoother look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The biggest decision you have to make when installing **quarter** **round** or shoe molding is whether to match the color of the baseboard or the flooring. It's not an easy decision so I asked several interior designers what they recommend. They unanimously said **quarter** **round** molding should be painted the same color as the baseboard. It should not be stained the same color as the wood floor, as it should look like an extension of the baseboard, not an extension of the floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most molding (skirting board) is 3/8" thick. You need a 1/4 inch gap a**round** the floor to allow for expansion due to moisture.

-   The terms “**quarter** **round**” and “shoe molding” are often used interchangeably and for a good reason, but there is a distinct difference between the two. When we compare shoe molding vs. **quarter** **round**, we see that **quarter** **round** is essentially ¼ of a perfect circle, so you’ll have a 90-degree angle corner on one side. And although shoe molding also features the 90-degree corner, its **round** portion is not a perfectly circular radius, so this piece of trim is thinner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Touch up paint every place you caulked (top of the **quarter** **round** where you caulked, the joints, and any other spots that were scratch up during installation. (Now you are thankful you painted the first coat before installation.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
