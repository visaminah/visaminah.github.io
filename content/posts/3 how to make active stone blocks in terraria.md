-   To make a furnace, you need to use 20 **stone** blocks, 3 torches, and 4 of any wood. Click the work bench and scroll until you see the option to create the furnace. You will need to deploy this item to use it. You need to create a furnace to smelt iron ore into iron bars. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both biomes will slowly spread, even before Hardmode. They convert nearby blocks to the same biome at a very slow rate. Corruption and Crimson can spread through sand, mud, grass, **stone**, pretty much every default natural block in Hardmode, but in pre-Hardmode, they only spread through grass and bushes. Converted areas will have the same background music, spawn the same enemies, and grow the same plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remember, vines can grow in tunnels and will spread Corruption. These will grow from underneath the grass blocks. Even though it's even more time-consuming, you should encase the tunnels in a cheap block, like **stone**, to prevent vines from growing along the dirt walls. It's extremely frustrating if the vines ruin all the time and effort put into securing your tunnels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
