-   Each **pixel** is represented by one single byte. Its value can range from 0 to 255; 256 possible colors. Each value between 0 and 255 represents a specific color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   8-bit (color) graphics are bitmap images with a limited amount of colors. The color per **pixel** is described using a so-called byte. A byte consists of 8 bits. Each bit is similar to a light switch; it can be on or off, or, more specifically true or false. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Reducing the size of a bitmap image means less **pixel**s. Based on the original size, the computer has to recalculate - or resample - the original image. Depending on the technique used for the calculation, more or less information is lost. Increasing the size of a bitmap image means more **pixel**s. The computer has to make an assumption, based on the original image, about which colors will be used for the increased amount of **pixel**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While creating the **pixel** art illustration shown in the video below I've saved a total of 110 different versions. It took me about 10 months to complete it. I've spent 110 days on the **pixel** art illustration, ranging from one hour to an entire working day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Isometric projection is extensively used in older computer games and contemporary **pixel** art, because you don't need to resize (read redraw) objects. Or in the case of computer game perspective distortion doesn't need to be calculated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
