-   Another important component of an air **hockey** **table** is the airflow. You want something that offers a strong and consistent airflow across the entire surface, as this will ensure the pucks can glide and that the game is fair for both sides. Look for models with a 100-volt fan motor or an otherwise high-quality airflow system. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Accessories like pucks are always included and will not affect the price, but not all pucks are created equally. "Each **table** will include pucks and handheld pushers. Some are more ergonomically designed for the hand, others feature the traditional single post. Either way, those are all included in the purchase and won't affect the purchaser price," according to LaBarre. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Though it's on the bigger side for a home air **hockey** **table**, users say this pick from MD Sports was incredibly easy to build for even one person (though keep in mind it takes two to lift and flip it).

My family used to have an air **hockey** **table** in our last house and it was a blast when friends came over. However, there was always a puck going where it didn’t belong as we got into the game and hit it with a bit too much force, so having a spare puck ready to go was a must. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The simple design of this compact air **hockey** **table** features manual sliding scorekeepers and goal boxes.
