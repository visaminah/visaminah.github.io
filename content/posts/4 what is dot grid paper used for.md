## 4 Facts What Is Dot Grid Paper Used For | Dot Grid Notebook
-   I’m new to brush lettering but was pretty pleased with how my title page turned out. Next, I’ve included a couple of functional-but-not-very-aesthetic pages for keeping track of finished projects and project ideas. The latter will remind me which fabrics I’ve mentally assigned to garments so I don’t end up using something I shouldn’t! The dot **grid** **paper** is really handy for drawing charts and boxes as it keeps those columns nice and even. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should probably change the title to Notebook and not Paper as 'Graph Dotted Paper' suggests that it is just loose leaf **paper**. Reading through the reviews I realized I'm not the only person who made this mistake so it is not just me. Yes we could have read the title more clearly but also the title used in the image is deceptive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I mentioned Zentangles it in my blackout journaling post, but if you’re not familiar with the term, they’re an easy-to-learn, meditative way of creating beautiful abstract images with combinations of dots, lines, curves and orbs. It’s an excellent way to unwind and I really loved creating this page. While you can go completely freehand as I did with the two curved designs, the dot **grid** **paper** means you can draw geometric designs and straight lines with ease. Well, kinda straight. I’m actually not great at drawing straight lines without a ruler but I think Zentangling on a regular basis would definitely improve that! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My fabric stash page is one of my absolute favourites and I can’t stop staring at it! I hope it will remind me to “shop my stash” before making any spontaneous fabric purchases. I originally planned to add actual swatches of fabric, but I was wary of making my journal too bulky or creating an uneven writing surface. I printed photos of my fabrics onto sticker **paper**, and cut the “swatch” shape with my Cricut as I didn’t want to blunt my pinking shears. You could sketch your fabrics if you don’t have access to a printer and don’t want to include actual swatches. I’ve made a note of the fabric composition and when and where I bought each fabric. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
