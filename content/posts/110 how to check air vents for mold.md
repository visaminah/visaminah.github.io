-   As your air conditioner works, it is blowing cold air or warm air through the air ducts. Additionally, this can create a moisture barrier of condensation as the air inside the air duct meets the air being produced by the air conditioning unit. When the water vapor is created, it settles on the walls of the air ducts. This creates an environment that is conducive to **mold** growth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drain pans and cooling coils are potential components of your HVAC system that you can take a DIY **mold** removal approach with. Before tackling either one, be sure to wear a respirator and gloves. It also wouldn’t hurt to wear some old clothes you don’t care about. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These symptoms can occur in healthy people, as well as people who already have pre-existing conditions.

Keep reading to learn all the questions to ask and how to avoid scams! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Water is present on the coil when the air conditioner is running. The water is deposited as moisture is removed from the air during cooling. Air filters inadequately prevent dust (aka ‘**mold** candy’) from being deposited on the coil, usually because they are of poor quality, do not fit properly, or are missing altogether. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before You Start No matter which method you choose, make sure to wear a mask and gloves. These will protect you from inhaling or contacting **mold**. Don’t forget to turn off your AC or heating unit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Toxic Signs of Mold On Vents 1 - Black Dust On The Air Vents If you see black dust on the surface of an air vent that can’t be easily cleaned—it is likely a species of **mold** or mildew, and an early sign of black **mold** in the air **vents**. If **mold** is inside your air duct system, the spores can get blown to the **vents**, and eventually end up as a black dust. Also, **mold** can start growing on the air **vents** themselves because dust accumulates on the surface — which is a food source. Cleaning the visible **mold** on **vents** is recommended because the **mold** may release spores into the air, possibly causing harmful health issues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes! Indoor air can retain household chemicals, volatile organic compounds (VOC’s), **mold** spores, pollen, microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOC’s), toxins, bacteria, viruses, and other irritants more easily than outdoor air. Infectious bacteria and viruses can cause disease. Mold can cause mental and physical health problems including: allergy sensitization, shortness of breath, allergic reactions, asthma attacks, and mental health problems including: disordered brain function, changes in balance, slower blink reflexes, slower reaction times, color discrimination problems, and depression. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you spot **mold** on your air **vents**, it’s not something you should ignore. This can be really dangerous, especially since the air will distribute the **mold** around your home. You’ll start to breathe it in which can lead to a range of health problems, including (1): - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Odors, dark spots and growths aren’t the only way **mold** takes form. It can also appear as yellow, blue, green or pink (3). Sometimes it just looks like a discoloration or stain. It can also be a variety of textures including velvety, fuzzy, or rough. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Get yearly air duct cleaning. To prevent the growth of **mold**, it’s important to remove the food source in your air ducts. Not only will this cleaning remove any dust, dirt, and debris that could impact how well your ducts circulate air in your home, it will also remove any visible traces of **mold** and mildew that are present.

Some people may even get headaches or experience lightheadedness and mental fatigue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have conduct home **mold** inspections and AC unit **mold** inspections from Miami to West Palm Beach since 2004. Having provided these **mold** relates services I see a pattern. Almost all the **mold** in almost all ducts and AC units sampled is Cladosporium. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   —When you take a hot shower, that steam needs to go somewhere. Ideally, it should be vented outside by an exhaust fan. Otherwise it can collect on **vents** or registers in the bathroom. During warmer seasons, cooler air is being piped through **vents** and sometimes moisture will condensate along the sides of the ductwork. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The air we breathe every day is a lot dirtier than you may realize – even when you are inside your home. Nearly every home in the United States has over 1,000 types of **mold** whose spores are suspended in the air. Unless you get an air duct **mold** cleaning, these **mold** spores can also spread from one room to another through the HVAC system. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One form looks like black spots. These may be large, covering a mass area, or they could look like small black polka dots. This could be black **mold**, otherwise known as Stachybotrys chartarum, and it’s very dangerous (2).

Limiting your home to damp and cold areas can substantially reduce the growth of **mold** in your home. Keep an eye on your basement drain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The components of an HVAC system lead to moisture buildup in the form of condensation inside it due to dehumidification, which can trigger the production of **mold** in air ducts. Not maintaining the humidity levels inside the home can result in **mold** growth and thriving in your ac ducts. Since the inside of the air ducts is usually out of sight, it results in a state of “Out of Sight, Out of mind”. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the harder **mold**s to distinguish is Aspergillus. This type of **mold** can take on many different forms and colors. The most common colors are green, yellow or white. With that said, this type of **mold** can cause fever and chills, shortness of breath or chest and joint pain. When exposed to this type of **mold**, some people will also claim that they get headaches or some type of eye symptom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since **mold** growth is so common in homes throughout the United States, it’s a pretty safe bet to say that your home has at least a small amount of **mold**. Mold in small quantities is not anything to be too worried about. However, you should be on the lookout for signs that the **mold** growth is becoming excessive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best way to get rid of **mold** on air **vents** is by hiring a professional. They will adhere to high safety standards, ensuring there are no hazards for them, your family, or your home.

-   —A hidden plumbing leak can let water into your ducts, creating a great environment for **mold** growth. Inadequate bathroom venting —When you take a hot shower, that steam needs to go somewhere. Ideally, it should be vented outside by an exhaust fan. Otherwise it can collect on **vents** or registers in the bathroom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Again, **mold** loves to grow in damp, dark spaces. So, you’ll often find **mold** forming in areas like bathrooms or kitchens, hiding underneath cabinets or underneath baseboards. Check other areas like your basement and attic or areas that have pre-existing water damage. If **mold** is growing anywhere in your home, it could very likely be growing in the air **vents**, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3.Mold Inspection – Scammers prey on your fears, use a cheap coupon or add to get their foot in the door. Then, they tell you you have **mold**…even if you don’t! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Based on how your health is can be a clear indicator of **mold** growth in your air conditioner ducts. As the ac unit is being used, the air can be blowing **mold** spores all-around your home. This can cause some major health changes. Let’s take a look below at some warning signs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **mold** inside AC units is very often Cladosporium **mold**. This **mold** most often appears tan, grey, or white inside ducts. It is often pure dark black on AC register and on the exterior of air handers and outdoors where it is exposed to light. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Believe it or not, **mold** comes in a variety of colors. The most common **mold** for ac ducts is typically black **mold**. Oftentimes you can see the **mold** spores as they begin to collect and multiply on your air **vents**. Also, **mold** is naturally occurring and is a part of the fungi family. Mold can grow in any damp place and the **mold** spores float around in the air and eventually land in areas of high moisture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cooling coils and drain pains have a close relationship. When moisture forms on the cooling coil it drips into the condensate drain pan, allowing the moisture to drain outside of your home or into your main sewer line. Or at least it should… more on that in a second. During the whole process, dirt and **mold** spores from your home’s air are also collecting on the coil and dripping into the drain pan. You see the issue here? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Make sure you’re regularly cleaning your air **vents** and ducts before **mold** appears. You can use the above methods to keep them clean so that they aren’t the ideal environment for **mold**. Clear path: Don’t put objects or obstacles over your air **vents**. This limits good air circulation which can lead to **mold** growth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mold thrives in humid, dark spaces with a high water vapor content. When your HVAC system runs, it creates a perfect environment for **mold** growth as heated or cooled air runs through the ducts. Further, the airflow can cause spores to break off from the **mold** and spread to other areas, infesting the entire home with more **mold**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Air duct cleaning is NOT a DIY project. Special equipment is needed to remove dust, dirt, **mold** and debris. You really do need to choose a professional for this job. How can you choose the right contractor? What questions should you ask them before hiring them? What kind of advertising should you expect? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While you may not be able to spot **mold** in your air ducts, you might be able to find it in other areas of the home. Depending on the species, **mold** can be green, brown, black, blue, or white. It usually has a fuzzy or spotty appearance, and it is often accompanied by water damage or rot to the surrounding area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If possible, vacuum the coils gently with a HEPA vacuum or use a soft brush. This will help remove surface **mold** and dirt. Make sure not to damage the sensitive fins around the copper coils. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And since **mold** needs moisture, darkness, and food to survive and thrive — the HVAC system is the perfect breeding ground. If you are wondering about the ‘food source’ for **mold**, it is usually in the form of common household dust. In this HomeInspectorSecrets.com Guide, I will go over... The most common indicators that **mold** are in your HVAC system - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   UV light only works on **mold** if the light is held 1-2 inches from the effected surface. Depending on the surface, it takes anywhere from 10 – 30 seconds in that area to effectively kill the **mold**. As the distance the UV light is from the **mold** increases, the intensity of the light decreases and renders the process ineffective. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This process when done correctly supposedly kills 99% of the **mold**. Now let’s assume there is one million **mold** spores in an area. That means at the end of this process, there are still 10,000 living **mold** spores that are colonized and still reproducing in the “treated” area. Not good. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   I can tell you that the **mold** inside AC systems and ducts is typically Cladosporium **mold**. It can make many people sick. It may not be what people call toxic-**mold**, but it does very often cause other non-toxic types of health complaints like allergy and asthma, sometimes serious. Even toxic **mold** typically does not appear to often cause toxic reactions in indoor contamination settings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Start by turning off the unit. You don’t want air blowing through the system without a filter! (Not having a filter is a great way to increase dust aka ‘**mold** candy.’) Next, using a measuring tape, measure the length, width, and depth of the inside edge of the filter’s slot frame. Round down to the nearest whole number. The actual filter should be ¼” to ½” smaller than the inside of the frame. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **mold** is often grey or black, it may have white patches. It is not likely the one they call toxic black **mold**. All that grey, black, and white stuff in AC units and ducts is almost always primarily Cladosporium **mold**. Smaller amounts of Pen Asp **mold** and other **mold**s may be present in the AC unit and ducts as well. But based on countless inspections for the last many years it is primarily Cladosporium **mold** in air conditioner systems and ducts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lysol does have disinfecting products, including their **mold** and mildew remover spray. It eliminates **mold** and mildew stains, bleaches surfaces and kills 99.9 percent of viruses and bacteria. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
