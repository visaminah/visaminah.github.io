## 9 Things You Should Know About Best Laminate Flooring For Radiant Heat | best laminate flooring over radiant heat
-   Most **laminate**s also have a maximum temperature point; check with your manufacturer before combining with **radiant** heating. Still, **laminate** naturally feels warmer to the touch than other flooring choices. When combined with a **radiant** flooring system, it may be the perfect choice for keeping your home warm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What pushes individual flooring choices into the “good” or “bad” for use with **radiant** heating centers on the thickness of the flooring, and the conducive nature of the flooring materials. Thicker choices are harder to heat, and dissipate the heat quickly after heating. Mineral-based flooring are excellent thermal conductors. Some flooring materials expand and contract based on inside conditions, while others maintain their shape in all kinds of situations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing a flooring that already has thermal-conducting properties, such as stone, marble and ceramic tile, will hold more heat than other choices, making them preferred flooring choices over **radiant** heat. Ceramic tile consistently tops the list for bathroom choices because it stores heat well. If you’ve dreaded cold mornings in the master bath before, filling your room with plush rugs, **radiant** heating can change the way you look at tile, and make your bathroom warm whenever you desire. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Electric systems use rolled cables in a looping pattern braced with mats, mesh, or film. It’s embedded in a concrete slab, installed underneath the subfloor or flooring, depending on the installation method used. This is often the best choice if adding **radiant** heating after construction. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want hardwood in your home, and love the thought of heated floors too, **laminate** is the way to go. Its thinness makes it a good choice when installing over **radiant** flooring. However, you will have to take added precautions depending on the type of **radiant** heating you use. If a hydronic system allows moisture to escape, your **laminate** would be permanently damaged. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like porcelain and ceramic tile, natural stone is also a good choice for use with **radiant** heating systems. Like tile, it will warm quicker and retain heat longer after shut-off. Natural stone is thicker than tile, and will take longer to warm to the touch. Yet it has a lot of other qualities of tile in that it won’t be impacted by moisture, and won’t degrade over time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, not all flooring choices work well with **radiant** heating. To get your desired result, choose your flooring wisely. The right flooring choice will give you the warmth you’re looking for, without jeopardizing your safety in the process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Porcelain and ceramic tile are ideal for use with **radiant** heating because it conducts heat well. Its thin structure means it’s easy to lay over the heating system, and will continue to hold heat without a lot of work. Tile will heat up rapidly, and retain the heat longer once the system is turned off. Tile is also the perfect choice to use when moisture can be an issue, as it will not rot when used with hydronic systems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want the look of hardwood, many homeowners lean towards **laminate** because of the additional benefits it offers. If moisture may be an issue, **laminate** will hold up better than traditional hardwood. However, **laminate** is still wood. Water will impact the structure quickly to the point of no return. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
