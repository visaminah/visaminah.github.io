## 58 Tips for Do Navy Blue And Pink Go Together | What Color Does Purple And Pink Make?
-   Navy blue is a great colour for a bedroom, it creates a calming mood which is ideal for a room of rest. It’s able to contrast and complement other colours, creating almost endless possibilities. Whichever way you choose to introduce **navy** blue into your bedroom decorating scheme, you won’t be disappointed. Read on for some **navy** blue bedroom inspiration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But blue projects confidence and daring. And I’m not talking about **navy** here. I’m talking about true blue as a clear sky. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink looks great when paired with blue, green, yellow, or other shades of **pink**. Purple looks great with teal, blue, or red. Again, both colors work well with each other and with neutral colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some of you might know, but some don’t. So, basically, **pink** is considered a secondary color while blue is seen as the primary color. But what is the key distinction between these two colors? How do you tell which one is which? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When blue and **pink** are combined with green, the result is a gray or brown color. This color mixture produces the very same result as all modern colors. Due to their wide range of shades, these colors generate gray or brown. Gray becomes garbled when blended. Aside from gray and brown, complementary colors include orange and blue, as well as yellow and purple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For those that love grey but maybe prefer a darker hue, this muted color can also pair quite nicely with **pink**. Just one **pink** piece of accent furniture makes a bold yet delicate statement and adds just a hint of color to break up the dark grey. The blush velvet **pink** couch in the image above proves that you don’t need to overdo the **pink**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because blue, yellow, and red combine to form brown, getting yellow in your purple could really make it look less appealing. If your purple does not really turn out as intended, you could try a new **pink**, red, or blue. If you are not sure, experiment with various reds and blues to see what purples result. Quite often, the outcome is even better than just what you presumed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A mid-width, solid **pink** tie in silk will look great at any gathering. Pink will match with any shade of blue suit. In my opinion, the color works better in summer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue and **pink** are complete opposites, but you know what they say about opposites, they attract! Blue may be seen as more of a bold color whereas **pink** is softer in nature. But with the right shades, tones, and textures, blue and **pink** can be a gorgeous color combination. For example, in a blue-themed bedroom, some light shades of blue and soft shades of **pink**, along with white in the scheme can create a calming and serene space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Much like green, there are several shades of blue that will complement **pink** quite nicely. When pairing with blue, this is when we see a lot of fuchsia, darker or hot **pink**s used. Pink and blue do match nicely together and culturally, these colors are seen as opposites so putting them side by side stimulates a sort of color harmony. Pink is not just for girls and blue is not just for boys anymore. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I love how the super-feminine light **pink** pops against conservative **navy**. The look is classic yet fresh, especially when you pick heels made of the season’s it-material, velvet. Add a satin clutch and major earrings, and you’re ready to hit the town with no room for the blues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Subtlety is key. A darker wool tie is perfect to combine with a light blue suit. This is one of the occasions when you could even pull off a **pink** shirt of a more powerful tone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Almost any color will complement your blue foundation. White shirts are always a winner. But black, **pink**, and red all work well, to name just a few. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If we like **pink** and white together and we also like **pink** and black together then when we pair all three we know it’s going to be an exquisite trio. If you have to be stuck in an office all day you might as well make it something that is pleasing to look at. Each color here is completely balanced and not one outshines the other. Yes, the black may add a stark contrast but the fact that it’s carried throughout the middle of the room makes this room balanced and well designed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the end, because **pink** is a lighter and softer version of red, it may not be included in all paint sets. As such, you might need to combine white and red to get **pink** for your combination after all. Rather, combining blue and red will save you a huge amount of effort and time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Being on opposites sides from each other on the color wheel means that **pink** and green are the most complementary to each other and it also means that you can pretty much find any shade of green to go with **pink**. It’s important to match the correct hues, though. Visit our page on colors that go with green to learn more about decorating with green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   More red or **pink** might be added to create the purple pop. Additionally, adding white by itself can also lighten the combination. Because white is really light, you may need to add a lot of it before you start noticing a substantial difference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The color wheel comprises three primary colors that are red, blue, and yellow. These colors are mixed to further create secondary colors that are purple, red, and orange. Lastly, tertiary colors are made by mixing primary and secondary ones which give us six colors like red-violet, blue-green, etc. But what other colors work together and how are they combined? What happens when you mix blue and **pink** together? Let’s keep reading to learn about this tertiary color and subsequently know more about what color is bronze and what color is carbon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fun and edgy come to mind when looking at this marvelous sapphire velvet sectional. There’s a richness but also a modern edge to the design of this room. Throwing in pops of fuchsia in the pillows, artwork and even adding a bowl to the coffee table give this room a fun feel all while maintaining the richness and elegance. Historically, we know that blue and **pink** are two colors that are opposites but this room proves that opposites most definitely attract. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So what are the colours that compliment purple? Yellow, orange, and green are the most obvious ones. However, contrasting colours aren’t the only ones that matter. Colours right beside each other on the wheel also complement each other, like purple, indigo, and **pink**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blush **pink** and sage green are one of the most common colors for a nursery. These two colors when used together have a total calming effect. Very modern and trendy, pairing the sage green with the **pink** also allows for a child to grow into their room. As in the picture above, you can see based on the trendy wallpaper and wall art, it would be very easy to transition from a baby to a little girl and maybe even a teenager in this room. Also, it’s very striking to see that the sage green was carried through onto the ceiling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink and blue, as you might all know, are very various shades, but they look great together, particularly in lighter shades. Both blue and **pink** are considered gender colors and are frequently used as pastel shades for holidays such as Mother’s Day and Easter. They are a vibrant, positive, bright, and cheerful mixture, so what color do they produce when combined? Let us investigate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A blush or very light **pink** always goes well with a matched muted shade. The light touches of gray and soft **pink** in this master bedroom leave a light and airy feeling. Using two soft **pink** armchairs to carry the **pink** from the master bedroom to the sitting area is a great choice for this room. This is a little amount of **pink** without being overwhelming. It’s a soft and feminine touch but not too much that a man would feel out of place. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s 2016, so we know that **pink** isn’t just for girls and blue isn’t just for guys. And yet we still think of these two hues as opposites. IMHO, though, they’re actually totally fab when worn together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No matter if you use red and blue or **pink** and blue to create purple, you may find it more difficult than expected. Even with a 50/50 combination, it will often end up fairly close to a purple-brown shade than a light purple. It is all due to the way almost all paints are manufactured. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this bedroom, the **pink** and blue share the weight. The nice, healthy mixture of the two completes the cheery and bright feel of this bedroom. One does not outshine the other and when pairing **pink** into the accent pieces like the modern end table you are left with a space that invokes sophistication but still allows for some feminine touches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink is typically created with lights that are 50 or even less green, 40 to 50 percent blue, and 90 percent red, based on different types of **pink**. Light **pink** contains approximately 50, whereas hot **pink** contains no green. As any of these **pink**s are mixed with more blue, the quantity of blue used equals the amount of the used red color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This farmhouse bathroom has such a bright and fresh interior. The centerpiece is the **navy** vanity which is beautifully floating, exposing the floor tiles which have a cool pattern featuring a faded grayish blue color. The quartz countertop is spot on, perfectly blending in and coordinating with the white walls.{found on inthedeets}. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As far as green and **pink** go, it’s hard to get them wrong. These colors are so complementary and I am sure that you could pair almost any shade of **pink** with olive green. Here this designer, Leah Ward has combined a stunning fuchsia floral wallpaper up against a vivid olive green picked up in the bed canopy, throw pillows and accent chair. It’s lovely that the bed and curtains are in a natural tone as to not overdo the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pair a powerful red tie of finest silk with a pale **pink** shirt. If your shirt is cotton, a thinner wool or cotton tie works too. Keep the knot mid to small. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The contrast here between the blush vanity and the stark black tile makes the vibe of this bathroom totally grown up and mature. Yes, you can have a **pink** vanity and still have a mature and classy bathroom. Black fixtures are also carried throughout in the lighting and mirror but then adding in just a few touches of gold in the faucet and shower fixtures really adds a nice glam to this space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best solution would be to use a toned-down right shade of one of the colors. As you can see in the picture, the neon cyan color was switched to dark indigo blue. In this way, you will be able to use neon **pink** as a statement color and don’t overstimulate the viewer. Moreover, in such vibrant color combinations, the neon would be powered by the lightness or, in our case, the darkness of other colors to make use of its best qualities. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The shades of blue and **pink** with a bright orange wouldn’t coordinate well together. Orange is made from a warm and bright yellow and red, making this warm shade of orange diametrically opposite from blue and **pink**. Orange would coordinate better with warm and bright colors. The hue of this secondary color will be halfway between the two primary colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'Grey can be surprisingly versatile and will happily layer with many colours such as inky blues, smoky greens and rose **pink**s,' explains Patrick O’Donnell on behalf of Farrow & Ball. Giving Sulking Room Pink, Inchyra Blue and Green Smoke as examples. 'However, if you want to keep the palette more monochromatic, layer tones of grey like Ammonite with Mole’s Breath.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We have already learned that the color that is made from combining **pink** and blue is purple or light purple. The skill of mixing colors is a great form of art. The process of mixing requires a greater understanding and knowledge of different individual colors and their properties. Any mistake that occurred in the mixing of pigments of the paints can, for example, if not performed properly, will lead to bad results. To mix **pink** and blue colors to get light purple, one needs to first have a deep understanding of colors and color combinations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink goes with teal, especially when it’s a soft blush **pink**. By keeping the **pink** more muted and toned back the dark teal provides stunning contrast and that’s when we really see these two colors work together nicely. This geometric wall pattern is quite a statement but one can’t help but swoon over the complementary pairing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With **navy**, you could go either way — bright and bold or more subdued. I personally, love a nice blush **pink** up against the **navy** for a stark contrast. Like in this front porch, the blush **pink** door is perfect not only against the **navy** siding but also given the color of stonework around the pillars and at the side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2398 As gorgeous as a starry night sky is this palette that combines **navy** blue and lapis. Monochrome design never goes out of style and blue is one of the best colours for this template. With darker tones, it exudes a sleek, modern feel while with lighter tones, it creates a warm and cozy space. Either way, both are inviting for different personalities. Monochrome magic is truly representative of the versatility of blue as a shade for the home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As we have already mentioned, colors have different moods and associations, and they influence us even more when we are placed in a room filled with certain hues. For example, a living room with marigold orange walls would bring a sense of coziness and playfulness. On the contrary, a bedroom with **navy** blue decor would create a refreshing and calm ambiance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Compliment light grey walls with a statement **navy** feature wall. Be even more daring by making that feature wall idea the ceiling –reminiscent of the night sky. So often pale grey rooms can seem chilly and cold, especially in a bedroom environment and in artificial light. Keep the results warming and inviting with a deep colour of the ceiling to create a cocooning, enveloping feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yellow is such an uplifting color and when you pair it with a beautiful **pink** the combination is sure to cheer up anyone. Adding in a **pink** couch here that is solid color allowed this designer to have a little more fun with a pattern for the ottoman. Throwing down a bright and vibrant rug that picks up both colors in the couch and ottoman brings them together and creates a unified design. Looking for more yellow inspiration? Check out our article on colors that go with yellow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light color blue pairs beautifully with **pink** and yellow hues. Royal blue pairs beautifully with vibrant hues like red and white. Baby blue pairs beautifully with complementing hues like peach and gray. Sky blue complements cream, jewel tones and gold beautifully. Need I go on? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink and grey have been a trending color combo for many years now. Typical in little girl’s bedrooms the grey breaks up the **pink** but still allows for a girly but sophisticated vibe. Add in just a little pop of **pink** with mostly grey to keep the femininity to a minimum but on the opposite hand add in just a touch of grey with **pink** and you can give a space a distinctly sophisticated look. But let’s break down grey into two separate shades because between light grey and dark grey the looks are completely different. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That’s right, you can pair blue with a different shade of blue to create a beautiful and stylish interior décor. Here for example the walls are painted in a sporty blue color while the window curtains are **navy** blue. That adds depth to the design and both colors go really well with the wooden floor and the furniture. {found on echeloncustomhomes}. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When working with **pink** and incorporating it into your home, you don’t always have to go over the top with other colors. Sometimes just a little bit of color in a curtain or throw pillow is all you need. In this kitchen from Jasmin Resse Interiors, the bluish-**pink** kitchen cabinets are the main act and we just see a pop of turquoise in the patterned curtain. In this case, adding in any more color, I think, would have taken away from the simplistic beauty of these cabinets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Did you know that colors that are on the opposite end of the color wheel are known as complementary colors, for example, yellow and violet? Mixing red and white makes the color **pink**. How much of the colors red and white you add to this mixture will give you a particular shade of **pink**. A tint of red and a majority of white will give you light **pink** whereas less white and more red mixed together will give you a darker shade of **pink**. This means that **pink** is not a pure color but a tint. So, mixing **pink** and blue will give you the color purple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We are showcasing a lot of muted and blush **pink**s right now and I promise we will get to some fun, bold shades of **pink** but I must give this mixture of beige and **pink** its time in the spotlight. I love how the designer, Karen B. Wolf kept this room light and bright. She uses touches of beige in the furniture and fixtures to add a natural feel with gives this room a total earthy yet light vibe and totally complements the pale **pink** walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Navy and brown are classic menswear colors, as familiar a pairing as a **navy** suit and pair of brown leather shoes. In this renovated 1890s cottage at The Houses Daylesford in Victoria, Australia, owners Theresa Albioli and Tony De Marco chose a glossy finish for wood paneling and matte for the walls above to create a moody **navy** backdrop for an antique wood dining table and chairs. For a more contemporary look, pair a caramel brown leather sofa or blond wood Scandi-style table with matte **navy** walls and bright white accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thinking of adding **pink** to your home? It can be a scary thought to add in a color that most people associate with Barbie’s Dream House but it’s not that intimidating when you have a list of colors that go with **pink**. Adding **pink** to your home decor is as simple as knowing what colors will complement it. Sure we all may remember the **pink** 70s bathrooms or the bubblegum **pink** our mothers slapped up on the walls of our bedrooms when we were kids but **pink** has evolved when it comes to the home and it has a place in design trends. Depending on the hue, the color **pink** can be a calming color and is associated with love, kindness, and femininity so why would we not want it in our homes? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink and orange are two colors that you may not think go together but when using the right shades they do have a great appeal. When working with orange and **pink** try to keep with fuchsia. These two colors are both very joyful and are quite close to each other on the color wheel but you can still have fun with them. A bolding clash when done correctly can create quite a statement and can provide a room with a little flair and creativity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Completely traditional, this entryway and staircase have a certain allure and I believe that comes from the textured **pink** wallpaper. Breaking up the white wainscoting and adding in **pink** gives this traditional space charm and elegance but also a bit of fun. Throwing down a **pink** rug also calms the space and makes it less cold and more inviting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink and blue color with just a touch of orange will probably look out of place together. Orange is composed of a bright and warm red and yellow, making it directly opposed to **pink** and blue. Orange generally goes well with bright and warm colors. The secondary color will have a hue that is in the middle between the two primary colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whimsical + colorful = fun. If you’re not sure if your color scheme screams “fun,” ask yourself if you’d find those colors in a candy shop. Bright, warm, contrasting colors are loads of fun, as are neon and “unnatural” colors like **pink** and purple and lime green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To mix **pink** and blue with green leads to a brown or gray color. This combination of mix has the same result as all contemporary colors. These colors produce gray or brown because of their vast spectrum of shades. Gray, when mixed, becomes muddled. Apart from the two colors, brown and gray, complimentary colors also include blue and orange and yellow and purple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And when in doubt, black is always seriously in style. Add dark accents for a splash of color. Think crimson instead of cherry, **navy** instead of turquoise. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bright jewel tones, like Blue Ivy and Solange are rocking above, are especially cool and complementary. And if you’ve got blue eyes, they really make your peepers pop. But blue and **pink** in other forms, like pastels, or **navy** and light **pink**, look really pretty together, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In terms of combining lights, the procedure differs slightly. Lights typically use the RGB color model instead of the RYB color model. As some of you might know, blue and **pink** lights, as per the RGB color model, will produce a purple-**pink** or rich purple color based on the light output of the colors used in the combination. While using the RGB color wheel and lights, purple is commonly known as violet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When paired with black or other dark colors, **navy** blue and similar shades can look quite sophisticated. A décor like this stands out and has depth even though the colors are fairly similar in intensity. Add a few bright touches of color for effect if you want to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
