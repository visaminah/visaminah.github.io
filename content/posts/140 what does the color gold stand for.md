It removes the material obsession with **gold** things, and replaces it with the drive to seek out spiritual perfection that is as pure as **gold**. Baha’u’llah, the prophet and founder of the Baha’i Faith, wrote: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not so in German, where “blau sein” means being drunk. “Blau machen”, literally “making blue”, means taking the day off because of a hangover.

And where in English we promise the moon, the Germans promise the **color** of the sky: “das Blaue vom Himmel verspechen”. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Children’s brands often use **color**ful designs – like Toys”R”Us or Crayola – but grown-up brands can also be creative! The use of multiple **color**s in Google’s logo shows the brand’s playfulness. As an example, ebay had a similarly **color**ful logo up until 2017 when it simplified its logo to one **color** in its marketing campaigns, although the **color**ed logo remains on the website. A similar change was made to Apple’s logo, from the multi**color**ed striped apple to a sleek silver one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   We often take for granted the significance and meaning behind some of our most well-known symbols. Flags have long been used as representation of places and people, and the thought that goes into their design goes far beyond just the choosing of complimentary **color**s and images. Their meanings often exemplify the values, history and moral standing of the places or individuals they represent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As with the concept of Yin and Yang, the duality of dark-light, black and white reflect natural complimentary manifestations. Black absorbs; white reflects. Philosophically one could say that these two **color**s represent the “as above, so below” but in their dichotomy. White would be the heavens, and black the rich earth from which Nature’s abundance springs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
