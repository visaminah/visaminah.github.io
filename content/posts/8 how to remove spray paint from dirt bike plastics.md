## 8 Fun Facts How To Remove Spray Paint From Dirt Bike Plastics | How To Remove Spray Paint From Plastic Without Damaging
-   This is nothing different then the primer really, you want the same technique and take your time to apply a nice even coat. Letting the **paint** start to cure inbetween coats is important because it will make sure the **paint** adheres to the layer underneath. This should be explained on the back of the can so make sure you follow the instructions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Product Total Sand paper – assuming a couple of different grades $10.00 3 x Cans of primer $24.00 3 x Cans of **paint** $21.00 - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best **paint** for **spray**ing any dirt bike frame is an automotive **paint** applied over a self etching primer. This will provide longevity over standard **spray** **paint**s. Using a reputable brand without going cheap will help avoid a poor finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although I prefer to powder coat, if I were to go down the route of **spray** **paint**ing my frame I would opt for rustoleum self etching primer which comes in a 12oz can and is usually around $7 per can on Amazon. (Link below) and then Rustoleum automotive **paint** at a similar price . These products I have used on other parts I have **spray**ed for dirt bike projects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is always a good idea to completely strip the frame of components before you start any prep work. Sure you can **paint** sections of the bike by masking off the areas you dont want to **paint**, but to do a proper job with a nice even application, then fully stripping the bike is the way to go. This will also go towards giving you the best possible finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are following the hand keying method then you will have old **paint** on the frame which is fine. It can be a benefit as it will provide you rust protection to the section of frame underneath. The **paint**ed areas will need keying as well though so don’t miss them out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you do any **paint** application you want to setup a decent work area. Hanging the frame up to get 360 degree access is ideal. You can use wire coat hangers or rope to suspend the frame from your garage ceiling if you are able to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are 2 main options when it comes to **paint**ing your dirt bike frame. You can either get it powder coated or you can **paint** it yourself using **spray** cans. I am making the assumption that most people who read this post will be looking at the option of **paint**ing the frame themselves so that is the process we will talk about in this post. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
