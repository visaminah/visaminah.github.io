-   Orange is a warm and welcoming color and there are quite a few **colors** that go with orange. First, different shades of orange for a monochromatic look, or try using blues and greens. Neutral **colors** like white, brown, cream, and beige work well. Purple can also add a pop of color next to orange. When it comes to what color matches orange walls, then some of these are your go-to accent **colors** for orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Warm peachy **red** is having a real moment. By now, you’ve probably seen the shade in dozens of matte lipstick tubes, blush palettes, and the like. Instead of applying the color to our lips, we’d rather wear it in a way that’s semi-permanent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Remember to have fun and don't be afraid to experiment with different shades and varying proportions of each color.

-   This whimsical bedroom belonging to Kate Pearce's daughter is so much fun for a variety of reasons, but one of the biggest is the playful use of color. The pink trim that runs around the ceiling, floor, and doorways frames the walls cove**red** in a floral wallpaper pattern.

-   If you want to go all-in on a moody color scheme, this **red** and green bedroom by Reath Design is a study in how to do it right. The trick is to add a secondary color — in this case, orange.

-   You might not think pink and orange go together, but it can create a fun and bold combination. Pink can go with orange walls and makes a playful option for a girls’ bedroom.

-   You might think orange décor could be too much, but there is more to the color than a single option. There are a few ways you can subdue the color, or even use it like you would a neutral color.

Some of the easier orange **colors** to work with besides burnt orange include sienna and terracotta. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Which direction does your bedroom face? If the window faces south, then you’re onto a winner. South-facing rooms have an ever-glow characteristic. They sit facing south, and as such have the best placement towards natural - warm - sunlight. Match a south-facing window bedroom with the right color of **red**. Ideally, this is a chalky, matt color of **red**, such as this Sang De Boeuf shade from paint brand Edward Bulmer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My fellow **red**heads, I hope you all enjoyed Tuesdays revelries… or, for most of you, the weekends debauchery. Even if you have no Irish ancestry, as a **red**head, St. Patrick’s is your day. People rub your head for good luck, call you a leprechaun (or is that just me…?), and above all, definitely expect you to be wearing green. That is our color, right? We’ve all heard it… most likely more than once…. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Colors that go with **red** are tricky to pin down - **red** is one of the punchiest **colors** in the color wheel. Danger, fire, love, and anger. These are just a few of the things which, throughout life and for better or worse, we are told the color **red** represents and because of this it is often deemed too strong for decorating certain rooms at home - the very opposite of all the soothing **colors** that go with grey. But is that always the case, we ask? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. Cinnamon. As Neil Young said, we are the Cinnamon Girl. The **red**dish/brown tint of cinnamon looks amazing with many a **red**head’s locks. Again, add some **red** accents! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The natural color of wood is extremely versatile and stained wood is just as great. They go really well with **red** and lots of other accent **colors**, as you can see in this farmhouse-style kitchen. We like the contrast added by the concrete countertops that prevent the **red** cabinets from clashing with the wood backsplash.{image from blackburnarch}. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Eager to try a **red** hair color? We don’t blame you! When it comes to achieving the **red** shade of your dreams, however, it’s best to avoid DIYing it at-home. Red is a notoriously finicky color, so we always recommend leaving your **red** hair color transformation to a salon professional. They’ll be able to create a specific formula using professional color to help you leave the salon with the best possible results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike pink-infused hair, blood orange is all about the juicy notes. There’s barely a hint of **red** here. Instead, the shade is primarily an orangey blonde that looks a little space-age chic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Consider this as canon when forming your modern bedroom ideas. It depends on which direction your bedroom faces and where the natural light comes from, alongside the specific tone of **red** you end up choosing. Be aware of both of these elements, and you can make a savvy decor decision on whether to, or whether to not, envelop a bedroom in **red**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Historically, the color **red** has been associated with the romantic gesture of gifting **red** roses. Red hues are connected with a cozy fireplace and a volcanic eruption. Red **colors** combine passion and danger (due to **red** being the color of blood), and these color shades stimulate people when they spot this specific color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark, neutral **colors** are a great way to ground a **red** and green room and avoid that Christmassy feel. This dining nook from Maestri Studio pairs a swirling green wallpaper design with a bright **red** dining bench with a black base. Black and white tiled floors, a white table, and a gold chandelier add an air of glamour to the swanky breakfast nook. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Green and yellow are analogous **colors** on the color wheel, so naturally, they pair well together as seen in this living room by Dabito from Old Brand New. While the blue-green accent wall and mustard yellow couch are the main attractions, pops of **red** are brought in with the help of home decor, like pillows, a throw, artwork, and a colorful rug. A black coffee table mirrors the chandelier above, while a vase filled with lush greenery adds an organic note to the eclectic scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Orange is a warm and uplifting color that can inspire creativity and brings a fun element to a space. To get the most out of orange décor ideas, you need to understand what **colors** go with orange, so you do not overwhelm the senses. By creating the best orange color combinations, you can help bring an engaging and joyful feeling to a room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In a more traditional setting like this dining room a darker and more subdued shade of **red** can look really nice when pai**red** with ivory or beige and with wooden furniture with a dark stain on it. It’s a classic combo which gives the **red** a very royal feel.{found on tylarkins}. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When color mixing, Morse recommends using materials with texture, such as velvet, bouclé, and linen, or using subway tile in either shade for a pop of color and fun. "For kitchens, the Wolf appliances with **red** knobs, or **red** appliances, are a great way to infuse [the color into] your design," she says. If you are still unsure about using the color scheme in your home year-round, start off small with pieces of decor that can quickly and easily be swapped in and out, such as accent pillows, throws, area rugs, and artwork. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Maybe painting all the walls in a room orange seems too much, but you still want to use it? Instead of going all out with all the walls, paint only one wall and create an accent wall. You can choose a vibrant orange or a more earthy orange and surround it with more neutral tones like white or cream. You can further bring in more orange **colors** by adding other items or accessories. You could also go for a patterned look that contains orange, which is an even more subtle way of introducing the color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some of the misconceptions? Well, generally speaking, we’re advised to swerve using **red** in rooms which are intended to be restful by nature - bedrooms mainly. However, this shouldn’t be taken as gospel, as we discover. And whilst it is a firey character amongst its color counterparts, it can be used to create beautifully whimsical room scenarios too, like a dream dining room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cozy up your bedroom with dark shades of **red** and green. The moody color pairing looks positively radiant in this dreamy setup by Hudson & Mercer. Add an earthy neutral such as tan to the mix, which will lighten up the scheme while simultaneously adding warmth. Complete the luxurious setup with lustrous brass accents and striking wood furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   4. That little Red dress. Yes I said it! Every **red**head should have at least one **red** dress. Make sure to pick a shade of **red** that doesn’t match your hair. The same rules for finding the right shade of **red** lipstick apply. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first thing to think about is painting the walls, which is not as simple as it appears. Red walls can transform a space into something gorgeous and elegant, especially when applied in a Mediterranean or classic style. In order to accomplish this look in a current and modern style, it is necessary to balance the strong impression of **red** with other elements of the design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That is not to say that white should be abandoned as a part of interior design – far from it. White provides much needed neutrality and can create a calming space. However, it is important to balance that neutral space with the little colour accents that stimulate the creative and emotional sides of your psyche. One of the best colours for this is, somewhat surprisingly, the colour **red**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here’s another infinitely wearable shade of **red**. This caramel-influenced color suits women of all skin tones, combining ashy notes with warm **red** and brown. Instead of spending another year on the same old caramel hair, add a surprising flash of **red** to the mix. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When looking at the basics of color theory, you will learn that orange is a secondary color. This means it is made by combining equal amounts of your primary **colors** yellow and **red**. Orange, like **red**, is made to stand out, and a bold orange can convey both excitement and warmth. There are also various shades of orange you choose from lighter to darker or bolder options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Square color schemes are **colors** placed at an equal distance from each other like the triadic **colors** but in a square form. Again, these **colors** form a contrast and should be used carefully, in a similar fashion to your triadic **colors**. Whenever there are more than three **colors** in a color scheme, it becomes more challenging to combine them, so you need to properly understand how to work with these **colors** to create a balanced and cohesive look. Rectangular or a tetradic color scheme, also has four **colors** evenly spaced, but it contains two pairs of complementary **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When combined with linen white walls, apple **red** window frames truly add to the dramatic attractiveness of a room’s design. This impact is aided by well-chosen flooring, such as carpets with a variety of **colors**. It is possible that the **colors** you choose to compliment this style will be both warm and cold in tone, depending on the look you are aiming for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nothing infuses energy into a living space quite like a radiant shade of **red**. The ultimate power color, **red** stirs up an emotional response—like passion from rich ruby, warmth from deep crimson, or vitality from striking scarlet. Not as serene as green or as beloved as blue, this fiery hue tends to strike controversy among design enthusiasts. But for a color that’s known for bringing the drama, what else should we expect? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You don't have to use bright, saturated shades in order to nail a **red** and green color palette. For example, in this light green nursery designed by Chango & Co., white furniture and muted tones keep the sweet space feeling light and airy. The **red**-spotted area rug and dark green nightstand add visual weight without overpowering the subdued scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also go from bold to earthier shades of orange for a more rustic appeal. If you are happier with a more neutral color palette, orange can also be used similar to neutral **colors**. Some examples are burnt sienna and ochre. These **colors** work well with soft greens, warm browns, and pale blues, to create a natural and comfortable look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red interior **colors** stimulate the senses and compel people to act. Red interior design and décor encourage people to take risks and make snap judgments. Red bedroom design makes it easier to wake up but could also cause difficulties in going to sleep. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s nothing wrong with using white as a primary color in a room. In fact, it’s the most versatile color that goes well with everything, including **red**. That gives you the possibility to really put an emphasis on your accent color and even to introduce a third color as well, like brown for instance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a more grandiose and luxurious feel, try pairing gold and **red** in the dining room or more formal area. It creates an old-age spirit but also a sophistication and timeless appeal as well.{found on wandrdesign}. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Colors used in interior design have an effect on how a room feels. Red accent walls, ceilings, floors, and home furnishings provide an atmosphere of vitality, passion, and vitality in a room. By monitoring the amount of **red** utilized in interior design, you may exert control over a powerful yet subtle element of your room’s décor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We love the dark, moody shades used in this bedroom by the team over at Hudson and Mercer. The earthy tones of the rust-colo**red** walls and the hunter-green accents pair beautifully with the rich burl wood features. A pair of bouclé stools and stylish mirrors complete the handsome vanity setup. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Powder blue is actually the perfect partner for a bright and bold pillar box **red** shade," says paint and decorating guru Annie Sloan. “It instantly cools the fiery tendencies of the **red** and has connotations of fun and playful mid-century decor. Think American Diner, or indeed those beautifully playful blue and **red** Italian kitchens and cafe schemes of the 1950s era - powder blue and pillar box **red**? It’s tried and tested!” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When studying the color wheel will help you to determine the best **colors** that go with orange. By taking note of where each color can be found, you can find the various color combinations that will work. However, when dealing with orange décor, it is best to use it as an accent color because it can become overstimulating in larger amounts. Let us move on to some of the color combinations for orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When we think of the **colors** **red**, green, and blue we tend to imagine the bright shades that are present in every kid's classroom. However, there is no rule that says you can't experiment with warmer or cooler variations. For example, in this open living space by Black Lacquer Design the emerald green dining chairs and **red** sofa are in line with tradition, but the light blue cabinet color is an unexpected twist. In addition to being fun to look at, each vibrant color distinguishes a different area — green for the dining space, blue for the kitchen, and **red** for the living room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When the time comes to select the perfect palette for your room, you can't go wrong with complementary color pairings like blue and orange, yellow and purple, or **red** and green. Now you might be thinking that the latter combination will make your space look a little too much like Santa's workshop; however, **red** and green are easier to work with than you might think. "They're not difficult [to decorate with] as long as you don't make it look like a holiday room," says Andi Morse, founder of Morse Design. "Do **red** and green go well together? Yes, they do, but I would integrate other **colors** and lots of texture to keep your space from looking too seasonal." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink is the perfect complementary color to **red**. It is **red**'s closest color friend, and as a result, the combination makes for a well-matched decorating scheme. For best results opt for a softer Etruscan or earthy **red** tone when thinking about **colors** to go with pink, as it tends to pair together more tonally than brights. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our first color combination is known as complementary **colors**. When these two **colors** are placed alongside one another, one color tends to make the other color stand out, meaning it creates a contrast. In this case, if you find orange on the color wheel, and you follow a line that moves directly opposite orange, you will find blue. So, for example, if you have a blue couch, an orange cushion would be quite eye-catching, and it produces a more balanced look. If you are looking for more than just two **colors** for a contrasting color scheme, you can have a look at split complementary **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Amp up the drama in your powder room with a bold wallpaper pattern à la this setup by Black Lacquer Design. The oversize mural — showcasing shades of green, **red**, and greige — does all the work for you. Complete the scene with a crimson faucet, towel ring, and stool. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you go **red**, there’s always the option to really go **red**. This neon shade is straight out of a comic strip or spy novel. Be warned that bright shades tend to fade quickly, so you’ll need to discuss a custom care routine with your stylist. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Despite the fact that **red** fills the air with a romantic aura, when it is utilized excessively, it can generate an undesirable strong emotional reaction. Moderate use of this hue will prevent its intensity from escalating to the point of causing overstimulation. When it comes to designing your bedroom using different **red** hues, be cautious. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This type of color combination also provides a harmonious look but uses only variations in a single color. This would mean you take the orange and then use lighter or darker shades of this one particular color.
