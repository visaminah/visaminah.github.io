-   'Grey is a beautiful color on its own but it also works so well with every other color because it's the ultimate neutral.

-   Muted sage green **kitchen**s are everywhere at the moment, and we love this rustic, country-style hue.

Light wood is a very easy material, which can bring a warm and familiar atmosphere into the interior. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'Grey is an ideal foil for other shades,' says Livingetc editor Pip Rich. 'This makes **grey** **kitchen** ideas the ideal solution. You'll only want to design a **kitchen** once, maybe twice in the entire time you live in a home, so if you go for a **grey** hero piece - like the island - you can easily swap other, more colorful accessories in as the years go by. Right now, I'm really into the fizzy joy of yellow next to **grey**.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Interior designer Kelly Hoppen thinks that **grey** is part of a growing trend. 'What we're seeing is that pale tones can be cool and cutting edge,' Kelly says.

-   A light-**grey** **kitchen** looks best with a very pale, almost white wood. When it comes to dark, graphite-**grey** color, all shades of **grey** fit well. You might go for a bold contrast, choosing light wood or give the interior a warmer look by combining **grey** **kitchen** cabinets with yellow or orange shaded wooden counters.
