## 9 Facts Water Pressure Starts Good Then Drops | water pressure starts strong then drops
-   Low water **pressure** can ruin everything from your shower to your dishes. If you’re tired of dealing with a low flow, let us know. The earlier we deal with it, the less the damage will spread–plus, the sooner you’ll be enjoying your regular water **pressure** again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If it has a handle similar to the one you would use to turn on your hose, it needs to be turned counterclockwise as far as it can go. If the handle looks like a lever, the lever needs to be parallel to the pipe. Otherwise, it’s not fully open, which is why your **pressure** is low. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Between showering, running the dishwasher, and flushing the toilet, American families use an average of 300 gallons of water a day. We tend not to think about where that water comes from or how it comes out of our faucets. Most of us don’t know where to look if the water **pressure** **drops**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you do, there’s a test you can try yourself to find out if the **pressure** regulator is failing to get an accurate read. Attach a water **pressure** gauge to your outside hose spigot, ideally the one that is closest to your **pressure** regulator. When you turn the water on, the **pressure** gauge will give you an immediate read of your water **pressure**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your basement or foundation is flooded you already know your pipes are leaking. However, it doesn’t take a leak of that size to mess with your water **pressure**. The leak is misdirecting your water supply so that even if everything else is working properly, you’re not getting the full flow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We’ve all dealt with clogged drains and pipes that are bad enough to call in a plumber. But what happens when the issue isn’t with the water draining but instead with the amount of water actually coming out? The average in-home water **pressure** is about 40 to 45 pounds per square inch (or PSI). If you feel like you’re dealing with low water **pressure**, chances are your **pressure** has slipped below this number. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll have to decide how unbearable it is to have low water **pressure** here and there. You may find that experimenting with your timing and changing your routine will help. As long as you can gauge when your neighbor isn’t using their water, you’ll be able to use yours just fine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If it’s lower than what your **pressure** regulator is reporting, your issue might be with the **pressure** regulator. These regulators are designed to adjust the **pressure** coming from your water supply line to a level that is safe for your pipes. If it’s not reading, it thinks that it’s doing its job when it’s actually letting through a low PSI. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is never a fun one to break to people. Shared pipelines are pipelines that run water into more than one house. What that entails is that when your neighbor takes a shower or washes their car, your water **pressure** is going to go down. This doesn’t mean that you’re paying for their water usage, but it does mean that your water supply is divided between two or more households. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
