## 294 Reference List: Best Sony Lens For Interior Photography | Best Sony Lens For Real Estate Photography
-   The **lens** has a constant max aperture of f/4. That means your aperture doesn’t narrow when you use the larger focal length. You have more natural light to work with, making darker rooms seem bright and airy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, one thing that most street photographers will agree on is that wide-angle **lens**es below 35mm are generally more difficult to use for street. If you are shooting people with a **lens** under 35mm then you will literally need to be in their face to get the photo. That said, some street shooters like to use a 24mm to allow them to include more of the surrounding environment in their photo. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are looking for the best possible wide-angle zoom **lens** then you don’t need to look any further than the Sony FE 16-35mm f/2.8 GM. This certainly isn’t a lightweight **lens** though, as it weighs in at a hefty 680g. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Any type of **lens** can be used to capture people, which means they are technically portrait **lens**es. But specific focal lengths can produce more flattering images. Shorter ones (35-55mm) are great if the backdrop is important to the story you’re telling, while longer focal lengths of 85 to 135mm can be great for general portraits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a variety of different **lens**es that allow you to photograph different sporting events. A lot of **lens** choice breaks down to the type of event, where you are relative to the action, and the lighting of the event. How do you choose the best **lens** for a sporting event? There are a variety […] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Excellent value for a wide-angle **lens** from $499.00 Buy from Amazon Nikon AF-S DX 12-24mm f/4.0 IF-ED Zoom Lens Best Nikon DX Lens Compatible with Nikon F-mount DX cameras - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Nikon PC 19mm is a masterpiece in precision **lens** building. It doesn’t come cheap. But for build and image quality, not much comes close. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The focal lengths available in this **lens** are incredibly wide, and photographing with these angles of view is very fun. Especially the 12mm end provides the opportunity to set one's work apart from the crowd. I shared a 16mm example earlier, but 12mm is in another class of wide. The FE 12-24 is a quality **lens**, but note that it does not accept front filters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, what’s most brilliant about this **lens** is its stunning bokeh and excellent autofocus. It’s fast, reliable, and silent. You can also use this in low light situations and get breathtaking results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 200-600mm F5.6-6.3 G OSS **lens** has not been out for very long but it’s already proving itself to be an exceptional telephoto **lens** for wildlife photographers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Sony a7c compact **lens** is extra lightweight, small and cheap. It’s even one of the smallest **lens**es for this camera. Yet, it still has a reasonable focal length of 16-50mm. It usually comes together as a kit **lens**, but if not, then this investment should be considered by hobby photographers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   15. Sony FE 85mm f1.4 GM A portrait photographer’s dream **lens** Specifications Mount: Sony FE Elements/groups: 13/10 Diaphragm blades: 11 Autofocus: Linear SSM (Super Sonic wave Motor) Stabilizer: No Min focus distance: 0.8m Max magnification: 0.12x Filter thread: 77mm Dimensions (WxL): 90x108mm Weight: 820g Today's Best Deals View at Walmart (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Best Buy (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Stunning image quality + High-end handling + Top-quality construction Reasons to avoid - Fairly weighty - Expensive to buy - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Try the Sony FE 28mm F2.0, one of the most compact and budget-friendly **lens**es you can get. It’s great for wide-angle photography of landscapes and everyday scenes, and an overall brilliant prime **lens** too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 16-35mm f/2.8 GM with very little coma and distortion is a great **lens** for astrophotography. This certainly isn’t a lightweight **lens** though as it weighs in at a hefty 680g. Thankfully the build quality is excellent and it’s weather sealed against dust and moisture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Build quality is excellent and it weighs just 565 g, which is 47 g more than the popular Sony 16-35 f/4 FE **lens**. The **lens** has very impressive corner sharpness even when wide-open at f/4, there’s minimal distortion and almost no COMA for night photography. However with a widest aperture of f/4 the 16-35 F2.8 GM **lens** or the 24mm F1.4 GM **lens** are more likely to be the first choice for astro shooters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There aren't too many ultra-wide zooms out there for Sony APS-C mirrorless cameras, but this offering is conveniently compact and lightweight while still packing a punch with good overall performance, a constant f/4 aperture rating throughout the zoom range, and 3-stop optical stabilization. The latter is quite rare on an ultra-wideangle zoom **lens**, and very useful if you have one of Sony's un-stabilized A6000-series cameras. In terms of image quality, centre-sharpness is excellent throughout the zoom range but corner-sharpness is relatively lackluster at 10mm, even when stopping down the aperture. Thankfully, color fringing is pretty negligible at any combination of focal length and aperture setting, even towards the corners of the image frame, and distortion is quite well controlled. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Zeiss makes some pretty great **lens**es for the Sony a7iii, and the Batis 85mm f/1.8 is no exception. It’s another versatile option you can use for landscape and interior photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you enable in-camera corrections, you will barely notice the chromatic aberrations from this **lens**. Still, they can be visible at wide apertures. The same goes with vignetting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 14mm f/1.8 GM is one of those **lens**es that make one grateful to be photographing at this time. Those photographing architecture, real estate, large products, or other subjects in a confined space, those photographing the great outdoors, including landscape and night sky photography, and those who simply want to get creative with ultra-wide-angles will want the Sony FE 14mm f/1.8 GM Lens in their kit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's compact, lightweight, and extremely versatile. Making this our top pick **lens** for the Sony a7iii for the most people's needs. It's certainly not the cheapest **lens** on the list, but it's also not the most expensive. Truly an epic all-round **lens** for those looking to upgrade their camera quickly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Those looking for some of the best third-party Sony a7iii compatible **lens**es would love the Sigma 24-70mm F2.8 DG DN Art. It combines both range and high brightness to deliver a stunning performance, without the exorbitant price tag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 24-70mm F2.8 GM II **lens** is part of the Sony G Master range, and if you don’t know, this is their premium line of **lens**es, with the aim to provide ultimate image quality, as well as beautiful background blur (or bokeh). This new **lens** is relatively small and lightweight, with an aperture ring, making it a great match if you’re looking for a small(er) **lens** without compromising on image quality. There’s an 82mm filter thread, and a relatively close focus distance of 21-30cm. With weather-sealing it’s a perfect match for Sony’s weather sealed mirrorless cameras. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thankfully the build quality is excellent and it’s weather sealed against dust and moisture. The 11 circular aperture blades delivers ultra-smooth bokeh, focusing is fast and silent, and the sharpness is excellent across the frame. I own this **lens** myself and it very rarely leaves my gear bag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 24-105mm f/4 G OSS isn’t Sony’s ‘best’ standard zoom **lens** for its full-frame cameras. However, compared with the top-flight Sony 24-70mm f/2.8 G Master, this **lens** is smaller, lighter, and feels better balanced on A7-series bodies. It also has a more generous zoom range and adds optical stabilization which is lacking in the bigger **lens**, and it only costs about two-thirds of the price. Sure, you lose a f/stop in aperture rating compared with the G Master **lens**, but we think the 24-105mm is the best Sony **lens** for affordable everyday photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 90mm f/2.8 Macro G OSS **lens** is one of the sharpest **lens**es that Sony has ever built. DxOMark reviewed this **lens** and said that its outstanding, scoring higher marks than both the Canon and Nikon equivalents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Sony **lens** ticks all the right boxes for portraiture on a full-frame camera, with its 85mm focal length and fast f/1.4 aperture. As such, it works really well for isolating the main subject against a blurred background. As well as being super-sharp, the quality of bokeh is wonderfully soft and dreamy, and remains so even when stopping down a little, helped by a very well-rounded 11-blade diaphragm. It’s undeniably a very pricey **lens** but we've estabished that its performance more than justifies the cost. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are into taking captures of insects, spiders, flowers, or anything else that’s super small, then look nowhere else. Here is your macro **lens** for Sony a7c. You don’t find any better macro with several benefits for this affordable price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a full frame camera, you’ll need a full frame **lens**. You can use adaptors if you want to use APS-C **lens**es with a full frame camera. But these can affect the quality of your images. And you need perfect quality for real estate photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** isn’t cheap. But it’s the perfect piece of equipment for architectural photography. The optical results are incredible. And once you start using one, you won’t know how you lived without it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s a lot to love about this **lens**, and so there should be given that it’s pricey for 35mm f/1.8 prime. It has a solid, weather-resistant construction featuring a metal barrel and mounting plate, while handling is very refined with a tactile focus ring and customizable function button. The image quality is excellent overall, although there’s some definite vignetting at wide apertures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony’s mirrorless **lens**es corrected for use on full-frame bodies like the A7 and A9 series, are labeled FE and have no reduction in their field-of-view when shooting in full-frame modes; these also work on cropped bodies or in cropped modes, albeit again with a 1.5x field-reduction. Sony’s A-mount **lens**es have SAL in their product codes, but models additionally labeled with DT are designed for bodies with cropped / APSC sensors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Without doubt, the Sigma 14mm f/1.8 Art is one of the best ultra-wide angle **lens**es ever made to this date. This **lens** has been available in both Canon, Nikon and Sigma mounts for some time, but now Sigma has adapted this **lens** for Sony E-mount. So you are basically getting an SLR designed **lens** with an adapter bolted on, this means that it does retain its considerable size and weight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best prime **lens** Sony FE 24mm F1.4 gm Finding an excellent quality wide-angle **lens** with such a low aperture number is rare. But in this case, the Sony FE 24mm F1.4GM **lens** excels and is excellently priced at the same time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With a focal range of 200-600mm and a maximum aperture of f/6.3 at 600mm this **lens** will help you to get closer to wildlife than ever before. If 600mm is not long enough then you can also add the 1.4x or 2.0x teleconverters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While some up-market Sony **lens**es are produced in conjunction with legendary optical manufacturer Zeiss, Sony now also produces its own premium ‘G’ and top-flight ‘G Master’ **lens**es as well. These aim for the ultimate in all-around performance and image quality, especially in terms of sharpness and bokeh (the quality of defocused areas within images). A prime example of this is Sony's 50mm F1.2 G Master (opens in new tab) **lens**, which is quite possibly the best 50mm **lens** (opens in new tab) on the market right now. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A standard full-frame zoom **lens** is something that every traveler needs. It handles well in both landscape and portrait photography. With a focal length of 24-70mm and the maximum aperture of f/2.8 is something you really can’t go wrong. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Images from the Samyang AF 12mm F2.0 E look fantastic, with excellent sharpness even when shooting wide open. You might notice some lateral chromatic aberration throughout the aperture range, but this can be easily corrected in-camera; the same goes for the minor vignetting and fringing that can crop up occasionally. This **lens** really punches above its weight for an optic at this price and is a tremendous addition to the kit bag of any Sony APS-C user. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is the best real estate **lens** for Sony cameras. It’s compatible with all E-mount Sony cameras. These include the Sony a6400 and a6600—two excellent mirrorless cameras. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another great Sports Photography Lens for Sony a7C is the Sony FE 85mm f/1.8. The ZEISS Batis 1.8/85 **lens** boasts a fast maximum aperture of f/1.8 for creatively blurred backgrounds, as well as built-in optical photo stabilization, allowing you to transfer and take images handed even in low light. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We also love the fact that it's the lightest 24mm f/1.4 **lens** you can get anywhere. Sure, it does come at a higher price point, but if you’re serious about your astrophotography, this is the **lens** for you to get. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The zoom range of the **lens** is ideal for real estate photography and lets you get the very best out of your Sony a6000 and capture photographs of a home in all of its glory. The 10mm wide angle is ideal for taking large outdoor photographs of the house as well as any indoor photographs in tight spaces or cramped rooms. Moving up through the zoom range you have the mid-range that is ideal for photographing the main room and finally the full 18mm zoom range that can be used to capture key parts of the house in detail. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Real estate photographers with a Fujifilm camera need this **lens**. It has a beautiful construction with excellent optical quality. And it has the perfect focal length range for interior and exterior real estate photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To help you decide on the best **lens** for your intended use, I’ve categorized the **lens**es into the following groups. Please note that there is a little duplication between the groups but this should hopefully make it much easier for you to find the **lens** that you are looking for. You can click any of the below links to jump to the type of **lens** that interests you the most. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   STF – Smooth Transition Focus. Lenses that employ special APD **lens** groups that get thicker towards the edges and, because of that, reduce the amount of light passing through. These **lens**es are designed to deliver extremely smooth, silky out of focus bokeh. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **lens** has the Nikon vibration reduction image stabilization system. It counteracts camera shake , keeping your images sharp. That’s a handy feature if you’re working in low light. You can also leave your tripod at home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Due to the abundance of light provided by the sun, it is much easier to participate in outdoor sports photography. Even if your **lens** has an aperture of f/5.6, shooting at shutter speeds beyond 1/250 is no longer a challenge. For example, many professional sports photographers will try for a shutter speed of 1/1000. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 12-24mm is the ultimate real estate **lens** for Sony users. It’s the perfect partner for your full frame Sony camera. And it’ll be a huge step forward for your real estate photography career. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At 600mm this **lens** is sharper than the Sony FE 100-400 + 1.4x is at 560mm. At 400mm this **lens** is also a touch sharper than the 100-400 which considering it’s a G **lens** and not a GM **lens** is really quite something. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Below, I differentiate different types of **lens**es by the size of their aperture, which is the hole that allows in light as measured by the f-stop. With a wider aperture, more light will come in for a better chance at getting great video indoors in dim lighting. The big trade-off with a wide aperture is you can’t focus on as many objects at different distances because the **lens** has a shallow depth of field. This will keep your subject very clear but the background will become blurry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a comparison with the Sony 24-70 F2.8 GM **lens** and the Tamron 28-75 F2.8 see this video from Gerald Undone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Performance: Interestingly it has built-in image stabilization. It’s a rarity and usually Sony E-**lens**es don’t have this excellent feature. Also, it has other usual features like smooth autofocus and ED glass for reduced aberrations. However, the focus could be a bit too noisy for videos. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Performance: A maximum aperture throughout the zoom range gives you great control over focusing and a nice background shallow depth of field. Super Sonic autofocus gives you traditionally as it’s with G-series a fast, quiet, and smooth focusing. But the biggest perk of this **lens** is built-in image stabilization. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is one of the Sony **lens**es that receives mixed reviews. Some people love it whilst others don’t rate is so favorably. I own this **lens** myself and although it’s certainly not as sharp as the GM version, the images it produces are sharp enough unless you really enjoy a good pixel peeping session. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** is sharp from 24mm all the way up to 105mm even when you are shooting wide open at f/4. If you like MTF charts then Roger Cicala has some over at LensRentals.com. Sony has really gone to town on this **lens** and it certainly shows. I don’t own this **lens** myself, but if I had money to burn I would certainly pick one up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because of the rather ‘slow’ aperture of f/4, this **lens** is not that big and is great to fit in your bag. The image quality of this **lens** is good, but not amazing. Obviously, the GM **lens**es beat this **lens** in sharpness, but if you want to shoot super wide then this **lens** is a great choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Build and handling: As it’s a large telephoto prime **lens**, the weight of 33.5 oz. (950 g) wouldn’t come as a surprise. It also includes Nano AR Coating, which will reduce ghosting and flare. Overall it’s designed from quality materials that are also weather sealed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   8. Sony FE 35mm f2.8 ZA Carl Zeiss Sonnar T* This tiny 35mm **lens** is ideal for street photography Specifications Mount: Sony FE Elements/groups: 7/5 Diaphragm blades: 7 Autofocus: Yes Stabilizer: No Minimum focus distance: 0.35m Maximum magnification: 0.12x Filter thread: 49mm Dimensions (WxL): 62x37mm Weight: 120g Today's Best Deals View at Adorama (opens in new tab) View at Walmart (opens in new tab) View at BHPhoto (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Compact and lightweight + Fast autofocus + Zeiss T* coatings Reasons to avoid - Heavy vignetting - Modest aperture rating - Pricey to buy - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is another ultra-wide-angle **lens** for Nikon APS-C cameras. It’s another fantastic option for real estate photography. And it’s a more affordable option than the previous Nikon **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **lens** offers an angle of view of 93 degrees, which is ideal for interiors and cramped exteriors. And the specially coated glass minimizes chromatic aberration. The result is crystal clear, glare-free images. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are currently so many brands creating **lens**es for the Sony E-mount system that it’s hard to keep up. The brand new Sony 14-24 f/2.8 Sigma **lens** that was designed for the E-mount system is an interesting option. As there are currently not many tests out yet and I haven’t used it for more than a few days, it’s hard to currently say how good this **lens** performs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By creating the Sony FE 24mm F1.4 GM **lens** Sony has proven that you can build an excellent **lens** into a very small package. The **lens** is extremely well built, weather sealed against dust and moisture and weighs in at only 445 g. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since most of us have at least one general-purpose/standard zoom **lens** that has wide-angle focal lengths built in (a 24-70mm **lens** for example), an additional wide-angle **lens** is needed to gain even wider angles of view. If your standard zoom has an f/2.8 max aperture, you may also desire a fixed focal length/prime wide-angle **lens** to gain a wider aperture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It has 16 glass elements arranged in 11 groups. That makes it a heavy **lens**. But it includes low-dispersion glass that reduces imperfections even more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Performance: Without a doubt, an ultra-fast aperture is the best feature of this **lens**. But this is not the only reason why it has a bigger price tag. It produces excellent sharp photo quality from center to corners. Also, the good news is that chromatic aberration is well kept down to the minimum. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 10-18mm **lens** has built-in optical image stabilization. This keeps your images sharp in low light conditions. And the autofocus motor is fast and reliable for this type of photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Build and handling: It weighs 29.5 oz. (835 g), which is pretty compact for a large aperture pro-grade Art **lens**. Also, built-in Super Multi-Layer and Nano Porous Coating are designed into a **lens** to reduce flare and ghosting. Which helps photographers to produce rich color sharp images. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Build and handling: Sigma **lens** is made of high-quality plastics and a brass mounting plate which has given it a quite reasonable weight (22.0 oz. / 625 g) for a pro-grade Art **lens**. Other features you can find from a **lens** are a click-on/off switch, a focus hold button, an aperture lock switch, and an AF/MF switch. Overall, it’s a compact **lens** that comes with a large **lens** hood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are looking for the best native 100-400mm zoom **lens** for shooting wildlife (my Borneo adventure), sports and action, then look no further than the Sony FE 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6 GM OSS **lens**. I’ve owned this **lens** since it was released and it has rarely been off my camera since. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Being too far away from a subject brings other problems. Facial features may become too compressed in appearance, and being too far away complicates communication. Longer focal length **lens**es require more working distance than their wider counterparts, and physical obstacles can inhibit the necessary line of sight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to capture images of the sky at night then you will want a **lens** that works well for low light photography. Some of the most important characteristics of a good **lens** for astrophotography are a wide maximum aperture like f/1.4, but the **lens** should also be sharp at this wide-open aperture and offer decent corner resolution and coma correction. Low vignetting is important to, as is the ability to focus manually since autofocus is out of the question at night. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Performance: As you would expect from f/1.4, it’s quite a fast **lens**. It produces high-end quality in low light conditions, as well as during high exposure. Another thing is a reliable autofocus system that makes it easy to aim your object razor-sharp within milliseconds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sigma 85mm f/1.4 DG DN Art Lens is an aesthetically-beautiful, optically and physically high-performing **lens** in an ideal portrait focal length and aperture combination with a relatively small size, light weight, and low price. This **lens** delivers very sharp imagery, potentially with a strong background blur, without the burdensome size and weight of its predecessor and competitors, and with an affordable price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best for: There are many options to use this Sony a7c **lens**. Most notably it’s used on events, architecture, city, real estate, or any other photography types where you have tight space. Due to its wide viewing angle, it’s also great to capture panoramic landscape photos. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Overall it’s just fantastic and one of the best **lens**es for Sony a7c. I would recommend this type of **lens** for anyone who isn’t exactly sure what they want to shoot. It gives you a great experience to try out different types of photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Sony a7c **lens** has quite the same specifications as the previous one from Sigma. But it’s lighter, has a longer focal length, and is a bit cheaper than the competitor above. However this Tamron **lens** doesn’t have that high-end “Art” touch, but it’s still great to be considered as one of the best travel **lens**es for Sony a7c. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 35mm F1.4 G Master **lens** is another premium **lens** from Sony, offering superb sharpness even wide open, with excellent handling and operation, in a relatively small and light **lens**, with metal construction. The **lens** benefits from silent, and accurate autofocus, as well as a manual aperture ring with both click and clickless operation. As part of the G Master range, the **lens** is designed for both excellent levels of sharpness, with beautiful and attractive bokeh or background blur. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In addition, when working in harsh lighting settings, a Nano AR coating has been used to reduce ghosting and **lens** flare for improved contrast and shade consistency. This 85mm **lens** is great for portraiture and other situations where controlling the center of attention is important. It has a bright f/1.4 aperture and a short-telephoto focal length. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **lens** is also known for being one of the sharpest zoom **lens**es on the market, so you’ll be sure your shots are of great sharpness on any Sony E-mount camera, especially the high megapixel ones like the A7RII, III and IV. The **lens** is also of great build quality and has a nice sunstar to it. The only ‘negative’ to this **lens** is that it’s the most expensive of all the choices. But if you can afford it, go for it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another excellent portrait **lens** you can get is the Sony 90mm F2.8, which also happens to be our top pick as the best macro **lens** for Sony a7iii. It’s user-friendly, has brilliant autofocusing, and perhaps the sharpest Sony **lens** to date. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This post has our recommendations for the best **lens** for real estate photography. We’ve included crop sensor and full frame **lens** options. And we have **lens**es for Canon, Nikon, and Sony users. We’ve also included some tilt-shift **lens**es for professionals. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are looking for a dedicated macro **lens**, or a **lens** that can combine both macro and portrait photography roles, then look no further than the 90mm F2.8 Macro G OSS **lens**. I own this **lens** myself and love using it for macro work and the odd portrait. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **lens** has an ultra-wide f/1.8 aperture, and it produces wide-open aperture image quality that is better than most **lens**es can produce at any aperture. The results are simply outstanding. This focal length requires a moderate amount of working distance for full body portraits, but this angle of view provides a great perspective for even tight headshots. That background blur this **lens** can produce is awesome — ideal for portraiture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 70-200 f/2.8 image stabilized **lens** is one of the most critical zoom **lens**es in most photographers' kits. Professionals and amateurs alike typically have this **lens** in their hands with high frequency. Professionals use it because there is no better **lens** available for many jobs, and amateurs use it additionally because this is the longest focal length available in an affordable, conveniently-sized f/2.8 **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Performance: A combination of fast aperture (f/2.8), zoom, and lightweight design is a more likely rarity. Also, the solid image quality remains in place throughout the zoom range. As it’s named a consumer lever **lens** its performance is excellent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 85mm F1.4 G Master is an exceptional **lens** and one which every portrait photographer should own if they don’t already. Sharpness across the frame is already excellent from f/1.4, flare resistance is very good, as is control of chromatic aberration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best Sony **lens**es aren't just designed for Sony's full-frame models (which are among the best cameras for professionals (opens in new tab)), but there are also a number of great **lens**es out there for Sony's large range of APS-C models that are more for hobbyists and enthusiasts, like the Sony A6400 (opens in new tab) or the Sony ZV-E10 (opens in new tab) vlogging camera. And don't forget that you can use full-frame E-mount **lens**es on APS-C models too, and often this can be the best choice for telephotos, macro **lens**es, and other longer focal length options. But with standard zooms and ultra-wide **lens**es, you must get a **lens** designed for an APS-C format camera. And, if you haven't decided which model to buy, then do also check out our best Sony camera (opens in new tab) guide. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a few things you need to look at when choosing the best vlogging **lens** for Sony a7c. Firstly, as you have to hold the camera in your hand for some time, then the more lightweight the better. Secondly, if you want to capture self-shots (as well as a handheld), then the focal length has to be short enough to fit yourself on the frame. These and some other things are well covered with that Sony a7c vlogging **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The images it produces have excellent color, contrast and impressive sharpness across the frame. Sadly the **lens** is not weather sealed like its larger GM brother, so you need to be a little more careful when the rain comes down. I also own this **lens** myself although it is collecting dust since I picked up the GM version. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best for: A prime **lens** with a focal length of 28mm is not so widely used. Some say it’s too narrow for wide angle snaps and too wide for anything else. But still, it depends on a photographer and how they can take out the best of a current **lens**. It’s still great for landscapes, portraits, capturing details from nature, and so on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you can find one for a good price, go for it. Another nice property of this **lens** is the ‘sunstar’ that it produces. When photographing into the sun, this **lens** has a very distinctive sunstar that you can recognise immediately over every other **lens**. I think it's beautiful, but that’s subjective, of course. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The build quality is as good as it gets for a Sony **lens** and it is weather sealed against dust and moisture. It is really only the autofocus performance that lets this **lens** down a little, as it’s most definitely not the fastest. However, eye auto focus works well and unless your subject is moving very fast you shouldn’t have any issues with nailing razor sharp images. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A small and fast **lens** is a bit of an upgrade to the previous one, however, it’s made for other perspectives. Specifically, it’s a prime **lens** with a decent aperture. A budget Sony a7c **lens** is a great deal for a beginner photographer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Meanwhile, a wide aperture is recommended as it allows you to focus just on the subject and blur out any distracting background elements. In portrait photography, it’s important to draw the attention of viewers to the subject, including their eyes and facial features. If you are planning for a romantic getaway with your significant other a portrait **lens** would be a great gear to pack for capturing those sweet and candid moments! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 85mm F1.4 G Master **lens** is a bright 85mm **lens**, that could be the ideal portrait **lens**, with impressive sharpness in the centre, even when shooting wide-open. There’s also the excellent build quality that you expect from a G Master **lens**, as well as dust and moisture resistance. Like other G Master **lens**es, you get an aperture ring with with clickless option. However, there are some downsides, as it is quite weighty at 820g, and it’s also rather expensive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best for: It’s a versatile **lens** and can be used in many ways. As it has wide angle capabilities it’s mostly used in close-range photography where you also need to fit a lot of objects or people. For example group photos, events, weddings, or city (even landscapes) photography, does its work perfectly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Tamron 28-75mm F2.8 Di III RXD is the best all-round **lens** for Sony a7iii and one of our top picks for today. It’s made of durable polycarbonate casing that’s compact and lightweight, while still being versatile. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   best wide-angle **lens** Sony 16-35mm F2.8 If you plan on shooting landscapes with your Sony a7iii, then this is the perfect **lens** for you. silent, accurate and super fast autofocus is coupled here with stunning edge-to-edge quality. Leading to stunning landscape photos all day long. $1,998 at Amazon$1,998 at B&H Photo - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 85mm f/1.4 GM is a fast, short-telephoto **lens** developed for E-mount mirrorless digital cameras. It has a popular focal length for portraits. This **lens** is capable of isolating the center of emphasis for shallow depth of discipline effects, as well as working well in low-light circumstances, thanks to its pleasing point of view and fast f/1.4 maximum aperture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony 1.4x teleconverter (SEL14TC) is currently only compatible with the Sony FE 70-200mm F2.8 GM, Sony 100-400mm GM, Sony FE 200-600 G, Sony FE 400mm F2.8 GM and Sony FE 600 F4 GM **lens**es. It will not physically fit any other Sony E-mount **lens**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unfortunately like many ultra-wide **lens**es, the Sony 12-24 has a bulbous glass front element, meaning that it protrudes from the front of the **lens**. This makes it difficult to attach filters and there is no filter thread. However, thankfully there are now several companies making filter holders for this **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The image quality is sharp throughout the focal length. And you can’t complain about the glass quality. It is quite a heavy **lens**. But that’s due to the 17 glass elements housed within. They also have a special multi-coating to help reduce flare, glare, and ghosting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When Tamron launched their 28-75mm F2.8 Di III RXD for Sony E-mount they really hit a home run. This **lens** has been sold out everywhere since launch and it’s really not surprising since it offers excellent sharpness and autofocus performance in a compact and lightweight body. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s important to use a **lens** designed for an APS-C camera. Some **lens**es are compatible with full frame and crop sensor cameras. But you get a 1.6x crop factor when you use a full frame **lens** on an APS-C camera. That means you can’t get the wide angle you need for real estate photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To find the best astrophotography **lens** for Sony a7iii, you want a wide-angle **lens** with a wide max aperture, as well as edge-to-edge sharpness. The Sony FE 24mm f/1.4 GM checks all these boxes - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a fantastic real estate **lens** from Tokina. Third-party **lens**es have come a long way over the last few years. And companies like Tokina provide affordable and reliable alternatives. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Tokina **lens** is compatible with Nikon APS-C cameras with an F-mount. But you can also get a Tokina 12-28mm **lens** for Canon cameras. Whether for Nikon or Canon, it’s an excellent value real estate **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Tamron 17-28 Di III **lens** provides professional-grade image quality in a compact, lightweight package with a very low price. There is little this **lens** lacks aside from switches. The focal length range does not reach the widest or the longest in the class, but it matches perfectly with another exceptional bargain **lens**, the Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8 Di III RXD Lens. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 12-24 F2.8 GM has not long been announced. As soon as reliable information about this **lens** is available this section will be updated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Build and handling: One thing that makes this Tamron **lens** for Sony a7c an excellent choice is its lightweight design. It’s much lighter than the previous and it gives an advantage to this **lens**. Because everybody wants to travel as light as possible. Overall, the design is simple and compact enough to take it on your travel adventures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Performance: Another key feature of this Sony a7c **lens** is its large aperture. You don’t find many telephoto zoom **lens**es with a fast maximum aperture of f/2.8. It results in fast autofocus and excellent performance during low-light situations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This wide-angle 23mm **lens** is typical of others in the Viltrox trio (with the 33mm and 56mm) boasting a fast f/1.4 aperture rating. As such, it can deliver a tight depth of field, at least at fairly short focus distances, and enables fast shutter speeds for freezing motion even under low lighting conditions. Weighing 260g, it’s small and lightweight for an f/1.4 prime and feels a very natural fit on Sony's smaller mirrorless cameras. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The bokeh is silky smooth and possibly the best of all the current 24mm f/1.4 **lens**es available. Autofocus is fast, quiet and super accurate. I own this **lens** myself and absolutely love it. I’ll be writing a review for it just as soon as I get a little free time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next up on ouris the Sony 10-18mm Wide-Angle Zoom Lens (Click here to check for product prices and availability) . It is our mid-range option being more expensive than the Rokinon 12mm covered above but more budget-friendly than the Sony 16-35mm Wide-Angle Zoom Lens below. Realistically, this is without a doubt the **lens** that we would recommend that you pick up for any - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can shoot flowers, insects, and other tiny subjects with this **lens** and capture the finest details. Even at the maximum aperture, the Sony 90mm F2.8 is incredibly sharp. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   best portrait **lens** Sony 85mm F1.8 In terms of value-for-money, it's hard to go wrong here with this **lens**.It offers super high quality shots as well as surprisingly fast and accurate autofocus. $548 at Amazon$548 at B&H Photo - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 35mm f2.8 ZA Carl Zeiss Sonnar T* has very compact dimensions of 62x37mm, almost qualifying it as a pancake **lens**, and it weighs a mere 120g. It, therefore, forms part of a very discreet package when mounted on one of Sony’s full-frame mirrorless bodies, while the 35mm focal length is the preferred choice of many street photographers. The **lens** is equally at home on Sony’s APS-C format mirrorless cameras, where it works well as a ‘standard prime’ with an effective focal length of just over 50mm. It has a fast autofocus system and works equally well in manual focus mode, and although vignetting can be noticeable when uncorrected in-camera, that’s not an issue when using the **lens** on APS-C format Sony mirrorless cameras. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Carl Zeiss branded Vario-Tessar T* FE 24-70mm f/4 ZA OSS **lens** offers a “standard” zoom range of 24-70mm, with an f/4 constant aperture, that allows the **lens** to be relatively compact. Optical SteadyShot (OSS) gives the **lens** useful optical image stabilisation, and this **lens** was released when Sony’s full-frame mirrorless cameras didn’t feature in-body image stabilisation. Build quality is good, and the **lens** delivers good optical image quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The portrait **lens** focal length decision should be based on the perspective you want, the subject framing desired, and the working space available. A wide-angle **lens** is best used for environmental portraits where your subject is shown along with their surroundings. Conversely, a long telephoto **lens** should be used for tight headshots. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, choosing the widest aperture you can find may not always be the wisest choice. After all, these **lens**es would be large, bulky, and more expensive. If you’re travelling a lot and shooting mostly the scenery, you might want to choose a higher aperture number just to save space. Check our travel photography tips for a better travel photography experience! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It also captures stunning bokeh and performs well in low-light, thanks to the f/2.8 max aperture. With the fast, silent, and accurate autofocus, this **lens** doesn’t disappoint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the 85mm G Master is out of budget then you might want to look at the Sony FE 85mm F1.8 **lens**. This **lens** is not as large, heavy or as ridiculously sharp as its larger G Master brother, but it certainly does not disappoint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The Voigtlander 110mm F2.5 Macro APO Lanthar is an incredibly sharp macro **lens** that offers the Sony FE 90mm F2.8 G Macro **lens** a good run for its money.

-   The Sony FE 100mm F2.8 STF GM OSS **lens** is a very unique **lens** in the Sony FE **lens**es line-up since it includes a built in apodization (APD) filter. This is a clear glass filter that progressively darkens similar to a neutral density filter as you get further away from the center of the **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The final **lens** and arguably, especially when used with your Sony A6000 is the Sony 16-35mm Wide-Angle Zoom Lens (Click here to check for product prices and availability) . That said, it is almost double the price of the Sony 10-18mm Wide-Angle Zoom Lens covered above and almost six times as expensive as the Rokinon 12mm F2.0 covered first on our list. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best for: It’s not only for vlogging purposes, you can create much more with that **lens**. As it has a short focal length of 20mm, you can use it well for short distances. For example street photography, indoor real estate photography, or even shooting wide-angle landscapes. It’s a versatile **lens** with wide options to create something special. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This one is a great alternative to the slightly more expensive Sony 85mm F1.4 G Master. While it’s not as sharp, this 85mm F1.8 **lens** is much smaller and lighter. In fact, it even has a faster autofocus. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Overall the prime **lens** with 85mm focal length and aperture of f/1.4 makes it one of the best portrait **lens**es for Sony a7c. If you are into blurred backgrounds and an amazing bokeh, then it’s for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here was a review of the best **lens**es for Sony a7c. Hopefully, you found a good piece of information and now you’re sure what your next **lens** is. Mentioned **lens**es would for sure upgrade your photography, but remember to keep practicing your skills. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 1.4x will extend the reach of the 70-200mm GM **lens** to 280mm and the 100-400mm GM and 400mm GM **lens**es to 560mm on a full frame camera like the a7iii, but it will do so by sacrificing one stop of light. Fortunately this does not slow the autofocus speeds of these **lens**es, however you will notice increased vignetting in the corners wide-open and also a little more software in the images. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Overall it’s the Sony a7c telephoto **lens** you want on your camera gear. But as expected, it comes at a high price. If you are doing it on a professional basis and want to shoot high-quality images (with optical stabilization), then it will be a real investment. It’s worth the money. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In a short space of time, Sony **lens**es have also become considered some of the best camera **lens**es to buy (opens in new tab). The best Sony **lens**es are typically the company's G Master **lens**es, which are big and beautiful but expensive. For photographers and videographers who need **lens**es that are lighter, smaller, or just not quite so expensive, there are plenty of alternatives. And many of these optics are so good in their own right that they can give Sony's G Master optics a real run for their money. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Neatly picking up the baton from Tamron’s 28-75mm standard zoom, this 17-28mm **lens** takes you into the ultra-wide-angle territory. It very much follows suit, with the same high-end, weather-sealed build quality, fast and constant aperture rating, quick and virtually silent RXD (Rapid eXtra silent stepping drive) autofocus system, and, best of all, the same terrific image quality. Corner-to-corner sharpness is particularly impressive for an ultra-wide-angle **lens**, even when shooting at the widest aperture. It doesn’t quite match Sony’s 16-35mm **lens**es for maximum viewing angle but it comes very close, and it’s great value at the price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **lens** does show signs of coma from f/1.8 to f/2.5 and you might even see traces of coma at f/2.8 if you have very bright stars at the edges of the frame. However, coma is still not as prominent as on many other wide-angle **lens**es, and also you are unlikely to have very bright stars at the edge of the frame, so I still think it’s a very good choice for astro shooters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the main drawbacks of the Rokinon 12mm is its lack of an autofocus meaning you have to control everything manually via the manual focus ring on the **lens**. Thankfully, with real estate photography, this is not an issue as neither the house or its internal rooms are going to be moving while you try to take their photograph. This combined with the smooth and responsive autofocus ring on the Rokinon 12mm makes it very easy to take detailed, sharp photographs of the property. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When most people picture the stereotypical photographer with their massive **lens**es, they are picturing a telephoto **lens**. With a range between 100mm and 600mm or more, this type of **lens** can zoom in extremely far. It’s usually used in professional sports and wildlife photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are looking for a dedicated macro **lens**, or a **lens** that can combine both macro and portrait photography roles, then look no further than the 90mm F2.8 Macro G OSS **lens**. I own this **lens** myself and have no plans to let it go anytime soon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If shooting in a studio with a background such as rolled paper and lighting with studio strobes, narrow apertures such as f/8 or f/11 will likely be in use, and all **lens**es have these options available. The sample portrait included at the top of this page was captured with a 135mm focal length and an f/1.4 aperture. The background is melting away, while a pleasing head and shoulders perspective has been captured. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   An ultra-wide Sony a7c **lens** is another piece from the G Master series that sparks with high-quality specs. There are a lot of benefits that make it a high-grade **lens**, but the price tag isn’t one of them. However, if you want something special, look nowhere else. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** performs beautifully throughout its focal length. The image quality is a delight. And you’ll experience practically zero distortion or aberration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Indeed, you won’t find another **lens** at this price range with a more stunning performance. The Sony 24-70mm f/2.8 GM, for instance, is great but very heavy and expensive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Chromatic aberration and distortion can be a problem with wide-angle **lens**es. But good quality **lens**es keep these imperfections to a minimum. You can correct aberrations in Photoshop, but it’s a time-consuming process. Buying a good **lens** for real estate photography is the best solution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sigma 30mm F1.4 Contemporary is another brilliant 3rd party portrait **lens** worth considering. The wide angle can give you stunning shots of people. It’s also relatively cheap and so perfect for beginners looking for a solid prime **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tamron continues to produce great mirrorless **lens**es, and the 70-180mm f/2.8 Di III VXD Lens is another big hit. Though this **lens**'s focal length range falls short of the competing 70-200mm models, the range provided is perfect for portraits. This **lens** delivers great image quality from a compact and affordable package. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sigma 70mm F2.8 DG Macro **lens** for Sony E-mount (full-frame) is the first macro **lens** from Sigma that has been adapted to Sony E-mount. However, the word adapted here is very important since the E-mount version of this **lens** has been adapted from their Canon and Sigma versions that were originally designed for SLR cameras and not mirrorless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Understandably, this 200-600mm **lens** is huge and bulky. At over 2 kg in weight, it completely offsets your a7iii’s lightweight build. This is also not the best **lens** for shooting in dark conditions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Given that Sony's A6000-series APS-C cameras are built for speed, it makes sense to get a **lens** that can keep up with them. Step forward, Samyang's AF 12mm F2.0 E, a highly capable Sony E-mount **lens** with super-snappy autofocus, and enough image quality to make the most of those APS-C sensors. The previous 12mm f/2 from Samyang was manual-focus only, which doesn't really suit the vibe of the A6000 series, so it's good to see this new optic correcting that issue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you will have probably noticed that this **lens** has found its way into 3 different categories. It’s not only a great **lens** for landscape, interior, and environmental portrait photography, but with its wide-open aperture of f/1.4 it also excels at astrophotography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Performance: As usual for G Master series **lens**es it also produces excellent image quality throughout every focal length. Autofocus Dual DDSSM systems give it rapid speed with silent focusing. After all when taking into account image quality then contrast and sharpness are spectacularly amazing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best telephoto **lens** Sony FE 70-200mm F2.8 GM OSS If you're looking for stunning up-close shots of faraway subjects, then this is the best **lens** for you. With incredibly fast autofocus, it is super versatile and offers edge-to-edge sharpness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Price is the only hurdle keeping the FE 50mm f/1.2 GM out of **lens** kits. However, because this focal length and extreme-wide aperture are so useful, it makes sense to ensure the best quality **lens** providing such is in the kit. The Sony FE 50mm f/1.2 GM Lens is that **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Zeiss branded Sony Zeiss Planar T* FE 50mm F1.4 ZA **lens** has a metal build-quality that impresses, as well as an aperture ring that can be declicked, which will benefit videographers. Focus was quiet, but not the fastest, and the high price is something to be aware of. But most importantly, the image quality on offer is “barely believable” as we said in our review, thanks to an impressive level of sharpness, as well as gorgeous-looking out-of-focus blur, even when shooting wide-open. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Near-silent and fast AF system Buy from Amazon Nikon AF-S DX 10-24mm f/3.5-4.5 ED Zoom Lens Best Cheap Nikon DX Lens Excellent value wide-angle **lens** - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some of the cheaper **lens**es may use more plastic, which although is lighter can be less durable. When looking for the best build quality in a **lens**, pay attention to its weather sealing features too. Especially if you’re looking to shoot outdoors! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first portrait photography concept that needs to be understood is perspective. If the camera is too close to the subject, the part of the body closest to the **lens**, usually the nose, is going to appear too large relative to the rest of the body. This effect is due to perspective distortion. Move in too close, and the subject may become uncomfortable with you in their personal space, creating a tension that does not photograph well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here is mentioned what is the best use of any **lens**, what is the price, and what different qualities it offers. There are **lens**es categorized by usage: prime, wide-angle, and different fields of photography. Also, to have a better and quicker aim to the price range, it’s divided into three categories: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best for: As it’s a prime **lens** you would assume it’s more likely a portrait **lens**. To be true, it’s used in many ways: events, weddings, landscapes, or even product photography. Due to its compact design, it’s also ideal for traveling as it doesn’t occupy much space in a bag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best portrait **lens** for Sony a7iii has to be the Sony FE 85mm f/1.8, which is portable and sharp, offering a surprising quality for its relatively lower price. This is for those who want both a high performance portrait **lens** and the best value for their money. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While this **lens** is relatively large, heavy, and expensive, it makes up for those shortcomings by covering an ideal-for-portraits focal length range typically requiring two **lens**es. The speed of focal length access is an image quality factor. Having instant access to disparate focal lengths enables fleeting opportunities to be capitalized on. Thus, by its focal length range alone, this **lens** has the potential to capture a superior set of images from an event. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony calls the **lens** "The ultimate portrait prime," and it is hard to argue against that statement. I've used wide-aperture 85mm prime **lens**es for entire senior portrait shoots, and the results this combination provides are outstanding. There seems always to be enough ambient light to use this **lens** handheld. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for an ultra-wide-angle zoom **lens**, then this could be a great choice, starting at an ultra-wide 16mm, zooming to 35mm. The Zeiss Vario-Tessar T* FE 16-35mm f/4 ZA OSS **lens** gives sharp images, and with a constant f/4 aperture, the **lens** is more compact than it would have been had the aperture been brighter. The **lens** has a solid all-metal construction, and takes a 72mm filter on the front of the **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Third-party **lens**es are often a good bet when looking to expand your system, offering premium performance at a cut-down price. The Sigma 20mm F2 DG DN | C is a prime **lens** providing excellent value for money, and is a good budget-friendly alternative to Sony’s own FE 20mm f/1.8 G (featured a few entries down from this one). In testing, we found that this **lens** handled fantastically on the Sony A7R IV, creating a perfectly balanced setup, and its optical performance was superb. It’s sharp throughout the aperture range, only getting a little soft at f/22. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 12-24mm focal length range is ideal for real estate. You’ll be able to capture interiors and exteriors without changing **lens**es. 12mm is the widest angle available in the Sony EF **lens** series. So it’s your best option for real estate photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sigma Art **lens** series has changed the way people see third-party **lens**es. They aren’t there to make up the numbers. Now they’re true contenders. And the Sigma 12-24mm Art **lens** is a contender for the best **lens** for real estate photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We've added in Sony's FE 28-60mm F4-5.6 (opens in new tab), a remarkably compact retracting kit **lens** originally launched with the Sony A7C (opens in new tab), but now available on its own. It's not much of a zoom range, but it makes for a very compact camera kit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   It’s difficult to find a good macro **lens** that also works well for portrait photography. If this combination is something that interests you, you can’t go wrong with this 90mm F2.8 from Sony. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Due to its size, telephoto **lens**es often need a tripod to prop up. They are heavy, not portable, and very expensive, making it less ideal for beginners. If you do go for one, research your camera backpacks carefully to make sure you have enough room to store this and the rest of your **lens**es/accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That said, if you have a higher budget and deal in the highest price tag homes in your area then the Sony 16-35mm should be your go-to choice. It will offer the absolute best photographs of any property that you are trying to sell allowing you to capture the home in perfect detail that really is second to none. Additionally, it has one of the best reputations within the photography community of all of the Sony E mount **lens**es currently available on the market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What is surpizing about this **lens** is that the autofocus is actually faster than the GM version. The bokeh isn’t quite as smooth as the GM, but it certainly comes very close. I own this **lens** myself and certainly have no plans to sell it anytime soon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony Artisan and long-time professional sports photographer Patrick Murphy-Racey recently sat down with a small fortune of **lens**es to talk shop on the gear he’s come to rely on in the Alpha mirrorless system. While it’s a longer video than what’s typically featured here on Fstoppers, it’s thorough with its insight and answers many questions that sports photographers may be asking in regards to which **lens** pairs well with what sports and how to decide between all the different options available. I’ll say that Murphy-Racey’s enthusiasm for reporting what he knows and what he’s experienced while working the sidelines makes the 47 minutes move by quickly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Build and handling: It’s surprisingly lightweight for a fast prime **lens**. Also, the overall build of the **lens** looks and feels professional with an aluminum alloy body. It’s also moisture and dust-resistant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For us, the best wide-angle **lens** for Sony a7iii has to be the Sony FE 16-35mm f/2.8 GM. Even with the maximum aperture, you will get sharp images on all edges. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Build and handling: Made with quality materials, as you wouldn’t expect less. The aluminum body gives it a pretty decent weight of 23.36 oz. (663 g), which is normal for this wide-angle pro-grade **lens**. Its dust and moisture resistance includes Nano AR and Fluorine coatings, and many other benefits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Overall this is one of the best **lens**es for Sony a7c without a doubt. The price tag could scare you off, but you will get magnificent quality in exchange for that. If you are in the portrait photography business, then for sure this pro-grade tool will level up your game. It’s a good value for the money! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **lens** is also compatible with the Sony FE 1.4x and 2.0x teleconverters helping to extend its reach up to 280mm with the 1.4x and up to 400mm with the 2x. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   12mm on the Sony A7RIII. A wide **lens** lets you get a strong foreground because of the extreme perspective. Photo by: 'Albert Dros'. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best for: As already mentioned, it’s perfect for portrait photography. With an amazing soft background and especially a bokeh effect is something so special that you haven’t seen it in any prime **lens**. With an option to adjust the aperture to f/16 it can be easily used and looks excellent even when shooting landscapes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best for: This 135mm Sony a7c **lens** is mostly used for portraits, as it gives a very shallow depth of field with excellent bokeh. But you also use it for example weddings, sports, landscapes or even detailed street photography. You can shoot at a long distance, which sometimes is inevitable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s also quite light for this focal range. Complete with the dust and moisture-resistant feature, you can easily use this on any outdoor trips. Plus, it’s great for capturing landscapes and architecture shots. This is an ideal **lens** for taking snapshots of places like Thailand where you’ll find incredible landscapes and interesting architectural landmarks! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We test **lens**es using both real world sample images and lab tests. Our lab tests are carried out scientifically in controlled conditions using the Imatest testing suite, which consists of custom charts and analysis software that measures resolution in line widths/picture height, a measurement widely used in **lens** and camera testing. We find the combination of lab and real-word testing works best, as each reveals different qualities and characteristics. You can find out more about how we test and review on Digital Camera World (opens in new tab). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have used this **lens** for lots of landscapes purely because I love the 12-24mm range. One of the negative aspects of this **lens** is that you can’t use ‘normal’ filters on it. It doesn’t have a screw thread and you can’t attach 100mm square filters. You will have to buy a separate holder and use 150mm+ filters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In contrast, a prime **lens** features only a single focal length and doesn’t let you zoom in or out. This means each prime **lens** caters only to a specific type of use and is not as versatile as a zoom **lens**. Yet the images it produces are much more high-quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is very hard to find fault with this **lens** but if I’m being very picky then AF performance could be faster and the manual focus ring adjustments could be finer for more precision. That said, for macro work I’ll normally adjust the focus by moving the camera back and forth and whilst making use of focus peaking to let me know when the focus is where I’d like it to be. This **lens** also has optical stabilization built in, making it even easier to get tack sharp images with slower shutter speeds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony 90mm F2.8 is hands-down the sharpest Sony **lens**. It’s also a great option for those interested in macro photography and portraits. Even when shooting wide-open, you can enjoy crisp images that are sharp to the edges. Featuring an impeccable AF system, this **lens** can produce stunning bokeh and low-light images without any distortion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But if you’re looking for the best overall **lens**, you can’t go wrong with the Tamron 28-75mm F2.8. Its wide focal range is extremely versatile. Use it for portraits, low-light, landscapes, and even the night sky. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to Sony’s G Master **lens**es, we think the 12-24mm F2.8 **lens** is one of its best. It may not be the cheapest **lens** you can get for your a7iii, but its performance at a 12mm focal length is stunning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best for: There’s no question that it’s meant for macro photography. With 105mm focal length you will benefit for many reasons. First, you don’t need to be too close to objects that could be scared off (like insects). Secondly, your captures wouldn’t be ruined because of the shade from your **lens**, because you can shoot at a distance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are on Facebook then I’d love for you to join one of the many Sony Alpha Shooters groups that I run. There are groups for Sony Alpha landscape, portrait, sports, wildlife, weddings, macro, street, and video shooters, as well as a generic group for everything else Alpha. You can find all of the links here. The groups are a great place to post your shots with your brand new **lens**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 70-200mm F2.8 GM OSS **lens** has a maximum focus range of 200mm, so your subject will need to be reasonably close if you want them to fill the frame. However, with a constant wide-open aperture of f/2.8, this is a great **lens** to use in low light situations or when you want the smoothest bokeh. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony FE 400mm f/2.8 Gm is a Full-frame fantastic telephoto zoom sports **lens** for **sony** A7c with excellent clarity, rapid AF, and a small diagram that maintains the excessive fashionable of choice shared amongst Sony’s premier line of G Master **lens** series.

-   A tilt-shift **lens** is an investment for your real estate photography business. They’re overkill for amateurs. But they’re an incredible tool for professional real estate photographers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After Tamron’s success with their 28-75mm F2.8 Di III RXD **lens** they now bring us a wider alternative in the Tamron 17-28mm F2.8 Di III RXD. Similar to the 28-75mm this **lens** offers great sharpness wide-open in a compact lightweight body and at a very reasonable price point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Within each series, Sony indicates its superior models by the letter G and names its flagship mirrorless **lens**es G Master or GM for short. Models involving a partnership with Zeiss are labeled ZA, and are generally pitched between Sony’s own G and GM **lens**es in quality. Meanwhile, **lens**es labeled PZ have a Power Zoom for smooth motorized zooming while filming, while those with OSS refer to Optical SteadyShot stabilisation.

-   Overall it’s one of the best Sony a7c **lens**es and should be an additional tool in your gear. It’s perfect for both videos and photos.

-   Performance: Sigma Art **lens**es are known for their superior image quality and this one is no exception. It also rocks with contrast and sharpness throughout the entire zoom range. Thanks to the aperture of f/2.8 it performs well in low light situations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Build and handling: As already mentioned then the biggest advantages are its dimensions and weight. Looks almost like a pancake **lens**, but it will double the length after it is zoomed out. Thanks to the compact design you can carry it almost everywhere – in a bag or even in a pocket (if you have deep pockets). You don’t especially need a camera bag when you only carry this **lens** together with the camera. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The image quality of this **lens** is incredibly close to the Sony FE 24-70 F2.8 G Master **lens**, which is mind blowing considering the G Master costs double the price! This is Tamron’s first native **lens** for Sony E-mount and I most definitely hope that it’s the first of many. I don’t own this **lens** but would certainly like to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I very frequently encounter the need for focal lengths wider than those in my standard zoom **lens** and seldom go on a shoot without having the wide angles covered. Some specific subjects requiring a wide-angle **lens** include landscape, real estate/architecture, and interior photography. Interiors can include those of a building, vehicle, aircraft, etc. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Offering the extremely popular 35mm focal length and ultra-wide aperture combination in the flagship GM professional-grade lineup seemed a no-brainer. The other no-brainer, at least to many, is the decision to purchase this extremely high performing, relatively compact, lightweight, and affordable **lens**. Its review-time best seller ranking attests to that statement. Just get this **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The Sony Sonnar T* 55mm F1.8 ZA has a fast f/1.8 aperture, which performs well in low-light conditions. While it can be quite large for a 55m **lens**, pairing it with the Sony a7iii still makes a relatively compact camera. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Used materials are also high quality with weather sealing components included. On the **lens** there’s also a focus switch and a hold button. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re serious about real estate photography, then this Nikon wide-angle **lens** won’t disappoint. There’s no image stabilization, so you might need a tripod. But it’s a fantastic piece of equipment. And it’s one of the best **lens**es for real estate photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** has a variable aperture of F4.5-5.6, an extremely fast and silent autofocus motor, and the build quality would make some Ferrari’s blush.

-   Prime **lens**es from Sony are usually more expensive, as they’re faster and require a more complex design. They are manufactured in lower quantities which naturally drive up the cost more. However, this also means they have a better build quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While not inexpensive, this **lens** delivers incredible image quality, despite the extremely-wide angles of view it avails. With f/2.8 available, this Sony **lens** is a great choice for photographing the night sky, along with low light events. Take this **lens** to the most beautiful locations and it is sure to enable you to bring home exceptional results. Note that this does not accept front filters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the Sony 24-70mm F2.8 GM is out of budget or simply far too large and heavy for your style of photography, then the Sony 24-70mm F4 Vario-Tessar T* FE ZA OSS **lens** may be what you are looking for. The **lens** is very well built and weighs in at only 426 g which is half the weight of the GM version! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   When you see it’s from the G series – it already sounds professional. To be true, it’s one of the best Sony a7c zoom **lens**es available for this model. If you are more than a hobby photographer, someone who uses a camera often, then it definitely should be in your camera gear. Because it offers so much value in different photography areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Aperture is how much light a **lens** can let through its sensor, where more light allows you to shoot in the dark without too much blurring. The lower aperture number (f/1.4) means more light can get in, while a higher aperture (f/22) denotes the opposite. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here’s another great telephoto **lens** for Sony a7iii, which we’d say is best reserved for wildlife or sports photography and shooting objects that are extremely far away. If you want the best focal reach, the Sony FE 200-600mm f/5.6-6.3 G OSS is your answer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Sony FE **lens**es stand for Sony Full E-mount **lens**es, which refers to any **lens** designed for the full-frame Sony mirrorless cameras. This includes the ever-popular Sony a7iii. You can use these **lens**es on APS-C cameras too, but note that the focal length will increase by 1.5x. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Almost as double cheaper as the previous, this Sony a7c Sigma **lens** will be a great alternative. Also, this **lens** offers excellent image quality with almost the same specifications as the aperture of 2.8. However, there is a slight difference in focal lengths compared to previous. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony 2x teleconverter (SEL20TC) is currently only compatible with the Sony FE 70-200mm F2.8 GM, Sony 100-400mm GM, Sony FE 200-600 G, Sony FE 400mm F2.8 GM and Sony FE 600 F4 GM **lens**es. It will not physically fit any other Sony E-mount **lens**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, I am very tempted to sell it so that I can afford the Tamron 28-75mm F2.8 Di III RXD **lens**. So my recommendation would be to buy the Tamron if you don’t want to spend the money on the GM 24-70 **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Still, despite this **lens** being adapted from their SLR versions, it is a beautiful **lens** that costs almost half the price of the Sony FE 90mm F2.8 G OSS macro **lens**. The images that it produces are razor sharp across the frame, chromatic aberration is well controlled as is distortion. The bokeh is silky smooth and the **lens** feels like all Sigma Art **lens**es do, extremely well built! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There really is no one answer for this, as the best **lens** for your Sony a7iii is the one that meets your photography needs and interests. For example, the Sony 85mm F1.8 would be the perfect choice if you’re into portrait photography, while the Sony FE 70-200mm F2.8 GM OSS is better suited to capture faraway subjects like animals and wildlife. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our top pick is the Canon EF-S 10-18mm STM **lens**. It’s a fantastic wide-angle zoom **lens** for Canon cameras. It delivers incredible results for interior and exterior shots for real estate photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A super fast Sony a7c **lens** is something special. You don’t see **lens**es with an aperture of f/1.2 that often. This lets you shoot in very low light situations, capture a motion, and shoot handheld without bumping up ISO. But it all comes with a filthy price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to the drawbacks, we really can’t think of any major red flags. This Sony **lens** is quite expensive compared to the other options, but it’s still the sharpest and most lightweight 24mm f/1.4 you can find. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Despite the long focal length range, the Tamron 35-150mm f/2-2.8 Di III VXD Lens avails an ultra-wide aperture that is the widest or nearly so among zoom **lens**es at all focal lengths. The image sharpness produced by this **lens** will seal the deal for many portrait photographers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This completely professional-grade **lens** has impressive image quality, fast and accurate AF, and Optical SteadyShot in a solid, weather-sealed, fixed-size body. The wide f/2.8 max aperture allows action to be captured in low light and, combined with the telephoto focal lengths, allows the background to be blurred away. An added benefit is that this **lens** performs well with teleconverters, a great option for when you need even more focal length. This **lens** is not inexpensive, butthe version II **lens** is impressively lightweight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, think about how much you’re willing to spend for a camera **lens** and what you really need. If an f/2.8 can work well for your photography as an f/2.0 version, there’s no reason to waste the extra money. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **lens** offers a useful zoom range from 24mm to 105mm, with the f/4 aperture helping to keep the size down. Optical steady shot (OSS) means you can use it with E-Mount cameras that don’t feature in-body image stabilisation, and still benefit from optical image stabilisation. When we reviewed this **lens** we could that it was consistently sharp at all focal lengths, with fast, and silent autofocus. The Sony FE 24-105mm F4 G OSS **lens** is also relatively compact and lightweight, with an impressively resistant to flare, and for an all-in-one zoom **lens**, this one certainly impresses. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Overall it’s one of the best Sony a7c **lens**es that rocks with its lightweight design and overall performance. Compared to previous competitors it’s much lighter and also cheaper. In terms of quality and price, it’s an excellent choice for wide-angle **lens**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are also photographers who prefer primes to zoom **lens**es in regards to landscape photography. Prime **lens**es often offer more sharpness. However, these days the zoom **lens**es are of such high quality that the sharpness often does not differ to an extreme amount. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wide-open at f/2.5 and the **lens** is already incredibly sharp both centrally and even towards the edges of the frame. Bokeh is very smooth and free from onion rings, although you will see some cat’s eyes which don’t really improve as you step-down. CA is extremely well controlled. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for a macro **lens** for your Sony camera, then the Sony FE 90mm f2.8 G OSS Macro **lens** hits the park running. That is to say, it’s excellent; it offers exceptional image quality, being difficult to beat in terms of sheer resolving power. You also benefit from built-in Optical Steady Shot (OSS), helping you keep shots steady and free from blur. Plus, it doubles as a great portrait **lens**, and can take detailed photographs of any subject. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Want the best telephoto **lens** for your Sony a7iii? Look no further than the Sony FE 70-200mm F2.8 GM OSS. It flaunts edge-to-edge sharpness, fast and accurate autofocus, stunning bokeh, and incredible versatility. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The only real negative thing about this **lens** is the price. At $11,998.00 in the US or £10,499.00 in the UK, this **lens** will leave a very noticeable hole in your bank account. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finding the best **lens** for real estate photography has to be the top priority for any property photographer. Real estate photography poses a unique set of challenges. And finding the best **lens** goes a long way in overcoming those challenges. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First up on ouris the Rokinon 12mm F2.0 (Click here to check for product prices and availability) . We have included the Rokinon 12mm **lens** on our list as it offers a decent, yet budget-friendly **lens** that can perform well when taking photographs for real estate agents with your Sony a6000. That said if you are a professional estate agent that will be using their camera and **lens** to take photographs of lots of houses we would recommend you pick up the Sony 10-18mm Wide-Angle Zoom Lens (Click here to check for product prices and availability) that we will be covering next. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A 135mm prime **lens** is a more likely rarity and it’s mostly used by professionals who want to add some other perspectives to their captures. For sure this Sony a7c **lens** is something unique and will add new dimensions and spark. But it all comes with a price, as it’s pretty expensive. If you look at something special, then it’s worth an investment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tilt-shift **lens**es are a bit on the pricey side. And they weren’t created specifically with real estate photography in mind. But more and more real estate photographers are turning to tilt-shift **lens**es. And more often than not, they aren’t turning back. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best for: A wide-angle zoom **lens** is ideal for everyday shooting. It never lets you down and can handle different situations. You can take it on your travels when you are big on Instagram for example or on a simple day out with only a **lens**. So a wide angle street capture, a quick portrait, or taking that nice nature photo far away – will handle these situations excellently. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 24-70mm F2.8 GM is one of the very few zoom **lens**es that can keep up optically with many of the best prime **lens**es. It’s extremely well built, weather sealed from dust and moisture, and the autofocus is fast and accurate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sigma 105mm f/1.4 DG HSM Art Lens for Sony full-frame E-mount is an exceptionally sharp **lens** even when shooting wide-open at f/1.4. Autofocus works almost as fast as Sony native **lens**es in good lighting, but in poor light autofocus starts to struggle a little more. There is very little in the way of vignetting and almost nonexistent chromatic aberrations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another interesting wide angle zoom option is the Tamron 17-28 f/2.8. This **lens** is very light and sharp but lacks range on both ends. It's a compromise but not a bad choice at all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A blurred background will make your portrait subjects pop. Longer focal length **lens**es will make blurring away a distracting background easier, as will wide apertures. The wide apertures will provide a reduced depth of field, so the depth of field vs. background blur must be considered. I like the mouth and both eyes to be in focus minimally. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Canon **lens** uses a 9-blade diaphragm rather than the usual 7. That gives you less flare and glare. And it helps create a smooth soft focus when using a shallow depth of field. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a big **lens** and it weighs 2115g without tripod mount and is 318mm in length. It’s also an internal focusing **lens** and the short zoom throw makes going from 200mm to 600mm a breeze. Because it doesn’t extend it also balances very well on a gimbal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is the best real estate **lens** for full frame Canon cameras. It’s from the Canon L series. And that means it’s one of their superior **lens**es. It also means a higher price. But it’s a price worth paying if you’re serious about real estate photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
