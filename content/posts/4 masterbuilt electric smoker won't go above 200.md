## 4 Tips to Masterbuilt Electric Smoker Won'T Go Above 200 | Masterbuilt Analog Electric Smoker Temperature Setting
-   Air comes in your intake vent. Warm air circulates from your fire box out the exhaust vent. Because hot air rises, your exhaust vent acts as a vacuum to draw air into the intake vent. When this hot air rises, it heats up your **smoker**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Feel like your **smoker** just isn’t hot enough? First, ensure you still have enough charcoal in your fire box. If you’ve been running your **smoker** for several hours a gentle stir may be enough to get back up to temp. Sometimes you just need to add more fuel though. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **smoker**s have two types of vents, one at the bottom and one at the top, although **smoker** designs do vary. The bottom vent, located near, and usually under, your firebox is known as your intake vent. The top vent, is your exhaust vent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Still, temperature control is one area that can be tricky for new WSM owners. Sometimes a Weber **smoker** runs too hot…even with all the bottom vents closed, the temperature won’t come down into the 225-250°F range. Other times, even with a full charcoal chamber and all the bottom vents wide open, a Weber **smoker** runs too cool…temperature won’t rise above **200**°F! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
