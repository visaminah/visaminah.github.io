## 75 Facts What'S The Best Grass Seed To Put Down | The Best South Carolina Grass Seed
-   When it comes to growing a quality lawn, the southern climate is not very hospitable. When mixed, southern **grass**es do not produce good results, and they spread by stolons (or creeping roots). Other varieties will tend to segregate into distinct patches of each array because these native species rarely hybridize effectively. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the most common reasons bermuda**grass** fails is improper soil preparation before planting. The proper way to prepare your soil for bermuda**grass** involves preparing the soil with organic matter such as composted manure or peat moss mixed into the top 6 inches of soil prior to planting your **seed**lings or plugs. This helps maintain moisture levels when watering your new lawn. The proper amount of water needed depends on how much sun exposure your lawn gets per day as well as how much rainfall it receives each month. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even in areas of North and Central Florida that experience a freeze, most **grass** will survive. Since the freezes in Florida don’t typically last for an extended period of time, the majority of **grass** will bounce back and continue to grow once climate conditions improve. If you live in Northern Florida and are concerned with losing **grass** to a freeze, you can opt for more cold-tolerant varieties of **grass** such as Kentucky Blue**grass**, Perennial Rye**grass**, and Fescus. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The short answer is to match your timing to align with the natural course of a **grass** type’s active growth. That means when to sow **grass** **seed** depends on optimal temperatures for their germination. Of course, there is more to consider than just temps in your timing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best type of lawn **seed**s to add to your lawn depends upon your existing **grass** and the problems affecting its growth. If heat has caused thinning of your **grass**, you may want to over**seed** with Bermuda or zoysia **grass**, both of which are heat-tolerant and drought-tolerant. If you have partial shade on your lawn, a good **seed** choice is St. Augustine. If you’re going for lush **grass** in winter, rye **grass** may be your best option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another step you can take to ensure that water and air can reach past the existing **grass** roots to the **seed**s you’re going to add, fully aerate your lawn with a core aerator. Rentals are available at garden centers. Pass the aerator over your lawn in sections, the same as when mowing the lawn. Allow the cores removed from your lawn to stay in place and dissolve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best turf success comes from planting the right **grass** for the region in which you live. You might consider water and care needs and appearance. But selecting a **grass** not meant for your climate can erase some of those benefits. Grass is categorized by season, so choose based on when it thrives: cool season or warm season. Each of these varieties requires different maintenance and—you guessed it—minimum sowing requirements to grow good-looking **grass** from **seed**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Starting with bare ground? Loosen the top 2 inches of soil and remove any materials (i.e. sticks and stones) that could block airflow. If you’re broadcasting **grass** **seed** over a large, bare area, a **seed** spreader and light tiller might come in handy. Hard ground might first require aeration or loosening soil a little deeper, closer to 6 inches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Zoysia **grass** is another great option if you want to save money on your water bill and have a low maintenance yard. It grows at an even rate without needing any trimming or cutting, and it has deep roots that make it extremely hardy against pests and diseases. Zoysia **grass** can be grown in both sun and shade, but does best in full sunlight because this helps the blades grow strong and thick. This type of **grass** grows between 1-3 feet tall depending on how long its left to grow before being cut back again. If you live in Florida where the summers are scorching hot, zoysia **grass** is one of the best options for your yard because it stays cool underneath even when temperatures soar above 100 degrees Fahrenheit! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fall is highly regarded as one of the best times of the year to plant **grass** **seed**. Taking advantage of the optimal fall growing conditions can help make establishing **seed** for the average do-it-yourselfer much easier. By following a few easy steps and remembering a handful of helpful guidelines, new **grass** will be growing in no time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best **grass** **seed** for Florida is a palatable lawn that can withstand the humid weather and has an ability to grow in shade. The perfect **grass** **seed** will have low-maintenance requirements, be durable under foot, and look great year round. In this blog post we’ll discuss several different types of **seed**s as well as their pros/cons. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Have you been thinking about adding lawn **seed**s to your existing lawn to achieve a more robust appearance? A vibrant green, lush lawn is the goal of most homeowners, but lawns are often more lifeless than luxuriant. And with such challenges as drought stress, insects, disease, sandy soil, and more, it’s no wonder Florida lawns are often sparse. Thankfully, there is a simple solution known as “over-**seed**ing.” It basically involves spreading **grass** **seed** over your existing lawn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Typically, you should avoid walking on the new lawn area for at least 4 weeks. Any activities from kids or dogs on the growing lawn can disturb your carefully broadcast **seed**s. Once the **seed**s germinate, the **seed**lings are tender as they grow above and below the ground, establishing roots. Walking on **seed**lings can damage them or uproot them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Likewise, watch for rain events. While a good soaking can help **seed**s germinate, a downpour can cause **seed**s to erode or migrate, gathering in a bunch at the bottom of a hill, for example. And it is best to plant **grass** **seed** before a steady rain, not right after a heavy one. Muddy ground is hard to work and too much moisture around new **seed**s could lead to a fungal disease that kills the **seed**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spring **seed**ed turf will also need a little more fertilizer to get it up and growing. At **seed**ing apply a starter type fertilizer. Apply a second application about four weeks after germination using a high nitrogen source of fertilizer such as 30-0-0, and, if possible, find a formulation that contains a percentage of slow release nutrients. This helps spread out the feeding and reduces summer stress by not being under such a lush application of nitrogen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For some property owners, appearance and texture is everything. If the **grass** requires mowing every five days and applications of silica sand, fine. The end result is emerald-green, touchable turf. For others, the courser more rugged feel of a St. Augustine **grass** like Floratam fits the bill because they get a consistent, persistent green mat of **grass** without doting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A popular choice in the southern United States, this warm-season type of **grass** thrives with lots of sunlight and well-draining soil. It is typically low-maintenance and does not require much watering or fertilizing. Mowing Zoysia **grass** is a little more challenging as it grows thick and dense, but this is what gives it its durability. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Time from planting to picnicking on a new lawn can vary depending on the specific **seed** type (some grow faster than others), site prep, **seed** quality (and age), and unpredictable factors like weather. In general, cool-season **grass**es grow faster than warm-season ones. Most cool-season **grass** **seed**s should begin to germinate in 5 to 7 days. Popular warm-season **grass** **seed**s usually take nearly 2 weeks and as long as 3 weeks. Be patient; a few factors can affect germination, such as: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grass can thin over time, requiring you to over**seed** the lawn to fill in. You can mow the existing turf shorter than normal, prep the ground, and sow **grass** **seed** to fill in. Over**seed**ing also works best when temperatures support germination for the **grass** type chosen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s tough to grow **grass** in Florida because of the heat, humidity and frequent hurricanes. The best **seed** for your lawn is a question that has many variables. You need to consider what type of **grass** you want to plant, how much time and money you’re willing to spend on maintenance, if it will be sunny or shady most of the year as well as other factors like wind power. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We believe the best time of year to sow new lawn **seed** is either in the spring, from the end of March to the middle of May, or from September until the middle of October. As a general rule both sowing time frames tend to coincide with good day temperatures and a much reduced risk of over night frosts. Sowing lawn **seed** in the middle of summer is possible however care must be taken to ensure it’s watered every single day until its established. A new lawn can take up to eight weeks to fully establish and will need the correct care until it is able to look after itself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The length of time it will take for the **grass** **seed** to germinate will depend on the temperatures. Expect at least two to three weeks, or more, for emergence. Once the **seed** is up, reduce the frequency of watering to as needed. By that I mean, water when the **seed**ling **grass** shows signs of stress, such as wilting or turning a bluish cast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Caring for your lawn and over-**seed**ing it for a lusher appearance is even easier when you visit Cypress Creek Landscape Supply for all of your landscaping needs. We have been serving the area for more than 25 years, and we have all of the high-quality lawn supplies you might need to create the backyard oasis and overall curb appeal you dream of for your lawn. From carrying gravel and many types of stone and rock to bulk topsoil, fertilizers, mulch, and much more, our garden and landscape center is a complete nursery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Start by clearing all weeds and other debris from the area you wish to sow lawn **seed** onto. This is vital as once the lawn **seed** is down you may damage the new **seed**lings if you start walking over them at a later date before they are fully established. Now is also the time to get the area as level as possible. Again this is important as once the **grass** **seed** has been sown you cant take it back up and start again if you decide your not happy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   St. Augustine **grass** is an excellent choice for homeowners who want a thick, lush lawn that looks great year round and requires little maintenance. It’s also very drought resistant so you won’t have to worry about watering your lawn as much as you would with other types of turf**grass**! The only downside to using St. Augustine **grass** is that it does require frequent mowing to keep the blades at a manageable height of 1-2 inches, which means you’ll have to spend time in your yard every week cutting back your **grass**! If you don’t mind spending some extra time taking care of your lawn, St. Augustine is a great choice because it grows well in full sunlight or shade, and will look great all year long when left untouched by the homeowner for periods of time before being cut back again! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   South Carolina homeownership is growing rapidly, with the 11th highest homeownership rate in the United States. This means that more and more people are buying homes in South Carolina. If you plan on purchasing a home, then there's one investment that will be more important than any other: **grass** **seed** for your yard! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   St. Augustine Floratam is considered native to areas like South Florida and adapts well to most soils. It is the most shade-tolerant warm season **grass**, but it needs at least four to six hours of sun to thrive. The **grass** establishes quickly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you do not want to wait until autumn, you can sow the **grass** in spring. However, the garden soil temperatures needed for germination will only be reached in April. Soil temperatures are usually best from mid-April to early May, but make sure that there is enough moisture in the soil. High temperatures in early June can easily harm the young lawn and ruin all your hard work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fall Dormant Seeding Fall dormant **seed**ing involves putting down **grass** **seed** before the ground is frozen, but yet the soil and air temperatures are far too cold for the **seed** to germinate at this time. Dormant **seed**ing is typically done in November when temperatures are too low for germination. The **grass** **seed** will lie dormant until next spring when the soil temperatures warm and germination begins. Covering the **seed** with mulch or a very thin layer of soil will greatly increase the success of the dormant **seed**ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you **seed** or sod a lawn, allot time on your calendar for a bit of prep work as the time draws near. This might require some pretreatment with an herbicide, and that month or more of waiting. You can also simply remove all weeds with hoes and by hand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the historic problems with spring **seed**ing has been excessive crab**grass** germination. Thin turf areas and disturbing the soil results in a bumper crop of this pesky weed. Fortunately newer crab**grass** control products can help us overcome this problem. The product Dithiopyr (active ingredient) is recommended for spring **seed**ing as it can be applied later into the season and still provide good control. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the lush, green lawn has grown to a height of at least 6 cm, you can start maintaining the lawn by cutting the **grass** with a mower that has sharp blades. Keep weeds at bay by applying a pre-emergent each spring or by periodically removing weeds by hand. Apply fertilizer seasonally, as recommended by your lawn care provider. And, always rake the lawn in late fall before the snow flies to aerate and stimulate the soil and **grass** after the last cutting. A little TLC will make you and your **grass** very happy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This product actually works as a pre-emergent and on **seed**ling crab**grass** which has already germinated. In most seasons it can be applied in early to mid-May and still provide excellent season long control. In fact, some labels on the product indicate it can be applied as soon as two weeks after germination, or when the new **grass** is 2 inches tall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A: More than anything else, when to plant **grass** **seed** depends largely on the climate in your part of the world and the types of **grass**es that thrive there. Next, consider the actual forecast around that time to select the best time to **seed** a lawn. Most Americans want to be surrounded by green lawns they can spend time in, and a few factors come into play to ensure the **grass** **seed** put down takes root. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take care not to distribute your **seed**s just before heavy rains, which can erode the soil and disrupt germination. (Sowing right after it rains is fine, but dry soil is generally easier to **seed**.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before adding **seed** to your lawn, mow your **grass** so that light can get through the existing **grass** to the **seed**s. Sunlight is needed for germination. A **grass** height of 1 ½ inches is ideal. Rake the lawn after mowing to remove dead **grass** and loosen the soil, allowing germinated **seed**s to root more easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pre-**seed**ing lawn fertilisers are a fast way to help your new lawn **seed** establish. It is best to apply the pre-**seed**ing fertiliser before the **grass** **seed** and give it a day or so to settle before then applying the **seed**. Pre-**seed**ing fertiliser is packed full of key nurtients that will become available to the newly germinating **grass** **seed**lings. The difference between a lawn that has used Pre-**seed**ing lawn fertiliser and one that has not is often very clear. We highly recommend this step to get the most out of your new lawn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spring **seed**ed turf has a very limited root system. My recommendation is not to even attempt spring **seed**ing unless you are committed to watering during the summer. Without regular summer applications the spring **grass** is likely to die in the dog days of summer, which means you are right back where you started and out your time and money. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you’re replanting an existing lawn or choosing **grass** for newly constructed landscape, you might be wondering: What type of **grass** is best for my Florida property? You’ve probably seen fine, thin, dark-green **grass** that feels like soft carpet to the touch. This is Zoysia **grass**, and there are several different varieties. The most popular right now in South Florida is Zoysia Empire. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are planning on planting **grass** **seed** in Florida for spring, you should do it as soon as the soil is warm enough. This will be approximately mid-February or March. If the ground has been worked up and rained on, it should be ready by mid-February. If there is still a lot of cold weather, wait until March 1st before planting **grass** **seed** in Florida. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When selecting the type of **seed** to plant, you first need to take stock of how much sun and shade the yard gets. Seriously, spend a day watching the motion of the sun, taking some notes, and snapping a couple of pictures. This will help when you discuss the **seed** options with your garden supply center or your landscaper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The reason why the fall season is the best time of year to plant **grass** is because the days are usually sunny and warm – while the nights are dewy and cool. This type of climate keeps the **grass** **seed**s moist while they germinate. Also, during fall, weeds that normally compete with **grass** are usually gone. Plant diseases are usually also under control during fall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes and no. Native **grass**es, in particular, will likely sprout in some areas, but there is a difference between sporadic sprouting and a broad area of **seed**s taking root. Just throwing **seed**s out will likely lead to uneven coverage. Plus, the blades that might pop up will not be healthy, well-rooted **grass** without adequate site preparation. If you want to speed up the process, try asking a lawn care professional to hydro**seed** your lawn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best time to plant **grass** **seed** in the fall is mid-August though late-September. This gives the **seed** a good amount of time to become established before winter arrives. The soil also tends to retain just enough moisture this time of year. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many varieties of **grass** **seed** to choose from. Seek professional advice on this topic. There is no need for you to attend agriculture college to learn everything you can about **grass** **seed**. Leave this step to the experts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s not necessary to soak **grass** **seed** before planting; the **seed**s are small and typically germinate 1 to 2 weeks after planting with consistent watering. If you have a short window for the best time to **seed** a lawn, especially for getting cool-season **grass** going before cold sets in, you can soak the **seed**s in water for 24 hours. Then, drain the water completely from the cup or bucket, and leave them in a warm location like a heated shed for a few days until small sprouts appear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bahia **grass** grows best in full sunlight, but can grow in partial shade as well. It is a great choice for those who want a low maintenance lawn that requires little care. Bahia **grass** does spread by rhizomes, so it may need to be controlled if it spreads out of bounds or into flower beds or other areas you don’t want it growing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the soil is prepared the **seed** can be broadcast. Then the fun of over**seed**ing begins as the soil surface must be kept moist through germination and into early establishment. This means light, frequent water applications applied as needed, based on weather patterns. The good news is that in the spring temperatures are cooler and more overcast, and rainy days are likely to reduce the watering demands typically found during hot September days. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bermuda **grass** is a warm season perennial that grows best in hot, humid climates, just like Central Florida. Bermuda **grass** is known to be one of the most drought tolerant lawn **grass**es in the world. It can withstand temperatures ranging from -7 degrees F. to over 100 degrees F. While it does not tolerate cold well, bermuda **grass** is able to grow and survive in areas where winter temperatures are below freezing for short periods of time (as long as it remains thawed). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the other hand, St. Augustine **grass** grows readily in South Florida soil with minor preparation. This reduces installation expenses. And, the **seed** itself is economical and considered the most price conscious way to install **grass** in South Florida. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because the aesthetic of Zosyia **grass** and St. Augstine **grass** are so different, property owners tend to have definite opinions about which type of **grass** they want for their Florida lawns. If touch and feel are not a big deal, then maintenance takes precedence. With mowing, fertilization and disease control in mind, St. Augustine **grass** generally comes out as the winner because of its lower-maintenance profile compared to Zoysia **grass**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Irrigation, especially too little, affects time to germination. Seeds need steady moisture to sprout, and do best with water sprayed lightly on the soil surface. Over-irrigating to the point that water pools or runs is nearly as bad as drying out. Spray **seed**s several times a day for the first few weeks, depending on the weather. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, let’s get honest about what it takes to care for a lawn in Florida if you choose Zoysia **grass** or St. Augustine **grass**. Indeed, there’s a difference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rolling the area is not essential but trials show a much better germination time and consistancey when a new lawn is rolled after sowning. Rolling presses the new lawn **seed** into the soil and helps surround it with moisture. This will speed up its germination and will create a hardier lawn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you might imagine, warm-season **grass**es (including Bahia **grass**, Bermuda **grass**, centipede, and St. Augustine) thrive in climates with mild winters and hot summers and don’t require as much water as other **grass**es. They germinate and grow in temperatures above 80 degrees. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you spread the **grass** **seed**, use a rake to work it into soil, but only to about ¼ inch. Don’t push the **seed** down too deeply or cover it with a thick layer of mulch that will block light. If you can, use a roller to pass over the area after raking to ensure **seed**s have good contact with soil. You can sprinkle a light layer of compost or straw over the soil to help retain moisture, but only thin enough to prevent blocking light. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best **grass** **seed** for North Florida is bahia **grass**. Bahia **grass** is a warm-season **grass** that grows in clumps. It is very drought tolerant and can tolerate wet conditions as well. Bahia **grass** also does not require mowing or fertilizing to keep it looking good. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What’s the goal for your Florida lawn? Do you want a soft, green carpet of **grass** with thinner, gentle blades? (Think: touchable, yet higher maintenance.) Or, are you thinking resilient, hardy, grow strong turf that can be left alone for a good week or even 10 days without a mow? (You can’t have it all.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Florida is a warm climate that tends to have high temperatures and very little rainfall. This makes it difficult for **grass** to grow in these conditions. In order for the **grass** to survive, you will need to water it consistently and fertilize it regularly. If you do not take care of your lawn, it will die off quickly. The only way for the **grass** to survive in these conditions is if you pay close attention to it on a regular basis. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We aren’t joking! The more water a new lawn gets the better (within reason of course). The soil needs to be damp to the touch but you must avoid creating puddles. If you start to get collections of water your new lawn **seed** will start to float and move from where you put it. Ideally a new lawn will be watered first thing in the morning and last thing at night. Try not to water in direct sunlight especially once the **seed** starts to germinate as this will damage it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Planting wrong **grass** on your Florida property can be an expensive mistake. Grasses need varying levels of sunlight, water and care to thrive. And, it’s pretty tough to fight Mother Nature. What’s better is to work with your property’s conditions—soil type, sun exposure, irrigation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you choose to lay sod to enhance the look of your lawn, you’ll want to be sure that it’s installed at the perfect time to maximize growth and retention. Similar to **grass** grown from a **seed**, most sod varieties will perform best when installed in a warm temperature environment. This especially holds true for warm **grass** varieties like St. augustine sod, zoysia sod, and bahia sod. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Water Requirements The most important rule to follow when establishing **grass** **seed** is “If the **seed** dries, it dies.” Water is essential and without it the **seed** cannot germinate. Maintaining a light frequent watering schedule multiple times a day until the **grass** fully establishes is vital. This ensures the **seed** always stays moist and doesn’t dry out. Watering heavy for long periods of time poses a risk of washing the **seed** away before it can establish itself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In order to ensure that your lawn stays healthy and green, you will need to water it on a daily basis during the summer months. You can also use a soaker hose or an irrigation system if the area is too large for hand watering. Make sure that you water the lawn early in the morning or late in the evening when temperatures are cooler so that you don’t burn the **grass** with excess heat from the sun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Germination The speed at which **seed** germinates and establishes itself can be determined by several factors. Aside from weather conditions, **grass** species has the biggest influence. Each species germinates at a different speed, some quicker and some slower than others. Assuming optimal weather and growing conditions, some **seed** can germinate in as quickly as 4-7 days, or it can take as long as 21 days before germination begins. Perennial Rye**grass** is considered a quick germination **grass** species, while Kentucky Blue**grass** is considered very slow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Zoysia **grass**: It performs best when it is mowed often, and this means weekly (or even every five days for varieties like Cashmere). This putting green-like **grass** needs to be kept at about ½ to 1 inch tall. It needs lots of attention in terms of regular fertilization, irrigation and mowing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When to sow lawn **seed** you asked? The time is right now! Using roughly 50gs per square meter (roughly a large handful) throw the lawn **seed** onto the prepared soil. Repeat this process until you have covered the whole area with **seed**. It is better to go a little thinner than put to much **grass** **seed** down in one go. You can always add more if you need to. If you do accidently drop a significant amount in one area a good stiff broom is useful to literally sweep it around to disperse it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After leaving the area to settle for a few days now is the time to level off any areas you may have overlooked or fill in dips that have developed as the soil has settled. Remember all the hard work will be worth it when your mower can glide effortlessly over a flat lawn. Once you are totally satisfied the area is level lightly create a tilth with a garden folk. Do not work the soil to deeply just the top few millimeters need to be “fluffed up”. By doing so you are creating a suitable **seed** bed for your lawn **seed** to sit in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The easiest **grass** to grow in Florida is Bermuda **grass**. It prefers moist soil, but can live in dry conditions as well. One of the characteristic features of this type of **grass** is that it builds up a deep root system and has little inclination to be harmful, so any pesticides are easily broken down by the microbes in the soil it resists frost as well. Since it’s resistant to damage from both pests and cold, Bermuda Grass makes an excellent addition to lawns and golf courses; just make sure you don’t have seasonal allergies or an allergic reaction when coming into contact with this **grass**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Zoysia **grass** is another excellent choice if you want to save money on water bills and have a low maintenance yard that doesn’t require too much attention from the homeowner every week. It grows at an even rate without needing any trimming or cutting, and it has deep roots that make it extremely hardy against pests and diseases. Zoysia **grass** can be grown in both sun and shade, but does best in full sunlight because this helps the blades grow strong and thick. This type of **grass** grows between 1-3 feet tall depending on how long its left to grow before being cut back again. If you live in Florida where the summers are scorching hot, zoysia **grass** is one of the best options for your yard because it stays cool underneath even when temperatures soar above 100 degrees Fahrenheit! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   South Carolina has both warm and cold seasons, but fall is the ideal time to plant the best lawn **grass** **seed**s.
