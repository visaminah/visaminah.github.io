## 130 Unexpected Facts About Best Commercial Gas String Trimmer 2020 | best commercial gas string trimmer 2020
-   A **string** **trimmer** is a tool that can help you trim tall grass and weeds in your garden. The **string** **trimmer** has a nylon **string** instead of a blade to do the cutting. This nylon **string** rotates very fast and helps to cut the weeds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Tanaka TCG27EBSP is a gas **trimmer** that comes with a 26.9cc, 2-cycle commercial grade engine. This means you can use it for professional trimming or in a large garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, place the **trimmer** right on the ground. It should be on the start grip handle’s opposite side. You don’t want the line or any part that cuts to touch the ground, as it may end up damaging the ground. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Remington RM25S is a true budget pick. It’s a bit of a contradiction, since it’s heavy (more than 15 pounds), it has the smallest cutting width of all the **trimmer**s on this list, and it has only a 25 cc, 2-cycle engine. For the price, though, it’s a solid weed eater and brush cutter for residential use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Looking for a solid steel **string** **trimmer** for cheap? This one works well enough. We don’t recommend it for the toughest jobs, but it has some capabilities. Consider this to be like #4 on the main list, but not as good. However, it should have everything you need. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The workhorse could chop down weeds as long as my waist level with ease. The **trimmer**’s deflector prevented a lot of bad debris from flying around. The RM1159 is quite compact and can easily reach around small corners and nooks. Once I was done with the mowing process, my lawn looked like entirely new terrain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To avoid any potential engine issues, hanging it on the wall, by the engine will keep your weed eater safe and well maintained. However, there are a couple of nuisances to be aware of should you have an electric or gas-powered weed eater, and a few additional rules to go by when storing your equipment. One of the most important considerations is how powerful the cutter is. If you choose a gas-powered **trimmer**, power is important, and you should pay attention to whether the power output is enough for the kind of jobs you want to do. Gas-powered engines in weed eaters are either 2-stroke or 4-stroke. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are looking for a reliable way to weed your lawn or garden with a weed wacker, look no further than the Cyclone Desert **trimmer** **string**. This .095-inch, multi-sided weed wacker **string** is made with a durable copolymer, offering abrasion resistance while cutting brush, weeds, and grass. Alternatively, the Maxpower **trimmer** line comes with an ample 855 feet of .095-inch line made with nylon monofilament for heavy-duty weeding and lawn maintenance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **string** **trimmer** weighs 10.3 lbs without the gas and has a good balance. This will make it easy to use for long periods of trimming without feeling tired. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The shaft is a straight line one that is suitable if you’re tall so you don’t need to bend while trimming. This **trimmer** weighs about 12.2 lbs which makes it heavy but comfortable to carry around in the yard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While choosing a commercial weed eater, you should also take into consideration the cutting path. It is important if you need a tool that will assist you in clearing grass on a lawn effectively. Plus, it takes lesser time to accomplish the task. Most **trimmer**s come with a small cutting track that is quite less effective when you clear larger fields. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wind the **string** in the opposite direction of its rotation. In most cases, you’ll want to wind the **string** counterclockwise. Many **trimmer** manufacturers imprint an arrow on the spool to show the proper direction to wind the **string**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1. Husqvarna Gas Straight Shaft String Trimmer 128LD - Editor's Choice Via Amazon.com Husqvarna 128ld String Trimmer is one of the best weed eaters that I have ever tried! It is equipped with a lot of specifications and unique features. This machine has helped me with all types of edging and trimming needs. For me, it is the right **trimmer** that can cut an overgrown lawn before using a lawnmower. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the Ego ST1511T is not available, we also like the Ego ST1521S Power+ String Trimmer with Powerload. This is the previous generation of Ego **string** **trimmer**, and it shares much of what makes the ST1511T such a success: long battery life, excellent power, and the easy line change. The significant differences are that it doesn’t have the telescoping shaft or the quick adjustment on the handle, so it’s not as flexible for varying body heights. The two **trimmer**s are typically sold for around the same price, so we recommend choosing this model only if the ST1511T is out of stock and you can’t wait for it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, you need to make sure the **trimmer** line you’ve purchased is right for your weed eater. Too thin, or too thick, and it may not work with your machine. Do your research and get the right line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Husqvarna 128ld **trimmer** is fitted with a 2-stroke, 28-cc engine, which makes it optimized for performance. The 1-horsepower engine is powerful enough to cut through bush-like terrain with no hassles. Similar to other gas-powered **trimmer**s, the Husqvarna 128ld also makes use of 100% gasoline, which needs to be mixed with oil before use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Husqvarna 128LD weighs 10.8 lbs which makes it lightweight for a gas **trimmer**. It should be easy to carry this **trimmer** around for a long period of time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Milwaukee 2825-21ST M18 FUEL String Trimmer is our premium choice pick. It’s a battery-powered **trimmer** that allows complete portability and near-silent operation. The battery and charger come with it, and it can run close to an hour on a single charge thanks to its brushless motor that uses less power and creates less heat. It has a straight 74-inch shaft that should be long enough for most people. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The weight of a **trimmer** is another thing that you should consider while buying a weed eater for commercial purposes. As you know, clearing your larger fields will take time and therefore, it should not be heavy if you want to complete the work without getting tired. The weed eater’s weight can be determined by the elements it comprises. That’s why you should not go with **trimmer**s that come with various parts. Power - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Instead of a blade, **string** **trimmer**s use a **string** (or “line”) to slice through foliage. String **trimmer**s consist of a long shaft with a cutting head, also known as a **trimmer** head, on one end. The cutting head is the part of the tool where you load the **string**, and it’s the part that does the cutting (thus the name). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The RM1159 weighs roughly about 78 pounds and consists of a 4-cycle 159cc OHV engine. The loop handle is ergonomic in design that also folds, allowing for easy storage and smooth transport. The RM1159 is capable of mowing down the toughest blades of grass. You can also adjust the cutting height of the **trimmer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is a common question that why should you choose this **trimmer** when there are bigger and better **trimmer**s in the market in the same price range. I have to offer several reasons why you should choose the GT-225 over others. Just because it is a lightweight **trimmer** does not mean that it lacks power. The Echo GT-225 is capable of edging and trimming without giving up midway. While other models pack a lot more power, they do not have the combination of being lightweight and powerful at the same time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But there are a few bonus features offered by some manufacturers that can take your **string** **trimmer** from “good” to the best weed eater around. However—and this is a big drawback for some—the power cord can severely limit your range and may prove to be a hazard. It may be all too easy for some to cut through it by accident or even trip over it while they work. For these reasons, corded weed eaters are best for those with smaller yards, who live in big towns, and who can stick close to home for their trimming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That depends on your specific needs. Trimmers with curved shafts are usually shorter, lighter, and cheaper. Straight shafts are longer, so they can reach a wider radius, and these **trimmer**s typically produce more torque. You’ll notice all of our top picks have straight shafts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   6. Tanaka TCG22EAP2SLB 2-Cycle Gas Powered Curved Shaft String Trimmer Now another two-stroke gas-powered Tanaka commercial weed eater enters the list. Instead of focusing on commercial-grade cutting power, the Tanaka TCG22EAP2SLB **trimmer** prides itself on an ergonomic design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Why does the power of the engine matter the most when making a gas **string** **trimmer** comparison of similar models? This characteristic determines the strength and effectiveness of the device, as the engine is what powers the equipment. Therefore, the more potent the engine is, the better the performance your tool delivers. It also means that a **trimmer** with a powerful engine can handle heavy-duty jobs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Square **trimmer** line has four hard cutting edges that are designed to aggressively cut through coarse weeds and green underbrush, where it excels. Round line is quieter and more fuel-efficient due to reduced wind resistance. It is also more durable than square line of the same size because it consists of more material. For generally weed-free lawns, round line could be the best choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a corded **string** **trimmer**, which means you need to have a long enough extension cord for your yard. With 8,000 RPM and 6.5 amps, this **string** **trimmer** should be powerful enough to handle most light yard work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Everyone likes a well-maintained lawn. However, achieving such a look requires the right tool for trimming your compound. In this article, I have provided the seven gas weed **trimmer** reviews so that you could choose the best equipment to keep your lawn neat and know how to use such tools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is well balanced for easy maneuverability and comes with a harness and safety glasses for added user comfort. But it has a lot of other features to commend it as a great choice in 4 stroke **trimmer**s. Straight shaft **trimmer**s have the advantage of transferring power more efficiently to the **trimmer** head. Given all the moving parts of a gas-powered **trimmer**, these particular types of weed eaters can be somewhat expensive to maintain. Because the gas-powered **string** **trimmer** has no cord, it is not limited by the length of that cord as to where it can go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We test our gas-engine and battery-powered **string** **trimmer**s in identical fashion. We use the machines on ordinary suburban lawn grasses such as blue grass, perennial ryegrass, and fescues in a variety of suburban and rural locations. However, our most severe testing occurred along the sloping bank of a sand floor drainage basin in southern New Jersey, where we used the **trimmer**s to cut down knee-deep weeds and wild flowers. We also did considerable edging where sidewalks meet lawns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the more annoying parts of using a weed eater is putting in new **trimmer** line. Once you run out, you have to put more in. For some, it can feel like a hassle, but once you know how it works, it can be quite easy. Let’s look at some of the best ways to **string** it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While searching for the best **string** **trimmer** lines on the market, the most popular types among users were made with gatorline, nylon, polymer, and colymer and had round, square, twisted, and multi-sided designs, each with their unique durability, cutting power, and noise- and vibration-reduction. We also included weed wacker **string**s of varying sizes for light- to heavy-duty yard work, ranging from .080 to .155 inches, making them compatible with a range of residential and commercial weed wacker heads. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While the materials used to make **trimmer** **string**s are all reasonably weld resistant, some **string** types have a higher degree of resistance than others. Given the same material, shaped line is more weld-resistant than round because of the increased surface area. Round **string** has the least amount of surface area, allowing heat buildup to occur more quickly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Greenworks ST80L210 String Trimmer is another battery-powered model that features a 16-inch **trimmer** head. It uses a brushless motor to increase torque and battery life. One full charge usually lasts about 45 minutes. It’s not light, but it’s not heavy either at a little under 10 pounds. At 65 inches long, it should be suitable for most people. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Anyway, no matter what you call it, the weed eater is designed to trim spots in your yard the lawnmower can’t reach, trim brushes, and do other yard work tasks as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Husqvarna 324L is a straightforward hand-held **trimmer** that has a cutting circumference of 17-inches. It is fitted with a 25cc X-Torq engine and equipped with a Smart Start System. The X-Torq engine helps increase the efficiency of fuel by up to 20% and reduces the emission of harmful exhaust by 60%. Apart from being quieter than other models, the Husqvarna 324L also limits the exhaust emissions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Round **string** comes in all sizes. It is economical, durable, and easy to reload. A round **string** is best for lawns with mostly grass and just a few weeds. It is not as efficient on weedy properties because the smooth edges tend to tear through weeds rather than cutting cleanly. A round **string** is also more likely to overheat and weld together when trimming along concrete walls or fences. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Weed **trimmer** **string** is available in round, square, multi-sided, twisted, and serrated shapes for different types of yard work. The shape of the **string** affects performance in several ways, including the cleanness of the cut, the durability of the **string**, and even noise level. It is important to match the shape with the application for which you’ll be using the **string**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No matter what, you are going to run out of **string** and need to replace it. Most models require you to rewind it by hand, but some make it much more difficult than others. Some use a fancy ratchet system, while others need you to disassemble the head to add more **string**. We tried to list any models that used outdated systems in our reviews. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Craftsman CMXGTAMD30SA Straight Shaft String Trimmer is the last model on our list to review for you, and this one features a large 30cc, 4-cycle engine that provides the user with a 17-inch cutting width. The shaft is straight, so it’s easier to use in some situations, especially when using attachments. It has a two-step starting mechanism where you push a priming bulb before pulling the **string** for easy starting. A multi-position handle helps make holding it more comfortable, and it also helps to reduce vibrations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This offering from Black and Decker also converts from a **trimmer** to an edger with a simple turn of the **trimmer**’s shaft making it an excellent investment for many of your lawn care needs. Moreover, it has a curved shaft that makes trimming and cutting actually more comfortable even if this is not a task that you enjoy. It has a straight shaft which makes it easier to get under bushes, etc and it does seem to eat up the line like lots of weed eaters do. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s not a great feeling to get injured by the **string** **trimmer**. That’s why you should wear protective equipment before using the **trimmer**. Wear a good pair of jeans and shoes that cover your feet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Very easy to assemble as you just have to reposition the handle and install its guard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gasoline weed **trimmer**s are available either with straight or curved shafts. The curved ones can bend between the spinning **trimmer** head and its handle. Such a tool will be a perfect match for small people. A device with a curved shaft also comes as more durable because such a design allows the flexibility of the drive cable. The curved shafts also have a better balance than straight ones that increases their maneuverability in hard-to-reach areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The cutting width that the weed eater provides can make a big difference in how long it takes you to complete a project. A wider cutting will go through more **string**, but the time-saving advantage makes it worth it. If choosing between two similar models, we recommend the one with the bigger cutting width. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are a tall person, you want a weed **trimmer** that will fit your height. Otherwise, you risk bending too much while at work and straining your back before even finishing trimming your yard. The good news is that this Craftsman WS295 model has an 11-inches handle that is long enough for tall people. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Some reviewers had problems with the carburetor. Some said it wasn’t as ergonomic if you were taller. However, these reviews do appear to be in the minority. Most people said it’s one of the best commercial grade **string** **trimmer**s if you want one that is powered by gas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, the retainer should be lined up with the outer head slot. Put the spool into the head of the **trimmer** and take out any line in the retainer. Put the cap back on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The cutting width can be compared to the working space operated by the device’s blades when cutting grass. The standard width of most gas **trimmer**s is between twelve to fifteen inches. However, there are also some durable options with a cutting width of over fifteen inches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many different types of weed **trimmer**s you can see in the market today. Some are powered by gas, some by a battery, while others by electricity. While the ultimate goal of trimming the lawn is met, they tend to differ in many aspects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **string** could be places in the cutting head as part of a fixed line or spool. A fixed line means you don’t need to worry about the **string** getting jammed. But it tends to wear the line out faster. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A 4-stroke engine runs on straight gasoline, so you won’t have to mix fuel. String **trimmer**s with 4-stroke engines are typically quieter and have better fuel efficiency than 2-stroke weed eaters. These benefits are what makes 4-cycle **trimmer**s cost more. However, these also require more maintenance, since these tools need regular oil changes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many weed eaters employ a starting line to start the **trimmer**. Here, you need to pull this line a few times, which is quite time-consuming and tiring also. Meanwhile, some **trimmer**s do not even start with consistent pulling. That’s the reason you should go with weed eaters that come with S-start or sequential start. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here is a battery powered **trimmer** that is awfully thin. It’s probably underpowered and is only recommended for very light jobs. If you’re looking for the cheapest commercial weed eater, you can’t go wrong with this one. Just don’t be surprised if it can’t cut very well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Husqvarna model is more powerful than most of the other **trimmer**s in terms of cutting width. It can trim a whopping 18 inches of grass and flower beds. This width is big enough to allow you to trim your lawn within an hour or two, depending on its size. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All of the power goes to a longer **string**, which means that they tend to operate at higher RPMs. A **trimmer** is an essential tool for keeping your yard neat and tidy. However, with so many different models, it can be confusing to make your purchase decision. So, here we’ve created a buying guide with the features to look for, things to consider and the answers to some common questions to help you make your final choice. The curved shaft allows you to see the trimming point without a need to strain, while not increasing the bulkiness of the **trimmer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This commercial weed eater also comes with the ability to control its speed. You can pick from low or high speed. Low saves power and works fine for easy tasks. However, high is great for those heavy duty jobs. You have an option to reverse the **string** **trimmer** as well in case some weeds get tangled up in it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now that we have that out of the way, make sure the engine is turned off. For an electric weed eater, take out the battery or unplug it. Now that you’ve done that, you can replace the **trimmer** line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the best aspects that I love about this **trimmer** is that it is very easy to maintain. You do not have to do a lot to make sure it remains in the best working condition for a long time to come. Even if you face any technical difficulty, you can easily reach the company’s support team for help; they will help you get the **trimmer** up and running in no time!

-   For the greatest durability, round **string** is the standard. Combining more material with less surface area, it has a longer wear time. Round **string** made of reinforced nylon or non-nylon polymer, or **string** with a hardened core material, will provide greater durability than basic nylon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **trimmer** is equipped with a 2-cycle, 21.2cc engine; while it might not be the largest engine around, it is more than enough to do what you need it to do. The smaller engine also contributes to making this model quite lightweight. Due to the small engine, starting the Echo GT-225 is very easy and will not exert you in any way; as long as you have oil and gas, you can expect the **trimmer** to start easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is no universal length of such a tool because different people need different tools.

-   The lowest engine power you can find on the market is 15cc. The main advantage of such capacity is that the equipment will consume less fuel. However, it will take much more time to trim a lawn with such a tool as if you were using a **trimmer** with a 25cc engine. With a low capacity comes a low speed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the other hand, **trimmer**s with straight shafts are considered a better option for taller users. Also, such models are usually more powerful and suitable for maintaining large areas. Also, a tool with the straight shaft allows for working for extended periods. The downside is that this type of **string** **trimmer**s comes at a higher price tag compared to devices with curved shafts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The brushless motor powers the Greenworks PRO 80V engine. The design of the **trimmer** is straight and made of an aluminum shaft, which provides ergonomics and balance while trimming. The trigger can be adjusted to Variable Speed to provide more control over the cutting power. The overall construction of the Greenworks PRO 80V is lightweight yet extremely durable, which makes it easy to maneuver without having to compromise on the strength.

-   In line with these objectives, this Tanaka **string** **trimmer** weighs just 10.1 pounds upon being assembled. This machine begins immediately with the S-Start feature and a Walbro carburetor. It has anti-vibration mounts and a lengthy 54-inch drive shaft to reduce fatigue from constantly bending. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Trimmer line ranges in size from about .065-inch to .170-inch. Large diameter line requires a properly sized **trimmer** head and more power to operate. Be sure to check the weed wacker’s operator’s manual for compatibility before attempting to load a new size. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   If you are still on the fence about which commercial weed eater to purchase, we highly recommend our best overall choice.

If you are looking for something a little smaller, the Remington RM25C Curved Shaft Gas String Trimmer is a smart choice. It’s our pick for the best value, and it features all of the same features as the top choice in a smaller, less expensive package. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, we have the Dewalt DCST925M1. This weed eater is the best for a mid-range job. With a nice **trimmer** head, solid steel construction, and its long-lasting battery, this is a brush cutter that works well for most people. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some **string** **trimmer**s require pre-cut lengths of line. Others use either one or two long lengths of line that wind onto a spool. You may need to remove the spool from the housing or load it in place. Refer to the owner’s manual or manufacturer’s website for detailed instructions for your specific **trimmer** brand and model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Husqvarna 324L Cutting Path Gas String Trimmer is our pick for the best overall commercial weed eater. It has a 25cc, 4-cycle engine that can spin the line up to 7,000 revolutions per minute (RPM). The 18-inch **trimmer** head makes short work of any tall grass and weeds, and the easy to use bumper feed releases line when you tap it on the ground for ultimate control. It’s lightweight at only 5 pounds, and it features a translucent fuel tank so you always know how much fuel remains. The air purge primer bulb removes air from the system, and it’s easy to reload the line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Remington RM25C Curved Shaft Gas String Trimmer is our pick as the best commercial weed eater for the money. It has a powerful 25cc, 2-stroke engine with QuickStart technology that makes it much easier to pull the **string**. It has a 16-inch **trimmer** head to quickly cut through the tallest grass, and a curved shaft makes it easier to see where the blade is cutting. The dual-line bump feed is twice as effective as a single line and is easy to control. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The RM2560 gas **string** **trimmer** is another powerful and versatile equipment both for small and large compounds. It has a sleek design and a comfortable handle. You can easily trim your lawn with this Remington tool because it cuts grass up to 16 inches. The length of this device is better than that of standard **trimmer**s that cut only a few inches at a go. Thus, with this equipment, you will have to spend much less time taking care of your garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If there is one thing that everyone likes, it is a green well-trimmed lawn. A well-maintained compound makes the entire household look neat and clean. Some people delegate the trimming work to special services, while others like doing maintaining their backyards by themselves. If you are among those who love gardening and taking care of your lawn, you need a good gas **string** **trimmer** to perform the job effectively. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Starting the Husqvarna 324L is extremely easy. You do not have to keep pulling the cord to flood the engine anymore. All you need is a single pull and the engine will start by itself. The Husqvarna 324L weighs just about 11 pounds; while it might be lightweight, the **trimmer** provides a lot of power while maintaining maneuverability as well. Even though 4-stroke engine weed **trimmer**s are considered heavy, the Husqvarna 324L is quite light. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Every **string** **trimmer**, whether cordless, plug-in electric, or gas-powered, has limitations on line size. Line diameter is a good indicator of durability. Assuming the same material and shape, a thicker line lasts longer. Thicker line also costs more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is easy to open the **trimmer** head. The manufacturer has designed it in a way that everyone can open and replace the detail without the help of an expert. Also, I love this equipment because it has a translucent fuel tank that gives you full control over the machine. You can quickly tell when you are running out of fuel and gas up the device in time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Poulan Pro PR28SD model allows some useful attachments. You may install either a pole saw, a blower, an edger, a cultivator, a **trimmer**, or a brush cutter. These options make the equipment ideal for anyone who looks for a durable multipurpose device. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of our top picks, the Husqvarna 324L is by far the lightest at only 5.1 pounds. That’s even light for an electric **string** **trimmer**. 3. Is a straight or curved shaft **string** **trimmer** better? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When buying a car, the first place you will look is under the hood. With **string** **trimmer**s, it’s all the same because the primary focus should be put on the power of an engine. You need to figure out the produced horsepower and the number of the cylinders of the selected model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike the common **trimmer**s that require you to combine fuel and oil, this Husqvarna 967055801 model uses unleaded gas only. The gadget has a powerful four-cycle 25cc engine. Thus, it can handle a large lawn without a problem. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **trimmer** from Craftsman is another option with a 4-cycle engine, but this one is even more powerful than the Husqvarna 324L.

For extra tough grass and commercial-grade jobs, the Craftsman CMXGTAMD30SA might be the best choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The handle of electric **string** **trimmer**s might be fixed. Or you might get some that can be pivoted as well as extended. So choose one based on your needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

You don’t have to wait for a battery to recharge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like most of high-quality gas **string** **trimmer**s, this Remington model has a super-fast starting technology. It will begin working immediately, as you press the button.

-   Better materials, like reinforced composite nylon have a greater more cutting power and breakage resistance.

Other **trimmer** **string**s are made from non-nylon polymers or copolymers for added strength. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You need to start the engines with the help of the manual recoil, which makes use of the fuel delivery system to get the engine running immediately.

The handle assembly can also be folded down for easier storage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The line of the weed eater is, well, what eats the weed. When picking a **string** **trimmer**, you should look at what type of line they will use. They can vary in weight.

-   For battery-powered **trimmer**s, our primary goal was to assess power and run time. For gas-engine **trimmer**s, we wanted to judge whether the power they provided was offset by their noise and weight. For all **trimmer**s, we wanted to see if each machine was comfortable and well balanced, and whether its line feed was finicky or robust. We found that especially when we were using the machines to cut down weeds, the growth was so tough, it took an immediate toll on the **trimmer**’s line, causing us to use the bump feed line mechanism at twice or three times the rate that we would in normal grass trimming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The downside to the Honda HHT35SLTAT is that it quickly goes through gas, which is not surprising considering the engine size, but it would often run out when we were far from a refill source.

At 17 pounds, it can get quite heavy after a short time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

The rapid feed is convenient for users. Pros The Echo is lightweight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note that we haven’t yet tested the Craftsman WS2400, due in part to supply-chain issues and shipping delays.
