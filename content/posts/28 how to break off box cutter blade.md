## 28 Facts How To Break Off Box Cutter Blade | how to snap off blade utility knife
-   This splendid utility knife with the strange name “Fat Max” has a nice thinness about it, being as it is just as wide as necessary. Apart from the **blade** slide, it is made completely out of metal, which means that it has a nice heft in your hand and is extremely durable as well. The spring loaded self locking mechanism, in combination with the notched feeder, is reliable in use and continues to hold the **blade** in position even when cutting really thick materials. The fastening clip for holding it safely in your jacket pocket can be pulled free from the **blade** guide (is a little resistant at first, try applying a little oil) and the groove that has been manufactured into the clip subsequently used to break off the used **blade** segments efficiently. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Snap-off knives are used together with segmented snap-off **blade**s. When the knife needs to change **blade**s, it is easy to open the hilt and insert a new **blade**. When the **blade** becomes blunt, a new edge is simply snapped off, so you always have a sharp working tool. We recommend using Sollex knife **blade**s, which will make any knife really sharp and durable. Sollex **blade**s are made of special German ice-hardened steel and cut through most materials without resistance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tip For a utility knife with a snap-off **blade**, such as the Kobalt utility knife, instructions to change the **blade** are very similar, explains Wood Magazine, except that you can get up to 13 sharp tips on a **blade** before it needs to be completely replaced. The snap-off **blade** easily retracts and extends by pushing on a button. When the tip is dull, it can be broken off with a pair of pliers. Take hold of the dull **blade** just above one of the break-off points and gently and carefully snap it off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Snap off knives are very popular because they have such a simple and robust design. However, if you work in the food industry or feel unsure about using knives with **blade**s, choose a suitable safety knife. Sollex offers many different safety knives that completely replace the **blade** knife if you so wish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The fixed or folding **blade** utility knife is popular for both indoor and outdoor use. One of the most popular types of workplace utility knife is the retractable or folding utility knife (also known as a Stanley knife, box **cutter**, or by various other names). These types of utility knives are designed as multi-purpose cutting tools for use in a variety of trades and crafts. Designed to be lightweight and easy to carry and use, utility knives are commonly used in factories, warehouses, construction projects, and other situations where a tool is routinely needed to mark cut lines, trim plastic or wood materials, or to cut tape, cord, strapping, cardboard, or other packaging material. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   With a snap-off knife, if a user needs to cut through something thicker, the flexibility is there. A user can extend additional segments of the snap-off **blade** and leave the knife locked for a thicker cut. It’s important to note this is not recommended from a safety perspective, as users should not extend the snap-off **blade** past the score line, but individual users have been known to use a snap-off this way. To maintain safety, solid **blade**s, which come in both 9-millimeter and 18-millimeter versions, are ideal for applications that need extended **blade** exposure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   By the 19th century the fixed-**blade** utility knife had evolved into a steel-**blade**d outdoors field knife capable of butchering game, cutting wood, and preparing campfires and meals. With the invention of the backspring, pocket-size utility knives were introduced[when?] with folding **blade**s and other folding tools designed to increase the utility of the overall design. The folding pocketknife and utility tool is typified by the Camper or Boy Scout pocketknife, the Swiss Army Knife, and by multi-tools fitted with knife **blade**s. The development of stronger locking **blade** mechanisms for folding knives—as with the Spanish navaja, the Opinel, and the Buck 110 Folding Hunter[citation needed]—significantly increased the utility of such knives when employed for heavy-duty tasks such as preparing game or cutting through dense or tough materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Automatic **blade** feed from magazine containing 6 extra **blade**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another utility knife often used for cutting open boxes consists of a simple sleeve around a rectangular handle into which single-edge utility **blade**s can be inserted. The sleeve slides up and down on the handle, holding the **blade** in place during use and covering the **blade** when not in use. The **blade** holder may either retract or fold into the handle, much like a folding-**blade** pocketknife. The **blade** holder is designed to expose just enough edge to cut through one layer of corrugated fibreboard, to minimize chances of damaging contents of cardboard boxes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A utility knife is any type of knife used for general manual work purposes.[1] Such knives were originally fixed-**blade** knives with durable cutting edges suitable for rough work such as cutting cordage, cutting/scraping hides, butchering animals, cleaning fish scales, reshaping timber, and other tasks. Craft knives are small utility knives used as precision-oriented tools for finer, more delicate tasks such as carving and papercutting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
