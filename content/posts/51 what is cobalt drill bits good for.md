## 51 Facts What Is Cobalt Drill Bits Good For | Tips for Using Cobalt Drill Bits
-   Multi-material **drill** bits are similar in construction to masonry bits, with a carbon steel body and brazed carbide tip. The main difference from a regular masonry **drill** bit is that a multi-material carbide tip receives special sharpening to **drill** through metal. The main advantage of the multi-material bit is that it can pierce through several materials simultaneously, including brick and concrete. These **drill**ing conditions would ruin the tip sharpness of a regular metal **drill** bit, making this variety a necessity for heavy-duty applications. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing the wrong **drill** bit can result in workplace losses, such as ruining your workpiece or creating inefficiencies with multiple bits. Therefore, before beginning any project, it is crucial to identify the **drill**ing conditions. Once this step has been completed, it will be easier to determine which variety of **drill** bit you should use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Love the **drill** bits. They are the best on the market. Just wish whoever packaged them could count. I ordered and paid for 10, but got 9. How can I prove that? Thomas W - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because of the power and efficiency of **cobalt** **drill** bits, they aren’t necessary right for all types of **drill**s – and certain types of **drill**s definitely aren’t right for them. You should also be wary of the surface you’re **drill**ing into: Steel and **cobalt** **drill** bits might not be right for wood or other softer substances. Using the wrong materials greatly increases your chances of accidents and injury. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black oxide bits last up to 50% longer than standard HSS bits. They offer superior durability and speed. Many pros find they get years of use from them and consider black oxide bits the best general-purpose **drill** bits you can buy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Titanium **drill** bits are HSS bits that have been coated with titanium nitride (TiN) using a process similar to electroplating. TiN is a ceramic material that increases the surface hardness of the bit and provides a thermal barrier by reducing friction. This results in increased production rates, corrosion resistance, and 3 to 6 times longer tool life. Titanium bits are suitable for **drill**ing iron, steel, aluminum, magnesium, and wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cobalt bits do not have a coating. Instead, they’re produced with a mixture of steel alloy and **cobalt**. The **cobalt** is used to increase the strength of the bit. It also keeps the bit from getting too hot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The HSS Twist Drill Bit Cobalt is manufactured to DIN 338. The **drill** bit is Type N (flute angle) with a 135-degree tip and a diameter tolerance of h8. Active cutting and perfect centring without wandering are achieved by the pointed split-point tip. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A) TTP HARD **cobalt** **drill** bits are M35 **cobalt** **drill** bits. This means that they contain approximately 5% **cobalt**. This will allow the **drill**s to **drill** the majority of hard metals including stainless steel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Prices vary depending on the manufacturers of the bits. You have to pay more for **cobalt** **drill** bits than titanium. Cobalt bits are more durable, so you may pay more for them, but you’ll likely get an extended lifespan from them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drill bits come in a wide range of shapes and sizes, and are available in a variety of materials and coatings. Most tooling and machining operations have a **drill** bit that’s designed specifically for the task. Here’s a quick overview of several types of **drill** bits, materials and design types. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Compared to regular M2 tool steel, M35 and M42 are indeed super. Where "regular" M2 HSS comes in at a hardness of around 62 HRC, M35 starts at 65 HRC and M42 measures 67 or so. That doesn't seem like much difference, but together with **cobalt**'s greater heat resistance, it supports higher cutting speeds—depending on the brand and whether the **drill** is coated, this might mean 50% faster spindle RPM and commensurately higher feedrates. Either way, be sure to follow the cutting tool manufacturer's recommendations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cobalt and titanium **drill** bits have various similarities. They can even be used for many of the same applications. But their slight differences are what can make a major impact on your project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ve already got the right **drill** bits from Wasatch Steel, but proper protective gear and other equipment is also vital. Cobalt **drill** bits are even more powerful than most, and you need to be protected in case anything happens to go wrong. Goggles, gloves, proper shoes and proper covering garments are a necessity – if you’re on the fence about whether a certain piece of protective clothing is really necessary, just assume it is. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The hardness of M35 **drill** bit is usually HRC65-67, and the hardness of M42 **drill** bit is usually HRC67-70. The price of M35 material is lower than that of M42. These two high-speed steels are more durable than the general-purpose HSS6542 or HSS9341 (hardness 63~66HRC), but the toughness is reduced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All of the different types of **drill** bits in these categories are based on High-Speed Steel (HSS), a designation you’ll see often when reading about bits. But the treatments those HSS bits receive to make them black oxide, titanium, or **cobalt** make marked changes in the performance, intended use, and longevity. Learning the differences helps you avoid wasting money and using the wrong bits for the wrong materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing the right **drill** bit for the task is an important part of any project or application. Whether it’s matching the appropriate bit to the substrate material, getting the right match for the depth and diameter of the hole, or even the volume of work needed, the right choice can extend the life of your **drill** bits. This in turn helps to improve productivity by allowing you to get more done with each **drill** bit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   High-speed steel is alloyed with 5-8% **cobalt** to create **cobalt** **drill** bits. These are the best **drill** bits for metal due to their high resistance to the massive heat generated when **drill**ing through highly abrasive and/or hard materials such as treated stainless steel, titanium, and cast iron. Unlike the TiN coating, **cobalt** is found throughout the entire material which makes it great for high production work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These are very high quality **drill** bits at a great price. I am a machinist and buy bits from a lot of different sources, but much prefer these in the sizes Spruce has available. Brian - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black and gold **drill** bits are manufactured by coating high-speed steel in a combination of black and gold oxide. The design provides better rust prevention performance and offers a unique appearance that stands out from standard black oxide **drill** bits. These bits are also cost effective and designed for general applications. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A common challenge for contractors is choosing the right **drill** bit given different **drill**ing conditions. Whether it’s plastic, wood, metal or concrete, every material that is **drill**ed into offers a unique set of challenges. Regardless of the **drill** a contractor uses, **drill**ing will only be efficient and accurate if the proper **drill** bit is selected for the job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   They can be used with softer materials, but with caution. For example, if you’re using **cobalt** **drill** bits on wood, you run the risk of splitting the wood. This is because **cobalt** **drill** bits do not have a brad (a sharp piece on the end that stops the **drill** bit from slipping). You can split or damage your project if you use a **drill** bit that is too tough. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **cobalt** **drill** bits are reasonably priced compared to offerings in the local hardware stores and Fastenal. I have not used them enough to know if they last longer. Barry S - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tenyu Tools Co., Ltd. has 10 years of experience in the production of has **drill** bits. Our company has a complete quality management system and after-sales service guarantee. Actively and enthusiastically solve all kinds of **drill**ing problems for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Carbide (Carb) is the hardest and most brittle of the **drill** bit materials. It’s used mostly for production **drill**ing where a high-quality tool holder and equipment is used. It should not be used in hand **drill**s or even **drill** presses. These **drill** bits are designed for the most demanding and hardest materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Titanium **drill** bits are produced by coating high-speed steel with a thin layer of titanium nitride. The titanium coating increases the **drill** bit’s surface hardness, lowers friction coefficient and offers increased corrosion protection. These bits last longer than standard metal **drill** bits and are suitable for general applications, such as **drill**ing through wood, plastic or metal. They also perform well on stainless steel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   They work well with harder types of wood. They can also be used on plastic and PVC. They work very well on steel, copper, brass, or aluminum materials, too. They work well in metal cutting machines, **drill**ing precise holes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for only the strongest materials for your custom steel project, **cobalt** **drill** bits are for you. Made with a small percentage of **cobalt** fused in with high-speed steel, these bits are naturally stronger and more heat-resistant than typical **drill** bits due to the infusion of the **cobalt**. Some **cobalt** **drill** bits can even withstand temperatures up to 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I ordered two #30 Bits in case one went dull. I had to **drill** out 96 rivets in a Cessna. No problem and I never needed the second bit. I center punched each rivet and the bit never wandered and it grabbed perfectly. Bob - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **drill** bits made of M35 and M42 materials are called **cobalt** **drill** bits. Because of their high hardness, good toughness and reasonable price, they are used as special stainless steel **drill** bits in the machining industry. Choose a **drill** bit between the two. When conditions permit, the M42 **drill** bit is preferred. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking towards durability, you’ll be better off getting a **cobalt** **drill** bit. You need to keep in mind that the price of a bit sharpener puts up the price. You can buy titanium **drill**s buts for a far lower price. If a price is an important factor, then titanium **drill** bits will serve the purpose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because of their durability and cost, most Pros don’t use **cobalt** **drill** bits for general purpose use. The extra hardness lets manufacturers make the flutes smaller as a percentage of the total thickness, increasing the strength of the bits. You can also sharpen them without losing cutting effectiveness. Cobalt bits cost more than TiN or Black Oxide bits, but many Pros find value in the toughness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cobalt **drill** bits are manufactured with high-speed steel and five per cent **cobalt** in their composition. Due to **cobalt**’s hardness and high-heat resistance, these bits are particularly useful when **drill**ing into hard materials like stainless steel and cast iron. Cobalt **drill** bits are the longest lasting and most durable products available on the market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The differences emerge from the way these **drill** bits are made. Cobalt and titanium don’t behave quite the same. Cobalt and titanium coatings make **drill** bits behave differently from each other. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If a shorter **drill** bit can do the job, it’s a good option. Shorter **drill** bits are more accurate and because they’re more rigid they don’t break as often. This helps keep workers on task and the project on schedule. Shorter **drill** bits are also better in tighter, more confined areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cobalt **drill** bits are more expensive, but they offer good value for money. Cobalt bits can be sharpened, which means they can be used extensively. They’re also made tough, meaning they will not quickly fade out. They’re golden in color, making them easy to spot amongst your tools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If discussing power tools Drill bits are an important feature. The most durable **drill** bits are **cobalt** and those coated with titanium. There are a few notable differences between **cobalt** and titanium **drill** bits. These can make a difference for your project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These are very sharp, great **drill** bits. I wish the size stampings were a little better (some are readable, some are not), but the actual **drill** bit cutting quality is amazing. Ray A - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Titanium **drill** bits come in different varieties. They are not actually made of titanium – their core is steel. They’re actually coated in different types of titanium. Titanium Nitride coating (TiN) is durable and tough. It is also able to withstand high temperatures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s tougher to overheat **cobalt** **drill** bits than virtually any other form, but it’s still possible. In fact, the larger concern in these cases can often be the **drill** itself rather than the **drill** bit – **cobalt** **drill** bits often stand up to temperature for much longer than a standard **drill**. In either case, be wary of the potential for overheating, and take proper precautions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cobalt is great for repeated **drill**ing of fiberglass. Lasts longer than other bits. Bob T - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Manufacturers heat HSS bits to 950 degrees Fahrenheit, creating a black oxide finish that resists rust and corrosion. This reduces friction between bit and workpiece, thereby speeding up the **drill**ing process. Bits made with a black oxide coating are suitable for work on steel, copper, aluminum, brass, oak, maple, MDF, pine, PVC, polycarbonate, acrylic, ABS, nylon, and composite materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As to the question “when should a **cobalt** **drill** bit be used," the answer is straightforward: anywhere you would use an HSS **drill**. Cobalt, however, will in most cases last longer than its less wear and heat-resistant cousin, and as we've seen, run much faster besides. The only caveat is that **cobalt** **drill**s, due to their greater hardness, are more brittle than HSS. The user must therefore take extra care to align them properly and avoid the radial tool pressures that might occur when **drill**ing into intersecting holes (hydraulic manifolds, for example) and angled surfaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Titanium bits are great for general purpose **drill**ing in a production environment because they **drill** quickly. The TiN coating also helps chips flow thru the flutes which is helpful because some materials – like aluminum – adhere to bits more than others. However, once the tip is dulled, it won’t regain it’s cutting edge without being recoated in titanium nitride. It usually makes more sense to replace rather than recoat them. So even though they are harder than **cobalt**, their edge is only skin-deep. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The titanium **drill** bit is a better choice for soft materials, like soft metals, wood, and plastic. The type of titanium coating also makes a difference. Titanium carbonitride coating can handle tougher materials than titanium nitride coating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The metal sheets are fine. The **drill**s are fine. And the rivets are fine. All good, thank you. Bob C - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Which **drill** bit is better for you, depends on what materials you’re going to be **drill**ing shortly? If you will be working with hard metals, like cast iron and stainless steel then **cobalt** bit is the bit for you. Its superior durability and the ability to sharpen the bit makes it the right choice. If you’re going to be working with softer metals and wood, then you won’t go wrong with a titanium **drill** bit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To get the best out of **cobalt** **drill** bit, you’ll need to invest in a good sharpening tool. There’s no point in throwing the **cobalt** bit away once it gets dull. Instead, you must re-sharpen it as much as possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As always the quality of the product is excellent but I ordered two **drill**s of the same size and neither was the right one. However one was mismarked by the manufacturer. The size difference was obvious to the eye. This was the first time in over 25 years that this has happened and the service you get from Aircraft Spruce is great. Gary M - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Titanium **drill** bits are heat resistant up to 1500F. The coating acts as a barrier between other types of metal. They are tough and able to **drill** into hard materials. The coating makes them heavy-duty, durable, lasting longer than a standard **drill** bit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Today, there is an endless selection of **drill** bits available on the market. While the base of most **drill** bits is composed of high-speed steel, many specialized bits are combined and coated with a variety of different alloys. Having a better understanding of these performance characteristics will make it easier to select the correct **drill** bit for each job that comes your way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
