## 63 Reference List: How To Strip Paint From Concrete Block | Will Wd-40 Remove Paint From Concrete
-   Paint is often used to change the usually gray color of concrete. We see concrete block walls **paint**ed as a solid backdrop or a colorful mural. Concrete patios, basement floors, and garage floors are transformed by **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Removing **paint** from concrete can be a troublesome project. Concrete is porous and rough, creating a textured surface to which **paint** easily adheres. Muriatic acid works very well at removing stains and **paint** from concrete, but can etch the surface if it is left on for too long or proportioned incorrectly. Muriatic acid will damage skin and clothes, so wear protective equipment at all times and work in well-ventilated areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This method uses Baking soda as the scouring agent that removes the **paint**. It’s another method that is considered more environmentally friendly as there isn’t any use for chemicals and does minimal damage to the concrete below! You will need a specialised blasting unit (a local hardware store may be able to rent this out to you, as well as the baking soda. We would recommend checking with the same store to see if they have the amount of baking soda you would need. Again, make sure you’re wearing the correct safety equipment such as goggles, gloves and a respiratory mask! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If there is a cinder block wall construction around your home you may, unfortunately, wake up to find graffiti sprayed on the wall. Depending on where you live, city ordinances will state the specific time period you have to remove the graffiti. Although soap and water will not generally remove the spray **paint**, there are some stronger products you can use to remove the **paint** form your cinder blocks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting concrete block walls helps to protect the concrete from wear and tear. It also extends the life of the concrete by preventing further damage. Proper preparation ensures an even **paint** application that will resist peeling and flaking. A concrete sealing primer prevents moisture from leaching out of the blocks and weakening the **paint** - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To remove old **paint** stains from concrete you’ll need a wire cup brush and a drill. We also used Dawn soap and hot water, but I don’t think the soap is completely necessary. Up to you on if you want to use it or try getting those stains up without it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Again, use your wide-wire brush to scrub off the loosened **paint**. Continue until no more **paint** comes off. If the stain was from latex **paint**, using warm soapy water as you scrub should be enough. Oil-based **paint**s are harder to clean, therefore, proceed to the next step. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One concrete block wall was completely bare, and water was leaking inside the restaurant. For this wall, we took a different strategy and **paint**ed on two coats of Lexon XP. This **paint** is thicker, and 2 coats of the Lexon XP coating helped to make the concrete block less permeable by water and ultimately more water-resistant. This coating stopped the water from leaking through the concrete block and onto the inside of the restaurant walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Concrete has porosity due to which it absorbs the liquid which is applied on the surface of Concrete. Due to the absorbing nature of concrete, it ships the layer of **paint** in it. That’s why it is very difficult to remove **paint** from concrete. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bare, untreated concrete can act like a sponge and absorb **paint** and other unwanted stains readily, making them harder to remove. Keeping your concrete protected with a sealer or floor wax will help prevent absorption, allowing you to remove the spot more easily. If you get to the spill early before the **paint** dries, you can often remove it using only detergent and water. If the **paint** has dried, you may be able to simply scrape it off the surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   *I say supposedly here because that’s what I’ve heard. Our **paint** never started to bubble, even after applying hot vinegar to it 4 different times. When we inevitably spill **paint** again, I’ll try this method when the **paint** is fresh. I think it would work well then. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blast the place that has been **paint**ed. Slowly work, keeping the dust about one and a half feet from the floor. Shift the dust over the **paint**ed area uniformly to ensure no color is left behind. Then the place is washed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Acrylic Block Fill primer can be applied over acrylic or latex **paint**ed concrete block when properly cleaned and prepared. Many manufactures also produce an oil base formula for use over oil base finishes.

-   of the concrete. There are two types of the grinding process, dry grinding, and wet grinding. Grinding will remove the **paint** from the surface of the concrete and make it smooth and clean . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’d prefer not to use chemicals, an orbital sander could work wonders. The sander removes the **paint** in two ways. It’s movement removes any loose **paint**, whilst the actual sandpaper or attachment itself removes the **paint** on the surface of the concrete. Make sure you’re wearing the proper safety equipment such as goggles, a breathing mask and gloves! If left in the same spot for too long, be aware that this could leave a circular pattern on the surface – keep the sander moving and be careful with how much pressure you use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Look for an environmentally friendly product that is safe to use on both indoor and outdoor concrete surfaces, such as Soy Gel Coatings Remover from Franmar Chemicals. These **strip**pers are typically thick gels that will stay active a long time after application. They also are biodegradable, low in odor, and free of caustic chemicals. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first step when preparing concrete block walls is pressure washing. Use a commercial style pressure washer and at least 2500 psi. A suitable spray pattern is the 15° degree tip held 12 inches from the surface. Any remaining loose **paint** will need to be removed manually. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. ProtectionConcrete blocks have tiny air holes and pockets that form a sponge-like surface, which means they soak up moisture easily. Concrete has a porous surface that collects and expels moisture, which can weaken or damage the **paint**. This is the leading cause of concrete **paint** failure. The extra absorption also can keep **paint** from adhering to the surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   is a common household cleaner that is widely used and applied to the affected area where the **paint** is to be removed from the surface.

-   For stubborn **paint** spills that can’t be removed by power washing or chemical **strip**pers, an effective and environmentally friendly alternative is soda blasting.
