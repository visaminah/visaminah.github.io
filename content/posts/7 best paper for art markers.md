## 7 Tips to Best Paper For Art Markers | Marker Paper
-   1. XL Mix Media Pad, 7″X10″ Side Wire http://amzn.to/2CTbcXB I love this sketchbook!! The **paper** is perfect for watercoloring, the sketchbook is compact and has a nice spiral binding. This sketchbook is very economical and I have bought these in multiple sizes now! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   4. Strathmore Mixed Media Pad http://amzn.to/2shiEel This sketchbook is great for brush lettering as there is a smooth vellum surface finish to the **paper**. The sketchbook is larger in size and great for quotes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   WHY PAPER IS IMPORTANT: To create beautiful dramatic brush calligraphy you need a sharp brush tip to be able to draw thin thin lines. And to maintain that sharp tip the **paper** you use needs to be super smooth to avoid any kind of fraying. Think tracing **paper**, wax **paper**, or smooth vellum. The **paper** needs to feel smooth to your touch when running your hands over it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As an artist, I love using my Tombow Dual brush pens because they are so versatile. I can use them for brush calligraphy and at the same time, I can use them for watercoloring. I use different **paper**s for both of these and I will address them separately below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. XL Mix Media Pad, 7″X10″ Side Wire http://amzn.to/2CTbcXB Yes! It’s the same **paper** I use for watercoloring. This **paper** works great for **markers** as well (as the sketchbook description says) and the **paper** is not too rough at all. There is some grain or tooth to the **paper** but it is very fine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Rhodia Black Dot Pad http://amzn.to/2D6psQ6 These were not the first **paper** pads I used when learning to brush letter. But boy did I fall in love with them instantly! The pads come in various different sizes but all of them have a very nice foldable staple binding. The Tombow pens literally glide over the **paper** and bring a new joy to your lettering. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   5. HP Printer Paper, Premium LaserJet Copy Paper, 32lb http://amzn.to/2D2YARN This is loose **paper**, not a sketchbook. I print all of my printables and worksheets on this **paper** as it has a nice smooth finish. This is also a great beginner budget-friendly **paper** as you can practice a ton with the sheets in one ream. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
