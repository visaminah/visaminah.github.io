To help you make the best choice for you and your home, we've rounded up 12 of the best **color**s to pair with the cool hue.

-   You can't go wrong with **gray** and white — pretty much ​any​ shade will look fabulous. Case in point, this bedroom corner by Hunker contributor Carrie Waller features **gray** and white **color**-blocked walls that act as a harmonious backdrop to the earthy decor. All you need in order to recreate this serene setup in your own home is a little paint, some low-adhesive masking tape, and a very steady hand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We have looked at the entire sartorial effect when wearing grey pants. Almost no single clothing item ever exists by itself, and it is impossible to see it as only as to do with grey pants. We have looked at how to build up a variety of possible looks starting from grey pants. These looks highlight the versatility of a neutral **color** base. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'One of my personal favorite **color** combos is **gray** and green. Specifically, look for cool, mid-tone **gray**s with blue undertones and cooler green hues (pistachio, light olive, etc) as well. This combination adds naturalism and freshness to whatever space it is in,' says Kazimierski. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As a final overall tip here another point we alluded to previously: try to find pieces that contain both **color**s as they’ll work especially well in outfits where you’re pairing them together elsewhere. For example, you could find ties featuring repp stripes in **gray** and red or perhaps a **gray** micro pattern on a red ground. And again, finding a suit in a shade of grey with an overcheck or perhaps a subtle stripe in a red tone will look especially smart in outfits featuring this **color** pairing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grey pants come in a range of different shades from lighter shades to darker shades, and while they are not as versatile as black pants can come close. This still makes it a very versatile **color**. In this post, we examine what to wear with grey pants and there is no quick answer. Let’s have a look at possible combinations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grey pants are a great item to have in your wardrobe. Neutral and versatile, yet still providing an edgy and unique look. As a general guideline, pairing darker grey pants with lighter **color**ed tops – and vice-versa – will always give you pleasing results. However, because of its flexibility, there aren’t too many restrictions that need to be put on what **color**s to pair with grey pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We can’t speak of the **color** wheel when it comes to grey, but we can follow some time-tested combinations. Add red to the mix for a **color** combination that just works. Black leather shoes, darker grey trousers, and a red shirt work together to create a fresh look that catches the eye every time. Add a black tie and you have modern elegance bar none. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At first glance, it may seem like there’s not much going on, grey may be considered too conservative or it can even come across as boring. That couldn’t be farther from the truth. Not only can grey be combined with many different **color**s, but since it comes in so many shades, it is also a great choice to pair with itself! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So, what **color**s work well with classic **gray**? Well, you can actually pair it with most hues, but there are a few that will undoubtedly look better than others — it just depends on what shade of **gray** you go with. Undertones will determine whether you'll have a harmonic duet or an out-of-key performance. If you're unsure about the undertone, just look at the paint description online or at your local hardware store. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're a **color** lover, it's a great idea to see a pale grey as a simple blank canvas from which you can mix and match **color**s of your choice. Like with many interior design rules, think odd numbers. In the above image, three **color**s are used together throughout the space in various shades - pink, blue and yellow – and it works to bring life to the neutral **gray** scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're able to recognize the **color** temperature of the **gray** you're considering, it will make choosing a complementary **color** palette that much simpler. Temperature or undertone incompatibility is almost always the culprit when **color**s don’t look “right” together. Consider charcoal **gray** as an alternative to black or dark blue: Charcoal **gray** can be the perfect dark **color** accent without being too deep or intense. It is also stunning as upholstered furniture or rugs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may not realize it, but depending on the specific shades that you choose, the combination of red and **gray** can result in a wide range of moods. A primary red with a cool **gray** can feel very lively and energetic, while a dark **gray** and a deep crimson red will feel completely different. In this boho living room, limewashed slate-**color**ed walls are paired with a red daybed, complete with matching pillows, and a red patterned area rug. The overall look is intoxicating and leaves a lasting impression. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue is another **color** that was made to go with grey. A versatile **color** – in countless shades – sure to provide you with limitless options. Blue and grey are two cool tones that go together, so naturally, it is difficult to get this pairing wrong. We’ve already covered navy blue – which is a perfect choice for balancing with contrast, but light pastel and medium sky blue hues can create looks just as pleasing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing lighter shades of grey to go with the blackest of blacks will give you a classic look. On the other hand – when pairing darker charcoal with black – don’t forget you can always add a pop of **color** here too for interest. A colourful or patterned scarf, tie, or shoes are just a few options to complete and balance a darker outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grey can be both dark and light-toned in the bottom wear department. The **color** can be highlighted by wearing black or grey **color**ed oxford or monk shoes for a sophisticated look. Whereas burgundy or brown **color**ed footwear will be a good choice for a casual outfit. Just try to match it up with the shirt’s **color**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now depending on you definition, these aren't strictly pants but they are a great option to pair with a Gray shirt. Plus, if you are after a lot more of a casual look that's easy to pull off but it is a classic go to, then you can't go far wrong with a Gray shirt and the ripped denim jeans look. Again, you can opt for Black jeans but personally a proper blue denim can be a really good look as the jeans actually pop the **color** whereas the Gray helps to neutralise it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The light **color**s like crisp white, light blue, beige, and navy blue shirts would look really well with grey textured pants. These **color**s will highlight the texture of the grey pants making them perfect for both a board meeting or a joyful night out with friends. Just pick your choice and pair it with dark-**color**ed footwear, and you are set for the day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remember to style up the rest of the outfit too, you don't just want to be concentrating on a **gray** shirt and what pants **color** combination to go with. Are you going to wear a jumper over the shirt, perhaps a blazer? Then what shoes are you going to wear? A pair of loafers for somewhere that's a bit more sophisticated, chuck on a pair of Chukka boots for a place that's a bit more casual. Even a pair of Jordans for a much more casual setting, there are a lot of options available to you to explore with Gray pants as they are so versatile in nature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This easy-to-use **gray** has a hint of beige or brown in it, making it warmer than your average **gray** hue. If you're concerned that **gray** would be too cold for your space, griege could be the answer. Learn the basics of tone: If you're able to recognize the **color** temperature of the **gray** you're considering, it will make choosing a complementary **color** palette that much simpler. Temperature or undertone incompatibility is almost always the culprit when **color**s don’t look “right” together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What **color** goes best with **gray**? This is a common question that many homeowners and renters ask themselves in an effort to shake things up. You see, **gray** is a popular **color** thanks to its versatile nature, ability to blend into the background if needed, and suitability to almost any design style. But that doesn't mean it's the most interesting hue on its own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pocket handkerchiefs, by common consent, are accent items. For this reason, steer clear of grey and black, but select white, cream, and red. Red is for the darker jacket and the lighter **color**s for light grey blazers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you opt for an all-grey outfit, you have the perfect backdrop for any statement piece you want to show off. A large pendant necklace would garner attention over a soft grey sweater, and a bright belt or pair of shoes would be an invited pop of **color** to an otherwise neutral outfit. Grey is the perfect companion for any bold accessory – it will highlight the special item instead of stealing the show. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pairing grey with other neutral tones can give you a very sleek outcome and shouldn’t be overlooked. Don’t think that the lack of **color** will make any outfit boring. Quite the contrary, grey paired with black, white, or tan can create a sharp look that is just as eye-catching as a bold print or bright accessory may be. Sometimes, less really is more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our next tip is that the more formal you want your outfit to be, the more it should focus on **gray** and less so on red. As mentioned previously, **gray** is a neutral **color** that helps to ground an outfit and is a staple of formal wear, whereas red is naturally bolder and should really best be used for accent pieces and accessories, especially to draw attention toward the face. Having one to three red accessories at least near the face is probably as much as you’re going to want and again, the darker the red the more formal it will become. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You must be shocked to see this option in the top 10 list of grey **color** pants matching shirt outfit ideas. But, trust the experts! You won’t be disappointed by trying out this look. Grey is always deemed to be such a dark **color** but its combination with floral print is an eye-opener. The floral print texture and light tones of the shirt will look fantastic because of their opposing tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This look is perfect for a semi-formal or business casual event. The white shirt is a classic, and the blue sport coat gives a pop of **color**. The sport coat also provides a great amount of contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now if you have read about what **color** shirt goes with Navy pants, then you will know that Navy Blue is also a great option for those wearing a Gray shirt. This is a nice level up from the playing it safely above, however, is not too out there either. This is a go-between for those who want to inject a bit of life and **color** into their outfit, but don't want to go too far with it either. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Elegance and sophistication, with a slight edgy demeanor is the key to making you stand out in the crowd. That can be possible with this gorgeous combination of a dark green shirt with grey pants. Pair it up with a smartwatch and dark-**color**ed shoes, and you are ready to take on the world. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to **color** pairings in menswear, perhaps few have been so commonly utilized by presidents, businessmen, Hollywood stars, and the common man alike as **gray** and red. The two hues play especially well off of each other, as the neutral **gray** provides a solid base, and the slightly bolder primary **color**, red, can draw a bit more attention. Read on for our top tips! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When choosing a specific **gray** shade for your room's **color** palette, you should start by choosing a tone of **color**. Warm **gray**s are slightly tinted with either orange, yellow, or red, making them appear a bit cozier—they may even look almost beige. Cooler-toned **gray**s have been cut with shades of blue, green, or purple. The resulting **gray** hue feels clean, crisp, and modern. True to its "neutral" title, **gray** really goes with almost every other **color**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's safe to say that **gray** works wonders with "neutral" shades, and brown is no exception. For instance, in this rustic bedroom by Jersey Ice Cream Co., soft **gray** wall **color** with a bit of texture plays well with the rich wood finishes used throughout (hello, accent wall!), resulting in a cozy and inviting space. Just remember to break up the dark, earthy hue with lighter textiles and furnishings to keep your setup from feeling too heavy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Great for a smart casual day outfit as it is quite a useful **color** to style. Light Blue shirts with light grey **color**ed pants give the wearer a smart-casual look fitting for sunny days. Or even you can suit up with a light blue button-down, dark **color**ed tie, and long overcoat for perfect business attire on winter days. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's definitely going to provide a sophistiacted and clean look finish. The only risk is of looking a bit boring **color** wise, if it is something where you are going out and there is going to be a lot of fun to be had, this can be a bit bland. That said, it is a great look, and can look pretty smart as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Navy is another versatile **color** that happens to work effortlessly with grey. Two classic, sophisticated **color**s that go great together. Pairing medium to light grey tones with contrasting dark navy hues can easily create either a professional or casual look that would work well for many occasions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many **color** options to go with for dark grey pants matching shirt ideas. You can choose white, black, or burgundy shirts for a perfect formal look. Or you can go with floral print, striped or pink **color**ed shirts for a smart casual look. Grey is one of those **color** tones that goes well with almost all shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At first glance, pairing **color**s together might seem easy, but it's a delicate art that can take decades to perfect—just ask any interior designer. The easiest, of course, is to start with neutral tones, but even these have intricacies that can be hard to get right. While it's true that **gray** paint **color**s typically pair well with anything, some hues are better suited together than others. Much of this science has to do with undertones, which can help inform your decision when picking a paint **color** or accents for your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This combination is a bit unusual, giving the wearer a positive surprise element in the midst of common fashion sense. The stylish checked shirts in light **color** with dark checkers suit the grey shade pants perfectly. With this combination, you will find a look that will work for you from the beginning of the day till night. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The fiery combination of grey **color**ed pants with different **color** shirts makes it a very versatile outfit option in the fashion world. Grey is a **color** that is not always the first choice but never fails to make men stand out, regardless of the occasion. So, go and get yourself one of these grey **color** pants with a matching shirt and be ready to shine wherever you go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thanks to its neutrality, grey is also the perfect choice when you want to add something bold to your outfit. Since it is subtle on its own, a bold or bright print can work wonderfully with a solid grey item. It also pairs well with textured materials – such as a chunky knit or fabric in a patterned weave. This neutral tone can even help you get away with a unique or unusual cut that could come across as tacky or unfashionable in another **color**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black and white are clear choices when selecting the base pieces for a wardrobe, but adding grey into the mix will give you an even wider range of options for putting outfits together. Grey – like black and white – is a neutral tone that can be paired nicely with just about any rainbow **color**. Plus, it is less harsh than black, so it can easily be used to create looks from casual, to classic, to very high-end. Grey is a colour that should be essential to everyone’s wardrobe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Belts are a good way of adding a splash of **color** interest to break up a monochrome swathe. Three belts should do the trick here – a black belt, a white one, and a mid-grey one. These can complement and contrast all shades of grey. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just like checked shirts, striped shirts also work in the favor of highlighting the gent’s body structure. Complete the look by wearing dark **color**ed footwear and black aviators during the day. This look will work great on both a date and a normal office day. Striped shirts are one of the best options for the light grey pant matching shirt outfits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let’s move now from suits into slightly more casual combinations of sport coats and odd trousers. A prime example here that would be particularly good for the colder fall and winter seasons would be a burgundy sport coat paired with **gray** flannel pants. A burgundy sport coat is always going to be somewhat eye-catching of course, though certainly less so than a bolder true red **color** but again, the **gray** flannel trousers will help to ground and neutralize the outfit somewhat so it won’t look too bold overall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Returning to fall and winter outfits for a moment, but going even more casual, you could substitute the sport coat for a sweater or cardigan in red. You’ll most likely be able to find slightly brighter **color** options here than just maroons or burgundies, and you could also consider different styles such as a tennis sweater or shawl-collared cardigan. Other options would include a v-neck sweater, again, paired with a red tie or changing up the **color**s in the different elements, and going with a **gray** sweater with red trousers or a **gray** sweater with a red patterned shirt and neutral trousers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Looking first at the monochrome look, a good idea is to have a shirt to match each grey in the pants that you choose. This provides an immediate variety of elegant, understated looks. Add a black shirt as well. If you wanted to you could leave it there and never have a problem, but **color** is always good. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grey is a neutral **color** that draws on mixtures of the three primary **color**s to be formed. It lies between black, which has none of the **color**s at all, and white which contains complete saturation of all **color**s. Black and white, like pure greys, are achromatic and therefore pair well. If you look at web **color**s you will see that perfect greys have equal amounts such as light grey which is #D3D3D3. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In **color** theory, **gray** represents neutrality and balance; it's the shade that brings white and black together. It is seen as the perfect neutral, moderating brighter hues and pulling **color** palettes together. Basically, it's an easy **color** to work with, which means you really can't go wrong. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'A silver **gray** looks fantastic with a deep teal or pastel turquoise,' shares Chris Campbell, Partner at The Charming Bench Company (opens in new tab). 'Various hues of aquamarine with black and white accents give a timeless aesthetic that looks contemporary but also classic.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This blue button-up creates a lot of contrast with grey jeans. You’ll also notice that the stripes are red and light blue. Having a mixture of **color**s creates a pattern, which adds interest to the outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'When using charcoal **gray**, my top recommendation is to use plenty of white in the space,' says Baldwin. 'This contrast will help brighten it up and prevent your space from feeling too dark.' According to Baldwin, this is important for lighter **gray** as well, but even more so for charcoal grey. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may associate **gray** with being a safe **color** choice, but that needn't be the case. In fact, **gray** comes into its own when paired with a brighter hue. Just take this eye-catching kitchen design by Mainstreet Stockholm as proof. The dark teal cabinetry paired with pale **gray** plaster walls and ceiling are a visual treat. ​::chef's kiss::​ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And relax. The combination of **gray** and green evokes some really relaxing vibes, making the pair an ideal **color** scheme for bedrooms. Complement the look even further by weaving in green accents — such as the books, plants, and artwork seen in this tranquil scene. We recommend forest, emerald, and sage tones, to name a few. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With light grey pants, always go for darker shirt **color** combination to make smart contrast of **color**s. You can choose black, maroon or dark blue shirt for perfect look. Also, you can go for printed shirts in dark **color** for best casual look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dusty pink is a versatile **color** that goes with most shades of **gray**, but we love to see it paired with a light stone-**color**ed hue, as shown in this living room styled by Mainstreet Stockholm. The muted warm and cool tones balance each other out, resulting in a functional space that looks and feels oh-so dreamy and luxe. Highlight the combo further with statement art, decor, and accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black, white, and **gray** is a classic trio that can work with a range of different aesthetics, from contemporary to traditional, depending on how you style it. For instance, in this modern-meets-industrial living room, the **color** scheme hits all the right notes. The **gray** textural accent wall and light **gray** wood flooring add dreamy depth and anchor the open layout, while the black accent chair, firebox, and stair rails punctuate the space and add a bit of edge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Last, but certainly not least, one of our favorite **color** combinations is **gray** and terra cotta. And with one look at this stunning living room design spotted on These Four Walls, it's easy to see why. The statement ceiling painted in burnt orange is the perfect complement to the tall silvery, **gray** walls (the matching suspension lighting doesn't hurt either), and the pops of green, navy, and charcoal accent **color**s provide even more for the eyes to feast on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The key to a great match lies in coordinating the tones. Warm **gray** shades go well with other warm-toned **color**s, like taupe, blush pink, butter yellow, and burnt orange. On the other hand, you can pair cool **gray** with other chill tones like navy blue, sage green, and cool whites. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Jackets should come in three **color**s. They are grey, black and navy blue. Jackets are better in darker **color**s so even the grey jacket should be on the dark side of the greyscale. A light leather jacket, though, does work well with dark jeans and a t-shirt for a casual look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As we mention in our guide to Pairing Gray and Blue, you can almost equally wear ensembles featuring **gray** suits and blue shirts as well as blue suits with **gray** shirts. However, the same really isn’t true when discussing **gray** and red. While you can certainly wear suits in different shades of grey with shirts that incorporate red, wearing a red suit with a **gray** shirt isn’t a look we’d recommend. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'Gray and pink is a great pairing. This often works best with darker, more serious **gray** tones and a lighter, airy pink. The contrasting hues play well off of each other and create a balance that exudes sophistication,' says Andre Kazimierski, CEO at Improovy Painters St Louis (opens in new tab). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may have noticed that **gray** has become one of the top neutral **color**s in the interior design world. While beige, tan, and white will always be great picks, decorating with **gray** grants homeowners design options they might not get with other neutrals, but there's always the question of choosing **color**s that go with **gray**. Gray can appear to be cool or warm, which makes a difference when it comes to selecting **color**s that live well with **gray**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gray shades often showcase blue undertones, making blue hues a great match. So follow the lead of this moody setup by Scandinavian Homes and dress up your silvery bedroom walls with a bold navy. Break up the drama-filled **color** scheme with pops of verdant green in the form of lighting, decor, and plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are living with the illusion that pink **color** is only for the females, then you cannot be more wrong. The combination of the pink **color** shirt is said to be one of the best choices for a light grey pant matching shirt option. This outfit will give you a more approachable and inviting look and will help you settle in a new environment with ease. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An olive green jacket works perfectly with grey jeans. Olive green and grey are both slightly muted **color**s, which makes this outfit a more subtle and low key outfit when talking about **color**s. However, it is not a subtle outfit. In fact, it is one with a lot of character. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether wearing a suit or a combination featuring a sport coat and odd trousers, you can of course, further enhance the **color** pairing by use of your accessories and your footwear. Consider perhaps oxblood shoes and red accessories like a carnation boutonniere and a pocket square with some red **color** tones. And if you’re feeling especially bold, something like a Winchester shirt featuring red and white stripes would fit the bill for these types of outfits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If painting a whole room isn't your thing, try bringing **gray** into your decor's existing **color** palette through accessories. A beautiful **gray** throw blanket or sleek **gray** coffee table can be just what your room needs to feel fresh and new. Have fun with **gray**: It’s been years since **gray** was considered bland or conservative. Even if you want a room packed with energy and personality, **gray** can be a great option. Funk it up with a lot of patterns and unique accents to add an extra dose of playfulness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you are looking for dark or light grey pant matching shirt options, a white shirt is always a winner. Whether it be a turtleneck or a crisp button-down, white shirts are meant to fit perfectly well with grey pants. The shade of the grey **color** doesn’t matter, because this combination can never go wrong. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ties should be more muted than a cravat. It should be plain or striped and ideally not too broad, though if you are not going for a monochrome look the slightly broader ties can work. A special thought is a fishnet tie in a different **color**. By the interplay of the shirt **color** peeking through the holes in the tie netting, a very fetching effect can be achieved. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'My go-to **color**s to pair with **gray** in home decor are shades of green,' says Leonard Ang, CEO at iPropertyManagement (opens in new tab). 'It provides a sharp, clean effect, and the contrast between a charcoal grey and a bright green can really pop if the green is used in moderation.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, we have drawn together a closet of items from shoes to accessories that can work together in multiple ways to dress you stylishly. We did not mention but do now, that generally there should only be one additional **color** used outside the grey tones. Do not add more than one of red, blue, or yellow **color**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're a fan of tone-on-tone schemes, there is no better **color** to pair **gray** with than, well, **gray**. Follow the lead of this uber-chic bedroom design and get creative with wall paint to showcase your monochrome **color** idea. Here, both dark and light **gray** paint **color**s are layered to create a graphic accent wall behind the bed. The silvery linens complete the modern setup. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another match for grey that can’t be ignored is yellow. The most cheerful **color** on the spectrum is the perfect match for the muted tone that grey provides. The neutral grey can help tone down a very bright shade of yellow; in contrast, a sunny shade of yellow can provide the perfect lift to a toned-down grey. With so many possibilities, try and choose shades that complement each other well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There's a right shade of **gray** for any room, from the palest silver to dark charcoal. Designers love the chameleon-like hue for its ability to lean warm, cool, or simply strike the perfect balance between the two. The best **gray**s also change with the light throughout the day, adding depth and visual interest to your interior. Gray's neutral character also makes it the ideal partner for other **color**s. Whether you're looking to create a serene tone-on-tone environment or find a piece of furniture that'll really stand out, here are some of our favorite **color**s to pair with **gray**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'My favorite element to pair with light grey is gold,' says Randi Baldwin, interior designer and co-founder of Relaxing Decor (opens in new tab). 'I love implementing some gold light fixtures or other small decorative elements, such as side tables. I especially love light **gray** and gold in kitchens or bathrooms.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Toned-down shades of grey can make some otherwise “out there” garments acceptable. A plunging neckline or open back will look much posher in a neutral tone than a bright **color**. The neutral grey tone can also bring a more conservative feel to a super-short mini dress or pair of pants with cut-outs down the leg. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A mistake that many men make when first getting into menswear is to buy solid **color**ed dress shirts in dark jewel tones including maroon, often in an especially shiny satin finish. Not only will the contrast be a bit too overwhelming in a formal outfit, but it will also cheapen the ensemble overall if you are to wear a shirt like this. It would of course be more commonly seen in settings like a high school prom or perhaps a Scarface Halloween costume and those definitely aren’t the associations you’ll want to go for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Working within the same basic outfit mold as the last but going slightly less formal, you could exchange the charcoal **gray** suit for one in medium or even light **gray** and if you’d like to add an extra element of style, you could even consider a suit that incorporates both **color**s. For example, a glen check suit that features a red overplaid. This would be further accented by wearing the red tie for a lower contrast outfit and especially good for grey suits that have cooler tones, you could also consider a patterned red tie that incorporates some blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the first image of **gray** that comes to mind is cold and industrial, then you're in for a treat. A wide variety of hues means there's a **gray** out there for every home—it just might take a little bit of trial and error to discover what shade suits your space the best. Consider greige: This easy-to-use **gray** has a hint of beige or brown in it, making it warmer than your average **gray** hue. If you're concerned that **gray** would be too cold for your space, griege could be the answer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red trouser options to pair with a grey sweater would include things like chino pants or even corduroys. Depending on the boldness of the red **color**, you could verge into the territory of go to hell pants if you so chose. Further driving home, the **color** pairing with an overall casual feel would be adding something like grey suede shoes to the mix here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Baldwin recommends using a large variety of shades of **gray** in your decor. For example, if you have a light **gray** couch, add medium and dark **gray** pillows as well as a charcoal **gray** throw blanket. 'You'll also want to use plenty of white to keep your space looking bright,' she adds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A versatile style suitable for both formal and casual events, grey **color** pant matching shirt go all the way in every style. Whether you prefer light shirt **color**s like beige or crisp white, or you love to rock with dark tones like maroon, black, etc. you can pair them up with light grey pants. Here are some of the fitting options for the most voiced question, what **color** shirt goes with grey pants? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grey walls can act like a neutral blank canvas for the rest of your scheme to work around. This means that any kind of decor style can be paired with **gray** walls – from scandi to industrial, and from modern heritage to minimal, grey walls really can work with any interior style. The shade of grey that you choose can impact the overall feel of your room, so always ensure to use tester pots before you buy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Perhaps the easiest way to pair these two **color**s together is via the use of a suit and tie. We’ll start here with the example of a charcoal **gray** suit paired with a red tie. As we’ve gone over numerous times before, charcoal is both a formal **color** for suiting but also especially versatile and when paired with the bolder pop of a red tie which can draw a bit more attention to the face, the pairing works well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Charcoal **gray** can be the perfect dark **color** accent without being too deep or intense. It is also stunning as upholstered furniture or rugs. Use it as an accent: If painting a whole room isn't your thing, try bringing **gray** into your decor's existing **color** palette through accessories. A beautiful **gray** throw blanket or sleek **gray** coffee table can be just what your room needs to feel fresh and new. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We alluded to this tip a moment ago but again, it’s important to reinforce that you shouldn’t wear too many statement pieces simultaneously in an outfit of this nature. Red is a naturally bold and eye-catching **color**, so having too many accessories or outfit elements at once will probably make the outfit look overwhelmed. You could consider capping off one of these outfits with something like a maroon fedora, red driving gloves, or again a red carnation boutonniere, but don’t wear all three of these together so you won’t come across as looking like a Dick Tracy villain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We are nearing the end of the closet of items that go with grey pants and now there are only the accessories to consider. If you need a cummerbund, the best recommendation is red. There is something striking about a red cummerbund. That broad swathe of **color** gives some oomph to the more muted greys and the black shoes of a semi-formal evening outfit.] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take a look back at Scandinavian trends and you'll find mustard yellow paired with steel **gray** ​everywhere​. They really are a match made in heaven if you're looking to create a graphic yet minimal scheme. This eclectic bedroom by Fantastic Frank showcases the beauty of the striking **color** combo in the center of the room: the bed. The charcoal **gray** sheets and the sunny yellow comforter make a bold statement against white walls, while the yellow artwork hanging above and the blonde wood flooring tie the whole room together. A pair of green sconces are the perfect finishing touch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Jeans come in all **color**s these days, but classically they belong to the blue family, and as explained above, blue is a perfect match for grey. Jeans come in all sorts of washes, from very dark – navy to acid washed – basically white, all hues complemented beautifully with a grey tank, blouse, or sweater. Jeans paired with a grey top can make up an outfit for any occasion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
