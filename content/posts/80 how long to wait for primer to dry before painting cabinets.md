## 80 Tips to How Long To Wait For Primer To Dry Before Painting Cabinets | How Long To Let Primer Dry Before Painting Cabinets
-   Chances are you've spotted painted kitchen cabinets on Instagram or Pinterest and thought of recreating the striking look in your own space. However, it’s easier said than done, since there are a slew of painted kitchen cabinet mistakes to consider before you even think of grabbing your paint brush. From cleaning the wood thoroughly to sanding surfaces, there's no way around handling the prep work that's needed to ensure a smooth paint job without any brush marks. Plus, once you’re finally done **painting** your cabinets, you need to give them at least a few days to dry to make sure your hard work remains intact. In other words, it’s an involved process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have been in the paint bus for yrs. Your Info on **primer**s and top coats is very solid, ther is another **primer** easy to sand and its oil, SW ez sand try it. but i follow you and love your info depend on it for a top dollar jobs. Thanks Mike - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Getting more airflow will help your **primer** dry faster. For this reason, Allow the air to circulate on your primed surface by opening the windows and blowing fans. Be sure there isn’t any dust or other particles in the air that might get in your **primer** and cause problems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Question: I'm **painting** Oak kitchen cabinets with a clear finish that don't have huge open grain issues. I plan to do it with a roller-brush, and top it with BM Advance. The biggest goal is a smooth finish at the end. What do you think I should do? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Question: I was raised on BIN, it was always the go-to **primer**. However, recently paint stores have been advising against using it for anything other than spot priming. Have you heard the same? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We applied a second coat of paint on the back of the cabinet doors and the frames after Clara went to bed. As for applying any sealer or topcoat, the general pro recommendation for cabinet **painting** is to use high quality stain blocking **primer** and 2-3 thin and even coats of super high quality paint with ample drying time between coats (Benjamin Moore’s Advance paint is meant for cabinets without any top coat, since sealers can drip, yellow, and even cause things to stick/crack since they thicken the application). Day 7: We gave the doors a full day to dry before flipping them over and applying a first coat to the fronts (the reason we did the backs first was that just in case the backs got marked up while we painted the front, at least the front would remain pristine). The day of drying time did the trick though, so the backs look as good as the fronts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Answer: Use either oil-based **primer** or BIN. I use BIN. It sprays really nice into a smooth finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Primer: No sanding required, but don’t skimp on the **primer** (even if the paint boasts it has a built in one). This is what is going to make the paint on your cabinets last! Also, **primer** is significantly cheaper than paint, so a coat of **primer** will actually help extend your paint coverage. We really love Zinsser Bulls Eye 1-2-3 Interior/Exterior Multi-purpose Water-based Wall and Ceiling Primer. It’s designed for all surfaces (interior/exterior drywall, concrete, wood, non-galvanized metal), dries quickly and my favorite–adheres to glossy surfaces without sanding. Tip: If you’re going for a dark paint color like we did, the paint counter will tint your **primer** dark for you for free! It definitely cuts down on top coats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Question: My home is 5 years old and the builder installed cabinets that were painted with an oil-based enamel but painted on-site (not baked). A few dings/gouges have appeared in the soft wood so I've filled them with either painter's putty or Bondo Glazing Putty, depending on the area. I need to touch up the paint now. I plan to touch up these areas with the same paint that was used by the builder but should I use a latex **primer** or oil-based? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Answer: If the cabinets are new and already painted, latex **primer** is probably fine. Oil **primer** is good when you're **painting** stained cabinets. Oil **primer** dries harder than latex and it seals the surface. The **primer** only smells bad the day of application, not weeks after. Open a window and the odor is gone when the **primer** dries. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Answer: I use Emerald urethane enamel for cabinet **painting** and would recommend it. I spray it with my airless sprayer. The paint doesn't yellow like oil paint, but dries hard, similar to oil paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paint finishes also contribute to the overall process of **painting** and letting it dry. Molly Machmer-Wessels, designer at Woodland Design Company, says you should allow for two hours of dry time for satin and semi-gloss finishes. Glossy paint finishes require the longest wait time which is about three hours before being able to re-coat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I prefer shellac **primer** over oil because it dries faster. Material build-up in corners doesn't stay wet for hours like oil does. But if you plan to brush and roll, this product won't splatter as much as shellac. After drying, it sands easily for an excellent bond with your paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All that info above (and those three bolded links to the previous posts on puttying/sanding/deglossing, priming, & **painting**) should be enough to get you going on any cabinet-**painting** project – but just because I always think a video is worth a thousand pics, here’s a quick one that runs through the process for you. Although at some points I’m so delirious that I make up words (putty brush?) and refer to **primer** as paint about a dozen times. But it definitely can be helpful to see exactly how to putty a hardware hole or how to prime and paint a cabinet door. Enjoy! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After that you should perform the test in a small hidden area. Wait at least 30 minutes more after the **primer** feels dry to the touch. After waiting, apply paint in an unused area to make sure it does not change color, flake, peel, roll up, or mix with **primer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Helpful tip: I usually strain all the **primer**s and paints that pass through my spray gun. Even though it is an extra step, I truly want to ensure there is nothing in my paint or **primer** before it is sprayed.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before **painting**, the **primer** needs to be completely dry. Otherwise, the **primer** may pull away from the surface when you use paint. The surface will appear streaky, flaky, and the color could peel and look uneven as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After your first coat of paint is dry, it’s safe to recoat typically after four to six hours. A good rule of thumb is to wait at least three hours to recoat your paint or **primer** if it’s water-based. Waiting 24 hours is best for oil-based paint and **primer**. If you’re unsure, the instructions on the paint’s label can give you the best final say. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here are a few things you can do to help your **primer** dry faster. For this purpose, you can use a dehumidifier which will reduce the home’s humidity level. Secondly, you can also open up the windows and doors to allow more air to circulate. It will speed up the dry time of the **primer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   BIN is a shellac-based **primer** that I use when spraying cabinets. The milk-thin consistency of BIN makes it splatter easily when brushing and rolling, but for spraying, it's awesome. The **primer** lays out nicely over cabinets that have been cleaned and sanded. When spraying doors horizontally, the material levels out really well on grainy oak, seeping into cracks without having to roll it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may also consider a **primer** that dries quickly. One option is self-priming paint, which is designed for fast drying. If you prefer to use a separate **primer** instead of a two-in-one option, a latex **primer** would be ideal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Answer: Yes, BIN shellac **primer** is a good product to use on your bathroom cabinets, but it's messy to work with if you're brushing and rolling because it's really thin and splatters easily. Oil-based **primer** is thicker and less messy for brushing and rolling. If you only have one small vanity, I would buy two or three rattle cans of **primer** and spray it on instead of brushing and rolling. Clean the cabinets, sand them, and apply the **primer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thick **primer** coats will take longer to dry. So, coat the **primer** with a sprayer. A **primer** is best applied with a sprayer, which results in a thinner layer than brushing or rolling it. The **primer** should dry the same amount of time as paint if applied more than once. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Primer usually dries within an hour of application. If you need to apply another layer of **primer**, you should wait three to four hours. Unlike a water-based **primer**, an oil-based **primer** will need more time to dry out. For a second coat, allow it 24 hours to ensure that it is completely dry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Too much heat or humidity will delay the drying process significantly. High humidity areas dry more slowly than low humidity areas. The **primer** may become too thick (especially oil-based **primer**s), making it challenging to apply. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Answer: Let the **primer** dry overnight before sanding and **painting**. Cover Stain sands a lot easier that way. If you sand it 2 hours after priming it will be gummy and harder to sand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I had finally decided on Cover Stain oil based **primer** for my MDF kitchen cabinets, then noticed in the product information that it is not suitable for cabinets. So confused! I plan on brush **painting**, not spraying. Would this still be the best choice? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Water-based paints dry faster than oil-based paints because they’re thinner, and easily affected by airflow. A thicker paint (like two-in-one paint and **primer**) takes longer to paint (and dry) because it’s significantly thicker. Sheen is another aspect to consider. Matte paint dries faster than glossier paint, in fact, using a glossier paint can add up to an hour to your total dry time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Surfaces that already have paint on them and surfaces made up of metals, steels, and wood are ideal for oil-based **primer**s. The drying process is slow, and it might take up to 3-4 hours to dry. Also, they emit high amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most latex **primer**s dry to the touch within 30 minutes to an hour. The **primer** must dry thoroughly before the surface can be painted, which may take up to three hours. Humidity and cool temperatures make drying more difficult. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Question: I was told by my local hardware store that I did not need to prime my stained cabinetry. As I'm putting on my first coat of paint and noticing the yellow coming through. Hopped online and started reading. Do I now need to take off my cabinet's first layer of paint and then do the two coats of **primer**? Or can I just lightly sand my cabinets and go ahead with my two layers of shellac **primer**? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For **painting** furniture and unfinished drywall, latex **primer**s are the perfect solution. They have got fast-drying properties and take around one hour at max to dry. They are also suitable for priming softwood, concrete and brick, and metals. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Question: I am getting ready to paint my ugly orange looking stained cabinets. I was just wondering about the order of things. I know I need to sand and fill the wood grain but what would be the order of all that? Clean, sand w/120, wood grain filler, sand w/220, shellac **primer** and then paint? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Strip the paint off the cabinets and start over with oil **primer** then your paint. Paint alone doesn't bond well to wood cabinets without **primer** underneath. The paint will rub off and scratch off easily, and priming and **painting** over that won't help anything. There is already a weak bond. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   : With the **primer** all done and dry (be sure to read the can – ours said not to over-prime, so one coat did the trick), during Clara’s nap we flipped the cabinet doors over again and painted one coat of paint on the backs (we used Benjamin Moore’s Advance paint in Cloud Cover). We applied it with a high quality 2″ angled brush to get into all the cracks and a small foam roller to smooth everything out and ensure that we were applying super thin and even coats (there’s a video of the application process a bit further down in this post). Clara woke up before we could paint the frames, so after she went to bed that night we put a first coat on the cabinet frames. Day 6: We applied a second coat of paint on the back of the cabinet doors and the frames after Clara went to bed. As for applying any sealer or topcoat, the general pro recommendation for cabinet **painting** is to use high quality stain blocking **primer** and 2-3 thin and even coats of super high quality paint with ample drying time between coats (Benjamin Moore’s Advance paint is meant for cabinets without any top coat, since sealers can drip, yellow, and even cause things to stick/crack since they thicken the application). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cover Stain oil, not the newer latex version, is a good **primer** sealer and bond coat for kitchen cabinets. At roughly $23 per gallon, the price is half the cost of BIN. Like most solvent-based coatings, the smell is horrible. Whether you're spraying or rolling it, gloves and a respirator are highly recommended. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you plan to paint, it is essential to know how long does **primer** takes to dry. For this purpose, you need to find the right type of **primer** that works well with the paint. Make sure to read the instructions on the can because the drying time of **primer** varies by brand and product. The process might take a while, and you may need to wait for ideal weather conditions. However, if you use a quality **primer** in the right conditions, you will achieve excellent results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting during the spring or fall is ideal because the temperatures aren’t too hot or cold. If you’re **painting** in a hot or chilly room, expect increased drying times. The best temperature to paint a room in is a warm room with low humidity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, you can spray BIN with a Graco airless sprayer, but not the portable handheld airless. The best tip size is 210, or 310, depending on door sizes. The green Graco FFLP tips are what you want to use. You need the blue RAC X tip guard to use the green tips. When you spray BIN always strain the **primer** first and clean the sprayer carefully with ammonia water mix. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Don't use any paint on your cabinets without cleaning, sanding and priming them first. The guy at the store is wrong. Oil-based **primer**, or white shellac **primer**, are the best options for **painting** lacquered cabinets. Sand the cabinets first to remove the gloss so the **primer** sticks good. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I'm glad you found the article helpful. BIN **primer** is great for cabinets. Just make sure you cover the floor carefully because it sprinkles like crazy brushing and rolling it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Answer: No, I haven't used Extreme Bond Primer. I do know though that because it's latex, the **primer** will not seal in wood tannin. If you're working with an oily wood like oak, I would use an oil-based **primer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **primer** coat doesn’t have to be perfect, it should cover the surface, and not look blotchy or uneven. Ideally, the **primer** should look even and have no visible drip lines. Primer does not need to completely cover old paint coats for the new paint to adhere flawlessly, but it should be applied uniformly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the biggest mistakes made when **painting** cabinets is using latex **primer** instead of oil. Products like latex Kilz 2 and Bullseye 1-2-3 won't completely seal the wood to keep tannin from leaking into the paint. Latex **primer** is also soft when dry and rubs off easily if you make the mistake using it on bare wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Have you ever painted the surface and didn’t get the desired smooth result after the very coat of the paint? It is precisely where the **primer** can jump into your rescue. The purpose of the **primer** is to seal a porous surface, which gives us uniform coverage on the topcoat of the paint. Also, you can improve the coverage of the last coat of paint with a tinted **primer** to match the topcoat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cabinet door backs and cabinet frames were primed (we love Zinsser Smart Prime which is high-quality, stain-blocking, and low-VOC – the **primer** trifecta). We applied it with a high quality 2″ angled brush to get into all the cracks and a small foam roller to smooth everything out and ensure that we were applying super thin and even coats (there’s a video of the application process a bit further down in this post) Day 4: We flipped the cabinet doors over and primed the fronts, leaving them to dry another 24 hours, just like the backs. Read more about the priming steps of this process here (there are extra pics too!). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **primer** sprays fine with an airless sprayer, but a bigger spray tip is needed, preferably size .015 to .017, otherwise, the material won't atomize and spray with an even pattern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, the imperfections in the **primer** will show through the enamel, so sanding them out is important. Cover Stain sands nicely when you leave it alone for a day and let it harden up a little. If you sand it too soon it gums up and it's harder to sand. Use a sanding sponge to sand out the imperfections. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can spray this product or use a roller, but like Cover Stain, the thicker consistency can cause rope texturing when rolling if you apply too much. It takes a little practice, but imperfections can be sanded out before **painting**. This product can also be used for priming stains and patches on drywall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 4: After sanding, wipe down the surface with a damp cloth to remove any dust or residue. Primer and paint won’t stick to dust. After wiping, allow the surface to dry before moving on to **primer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Question: I need to repaint my cabinets. They have a clear coat on them. Can I apply the **primer** directly without removing the actual finish? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is important to wait until the **primer** dries. In general, latex- or shellac-type **primer**s dry within 1-3 hours per coat. Water-based **primer**s dry within 3-4 hours once applied. On the other hand, when you use an oil-based **primer**, the coat must be allowed to dry for 24 hours. Keep in mind that low temperatures and high humidity are both factors that extend drying times. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Answer: I would use BIN or oil-based **primer**. Cover Stain is good. Milk paint alone doesn't have any sealing properties. Cherry bleeds red oil like crazy, so if you don't prime the cabinets correctly, you'll see red streaks everywhere through the milk paint. I would prime two coats of either product I mentioned. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Answer: I'm not sure what you're asking. If you're referring to the best **primer** option, use oil-based **primer**, or white shellac **primer** (BIN). Cover Stain oil **primer** is great if you go that route. You can use your HVLP sprayer for the cabinets, but you'll likely have to thin the **primer** and paint, depending on the products you choose. I use an airless sprayer and don't have to thin my **primer** and paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The problem is more than likely that a bonding **primer** wasn't used over the oil paint and that's why the latex paint is peeling. Water-based paint bonds poorly to oil paint without a bonding **primer** underneath. While you could sand the loose latex paint off, prime, and paint, you already have a weak bond underneath from the original problem. I would remove the latex paint, sand, prime, and then paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thanks for the **primer** tips. I am **painting** my oak kitchen cabinets white. Even though I will be using a roller and brush I think I'll go with Zinsser BIN Shellac based on your article. I am looking for something that is not too thick and dries fast. Yes it's more expensive but it seems like a good investment to avoid problems later. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bill Samuel is a general contractor who rehabs houses in Chicago. Samuel says to “reference the manufacturer’s instructions for the specific paint you purchase and follow their guidelines on wait times for between coats.” Since the environment you are **painting** in can affect the amount of time it takes for your paint to dry, also be sure to consider the temperature and humidity levels to estimate your dry time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For those who can’t watch the video above to see my shot of the painted cabinets up close, the picture below might shed a little light on the whole oak-grain thing. Using high quality **primer** and good self-leveling paint helps hide a lot although it doesn’t guarantee 100% invisible grain (we don’t see any evidence of grain on the oak cabinets in the office but do see a hint of it on the kitchen cabinets, so it probably just depends how much grain your cabinets have to begin with). We don’t mind painted wood that looks like painted wood though, so a little grain is ok with us, as long as the paint is nice and even and glossy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nobody likes the odor, but oil-based **primer** seals the surface of cabinets the best and prevents tannin bleed. Oil **primer** dries harder and sands nicely too. Paint bonds really well to oil, using a good paint of course. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since modern paints are expensive, reducing the need for additional coats can be cost-effective. A **primer** will make the topcoat adhere better to the surface. Having established the importance of **primer**, Now we need to focus on the burning question that has been there in everyone’s mind, how long does **primer** take to dry? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Answer: On laminate, oil-based bonding **primer**, or shellac based **primer**, like BIN, is fine. The surface needs to be cleaned and sanded first to remove the gloss. You can use the same **primer** on veneer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 7: Apply your paint exactly the same way you applied your **primer**. Always move in smooth strokes that go in the same direction as the wood grain. Pro-tip: For a really great result, apply **primer** and paint with a sprayer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It may not be enough to apply a thin coat of **primer** over the imperfections, and perhaps you should apply more. Using too many thin coats of **primer** will slow down the drying process. You can check your manufacturer’s instructions to figure out how many coats to apply. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Im using cover Stain Primer Zinsser on bathroom cabinets, i sanded/cleaned them well, im spraying it with my wagner 3000. And now im sanding again to take off the gloss and to make it smoother, but i noticed some spots on the cabinets that look heavy(**primer**), and i cant sand them down to look all the same...... im worryed when i paint them with a Urethane enamel paint that it will show????? Any help. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Answer: No, I haven't heard that. It works well for cabinet priming and spot priming. The price is a little high compared to oil **primer**, but I haven't had any problems with BIN. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We suggest you consider all the factors we’ve outlined when picking the best day to paint. The environment affects the time it takes for your **primer** to dry, including the temperature and humidity, so keep a close eye on them to achieve the best results. Additionally, you can schedule your weekend DIY project once you know how long the **primer** takes to dry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   …but it’s definitely progress. Hooray, progress. So who’s about to embark on a cabinet **painting** adventure of their very own? I hope this post full of details (and especially that little video we whipped up) come in handy! Have fun and don’t forget to make up words (might I recommend putty brush?). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a few easy ways to speed up the drying process of your **primer**. If you’re short on time, try these tricks so you won’t have to wait forever for your **primer** to dry. Here are some suggestions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **primer** should be dried at 40 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit or about 24 degrees Celsius. At lower temperatures, the **primer** will dry more slowly. So, if you are **painting** in a cold room, turn on the heating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **primer**s may take three hours to dry completely before **painting**. However, a warmer temperature and low humidity can speed up the drying process of **primer**. Here is a table showing the drying times for the seven most popular **primer**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The last thing you want is for knots to show up on your cabinets weeks or months after you've painted them. The best way to prevent this is with **primer**. "Priming helps paint to adhere to surfaces and is a critical step if you’re **painting** cabinets," Gibbons says. Consider Clare’s fast-drying, multi-surface paint **primer** that can help conceal any imperfections and even block stains. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This product is an excellent sealer that bonds well with wood. The dry time is fast, typically under one hour, allowing for light sanding and a second coat the same day. If you spray BIN, you need to clean the sprayer with either ammonia or denatured alcohol, not paint thinner. You can brush and roll this product fine too, but with the fast dry time, the **primer** will start to get gummy if you don't work it onto the surface fast enough. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Day 5 : With the **primer** all done and dry (be sure to read the can – ours said not to over-prime, so one coat did the trick), during Clara’s nap we flipped the cabinet doors over again and painted one coat of paint on the backs (we used Benjamin Moore’s Advance paint in Cloud Cover). We applied it with a high quality 2″ angled brush to get into all the cracks and a small foam roller to smooth everything out and ensure that we were applying super thin and even coats (there’s a video of the application process a bit further down in this post). Clara woke up before we could paint the frames, so after she went to bed that night we put a first coat on the cabinet frames. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Question: I have bought a new unfinished cabinet to added to the kitchen. The other cabinets are painted and plan to repainted them also. Question: what would be the best **primer** to use on unfinished wood? I will be **painting** all cabinets with Behr latex. Thanks? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So as I understand it, using a shellac **primer** on lacquered cabinets is the way to go? Some guy working at Sherwin Williams claims he painted Emerald Urethane on his lacquered cabinets and it bonded well. I have trouble believing this. Your thoughts? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Primer types and brands vary in their drying times. You can choose from four classes: Latex-based, Shellac-based, Oil-based, and Self-priming. To get an idea of how long it takes for the **primer** to dry, please check the drying times of most popular **primer**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our week-long phase 1 kitchen refresh is all but done now. The most dramatic change besides rearranging the cabinets (did you even know you could do that?) was **painting** the cabinets this past weekend. Everyone knows how transformative paint can be, but one of my favorite aspects is one hue isn’t going to be more or less expensive than another. This deep green-gray color we chose (Sherwin Williams Thunderous mixed in HGTV Home by Sherwin Williams Infinity Line at Lowe’s in a Satin finish) is really rich, unified our kitchen added a lot of depth and made everything look a lot more intentional (and even more expensive) for very little money (we also added a bunch of this shiplap vertically as our backsplash and wooooooow! It’s a really amazing product that actually comes pre-painted white, but we painted ours the same green as our cabinets. Back to that… - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 5: When **painting** kitchen cabinets you should always use a **primer** first. Primer will help protect your cabinets, and it will also create a smooth base to help you get better adhesion and truer color from your paint. When applying **primer**, just as you did with the sandpaper, move in the same direction as the wood grain for best results. Pro-tip: To get better coverage along the sides of your door, raise it off your work surface with bricks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   She suggests **painting** a big poster board with a tester can in the color you're considering (you can usually get a small one for just $5). "Hang it up next to your backsplash and your appliances and make sure that's really the color you want." If you're stuck on where to start, check out color paint trends for inspiration! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
