## 8 Tips to Pots With Architecture For Insects | pots with architecture for bugs
-   Darker containers, particularly those that are black, have been observed to heat the soil more. For example, in one experiment, researchers raised bush beans in silver, white, and black s**pots**. The black **pots** had the warmest soil and the white **pots** had the coolest soil on the sides of the containers that faced the sun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before selecting the color of your planter, there are a few things you should be aware of. For instance, a planter’s color may affect how much heat it retains; the darker the color, the more heat the planter retains, therefore a lighter-colored planter would typically perform better in hotter regions than a darker-colored one. Following is a list of the most popular colorful plant **pots**, along with information about their appeal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A visual celebration of these natural feats of engineering and ingenuity, Architecture by Birds and Insects allows readers a peek inside a wide range of nests, offering a rare opportunity to get a sense of the materials and methods used to build them. Here, we see the kinds of places where nests are built—for instance, the house wren has been known to occupy cow skulls, flower **pots**, tin cans, and the pockets of hanging laundry, while the uglynest caterpillar prefers rose bushes and cherry trees. Inspired by the vast nest collection at the Field Museum, which features specimens gathered throughout North and South America, Peggy Macnamara’s paintings are enhanced by text written by museum curators. This narrative provides a foundation in natural history for each painting, as well as fascinating anecdotes about the nests and their builders. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like so many natural treasures, nests are easy to ignore. But Macnamara’s gorgeous paintings will undoubtedly change that. Architecture by Birds and Insects at last gives the tiniest engineers their rightful moment in the spotlight, and in so doing increases awareness and encourages the protection of birds, **insects**, and their habitats. Readers will never look at a Frank Gehry design, or a treetop nest, the same way again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Have a go at identifying what you have found. There are lots of fantastic resources online to help. You can either take photographs of the **insects** you want to ID or collect them in small **pots**.Remember to return them to where you found them. Here is a list of some of our favourite insect identification resources. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Influential American architect Philip Johnson once mused, “All architecture is shelter; all great architecture is the design of space that contains, cuddles, exalts, or stimulates the persons in that space.” But with just a small swap of a key word, Johnson could well have been describing animal nests. Birds and **insects** are nature’s premier architects, using a dizzying array of talents to build functional homes in which to live, reproduce, and care for their young. Recycling sticks, branches, grass, and mud to construct their shelters, they are undoubtedly the originators of “green architecture.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A bright yellow colored planter intended to improve any interior. Succulents, cacti, flowers, and other small plants can be stylishly housed in these **pots** along with other real or artificial plants. The yellow color always has contrasting flowers and plants. These planters with contracting color plants give a vibrant feel to your home or balcony garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pick white or fiber **pots** for the most development potential. Your plants will still prosper even if you favor terracotta or another hue. For any heat-sensitive plants, choosing lighter hues is crucial, especially if they are placed outdoor plants in hot weather or direct sunlight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
