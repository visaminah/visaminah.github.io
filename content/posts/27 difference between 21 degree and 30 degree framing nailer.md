## 27 Unexpected Facts About Difference Between 21 Degree And 30 Degree Framing Nailer | 21 Degree Framing Nailer
-   Although becoming less common with the arrival of cordless models, fuel-powered **framing** **nailer**s are still fairly popular. They rely on a combination of a fuel cell and a rechargeable battery for power. A fuel-powered **nailer** is lighter in weight than a cordless model and will also last longer before the battery needs recharging or the fuel cell needs replacing. As far as the downside goes, replacement of the fuel cell adds to the expense of a fuel-powered **nailer**—and they’re not inexpensive. Plus, due to the combustion created by the fuel cell, this type of **nailer** will emit an unpleasant odor during use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A brushless motor is more efficient because it creates less friction and therefore loses less energy. Brushless motors are 85 to 90 percent efficient, while brushed motors are 75 to 80 percent efficient. This means a brushless **nailer** will have more firing power and last longer before the battery needs a recharge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **framing** angle refers to the position of the **nailer**’s magazine—the long metal piece attached to the head of the tool that holds the nails. Most **framing** **nailer**s have a magazine that is angled away from the head of the **nailer** to allow for easier maneuverability between studs or joists. The most common angles for **framing** **nailer**s are 15, 21, 28, 30, and 34 degrees. These are fixed angles and are not adjustable, so it’s critical to buy nails that match the angle of the **nailer**. A 28-degree nail will not work in a 21-degree **nailer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pneumatic **framing** **nailer**s use compressed air supplied by an air compressor to create the force that drives the nail out of the gun and into the wood. On the plus side, they provide a consistent source of power, pack more force than their cordless and fuel-powered counterparts, and are lighter in weight than cordless **nailer**s. They also allow for rapid firing, which can help facilitate a faster **framing** process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The heavy-duty pneumatic **nailer**s you find on construction sites usually have a 21-degree magazine angle. Framers need to drive full-size nails, and more important, they need the nails to have full heads. Many local codes prohibit clipped-head nails for **framing**. You might also find zero-degree **nailer**s on construction sites, but these are usually lighter-duty tools for installing subfloors, siding and roof decking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Power **nailer**s that shoot brads and staples are often designed with a zero-degree magazine angle. This simple design is practical because brads and staples are thin, and you can fit a lot of them into a small space. Three-and-a-half-inch **framing** nails, on the other hand, are relatively fat, and the magazine needs to be longer to accommodate a reasonable number of them. Enter the 21-degree magazine angle, which reduces the horizontal extension of the magazine by about 15 percent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While you can use a **framing** **nailer** for siding (by fitting it with short 2-inch screws), you cannot use a siding **nailer** for **framing**. Framing **nailer**s require 3½-inch nails that can penetrate deep enough to create a secure connection between 2×4 boards. Siding **nailer**s can only handle nails up to 2½ inches, so they won’t work for **framing**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We used each of the **nailer**s for different aspects of a few different jobs. We used each on a small **framing** job as well as building a portable pitching mound. Some of the wood was very dry and easy to work with, while the rest was extremely wet, heavy, and resistant to nailing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cordless **framing** **nailer**s rely solely on their battery for power. This generally makes them heavier, as the battery adds weight to the gun. As with most cordless tools, their greatest asset is convenience. Since they needn’t be plugged into an outlet or an air compressor, they can be used on jobsites where electricity isn’t available. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **framing** **nailer** that uses nails that come in long strips requires a stick magazine. Stick magazines have a lower capacity than coil magazines, but they create better weight distribution, making the tool easier to handle. Coil magazine: Framing **nailer**s that use nails connected with long strings that coil around require a coil magazine. They have a larger nail capacity than stick-style magazines, and the shape allows for fitting the **framing** **nailer** into tighter spaces than with a stick magazine model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There was a time when neighbors could tell a crew was **framing** a house by the sound of metal-on-metal-on-wood, since hammering nails was the only way to connect large dimensional lumber. That sound is now a thing of the past, replaced by the repetitive “pop!” of **framing** **nailer**s. These powerful tools operate by using combustion, electricity, or compressed air to create enough force to fire nails up to 3½ inches long into wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Carpenters consider round-head nails to be the more secure option, as a round head is less likely to pull through a piece of **framing** than a clipped nail. In fact, due to round-head nails’ holding power, some building codes strictly require round-head nails only. Since the round head prevents the nails from sitting flush next to each other, however, the trade-off is the magazine will hold fewer round-head nails than clipped ones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some **framing** **nailer**s include protective guards, which shield the user from debris or nails that may deflect off material. Another possible feature may be integrated LED lights that indicate when nails or batteries are running low and provide lighting for the work area. Some pneumatic **nailer**s allow users to adjust the direction of the exhaust to keep air from blowing in the face. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The greater the angle, the more maneuverable the **nailer** is, which will allow the user to fit the head into tight corners. The best angle comes down to personal preference and the type of project. For **framing** projects that require the **nailer** to fit into tight spaces, such as between studs or in corners, it makes sense to have a 30- or 34-degree **nailer**, which provides the maximum amount of maneuverability. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Framing **nailer**s include various features for safety and material type. All **framing** **nailer**s include a depth-adjustment knob, which allows control of how deep the nail penetrates the wood. Woods of different hardness and thickness will require different nail-depth settings. The best **framing** **nailer** will have depth adjustment that is easy to use, requiring only the simple turn of a knob. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because of their ability to drive 3½-inch nails into wood, **framing** **nailer**s are considered one of the more dangerous power tools. A misfire can cause serious injury, sending a nail through a foot, a hand, or worse. To prevent accidents, it’s crucial that the **nailer** be comfortable to handle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even with all of that background information on **framing** **nailer**s, shopping for one of these tools can be intimidating. To help streamline the process, check out the following list of top models. The lineup includes some of the top battery, fuel, and pneumatic **framing** **nailer**s on the market from some of the most highly regarded tool manufacturers in the business. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Framing **nailer**s work with two types of nails: round head and clipped. Round-head nails, true to their name, have round heads, whereas a clipped nail has a head that appears to have a chunk taken out of it. This head shape allows the nails to sit flush against each other in a stack in the **nailer**’s magazine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nails are typically used for **framing** as they have more tensile strength than screws. Whereas nails will bend under pressure, screws are more brittle and therefore more likely to snap. That said, there are newer high-tensile screws on the market designed specifically for **framing**. You cannot, however, use screws in a **framing** **nailer**. If you plan on **framing** with screws, you’ll need to use an impact driver or a cordless drill. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The magazine angle doesn't affect the angle at which the nail emerges from the head of the **nailer**. As long as you hold the head flush against the work surface, the **nailer** will drive it perpendicularly into the wood. The purpose of angling the magazine with respect to the head is almost exclusively to save space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s a lot riding on a list of the best **framing** **nailer**s, so our extensive experience working with these tools informed us of which features were must-haves. Next, we collected tools from all of the top brands in the **framing** **nailer** field for review. After extensive product research, we narrowed our group of **framing** **nailer**s down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you're installing interior trim, your gun doesn't need as much power, because it's driving finish nails or staples -- not **framing** nails. Consequently, interior trim **nailer**s often have steeper magazine angles, such as 28 and 34 degrees, to save space. You'll be thankful you have a that extra space when you have to use the **nailer** in tight corners. Battery-powered **nailer**s--the ultimate in nailing convenience--aren't as powerful as pneumatic **nailer**s, and they usually have a 28- or 34-degree magazine angle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s possible to make arguments for both types of **nailer**s. For those who prefer a high-capacity magazine, such as production framers or those who primarily work in high above-ground places like roofs and rafters, coils are key. But for those who prefer something lightweight, stick-style magazines are better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One angle isn't necessarily any better than the other. The overall design and quality of the tool and its purpose are more important than the magazine angle. Because nails used in 21- and 28-degree **nailer**s are not interchangeable, it's best to stick with one angle if you're supplying tools and nails for a crew. The main advantage of the 28-degree tool is that its compact design makes it easier to handle, especially in tight places. If you're a home handyman looking for an all-purpose tool that you can use for a variety of tasks, it's probably better to choose a 28-degree **nailer** than a 21-degree one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Size is rarely an issue when it comes to **framing** **nailer**s. Almost all **framing** **nailer**s will fire the 3½-inch 10D nails required for **framing**. Instead, consider angle, weight, and type, all of which are discussed in detail above. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Increasing the magazine angle to 28 degrees saves even more space, but it's challenging to design a drive mechanism that has enough power to drive full-size nails at such a steep angle. Consequently, the nails for a 28-degree **nailer** are usually smaller than those for 21-degree **nailer**. Moreover, except for one or two exceptions, they often have clipped heads, so that more of them can fit into the magazine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Different types of angles also shoot different types of nails. Nailers with 15-degree or 21-degree angled magazines use full-round heads, which are more secure than clipped nails. A 28-degree **framing** **nailer** can use clipped or full-round head nails, while 30- and 34-degree **nailer**s can only use clipped nails. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
