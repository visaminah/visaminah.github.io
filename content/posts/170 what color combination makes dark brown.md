## 170 Reference List: What Color Combination Makes Dark Brown | How to Make Brown Paint (3 Common Shades)
-   Now things get little weird. If we look at our wheel then yellow + purple shouldn’t really make **brown**. They should make gray as they’re almost directly opposite each other. But let’s try them and see. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Creating custom hues of **brown** is truly a balancing act. While white can be great for creating a latte-type hue, you do run the risk of getting too far into the beige family if you’re too quick to swirl white into your palette. There’s also no shortcut to getting to a darker shade of **brown** quickly by blending in some black. Generally, black simply overpowers **brown** to the point where it loses its textured nuance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All that digression was for this: **brown**s aren’t just high or low value – they can be high or low *chroma*. And we need them more often that you’d think. A lot of the **color**s we’ve mixed so far have been high chroma. But how do we mix the low chroma ones? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Alternatively, if you want to create a darker shade, you should use darker **color**s over brighter ones. Ensure that you achieve the most accurate result possible while preparing a shade of **brown**. Therefore, we advise that you first produce the **color** on the sheet of paper or screen that you will be comparing it with, before beginning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Value is the name for how light or dark the **color** is. Conventions vary but I use the Munsell notation and measure value from dark – 0 to light – 10. You can think of this as how light or dark a **color** would appear if we viewed it in black and white. Black would be 0 and white would be 10. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What **color**s make **brown**? Find out many ways to mix **color**s for **brown**. One of these might surprise you. It certainly did me. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 3: Add a very small amount of white. Use less than you did of the other three **color**s. A touch of opaque white can help make your **brown** lighter, but apply a little at a time. You can always apply more to reach your desired **color**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is also the perfect base for creating a beautiful and realistic rust **color**. In fact, this is one of the only times when black actually works well with **brown**. The easiest recipe for rust-**color**ed paint is to add red and yellow to a very flat **brown**. You can then add just a touch of very grimy black. Some people even like to add a touch of gold for a brassy texture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a variety of approaches that may be employed to get the **brown** **color** you desire. Before you begin learning the many approaches for achieving this **color**, you must first ensure that you have the appropriate tools. The following are the resources that you will need to get started: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Making **brown** paint will necessitate the use of many distinct **color**s blended. There are a variety of approaches that may be used to accomplish this. The most frequent method is to combine equal amounts of each primary **color**. Another option is to combine secondary **color**s with the complementary hues of the primary **color**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even your bathroom can benefit from the perfect shade of **brown**. This room achieves its elegant design by pairing **brown** with pale blue. The wallpaper is Strawberry Thief from William Morris with a background of gray **brown**. The pale blue leaf accents lighten up the dark wallpaper without looking too stark. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, oftentimes in painting, you need a more specific version of a **color** to fit your vision. This **brown** can be refined by adding more or less of your primary **color**s and white to make it perfectly suited for your needs. Here are some basic moves to alter your **brown**. Play with these methods, adjusting them to suit your needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Broadly speaking, the **color** blue represents safety, belief, and fealty. It exudes feelings of safety, support, and tranquility. Even though it might have lots of optimistic connotations, such as harmony and self-belief, it might also have some pessimistic connotations, such as passive and easy to predict. That, nevertheless, is just broad **color** symbolism. Different shades of blue might have distinct meanings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue and orange are the **color**s of the sky (blue sky and orange sunsets). Yellow are purple are the **color**s of royalty (kings wear gold crowns and purple robes). Red and green are the **color** of roses, strawberries, holly, tomatoes and yes, Christmas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you need a higher chroma **color** than you have on your palette you can’t mix it. (I’m sure there is an exception to this rule but it’s very rare and I can’t think of one off the top of my head) This is why all our favorite pigments have such high chroma. You can’t mix them! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Golden **brown** paint lets you add a natural honey glow to hair and fur textures, landscapes and even skin tones. This shade favors yellow tones, an important aspect when working through how to make **brown** paint. It’s a simple yet effective formula to learn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is not only an unordinary **color** to combine with, but it also does not actually exist in lights. It generally makes **color**s appear either muddier or darker in physical art substances. However, using **brown** in blending is inconceivable in lights. As a result, blue and **brown** are a **color** mix that is rarely seen when blending **color**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lighter **brown**s work well for painting highlights, coffee with milk and light hair **color**s. For a lighter **brown**, you can add white paint a little at a time until it has reached your desired tone. Adding a touch of one of the primary **color**s can also be nice, keeping the **color** from becoming too beige and bland. Adding red or yellow will make for a warmer light **brown**, and a touch of blue will make for a cooler light **brown**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cerulean blue, cadmium red light, and cadmium yellow light make a nice light **brown**. If you add some titanium white, you can make it lighter and duller, like a beige. Robie Benve - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **color** model, just like the common RYB **color** model, employs subtractive blending. As a result, when **color**s are blended, wavelengths of lights are eliminated rather than added. As a result, **color**s in the CMYK **color** model that is generally used in printing and ink combine separately from **color**s in the RGB **color** model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Complementary **color**s are the different tones that are immediately opposite each other when peering at the **color** wheel. These are **color**s that look great when used in combination with one another. When discovering how to create **brown** paint, you may combine two complementary **color**s to get the desired **color**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to creating **brown**, a variety of **color**s such as primary, secondary, and complementary hues may be used to get the desired shade. Knowing how to create **brown** paint is a necessary ability for every artist who wants to express themselves creatively. Brown can be found everywhere in the natural world, and there is a myriad of various **color**s of **brown** to choose from to suit your needs. If you are a newbie to **color** mixing, the most effective way to learn is to explore and try several ways, until you have a firm understanding of the basics of **color** mixing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No matter what you plan on painting, you’ll likely need more than one type of **brown**. As mentioned before, if you want a lighter tint, keep adding a bit of white. Make sure to thoroughly mix before adding in more paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is unmatched in its versatility. Rich and textured, **brown** awakens feelings of strength and reliability. There is something about **brown**’s connection with the very dirt and clay that sculpt the earthen terrain we walk on that makes us feel grounded and connected. This is why **brown** evokes feelings of warmth, comfort and naturalness when introduced into a space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The simplest way to darken **brown** without adding black or a harsh blue is to experiment with adding red and yellow to create a warmer tone. Conversely, you can bring in a touch of blue to draw out the cooler hints within your custom shade. A little blue can do a great job of bringing out the highlights in an image. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It takes some experience to get the hang of mixing water**color**s, so simply explore and develop a feel for it. Remember to only combine the **color**s when you need them since they will dry up rapidly if not used immediately. Additionally, you may mix water**color** paints immediately on the paper, removing the need to mix them beforehand. However, we advise that only expert painters should do this because if the **color** mixture is incorrect, the whole artwork will be harmed as a result. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We often see a lot of **brown** objects not just because **brown** energy is captured from them. Rather, it could be showing a paler orange light rather than other objects nearby. A lot of **color**s do not exist as reflected lights. In fact, we only see them as a result of how our brain interprets them. For all of these reasons, **brown** is infrequently used in neon lights outside of businesses. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We can think about **color** as having 3 properties. These are hue, value and chroma. I’ll describe these briefly below - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Alternatively, if you want to get a cooler and darker **brown** tone, you might use **color**s such as blue and green. It is important to blend **color**s gradually and softly when attempting to bring out the warmth or coolness in a **brown** hue. The use of this method eliminates the problems that might occur when you add more **color** and then struggle to remove it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This can be a smaller amount than the other **color**s that you added to make the **brown**. It is not meant so much to lighten the **color** as it is to enforce it. The opaque white paint will make your **brown** **color** more opaque, giving it more bang for your buck in terms of canvas or painting surface coverage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To create a light **brown** **color**, mix the three primary **color**s together, then add some white. The amount of white will depend on how light you want the **brown** to be. There are countless shades of light **brown** and the amount of each of the primary **color**s you add will alter the shade you end up with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Knowing how to make **brown** paint is a fundamental part of painting in any medium. Though **brown** is one of the most abundant **color**s in nature, it’s also one **color** you won’t find on the **color** wheel. How can something so present all around us be missing from the artist’s spectrum? Maybe it’s because learning how to make **brown** paint using other **color**s is so easy! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown **color**s are typically desaturated shades of reds, oranges, and yellows which are created on computer and television screens using the RGB **color** model and in printing with the CMYK **color** model. Browns can also be created by mixing two complementary **color**s from the RYB **color** model (combining all three primary **color**s). In theory, such combinations should produce black, but produce **brown** because most commercially available blue pigments tend to be comparatively weaker; the stronger red and yellow **color**s prevail, thus creating **brown** tones. Displayed here are some common **brown** shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you think about the **color** teal, deep seas and oceans might be the very first image coming to your mind. Brown, on the flip side, is just as much a wake-up call of nature as the **color** blue. The amount of blue added to the combination, as well as the amount of **brown** present, determines the effect the outcome **color** has on the watcher and the surroundings as a whole. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What I mean to say is that you can have a lower chroma **color** *of the same value*. You can gray out a **color** without it becoming darker. Of course you can also do both – you can lower the chroma and lower the value but you can do either one independent of each other. That was a confusing sentence – I think a picture is needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But it’s still a yellow! It’s just a very low chroma yellow. That’s our **color** of sand. It’s definitely in the yellow part of the wheel but it’s just very very grayed out (or low chroma if you want to use the proper lingo). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is important because in painting we often need lower chroma **color**s. A lot of **color**s in nature are low chroma – sometimes surprisingly so. An example I often come across is the **color** of sand. If you ask anyone what the **color** of sand is they’d likely say ‘yellow’. If you take a look at the picture below and ask yourself what the **color** of the sand is you’d also say ‘that’s yellow sand’. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A cool red mixed with a warm blue make a brilliant purple. Here, Alizarin Crimson is the cooler red while Ultramarine Blue is the warmer blue. Color temperature is relative. Though blue is a cool **color**, within the family of blue hues, there are warm and cool variances. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **color** shown above at the top right at the head of this article (**color** #964B00) is the **color** normally and traditionally regarded as **brown**—a medium dark orange. Its h (hue) code is 30, which signifies a shade of orange. The **color** to the immediate right (**color** #A52A2A) that was chosen as the web **color** "**brown**"—a medium dark red—is the **color** traditionally called red-**brown**. That this **color** is a shade of red and not orange can be easily ascertained by inspecting its h (hue) code, which is 0, signifying a shade of red. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is typically created by combining yellow, red, and black in the CMYK **color** model. Nevertheless, blue, red, and yellow might also be used. When blue and **brown** ink are blended together, the resulting **color** is often comparable to paint, which is known as dark blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown. It’s a vital **color** in acrylic painting, used to create subject matter as widely varied as hair, skin tones, chocolates, trees, earth, and hardwood floors. Do you know how to mix **brown** paint? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A little bit of opaque white helps lighten your **brown**, therefore, make sure to only use a little amount at a time. You may always add extra to get the **color** you want if necessary. If you would like to achieve a lighter **color**, keep adding a little amount of white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A combination of two primary **color**s creates a secondary **color**. Colors such as orange, green, yellow, and purple are examples of secondary **color**s. The following **color**s must be combined to create secondary **color**s: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Brown and blue tones work together as a study in contrast. Also, the bright and vibrant shades of blue will balance out the neutral background of **brown**. The shades of blue that work best with **brown** are and . Red – Red and **brown** both have warm and rich undertones. Shades of brick red or burgundy look amazing with **brown** accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some yellows show a clear red bias, they are darker and lean more towards orange than true yellow. These **color**s will make duller greens because red acts as a neutralizer for greens. Robie Benve - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since ancient times, the **color** **brown** has been used in art. The chemicals found in the earth were utilized to make **brown** dyes and hues by early civilizations. Among other things, walnuts, clay, and iron oxide were employed in their creation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   , or **color**, may be closer to either red, yellow or blue, depending on how much of each you use. Saturation , or intensity, is determined by the shades of the **color** you choose when determining how to make **brown** paint that works for you. Brighter yellows will create a more golden **brown**, while deeper reds will produce a more chocolatey shade and darker blues will result in a grayish **brown**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So looking at the **color** wheel we should be able to mix **brown** by picking two **color**s across from each other that cross through the **brown** section. The first one we’re going to try is red + yellow + blue. We know red and yellow make orange and if we join orange and blue the line goes through the **brown** wedge. This is the ‘classic’ recipe for **brown** so we’re pretty sure it’s going to work and the **color** wheel also says this. How well does it work in practice? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to the **color** **brown**, there are countless shades, from light, sandy beige to dark mahogany. Mixing a specific shade of **brown** can be complex as some **brown**s lean warmer and others cool, while some **brown** **color**s have a red, yellow, or green undertone. There are some basic **color** rules that you can follow, however. The fundamental answer for which **color**s make **brown** is the three primary **color**s—red, yellow, and blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Knowing how to create **brown** paint is crucial, especially if you want to use it in your artwork or craft projects. To make **brown** paint, it is important to ensure that the **color**s are correctly mixed. Depending on the mediums used, there are many different ways to make **brown** paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Warm **brown**s work well for painting brick, warm wood tones, and trees in sunlight. To make your **brown** warmer, experiment with adding red and/or yellow paint a little at a time. If the mixture becomes too warm, you can add a touch of blue paint to cool it down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your goal in deciding how to make **brown** paint is to make a glowing golden **brown**, mix in some orange and see how it turns up the sunshine in your **color**. Ocher paint can be helpful here, too. Add a little and watch how it brings nuance to your golden-**brown** paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark **brown** paint generally falls into the categories of sepia or umber. These shades include a great deal of black to bring down the vibrancy and darken the overall **brown**ness. Try these **color** blends if you want to learn how to make tan paint darker or are starting from scratch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As soon as the **brown** has been combined, test it on a piece of paper to see how it will turn out when painted. As previously said, there are a plethora of possibilities available when it comes to combining **brown** **color** schemes. The most effective method to get a thorough understanding of this is to experiment with various mixtures by yourself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So let’s take a look at our **color** wheel. Around the outside we have all our different **color**s (or hues). Where is **brown**? Hmmm it’s not there. But the **color** wheel has all of the **color**s so it must be there somewhere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown can be created in a variety of ways in painting. One method is to create a darker form of orange. Having said that, the only perfect way to create orange in lights darker is to darken them, which only creates noticeably dimmer lights instead of changing their **color**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Well. Yes it’s possible but it’s a bit hit and miss. Adding a complement in can swing the hue quite a lot and we probably don’t want that. Now don’t get me wrong using complements in painting is a great technique to have in your armory as they, well, complement each other. But we’re talking about mixing a specific **color** here and adding in complements can get fiddly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fortunately, **brown** is a far simpler **color** to create. The most prevalent way to make **brown** is to combine equal parts of blue, red, and yellow paint together. Browns might also be created by combining complementary **color**s on the RYB (Red Yellow Blue) **color** wheel. Red and green, orange and blue, for instance, combine to form **brown**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Colors aid in the capture of feelings and emotions, particularly when they are used in painting and sculpture. When it comes to **brown**, there is a vast variety of tones that may be achieved. For example, you may use warm **color**s like yellow, red, and orange to give your **brown** more warmth and depth by mixing them in with your **brown**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, **brown** done the right way can be extremely sophisticated. It can even activate our senses like a cup of strong, nutty coffee or tart dark chocolate. You have every reason in the world to want to incorporate the **color** **brown** into your **color** expeditions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While these **color**s are just suggestions, they all draw out the very rich and deep beauty that can be easily overlooked due to the strength of **brown**. The bottom line on creating **brown** is that there’s no limit to how granular you can get when mixing shades of **brown** that occur in nature. Just remember that it all starts with a balance of red, yellow and blue. What you do after that depends on how rich or muted you’d like your **brown** to be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Green is a natural complementary **color** for **brown**. Green and **brown** **color**s work well together because they look familiar to us. We see these when we look around the natural world every day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mixing water**color** paints may be accomplished on a plate or a tray depending on your preference. Add the **color** first to a tiny puddle of water on the surface that you will combine with your hands. You may use a variety of **color**s to create this water puddle of your choosing. You will need to moisten the surface that you will be painting with water before you begin. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When painting with **brown**, it soon becomes obvious that this is a very overpowering **color**. This is one of the reasons why it works so well as an accent shade. However, you can successfully pull off painting in blocks of **brown** if you understand how to stage **brown**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Red and **brown** both have warm and rich undertones. Shades of or look amazing with **brown** accents. Orange – Orange and **brown** are another natural **color** combination as, together, these are reminiscent of autumn. Many oranges work well with **brown** including copper and bright orange . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So now we know. We have a number of answers to the question ‘what 2 **color**s make **brown**’. We have - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s good to begin with equal proportions so you don’t find yourself adding endless amounts of different colours and ending up with a muddy mess, but once you’ve got your basic **brown**, you can start to play around. Add some red, and you might get a warmer, chestnut **brown**. Add blue, and your shade will become colder and more purplish. Make sure you wash your brush before you add a new colour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Well that does work quite well. For the water**color** swatches we don’t have gray of course. I’ve added in a little black (which makes the **color** darker) and then a little water to bring the value back up again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes that works. But black tends to gray down **color**s so are there other ways? What about our blue and orange combination? If we add a little more blue to our orange than before that should pull it darker. But our blue probably isn’t dark enough to make a really dark **brown**. What other blues could we try? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s likely that you’ll make the mistake of adding too much white when trying to tone down **brown**. It’s not too late if you find that you’re headed more toward a cashew-**color**ed tone than a true **brown**. You can actually walk back your **color** a bit to restore the rich **brown** tones that you’re trying to achieve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In an effort to make **brown**, new painters sometimes just mix a little of everything together and hope for the best. Hoping for the best is not a good plan, even if you get lucky sometimes. Mixing a range of **brown**s does not have to be a mysterious shot in the dark, however. There are several benefits to learning to mix neutral **color**s (both **brown**s and grays). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **brown** shade may be created by combining equal quantities of paint from each primary **color** on a **color** mixing palette. It is fairly simple to combine the three primary **color**s. A little quantity of white may be necessary to alter the **color** of the final result. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Anyone who has looked around at **brown** dirt, sand, dogs, fall leaves and chocolates knows that there are endless shades of natural **brown** in the universe. As a result, you may want to tweak the Red + Yellow + Blue formula a bit to create very nuanced shades of **brown**. Take a look at the formulas for creating variants of **brown**: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re not sure where to begin with painting, acrylics are a brilliant starting point. They’re bright, quick-drying and water based, and they won’t cost you a fortune. On the page, acrylics may look a little darker than they were on the palette, so when you’re mixing **brown**s, adding a tiny amount of white or yellow can ensure you get the result you’re looking for. Adding a bit of white is also a great way to make your colours a touch more vibrant, and add complexity to store-bought shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Darker **brown**s work well for painting hair, twilight scenes, and dark wood. While it may be tempting to create dark **brown** tones using black paint, this can often create muddy tones. This may work for your painting, but often it does not. For a **brown** that is dark but still bright, add a dark blue paint such as ultramarine to the mix. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   , or intensity, is determined by the shades of the **color** you choose when determining how to make **brown** paint that works for you. Brighter yellows will create a more golden **brown**, while deeper reds will produce a more chocolatey shade and darker blues will result in a grayish **brown**. Value, or lightness and darkness, determines how soft or rich the **brown** is. Paler shades of primary **color**s will result in lighter **brown**s, while heavier shades will result in darker **brown**s. When learning how to make **brown** paint, all hues, saturations and values are worth experimenting with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These are **color**s that cannot be formed by combining other **color**s. The primary **color**s are red, yellow, and blue. You will create **brown** if you mix these **color**s in equal parts and proportions. However, if you prefer a light **brown** **color**, you may include some white into the mixture. In addition, altering the proportions of these hues will assist you in achieving various shades of **brown**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown, on the other hand, comes in a variety of distinct shades and variations that you may paint. A light blue or a dark blue can provide extremely varied results depending on the **color** of the blue ink that you use. If the **brown** isn’t quite perfect, you may always add extra yellow, red, or purple to get it closer to the desired **color**. With time and practice, you will be able to create **brown** paint in a variety of different shades and tones that will suit your needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is where the white paint comes in. Try adding small amounts of white paint and mixing thoroughly – you should end up with the chalky, calming autumnal tone that’s becoming popular in our homes. Make sure you add a little yellow from time to time, though – too much red with that white and you’ll end up with more of a pink than a **brown**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is the one that everybody goes huh? when we first encounter it. Chroma is how bright or intense a **color** is. A high chroma **color** would be something like a napthol red which hits a chroma number of 14 or 16. A lower chroma **color** would be something like yellow ochre which comes in around a chroma 6. And a completely neutral gray would have a chroma 0. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first method is to use complimentary **color**s on the **color** wheel; looking at the **color** wheel, the complimentary **color**s are the pairs that are directly across from each other. These are red and green, orange and blue, purple and yellow. When mixed together they cancel each other out, meaning you create a greyscale, and in some instances you will get different shades of **brown**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To get a dark **brown** **color**, dark **color**s must be used instead of the primary **color**s. If you want to produce a gloomy appearance, you may choose a dark **color** such as black or purple. Red, yellow, and blue can also be used, however, you will need to balance it out by adding more red to achieve a darker shade of **brown**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Squeeze out equal amounts of blue, red, and yellow. Start mixing equal quantities of each **color** using a palette knife. Keep adjusting the mix by adding tiny bits of the paint **color** needed to bring it closer to the wanted result (see Table 2 above). Keep mixing with the palette knife until you reach a nice warm **brown** and all streaks from the original **color**s are gone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light shades of **brown**, such as tan and taupe, set the scene for a calm, serene space, and add natural warmth that pairs well with whites as well as more vibrant **color**s. Dark **brown**s add a moody vibe and sophisticated drama to a room. Dark **brown** delivers high-end saturated **color** to instantly elevate a space, giving it character and creating a backdrop that showcases furniture and decor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – The moody look of purple is a great look with **brown**. Pair deep and earthy with red undertones with **brown** for a dramatic look. Black and white – Both black and crisp white are neutral shades that complement many shades of **brown**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is a **color** that is used to depict simplicity and objects that are in their natural states. Brown is often used to represent strength, stability, and warmth by artists because of its direct connection to the earth and naturally occurring hues. Brown may be utilized to convey feelings of security and reliability. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The general rule for making dark **brown** paint is to add black. Just as you would add white for light **brown**, black can be used to darken it. There are countless shades of dark **brown**, from rich mahogany to warm caramel, and the specific tint of **brown** will depend how much red, yellow, or blue you use. To add warmth to your dark **brown**, add more yellow; to make it cooler, add more blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Well let’s start with the obvious. Black is the darkest **color** so if you want to make dark **brown** then add some extra black. And this does work. Let’s try it with all our orange and black mix and our yellow and violet mix: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown on the **color** wheel is a shade of other hues, specifically a duller version of red, red-orange, orange, or yellow-orange. Because **brown** is a darker and duller shade of yellow-orange, orange, red-orange, and red, to know how to make **brown**, you need to learn how to dull and darken a **color**. An easy way to dull a **color** (lower the chroma or saturation) is by mixing it with its complementary **color**, the one opposite on the **color** wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What else can we try? Taking another look at our wheel we see that both red and green are the same distance from orange. So according to our rule if we mix them they’ll meet in the middle and make **brown**. And they do! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Therefore, you can easily mix **color**s to get the shade you want. Painting realistically will need a thorough understanding of **color** theory and the ability to combine different hues. Knowing how to correctly mix **color**s can assist you in becoming a more accomplished painter and artist. Being able to effectively combine **color**s is a valuable problem-solving ability that all aspiring artists should be able to acquire. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since **brown** is deemed a neutral **color**, it is frequently used in fashion. Because they are simple to mix with other neutrals or bright **color**s, **brown** is a staple in many western wardrobes today. Artists and designers may use a wide range of **color** approaches in their respective fields. When using analogous **color** schemes, hues on opposite sides of the **color** wheel tend to mix to create a seamless effect. Furthermore, these **color**s make each other pop out more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you might all know, the RYB **color** model employs the **color** wheel that almost all folks learned in elementary school. Looking at the image right above, you can see that blue, red, and yellow are the three major **color**s in the primary **color**s category. And the mixtures of those **color**s might produce the other **color**s. Brown is created by combining equal amounts of these three primary **color**s. So, while mixing **brown** with other **color**s is nearly impossible, it is still feasible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So pigment mixing is complicated. And the reason yellow and purple can make **brown** is due to the slight bias of the yellow and purple towards orange. If you take a greenish yellow and and bluish purple you won’t get **brown** you’ll get something slightly the other side of the wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But that’s not all you need to know about mixing **brown** and blue. In fact, the resulting **color** will differ slightly or significantly, depending on various elements. So, let’s dig into it right now to discover the incredible world of **color** mixing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is a great **color** to consider having in your palette while painting with acrylics. One of the benefits of using acrylic paints is that they can easily be mixed and blended, which achieves more creative results. This provides a nice starting point for exploring various **brown** shades and combinations of **brown**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark **brown** is a timeless, elegant wall **color** choice, whether you're painting a formal dining room or updating a home office. It works with many different design styles from traditional to midcentury modern and as the main paint **color** or an accent **color**. This rich, neutral **color** packs a punch and adds sophisticated warmth while creating an intimate atmosphere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting can represent all visible objects with three **color**s, yellow, red, and blue.: for all other **color**s can be conpos’d of these three. — Jakob Christof Le Blon, 1720s - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some reds are warmer and lean towards yellow, like the cadmiums, others are cooler and lean towards blue, like the magentas. Warm reds will give you a warmer **brown**. Robie Benve - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first recorded use of wood **brown** as a **color** name in English was in Robert Ridgway's 1886 book Nomenclature of Colors for Naturalists, Compendium of Useful Knowledge for Ornithologists.[20] Ridgway further refined the details of its **color** coordinates in his 1912 publication Color Standards and Color Nomenclature.[21] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Complement the chromatic circle with complementary or opposing shades, or the three main **color**s, to provide depth and dimension. If you would like to make a lighter shade of **brown**, you should use brighter **color**s as opposed to darker **color**s. Alternatively, if you want to create a darker shade, you should use darker **color**s over brighter ones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’ve set your sights on a bigger project, you might be looking to mix larger amounts of **brown** paint for walls or furniture. Although you probably won’t be looking to make your **brown** paint from scratch, the same mixing principles apply – add dark to light in small quantities and create swatches of each shade until you’re happy with the result. Make sure you let it dry completely, as depending on the shade, colours can change significantly as they dry. Lighter colours tend to dry darker than they appear, and darker colours tend to dry lighter. The more you experiment, the more you’ll get to know the paints, and soon, you’ll be able to create a range of **brown** paint, from light, comforting earth tones to rich russet and puce. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink – Various shades of pink work well with **brown**. Blush is a current favorite to pair with **brown**. Fuchsia is a shade between purple and pink. Adding fuchsia accents to a room with **brown** is stunning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Each blue has a different relative temperature, opacity, and **color** bias. Ultramarine blue, for example, is a fairly transparent hue, with a red bias that makes it a warm blue. So it’s warmer than cobalt blue but cooler than cobalt turquoise, which tends more toward yellow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is a very special case in the **color** family. That’s because it’s one of the only **color**s created by mixing the three primary **color**s. Yes, mixing red, yellow and blue will get you **brown**. Of course, the ratio that you use when blending the **color**s will determine the intensity of the **brown** you create. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, **brown** is a neutral **color**. A lot of vibrancy and intensity are absent from neutral **color**s. By blending two **color**s that are complementary to one another, you may get these neutral **color**s. Other neutral **color**s are white, beige, and tan, among others. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Burnt umber is made by heating raw umber, which dehydrates the iron oxides and changes them partially to the more reddish hematite. It is used for both oil and water **color** paint. At a hue of 9, it is classified as a red-**brown**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Together, **brown** and green shades mimic the **color**s of the forest which is pleasing and natural to the eye. Both and have wonderful shades that work with **brown** tones. Blue – Brown and blue tones work together as a study in contrast. Also, the bright and vibrant shades of blue will balance out the neutral background of **brown**. The shades of blue that work best with **brown** are navy blue, turquoise, and pale blue . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The combination of dark **brown** and fuchsia is unexpected, but it looks natural in this living room from Liz Levin Interiors. Brown pairs best with other warm **color**s and fuchsia makes sense in this context. The light blue touch in the wallpaper cools the overall warm design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Sepia is a shade of **brown** that takes its name from the ink sac of the cuttlefish, Sepia. Walnut **brown** – The shade of **brown** represents the **color** of walnuts. It is a deep **brown** with yellow undertones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Keeping these principles in mind when it comes to the **color** **brown**, you can also combine a secondary **color** with its complementary **color**. By looking at the **color** wheel, that would mean combining blue and orange will give you **brown**, as will purple and yellow. Each of these **brown**s will look slightly different; **brown** mixed from blue and orange will give you a **brown** with a green base, while **brown** mixed from purple and yellow will be warmer with a yellow tint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For most of our mixes we should just be able to add water (for water**color**) or white (for acrylics or oils) to lighten all of our **brown**s. With water**color** the **color** hue shouldn’t shift when you add water. With oils and acrylics adding white can push the **color** to a slightly different hue. It’s something to watch out for and can be quite noticeable if you’re mixing a very red **brown**. Here’s the results: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Primary **color**s are **color**s that can’t be mixed from any other **color**s. They are the reds, yellows, and blues. Secondary **color**s are the **color**s made by mixing pairs of primary hues. Oranges, greens, and purples are the secondary **color**s. Red and yellow make orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Set up your palette. Place approximately equal-sized dollops of red, yellow, and blue on your palette, with plenty of space between each **color**. Add a dollop of white too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If we take a closer look at our **color** wheel all of the **color**s are very saturated. They’re the brightest we can get to in paint. We know that **brown** isn’t bright so let’s redraw our **color** wheel and darken each of the **color**s on the outside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is only when you begin to combine **brown** with complementing **color**s that you will understand how versatile **brown** can be. A new shade of **brown** is constructed by mixing each of the two pairs. Colors that are complementary to secondary **color**s are as follows: Blue and orange, as well as yellow and purple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Russet, a **color** of fall, is often associated with sorrow or grave seriousness. Anticipating a lifetime of regret, Shakespeare's character Biron says: "Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd / In russet yeas and honest kersey noes." (Love's Labour's Lost, Act V, Scene 1) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You only have a handful of **color**s that really work in harmony with **brown**. This is especially important to know if you’re creating a shade of **brown** paint because you intend to paint a room or accent wall in **brown**. In addition, knowing about **brown**’s flattering companion **color**s is also important if you’ll be slathering a canvas in rich, **brown** paint. Here’s a look at the **color**s that work with **brown**: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And they’re all the same hue (orange/red). But the chroma is changing from 2 to 12. And you can see that the **color** gets more saturated as it goes from left to right. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We know that if we mix complements (reds and greens, blues and oranges, yellows and purples) we should get a gray. We know that **brown** is a dark orange so we *should* be able to lower the chroma by adding in its complement – blue. Let’s try it – to the brushes! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is where the mixing comes in. Sure, you could buy a tube of **brown** paint and call it a day, but in order to get a precise, vibrant shade, there’s nothing better than making it yourself. Once you find the right balance of colours, you’ll be able to fine-tune your hue, so whatever you’re painting, you’ve got the perfect colour . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Looking at the CMYK **color** model above, you can see that it is the inverse of the RGB **color** model. The primary **color**s include yellow, cyan, and magenta, with secondary **color**s being red, green, and blue. Notwithstanding that it appears to be comparable to the RGB **color** model, the **color** **brown**, in fact, does actually exist in it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the other hand, you typically see darker variations of a **color**, which is commonly known as shades. They are darker versions of a **color**. Because a blue and **brown** paint combination is generally dark to start with, you will not have to worry about this. However, if you want it to show up even darker, simply add a dash of black to the combination. But always bear in mind when using black in this mixture because a little black paint goes a long way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before I begin, I think it’s important to understand what **brown** really is. I mean it’s a pretty confusing **color** to define isn’t it? Here’s a rule of thumb, think of **brown** as a type of orange. So simplifying this, I know that orange is made of red and yellow, and that red and yellow are warm tones. In order for a **color** to look **brown**, the warm tone must be the predominant tone, if the cool tone is stronger than the warm tone, then the **brown** can turn blue, purple, or green. To visualize this more, you can see the different **color** mixing proportions and combinations in my **color** mixing cheat sheet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   White: Crisp, pristine white creates a beautiful contrast with a dark or chocolate **brown**. The contrast created is pleasing to the eye because it is much gentler than the classic black-and-white contrast. However, it creates that same elegant effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lights employ the RGB (Red Green Blue) **color** model rather than the RYB (Red Yellow Blue) **color** model. So, when you combine the three primary **color**s on this RGB **color** wheel, you will have the **color** white rather than **brown**. Brown, in fact, is not represented on the RGB **color** model, and you can’t really make **color** shades, and tints like you can interact with different physical art substances. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Displayed at right is the **color** that is called **brown** in the RYB **color** model. It is an equal mix of red, yellow and blue.[3] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is versatile and forgiving. It grounds a **color** scheme as well as adds depth and complexity. Therefore, you can use both bright and muted shades of blue to pair with **brown**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For the most part, the **color** **brown** was used to make darker backgrounds with lighter foregrounds or subjects in the 18th century. The earthy hues were supposed to represent humility and intellect and were popular in the 1700s. The use of the **color** **brown** also allowed painters to create realistic renderings of sights and places in a natural environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The theory that **brown** is made by mixing together all the primary colours (red, blue, yellow) doesn’t always hold up, but it’s a good starting point. Use an equal amount of each colour and mix them together. You should end up with a flat, chocolate **brown**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **color** theory could also be better understood by combining different **color**s. You may even discover some fresh and amazing **color**s to use through experimentation. So, only because blue and **brown** are an unusual **color** combination, it does not really mean you should ignore them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A popular light **brown** **color** is taupe, which has pinkish undertones. To make the **color** taupe, mix the three primary **color**s together, add in some white to get the desired lightness, then little by little mix in a bit more red. If you want to create a tan **color**, follow the same steps, but instead of adding in extra red, add in extra yellow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   More blue in the combination might produce a bluish tint in the resulting **color**, especially teal. As a result of the blue being added, its tone **color** value will start to lighten. It is worth noting that the blue hue you choose will have an effect on the final **color**. For example, cerulean blue is innately lighter than ultramarine and therefore helps to make a muddy and dark **brown** less strenuous. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So, when it comes to secondary **color**s, what two **color**s make **brown**? With secondary **color**s, you will no longer need to use the three primary **color**s. Instead, you will only have to use two. For example, mixing red and green will give you **brown**. Brown may also be made using the **color**s blue and orange, respectively. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To be able to blend **color**s appropriately, **brown** is one of the most crucial hues to know. Various **brown** tones are required while painting various objects and for generating illumination and transitions in paintings. Having an understanding of how to manufacture **brown** paint is vital for really bringing your artwork to life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For example, if you start from a red, the complementary **color** that you want to add is green. You may use a green out of the tube, or mix your own from yellow and blue paint. My favorite pure green is the result of mixing lemon yellow with a bit of phthalo blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Actually that last one was a bit of a cheat. Payne’s gray is a combination of pigments – often ultramarine and black. That’s why it appears blue. So we’re really just using orange + blue + black for a dark **brown**. Just like we did in the previous section. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is a **color** that we see practically every day. The **color** can be seen in wood, mud, and furnishings, among other things. The **color** is lovely, and it imparts a natural warmth as well as a feeling of aesthetic beauty. But what **color**s make **brown**? This article will explain the **color**s that combine to form the **color** **brown**, as well as how to create **brown**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you know how to mix paint properly, you will waste less paint in the long run. You may not always be able to locate the precise **color** shade that you want in a tube. Therefore, you can easily mix **color**s to get the shade you want. Painting realistically will need a thorough understanding of **color** theory and the ability to combine different hues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wow! I’d never thought of **brown** that way. Brown is a dark orange! But if you think about it it makes sense. We know **brown** is a ‘warm’ **color** so it makes sense it would be over near the reds and oranges. So now we know where **brown** sits on the **color** wheel we can answer the question ‘what **color**s do you mix to make **brown**?’. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is a relatively easy **color** to make. Most painters have experienced making “mud” by mistake. But what if your goal is to mix a specific shade of **brown**? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is a neutral **color** that comes in many different shades. By mixing different hues, you may get a variety of **brown** tints. A few of the most common **color**s in the **brown** category are light **brown**, sand **brown**, as well as dark **brown**. The quickest method of creating **brown** is to combine the primary **color**s in equal proportions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You could be able to recreate the **color**s if your blue and **brown** paints are unavailable or out of stock. Blue, in fact, is a tough **color** to create with paint because it is a primary **color**. The CMYK **color** model that is typically used for printer ink states that magenta cyan might combine to form blue. Nevertheless, because those **color**s are less popular in paint, it may be much simpler to purchase blue paint rather. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sandy **brown** is a pale shade of **brown**. Sandy **brown** is one of the web **color**s. At a hue of 28, it is classified as an orange-**brown**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For pigments, the brighter, purest **color**s are the primary **color**s red, yellow, and blue. As we mix primary **color**s they become somehow duller and darker. This is called subtractive **color** mixing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You might have noticed that the past decade has been all about cool shades of gray when it comes to interior design. But recently, the pendulum swings the opposite direction, with warm beige and **brown** tones popular once again. The **color** **brown** makes a space feel warm and cozy. From lighter hues that create an inviting feel to darker tones that make a dramatic statement, **brown** provides endless design possibilities and inspiration. The earthy and organic quality of the **color** makes it a popular neutral that will always be a classic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let us first begin with broad **color** families to find out what **color**s go with **brown**. In a sense, almost any **color** works well with **brown** provided that you choose the right shade of each. In general, it is best to pair warm **brown**s with other warm shades and cool **brown**s with cool **color**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Displayed at right is the **color** smokey topaz. At a hue of exactly 15, it is classified as a red-**brown** or orange-**brown**. It can also be called a vermilion-**brown**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   More **brown** would produce a muddier look. It might be a great **color** for making tones, with the coolness or warmth of the blended **color** depending on the **brown** hue used. In case a lighter **brown** is added, you might get a pastel shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A big portion of the process of learning to paint is based on experimentation, as well as luck. Many aspiring painters just throw paints together and hope for the best. Nevertheless, if you acquire the appropriate procedures and have a solid understanding of **color** theory, you will be able to reap a wide range of painting rewards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Look at the contrast in this classic bathroom. This designer brings together the stark white paneling with rosy chocolate **brown** walls. The rich **color** of the walls and textured wood accents balance the cool tones of the chrome fixtures and bright white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For artists, knowing how to create very specific and realistic shades of **brown** using paint **color**s they already have in their palette saves time and money. Yes, you can create masterful shades of **brown** using the main **color**s you probably already have in your art kit. What’s more, these techniques carry over even if you’re planning a much larger and ambitious interior décor project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To create a rich, dark **brown**, you’ll need to add more blue and red paint than yellow. You’ll notice there’s no black paint on the list – this is because generally, adding black can deaden your colours, removing the warm tones and making them dull and greyish. It’s best to stick to deep blues and reds to maintain the vibrancy of your paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The name of the **color** derives from russet, a coarse cloth made of wool and dyed with woad and madder to give it a subdued gray or reddish-**brown** shade. By the statute of 1363, poor English people were required to wear russet.[9] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are various words used to describe the many **brown** shades. Here is a quick primer on what those words mean. Of course, this is not an exhaustive list, but here are some of the most popular shades of **brown**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The deep purple walls create a rich backdrop for this wooden chest. Try this look in a foyer to create a look of drama. If you like this **color** purple, use Brinjal No.222 from Farrow & Ball. Don’t be afraid to mix it with **brown** furniture and a rug with deep **color**s to create a foyer with immediate elegance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   TIP: Keep tonal values in mind. The lightness or darkness of your blue and **brown** would also play a major part. Overall, the tonal values and tones you select are important! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is a **color** well beloved in interior design for its warm and solid presence. It represents both stability and reliability. Thus, it is understandable that the **color** **brown** has been a feature in art and design for thousands of years. It was first used in the form of umber, a pigment derived from the earth, in cave paintings and then in fine art and home design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A variety of **brown** shades are available, enabling the **color** to be manipulated in either direction. Some **brown**s feature overtones of yellow, red, or orange, which makes them seem to be a more welcoming **color**. Other **brown**s include more blue or purple pigments, giving them a cool **color** in contrast to the others. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The RGB **color** model, like some of you, might already know, is composed of visible light spectrum **color**s. As mentioned previously, blue, red, and green are the three key **color**s and are considered the primary **color**s. And when these **color**s combine, they form white. The **color**s might be changed by brightening or darkening the current lights, but this method does not produce **brown** lightly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is everywhere. From warming earth tones to deep, woodland shades, the world around us is full of **brown**. Whether you’re painting a wall, a portrait, a plant pot or a landscape, you’re bound to come across some variation of it – but given the amount of wildly different tones of **brown**, it can be tricky to find the one you’d like. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To make a dark **brown** mix, you want to start from three dark versions of your primaries. In the example below I used phthalo blue, a cool blue with very strong pigmentation, a little bit goes a long way; for the red, I picked pyrrole red dark, it’s a nice red, pretty close to true red, meaning that it’s not too cool or bluish, and not too warm, or yellowish. The yellow that I chose has a bit of a red bias and looks kind of yellow-orange, so I consider it a darker yellow, compared to lemon or light yellow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this blog, I talk about how to mix **brown** using three different methods. The first is using complimentary **color**s, the second using black paint, and the third using primary **color**s. In the video (below) you can see that I’m mixing the **color**s and then add white to it so you can see it in its dark and light form.

-   Whatever the blue **color** you use, the final outcome will be muddier or darker after being blended with **brown**. It may even have a bit of a clue of purple in certain instances. In fact, this is considered an unusual combination, but it is unlikely to be used frequently. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mix together using your palette knife. It will progress from being three distinct **color**s to a muddy mixture to **brown**. Your results may vary slightly, especially if you were using a different hue of any of the primary **color**s than I used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Orange and **brown** are another natural **color** combination as, together, these are reminiscent of autumn. Many oranges work well with **brown** including and . Yellow – Yellow adds a splash of a vivacious **color** to the staid sophistication of **brown**. Pair **brown** with Sunshine yellow and deep yellow ochre for a look with brilliant contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you examine the visible light spectrum, you will realize that it contains all of the rainbow **color**s except **brown**. In reality, the possibilities of you ever seeing a **brown** light are extremely remote. This is because **brown** light doesn’t really exist in nature, and any light that resembles **brown** is, as a matter of fact, orange that appears darker. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Yellow adds a splash of a vivacious **color** to the staid sophistication of **brown**. Pair **brown** with and for a look with brilliant contrast. Purple – The moody look of purple is a great look with **brown**. Pair deep and earthy plum with red undertones with **brown** for a dramatic look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What immediately enters your head when you think about the **color**s **brown** and blue? Blue conjures up images of water for us, while **brown** conjures up images of massive soil and **brown** tones in nature, for instance, tree trunks. Even though **brown** is a neutral **color** and blue is a primary **color**, both of them have roughly the same psychological effect.
