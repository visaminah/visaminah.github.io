## 9 Fun Facts What To Look For In A Photo Editing Monitor | Monitor For Gaming And Photo Editing
-   Look for a **monitor** large enough for comfortable, extended viewing during those day-long (or overnight!) **editing** sessions. Popular sizes include 19, 21.5, 24, 27, and 32" screens, with ultra-wide models also available. Larger, 40"+ **monitor**s are an option if you have the room to accommodate their suitable viewing distances. If you plan on doing any work on set, a 19" **monitor** offers a good compromise between screen size and portability with plenty of travel cases to choose from. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   HDR technology ups the color intensity and contrast of your images to a brilliant degree. Monitor brightness levels, expressed in cd/m2 (candelas per meter squared or nits), play a key role in HDR display; look for 1000 cd/m2 or higher for optimal HDR **editing**. HDR10 is the more common HDR standard with Dolby Vision or HDR10+ available in some **monitor**s, look for the standard supported by your **editing** system. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although it may seem that **monitor** features are being continually updated, we hope the above tips form a basis for choosing your video **editing** **monitor**. For a more in-depth look at log-format recording check out this article by my colleague, David Adler. Seeing is believing—stop by the B&H Photo SuperStore to look at some **monitor**s in person, and explore our wide selection on the B&H Photo website. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   LCD **monitor**s are widely used for **editing** and offer high-quality contrast ratios, brightness levels, and color-gamut compatibility. IPS (in-plane switching) LCD panels offer better viewing angles than their TN (twisted nematic) predecessors and support pro color spaces. OLED **monitor**s offer wide viewing angles, high contrast ratios and brightness levels, and true blacks; they tend to be higher-priced than same-size LCDs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   LUT (lookup table) support enables you to view your log recordings without their characteristic flat look; select **monitor**s can display side-by-side views of HDR and SDR (standard dynamic range) for comparison. Popular LUTs are come pre-loaded in some **monitor**s and/or can be loaded in via an USB port or SD card slot. Standard display tools on many **monitor**s include a vectorscope, histogram, exposure zebra, and frame markers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most production **monitor**s support a variety of input resolutions; it’s when you’re using formats on the higher or lower ends of the spectrum or less common frame rates that it’s important to confirm compatibility. Resolutions like DCI 4K (4096 x 2160), standard-def NTSC or PAL for legacy projects, and frame rates like 1080PsF 23.98/24 fall into this category. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re **editing** in 4K and you can swing the cost of a 4K or higher **monitor**, go for the higher resolution. On the other hand, if your existing **editing** system is 1080p-compatible and you’re not ready to upgrade to the greater processing and storage requirements of 4K, you can edit your 4K footage using proxies while viewing on a 1080p **monitor**. Lower-res footage can be displayed on a higher-res **monitor** (although it will be in a smaller, “windowed” form) so if you want to upgrade your **monitor** to 4K first, you can. Of course, if you’re color-grading in any significant way, you’ll be better off opting for the 4K+ resolution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Last, but absolutely not least, create a routine for calibrating your **monitor**. This aligns it to an established standard and is essential for maintaining a consistent look in your project. Some **monitor**s come with calibration software or can be adjusted by loading a calibration LUT. Your best bet might be a calibration program with a tethered probe since it can be used with multiple **monitor** models or, alternatively, you can hire a technician to do the first calibration and familiarize yourself with the process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What connections does your computer’s video I/O card provide? Monitor input ports include HDMI, 12G/6G/3G-SDI (BNC), Thunderbolt™, DisplayPort, USB and optical variations; make sure your display is compatible with your system’s video output. A loop-out port is a handy feature for feeding your signal to a larger **monitor** for director or client viewing during post-production. Select **monitor**s offer audio I/O options that enable you to split out embedded audio to external speakers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
