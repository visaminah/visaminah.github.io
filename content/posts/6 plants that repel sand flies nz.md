Road builders on the Milford Road and Haast Pass suffered clouds of them. While surveying road routes near Haast in the 1930s, Alan Dawber played a game with his mates: ?We used to compete with each other by baring our forearm to the sand**flies**, then when the first one made its presence felt, we would start killing them off one by one. I think the record was 64 before wiping the stinging mass clear.?1 - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Sand**flies**, like mosquitoes and other **flies**, are members of the order Diptera, and belong to the family Simuliidae. Similar species found elsewhere are called black**flies**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
