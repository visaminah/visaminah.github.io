## 38 Interesting Facts How To Mount A Sink To A Granite Countertop | Sink for granite countertops: how to choose the best option?
-   If silicone was used to glue down your under-mount **sink**, then you have another problem. Silicone can become notoriously strong after years of setting. The stronger the silicone bond, the harder it would be to remove the **sink** without causing your **granite** countertop some damage. While old silicone bonding can be removed using a knife, there are certain spaces that won’t allow you to do this without actually lifting the **granite** countertop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As for the undermount **sink**, cleaning is way easier as there’s no rim between the countertop and the rim. All you need to do is wipe the food crumbs down the **sink**. You also don’t need to worry about gunk buildup along the **sink** rim. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of undermount **sink**s. They cost a pretty penny, approximately 50-100% more than their rimmed counterparts. And because they’re a bit daunting to set up, their installation costs are also high. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We won’t sugarcoat the truth here. Replacing a drop-in with an undermount **sink** is difficult, and in most cases, the result is unsightly. Let us explain why. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To install the **sink**s, I applied a bead of DyanGrip Mirror, Marble, and Granite to the tip around the top. It’s VERY helpful to have an extra set of hands for this. I asked Danny to hold the **sink** under the countertop in position. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take your time and take great care to gather the right measurements. If you are off, even a little, you may have to recut the **granite** which isn't easy or cheap. You may even have challenges getting the **sink** to fit snugly in the countertop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Comparatively, undermount **sink**s require less countertop space than their drop-in countertops. As such, if your kitchen counter or bathroom vanity is short on space, the undermount **sink** can afford you slightly more surface area. It also allows you to draw more attention to your countertop material. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since 3cm **granite** (the typical thickness found in Austin) is about 1 and 3/16-inches thick, this makes the undermount **sink** seem a little deeper than it actually is. The **sink** is as deep as the depth of the **sink** PLUS the depth of the **granite**. So a 9-inch deep **sink** woud be over 10-inches deep once it is installed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before making a decision to replace your under-mount **sink**, it is always best to get the opinion of a professional plumber Sydney. Better yet, get the opinion of a **granite** professional. While we’re not suggesting that replacing an undermount **sink** without breaking the **granite** countertop is impossible, the opinion of the above-mentioned experts can at least help you make an informed decision before you push through with your project and all its attendant risks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Despite what most people think, marble is not a “soft” stone. True, it is relatively softer than **granite** in that it is easier to carve. It also easily scratches and stains relative to **granite**, which would explain this impression. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For years, only one debate has dominated the kitchen world: marble vs. **granite** vs. quartz countertops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can see that the opening must be perfectly cut for the size and shape of the **sink**. Also, the edge is polished, just like the top of the counter. The edge is called a flat-polish edge and is the same regardless of the style of edge profile you pick for the other edges on your countertops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also known as the rimmed or top-mount **sink**, the drop-in **sink** is perhaps the more popular of the two. From its name, you can easily guess that this **sink** drops into an opening on the counter. It also has a noticeable rim or ledge with a width varying from 0.5 inches to 2 inches surrounding the **sink**. This rim sits on top of the counter and helps hold the **sink** in place. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All our countertops at Marble and Granite work with undermount **sink**s. Ultimately, undermount **sink**s can be used with any type of stone countertop, whether its marble, **granite** or quartz. Their installation won’t present any real problems for a professional contractor and you could even handle the job yourself if you’re handy enough. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To make sure the opening in the countertop is perfect for the **sink**, we need the template that comes with the **sink** in the box. When you buy an undermount **sink** from us, we already have the template. Actually, when you buy the **sink** from us, we have the **sink** AND the template at our shop which saves you some running around. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An undermount **sink** typically pairs up with solid surface countertops (quartz, **granite**, etc.), and if you have a drop-in **sink**, most likely you have a tile or laminate countertop. In short, you cannot have either of those materials with an undermount **sink** since the edges of the material that supports the countertop will be exposed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 5: Add Backsplash and Caulk Backsplashes come in a million styles. You may opt for a **granite** backsplash piece to match your countertop, or you may do shiplap, or some kind of decorative wall treatment. You may even decide to skip backsplash altogether. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may also face some problems getting the undermount **sink** out of the cabinet even after you do manage to remove its silicone bonding. Space is just too small, and the **sink** will simply not be able to turn there for removal. Again, that would entail lifting the **granite** countertop, which brings us back to the risk of breaking it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Undermount **sink**s, on the other hand, work well with all countertop materials except custom tile and laminate tops. In the case of these two, the underlying MDF or particleboard fails to hold the clip fastener in place, making the installation less durable. Also, both laminate and custom tile tops are extremely vulnerable to water damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The drop-in **sink** has a rather traditional, timeless look. This means it can fit right into any countertop, no matter the kitchen style. For example, if you have a classic-style kitchen, you can get porcelain or enamel cast iron drop-in **sink** to complement the overall look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At the end of the day, there’s no outright winner. It’s all about which one you find more appealing. Just remember to keep your budget in mind when choosing between a drop-in **sink** and an undermount **sink**. All the best in your renovation journey! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Recently, though, another debate has taken over the kitchen space: undermount vs. drop-in **sink**s. Some homeowners swear by the undermount **sink**s, while others would rather stick with the more conventional drop-in **sink**s. All in all, it’s a debate that’s worth the while. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An undermount **sink** is installed beneath the **granite** countertop, usually by glueing the lips of the **sink** basin to the bottom of the countertop and otherwise strapping or supporting it. A drop-in **sink**, conversely, is set down into the countertop with its rim over the edge of the **granite**. With both, you need to be careful to prevent moisture or grime build-up inside the seam. Each style has its own unique advantages, which you should consider when choosing a style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Conversely, installing an undermount **sink** is a pretty challenging task. It needs to be installed below the countertop, so you need to have a complete understanding of the right techniques, methods, and tools. Not to mention the **sink** itself is quite heavy, which means you’ll most definitely require a professional hand during installation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As for **sink** material, the industry standard for an undermount **sink** is stainless steel, made popular because of its low price point and because it’s easy to clean, sterilize, or polish. Stainless steel is also widely available in a dual-basin model. We also offer BLANCO-line composite-stone **sink**s made from 80 percent **granite** that, though more expensive, will retain the impression of a kitchen or bathroom hewn from natural materials while coming in a variety of colors and designs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let’s say for instance that your under-mount **sink** has a lip that is snugly tucked under a cabinet’s walls. If this is the case, the countertop has to be lifted. That, however, exposes you to the risk of breaking the **granite** countertop. Always keep in mind that if you really want to replace the undermount **sink**, make sure you are ready for the possibility that the **granite** countertop might break, and that you are willing and able to replace it should that happen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As for the undermount **sink**, it lacks that rim that sits on top of the counter. Rather, this **sink** mounts under your countertop and stays in place thanks to extra durable calk, metal clips, or adhesive. You must install these support clips during installation to ensure your **sink** mounts safely beneath the counter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Marble and **granite** countertops have always been a popular choice for kitchen countertops, but it was primarily for its looks. In this case, they are ideal for undermount **sink**s because they also happen to be durable. The fact that they are porous also helps in helping the adhesives bind more firmly with the stones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A stainless-steel undermount **sink**s adds a final touch of class to a **granite** countertop, and although the job of installing one may seem difficult, it isn't any more so than installing a conventional **sink**. The installation is only as secure as the glue you use, however, so it pays to use the strongest two-part epoxy cement you can find. Another key to proper installation is to take your time. Give the glue even more time to cure than is specified on the label so there's no danger of the bond breaking when you fill the **sink**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In addition to measuring the opening and the **sink**, don't forget to measure cabinet depth as well as distance from the backsplash. The backsplash is particularly important because it will impact where you position the **sink** in your counter. Your faucet and veggie sprayer need clearance between the **sink** and backsplash. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We sell **sink**s as well as **granite** counters. When you come in to our Austin **granite** shop off North Lamar, we can show you a catalog of popular **sink** styles. You can also bring in one from somewhere else to go with your new countertops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How to Install a Granite Countertop Once we had the vanity, the top, and the **sink**s, it was time to install it. You can check out the video for this here (this also includes some info about the shower install as well!), and the step by step process below: *This post contains affiliate links. See policies. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whatever style you choose, make sure that it matches not only the **granite** but the rest of your home's general décor. You should also think about size and use patterns when choosing your **sink**. Is your kitchen small? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally, however, marble is much more durable and flexible than other metamorphic stones, a category of rocks to which it belongs. Marble countertops weather very well under all conditions, and they last for generations without visible damage. While you can scratch it with most pointed instruments, it will take a lot of force to actually damage the integrity of the slab. Marble countertops can handle any load that an undermount **sink** can put on them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you don't ask the fabricator of the countertop to drill these holes and install the threaded insert to accept mounting screws, they simply won't do it, because they have no idea of knowing what size or even style of **sink** that you are planning on using. If you provide them with dimensions and a template, they should certainly be able to accommodate this simple wish. Whatever you do, please don't rely solely on a bead of adhesive/epoxy or silicone to hold up your new undermount **sink** - it likely won't last. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Especially with **granite**, it is essential that your **sink** is installed and sealed correctly. If it isn't then you may run the risk of water leaks down the road, which could cause costly damage to your **granite**, cabinetry, and floors. Better safe than sorry, rely on the professionals! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In terms of appearance, the undermount **sink** takes things a notch higher. It comes in a clean, streamlined, modern look that goes well with contemporary kitchen styles. And if you need the effect to be a little stronger, simply pick the same material as your countertop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Don’t forget that choosing a smaller **sink** will increase your available counter space. If you are someone who cooks frequently, a double basin **sink** is handy for food prep and washing dishes. If you follow these simple steps, your kitchen remodel will go off without a hitch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
