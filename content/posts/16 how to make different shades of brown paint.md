-   If you find that the **brown** you have created is too blue, you can add some orange or red to form a caramel or honey color. Is the **brown** too yellow?

-   To create a light **brown** color using primary colors, place equal amounts on your palette. Combine the red, blue, and yellow colors using a palette knife or your brush until it reaches a **brown** color. You can include a tiny amount of white to make the **brown** lighter.
