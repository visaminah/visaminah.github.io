-   Fixed **mount**: This is the most basic form of TV wall **mount** out there, positioning your TV almost flush to your wall to give as discreet an appearance as possible. While this simplistic approach can be desirable for some, fixed options often don’t allow any movement or tilt of the TV whatsoever. With fixed **mount**s, it’s also vital to check that installation will not block any of the TV’s inputs once it’s up on the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

This opens up more options for a larger TV stand with more storage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   VESA, formally known as the Video Electronics Standards Association, is the display standards organisation responsible for the four circular threaded holes found on the back of TVs. Your VESA standard is the distance between these holes measured horizontally, then vertically, in millimetres, from the centre of each hole. For example, a TV **mount** stating a VESA compatibility of “75 x 75mm to 400 x 400mm” means that it will work with all TV VESA standards from 75 x 75mm up to 400 x 400mm, including all the sizes in between. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Give your home entertainment pride of place with TV stands for **55**" screens.

Just because you can, though, it doesn’t automatically follow that you should. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Capable of bearing a **55**kg load, even if you fluff up the installation, the **mount**’s clever Easy Glide system allows for quick and easy post-**mount** TV levelling. Meanwhile, cable access is made gloriously easy: simply pull the TV forward and up from off the wall, letting the **mount**s take the weight. Although this is a fixed **mount** and therefore unable to offer any tilt or swivel manoeuvrability, it does allow possibly the easiest and most convenient installation experience available. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tilting **mount**: These **mount**s allow you to angle the TV to better suit your environment. If you have to **mount** your screen higher than you might like (more on that in a minute), then you can adjust it to suit viewing from a lower position. Also, if reflections are an issue, you can simply tilt the TV away from them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Various options are available when choosing a wall **mount** for the TCL **55**" Class 5 TV. All wall **mount**s are different and have specific weight limits and VESA size ranges. Some wall **mount**s are fixed and don't move, while others have more flexibility with a full range of motion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
