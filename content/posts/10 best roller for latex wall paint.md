## 10 Tips for Best Roller For Latex Wall Paint | best roller for interior latex paint
-   Every **paint** **roller** cover has a nap length. Usually these run from about 3/16″ which are very fine to 1 1/2″ in length which look like a muppet on a stick. This measurement is the length of the fibers that are attached to the **roller** core. The longer the nap the more fiber you have on the **roller** cover. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Synthetic material that provides premium longevity and excellent ability to hold **paint** without splattering. Dralon® – This is a woven acrylic fabric coated with Teflon that Purdy uses in their White Dove line of **roller** covers which provides an extremely lint free product. This is one of my personal favorites for multi-purpose use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Natural covers are best for oil-based **paint**s or primers. If used with latex **paint**s, the water in the **paint** may swell the fibers, causing them to become matted. Blended covers (polyester / wool blend) – These combine the extra pickup of wool with polyester for longer life. Can be used with all **paint**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Longer naps are better for rougher surfaces because they can get into the nooks and crannies and they carry more **paint**. Shorter nap **paint** **roller** covers are better for smoother surfaces because they leave less texture on the surface resulting in a smoother finish, but they carry far less **paint** per charge than the heavier naps. Like with anything in **paint**ing it’s a bit of a balancing act to find the perfect nap for the job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purdy also has a unique **roller** system called the Revolution® Jumbo Mini **roller** which may sound like a misnomer since I can’t seem to understand how something can be jumbo if it is mini at the same time, but it is an accurate name. They have a larger 3/4″ core for these **roller**s which for me seems to make the **roller** roll better than traditional mini **roller**s which easily get gummed up with **paint**. These Revolution® **roller**s are available in both 4 1/2″ and 6 1/2″ sizes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – These combine the extra pickup of wool with polyester for longer life. Can be used with all **paint**s. Foam – These **roller**s carry very little **paint** per charge but can be used for ultra smooth surfaces due to their lack of any nap. They leave little to no texture on surfaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also keep in mind that traditional **roller** cages take effort to remove the **roller** cover due to the pressure they exert on the cover; whereas Purdy uses a quick-release design that allows less struggle to take off the **roller** cover. This means less mess (and effort) when trying to remove the **roller** cover. Always a win in my book. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For the roughest surfaces with deep grooves like mortar joints and troweled stucco you need a very heavy nap and that’s where these big boys come in. The extra long nap will leave a rough texture on a smooth surface but on rough surfaces you need those long fibers to get deep into the crevices and carry a lot of **paint** with them. Depending on how rough the surface is you can range from 3/4″ to as long as 1 1/2″ depending on the coverage you need. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a **paint** project coming up be sure to search the archives here at The Craftsman Blog and visit Purdy to find the best **paint**s tools for the job. I’ve trusted their brushes and **roller**s since I started in the business of restoring old buildings and they have never let me down. Good luck and happy **paint**ing! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – This is a woven acrylic fabric coated with Teflon that Purdy uses in their White Dove line of **roller** covers which provides an extremely lint free product. This is one of my personal favorites for multi-purpose use. Natural covers (mohair or lambswool) – Natural covers are best for oil-based **paint**s or primers. If used with latex **paint**s, the water in the **paint** may swell the fibers, causing them to become matted. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
