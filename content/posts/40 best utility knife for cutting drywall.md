## 40 Tips for Best Utility Knife For Cutting Drywall | Best Hand Tool To Cut Drywall
-   If you're doing some home renovations, a utility **knife** can be your best friend. A utility **knife** is a great tool to use for removing paint. Simply cut around the unwanted area with the **knife** and scrape off all of the bits of removed paint to reveal a fresh surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also adhere to sticky tape from one side of the shim at an angle used as your **cutting** guide for trimming. This way, you will have a straight edge to push up against instead of your fingers when ripping into them; it's important not to slip or pull by hand as this might tear through your shim if there are any rough edges on it. So instead, just push up gently against the **cutting** guide and slide the blade along. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I'd recommend using a utility **knife** to ensure clean lines on any paint job. Utility knives are more precise, and they allow for more careful **cutting** than tools typically used for paint, like an electric sander or sandpaper. All in all, the time it takes to do something with just a utility **knife** will be significantly less than if you were working with either of those other two tools. It'll make for a less frustrating and potentially hazardous painting experience as well! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use the utility **knife** to score a line on the back of the flap that you want to tear off. To avoid marking up your plastic, an adhesive use in packaging can be placed along one side of the scored line and then adhere it on top of itself with some pressure before ripping off from that side. Try working around corners or points by **cutting** through at 45-degree angles for simpler tearing and less ragged edges for larger plastics. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Despite the utilitarian design, this utility **knife** is by no means a good choice for heavy use. Construction quality is not to blame for this; the EAB simply lacks the level of comfort we desire for routine handling. However, the blade is reliable. It also easily clips onto your cash and cards, so you can have it accessible and ready to use when you need it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A sharp and new utility **knife** is your best bet. Carefully place the blade on the laminate, firmly hold the handle, and gently peel back the edge to cut through it. Simply start where you want to cut and drag the blade smoothly but firmly along. Make sure not to apply too much pressure or put too much weight on one side of the board before **cutting**! And don't worry about making a clean straight line; just work your way around until you're satisfied with how deep your cut is. You can always sand off any rough edges with an electric sander if they're really bothering you! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are various methods for splitting shims with a utility **knife** blade. The best way is to hold the shim in one hand and puncture the side of one edge with a utility blade in the other hand. Next, push down on top of the blade with your thumb or forefinger while still holding onto the shim with your remaining fingers (you can also use both if you want). Finally, move downward, away from yourself, along the slanted edge of the shim towards where you want it to split off from. Make sure not to slide back up because this creates an unrepairable cut and will leave jagged edges that could snag clothing or scratch skin when in use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A utility **knife** is a tool designed for **cutting** foam boards, which are often used as insulation. Usually, it comes with a set of replacement blades, or you can buy blades individually. Utility knives are powerful and quick, so caution is needed if it's not being handled by someone who knows what they're doing (typically not kids). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most common All purpose utility **knife** blade on the market is what we call Long straight **knife** blades. The terms trapezoidal or universal blade works well. These are 59mm long and are excellent for **cutting** plasterboard. Another very useful Trapezoid blade is the short straight **knife** blade which has a length of 52mm and three mounting notches in the back. The short straight **knife** blade can be used when you want a shorter and more robust tip on the **knife** blade that is better fixed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The easiest and most foolproof way to remove paint-coated screws is to use a utility **knife**. Simply set the blade width on your utility **knife** at just slightly bigger than your screw's diameter, position the tip of the blade against one shaft of the screw, and gently apply pressure until you feel it cut through about 2mm into it. Next, rotate the screw counter-clockwise with light pressure against the blade. Finally, abrade all around its circumference until it has been depressurized from simple nesting/leaned off before completely removing it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is possible to carve wood with a utility **knife**. The biggest challenge about utilizing one for carving purposes is the limited control you have compared to an actual wood carving **knife**. With that being said, it's still entirely doable and great for simple designs where intricate details aren't required. Keep in mind that this blade may become dull fairly quickly on thick pieces of wood, so be sure to change your blade frequently enough so you don't end up over-longing the **cutting** process because the edge can no longer effectively cut through whatever material you are working with at any given time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's a fabulous idea! This is how to use a utility **knife** for removing old grout. Simply place the blade on the surface of the grout along the seam lines you want to cut out and make a light pass in one direction only. The sharp edge will take care of any remnant paper, excess grout, dust, or paint residue left behind from chiseling off plaster walls. Scrape gently and evenly across your seam line and discard debris as you work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sollex's range of long utility blades for different materials. The blades are 59/60mm long and fit most knives on the market. Some of the blades have a coating on the edge, which makes them better suited for **cutting** in certain tougher materials. You can read more about Sollex's qualities and coatings here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fiberglass insulation has a siliconized aluminum coating that prevents air from circulating through it. Your utility **knife** should be able to slash the top of the insulation off. However, the material becomes very stiff and hard when cut, so stretching it and making as clean a cut as possible is important for an easy removal process. Apply firm pressure on one side while you slowly slash your blade across the top; this should do well to loosen up enough of the fiberglass compound to allow it to be easily peeled away from its copper coil lining. Next, remove all of the loose fibers using long-handled tweezers or your fingers--you'll need latex gloves if they're your personal preference for safety purposes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drywall **cutting** saws come in two styles, rubber handles, and wooden handles. Rubber handles are light and durable compared to the wooden handles. The wooden handle varieties are a little bit longer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can use a utility **knife** to start sanding down some of each side near the nail head to correct this issue. With luck, this will allow both sides of your nails to be exposed without popping back into place before topping off with paint or finish. In doing so, you get thicker material on each side of your new joint when applying paint or finish for quicker drying time and smoother surfaces! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many available utility knives on the market. Opinions vary on which is best for slicing through caulk as the blades tend to vary in thickness, sharpness, flexibility, and durability. The most common kind of blade handymen use is a drywall or "joint" **knife** that's slightly flexible and angled at 45 degrees, allowing it to get into tight corners easier. The angle also helps it slice through caulk more easily than a standard flat blade would. It also has a short handle that makes people with small hands feel more comfortable handling this product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As for the rigid knives, these models best fit into work bags or a side pocket. The lack of a clip attached to these knives, particularly the Stanley models, certainly makes them prone to slip out of the pocket they are stored in. The OLFA is an exception as its rubber grip helps keep the **knife** where you put it, but this means it's hard to get it in and out of a pocket. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If pressed to find some issues with this **cutting** tool, we would say that if you are doing a lot of work with a utility **knife** (e.g., on a framing project or a remodel), the act of unfolding the tool may become annoying. Additionally, it is a bit bulky for front pocket storage, particularly when squatting. Minor shortcomings aside, this tool is built for heavy use and fits in well in a professional kit or shop drawer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To scribe a hinge mortise, use this procedure. First, mark off the lines for the hinges on the two doors that will be hinged together at right angles to each other. Next, with a utility **knife**, cut along both lines up through the end of one line and down to meet it so that you have two U-shaped cuts with equal widths in both pieces (one cut on either side of an imaginary 90° angle). Next, stand these two pieces up, overlap them and then clamp them in place. Then using your utility **knife** or another sharp blade, make three to four long hash marks across both sides where shown, sawing back and forth across them until you feel the tip bump against something solid inside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Utility knives are one of the most versatile tools in the toolbox for day-to-day **cutting** tasks. Many people use them to do softer material, provided they have a blade that isn't too thin and can handle the task at hand. Even so, it's always best practice to know what your **knife** is recommended for before you cut anything up! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A utility **knife** is also a great tool for removing wallpaper. Using the blade, it's easy to cut out pieces of wall décor that are hanging on while leaving the walls intact. While you could use other tools like an Exacto **knife** or razor blade, the utility **knife** is perfect because its serrated edge will clear away any glue residue much more quickly and efficiently than a straight edge would. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The grip defines the power and leverage you can exert onto the **cutting** edge. Since we used the Stanley 1992 blade on all the tools (except the OLFA), the grip is the most crucial feature. If the grip is short or narrow, the control and power over the blade decreases. Grip was assessed by **cutting** various materials, including cardboard, garden hoses, rubber molding, nylon webbing, sheetrock, wooden dowels, and braided rope. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Milwaukee Fastback Folding is a do-it-all **knife** that conveniently folds and clips to a pocket or belt. The **knife** easily opens one-handed and provides 5 1/2 inches of gripping real estate. There are several nifty tools built into the unit, including a gut hook and a cord cutter. The magnetized, five-blade storage arm that folds out opposite the blade further adds to this model's utility. The construction is solid, and the open and close lock is well thought out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When buying a drywall utility **knife**, the most reliable design is a simple one. Look for a **knife** with a metal housing, usually aluminum, and a simple anchor screw holding the two sides of the metal housing together. Though you may hesitate about having to remove a screw every time you have to replace the blade, this type of design provides the durability needed when **cutting** thousands of sheets of drywall. After dealing with the hassle of cleaning the moving parts associated with quick release or retractable blades, trying to unfreeze a frozen utility **knife**, you will quickly come to appreciate the simple durable design a basic drywall utility **knife** provides. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A utility **knife** is a great tool to have on hand for many different jobs. It can be used in the garden, trimming tree branches, or even **cutting** up boxes that you might need to move into your new apartment. If you are looking for an affordable and versatile utility **knife** that will last through any task, this article has provided some excellent information that should help make your decision easier. In addition, we hope we've helped provide insight into what a utility **knife** can do and how it may just become one of your most valued tools! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Larger drywall nicks can be eliminated with a utility **knife**. However, when **cutting** drywall, it's important to keep the utility **knife**'s blade straight and hold the handle of the **knife** back against your thumb. Otherwise, you might discover that using a utility **knife** to cut drywall is not as simple as just following along a line on your sketch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best way to remove painted baseboards is to use a utility **knife** while applying a liberal dose of elbow grease. This type of blade can be used safely on any surface without leaving scratches or rattling loose splinters from the wood's surface. And, it produces straight cuts that do not need to be sanded down for any odd corners. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A utility **knife** is a good tool for whittling plugs, as it's thin and can be made sharp. You can make the plane of the blade face 90° to the surface by holding it at 45°. This will help protect your fingers when you're leading with them. With your support hand, go in the opposite direction that you are whittling and push into the wood beneath so there is extra feedback when **cutting** against the grain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to remove a popped nailhead, use a utility **knife** first. To do this, place the utility **knife**'s blade on top of the popped nailhead and press down firmly until it kerfs through the underlying plywood-veneer. Again, make sure your hand is not in front of the edge when doing so. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You are going to need a utility **knife** with an appropriately sized blade. Always cut veneer on the face grain or end grain (not cross-grain). After using the rip guide to saw this first line, you'll want to score it and then snap away one of the two sheets of wood--the goal is for there to be a continuous strip of wood between your two cuts. Be sure not to make any mistakes at this stage, as one wrong cut will ruin your work thus far. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's often the case that there is an excess of shingle tar and cement when installing new shingles. However, removing this excess with your hands will just create a sloppy finish. So instead, use your utility **knife** to slice off enough siding or roofing membrane to expose the area you wish to remove. Then cut away those loose pieces using your utility **knife** and clean up any exposed areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Well, most of the tools in this guide are hand tools. They feature a compact design that allows the user to hold them in the hand when working. Such tools offer precise and accurate **cutting**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many people have this tool at home but do not know what it is actually used for. This blog post will explain the many uses of a utility **knife** so you can make better-informed choices about whether you need one on hand at your home. So, if you find yourself needing one, make sure to visit Amazon ! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A utility **knife** is a tool used with electrical work to install or repair cables. Utility knives are also known as drywall knives and can be easily identified by the look of the blade that it uses and the way in which it opens. Drywall knives are really handy for slicing through the insulation around wires, making repairs on home wiring much easier. For example, if you need to remove some insulation from an electrical wire, all you need is one quick slice using the **knife**'s edge at a 45-degree angle across the rounded surface where there are no longer any sharp corners. With an electrician's tape measure, you can even tailor your cuts, so they're uniform and appropriate for your needs around each wire! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Quality of **knife** design and construction can go a long way in mitigating the risk of injury. Our sturdiness metric looks at the manufacturing tolerances, as seen in the fit of parts and the action of moving components. Construction material is also assessed. We took apart the knives when possible to see if parts could be tightened or replaced, as even the best equipment wears and requires maintenance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Start by taking time to measure and mark the **cutting** lines on the drywall panels. It will help you cut them accurately to length, thus avoiding misfits. I recommend that you use full sheets whenever possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To find the **cutting**-edge utility knives, we developed several practical evaluations that highlight the tools that excel in specific tasks and those that lean more towards general use. These evaluations inform the metrics or the particular categories that collectively describe a quality utility tool. These categories are grip, sturdiness, convenience, and pocketing. The following is a detailed description of the evaluations and the best performers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Oscillating tools are also more efficient and quicker than rotary tools when handling larger tasks. Just like rotary **cutting** tools, oscillating tools come either corded or cordless. The corded varieties are more powerful and suitable for detailed drywall **cutting** exercises. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can use a utility **knife** for removing carpet tacks as long as the blade is sharp. Simply scrape the edge across the surface of the tack head, gently pull up on it to withdraw it from the fabric, and discard it. Repeat this process until all of the tacks are gone. Be wary that some tack heads will completely disappear! Use caution to avoid damaging anything below your carpeting with a misplaced swiping motion, or after you've lifted off one end of a tack head and you're sliding down towards another without any support at the other end, just lift! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
