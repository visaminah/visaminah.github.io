## 10 Tips to Best Vacuum Cleaner For Old Person | Best Rated Lightweight Vacuum Cleaners For Seniors
-   There are some **vacuum**s that are lightweight, but the ergonomics are bad. A common problem is they are stiff in the handle. This creates awkward wrist positions that take more muscle and cause more pain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Captain’s side note! There are 4 versions of the Dyson V series. I chose the V10 here because it’s my “winner” of the bunch, but it’s somewhere in the middle of performance and price. If you want the complete There are 4 versions of the Dyson V series. I chose the V10 here because it’s my “winner” of the bunch, but it’s somewhere in the middle of performance and price. If you want the complete breakdown of the Dyson cordless V-series **vacuum**s click here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most big **vacuum**s have an on-off switch to control the power, but this isn’t always the case for more portable **vacuum**s. Some **vacuum**s like the Dyson V-series you have to hold down the trigger. In this case, it’s very easy to hold the trigger (not much different than just gripping the **vacuum**), but it could be a problem with hand arthritis if you can’t keep your hand in a gripped position. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some **vacuum**s suction power and the way they are designed can stick to the carpet and be difficult to push for anyone. This is especially true on dense, plush carpets. If this was the case, the **vacuum** was eliminated - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Okay, so the **vacuum** is easy to push, but does it clean well? Many of my overall best **vacuum**s were eliminated when considering the 3 concerns above. However, there were a few **vacuum**s that stood out as still performing extremely well (better than your average upright **vacuum**). That leads us to my favorite 3 **vacuum**s for seniors… - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your wrists hurt from arthritis and pushing and pulling the **vacuum**, you don’t necessarily need something light. Some **vacuum**s can be heavier (eg Dyson small ball above) but move around like they’re one of the lightest **vacuum**s you felt. These can work great in homes with no stairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Shark Rocket Ultra-Light (best overall): Weighing in at under 8lbs, this **vacuum** is 50% lighter than many uprights. And despite its lightweight, it can compete with many high-performing **vacuum**s. This isn’t to say it will get your carpets as clean as best of the best heavyweight **vacuum**s, but its cleaning power is better than the majority of **vacuum**s no matter what their weight. Here are some other pros and cons: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many reasons you might want a lightweight **vacuum**. Maybe you have arthritis, or maybe you have an elderly parent who will be using it. Or maybe you just get sick of lugging a heavy **vacuum** up the stairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dyson DC50 Animal Compact (slightly heavier but best clean): You probably noticed that this list doesn’t have any “excellent” carpet **cleaner**s. The Shark Rocket and Dyson V7 are good but not great. To be excellent, I had to look over 10lbs to find the Dyson DC50, but this is actually a pretty good **vacuum** for anyone who needs a light **vacuum**. It’s 30% lighter than most uprights and the “ball” technology isn’t just a sales gimmick; these **vacuum**s are simple to turn and easy on the wrist. If you plan on lifting your **vacuum** a lot (say, upstairs), this may be a little heavier than you want, but otherwise here are some highlights on a very powerful **vacuum** in a small package: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This was the easiest step. I just didn’t consider any **vacuum** that weighed over 10lbs. Why 10lbs? No matter how easy a **vacuum** is to maneuver, if it’s over 10lbs there are times where an elderly person is going to have difficulty getting the **vacuum** where they want (in the closet, up the stairs, etc). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
