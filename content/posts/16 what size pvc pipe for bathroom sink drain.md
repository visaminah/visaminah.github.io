## 16 Things You Should Know About What Size Pvc Pipe For Bathroom Sink Drain | What Size Pipes For Bathroom Plumbing
-   Old plumbing usually can remain; however, any new plumbing needs to meet code. If old galvanized **pipe**s and gate valves cause low water pressure, you might need to change them in order to supply new **pipe**s with enough pressure. Here, a ball valve has replaced a gate valve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use this chart to count the number of fixture units that will be connected to a **drain** line and for the minimum **drain****pipe** size. If a toilet connects to a **drain****pipe**, the **pipe** must be at least 3 inches. Check local building codes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once **drain** lines are assembled, an inspector will probably test to make sure they do not leak. Some inspectors will simply pour water through the **pipe**s. Other inspectors require that the line be plugged with an inflatable **drain** plug and the system filled with water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Valves, fixture controls, cleanouts, and compression **pipe** fittings must not be covered by a wall or floor surface in case you need to work on them in the future. If necessary, install an access panel. The most common location for an access panel is behind a tub or shower. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **pipe**s run from the distribution **pipe**s to the fixtures. As a general rule, you can run ½-inch **pipe** to most fixtures; run ¾-inch **pipe** to a hose bib or a water heater. Different fixtures place different demands on supply **pipe**s. Each fixture has a demand rating based on fixture units (see chart). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Common codes mainly focus on venting. After all, **drain****pipe**s that are not properly vented will run sluggishly and could release noxious fumes into the house. Here are some other important plumbing code considerations to keep in mind during your remodel: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **drain** cleanout provides a convenient access point to a **pipe**. Plumbing codes call for cleanouts at various points so **drain**s can be easily augered in case of a clog. You can simply remove the cap to access the blockage or debris inside the **pipe**. To be safe, install a cleanout whenever you tap into a **drain** line unless there is already one nearby. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When changing **pipe** materials, use the correct transition fitting. Without a dielectric union (shown above), the joint between galvanized and copper **pipe** would quickly corrode. Use the approved fitting when changing from plastic to copper, cast iron to plastic, and ABS to PVC. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   List fittings in detail on your plumbing plan so you will be sure to purchase the right ones. Be sure to use special **drain** fittings, such as a closet bend, so wastewater can flow smoothly. Inspectors will have specific fitting requirements for different fixtures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In most cases, **drain****pipe**s must slope at least 1/4 inch per running foot. Running a **drain** across a room that does not have a basement or crawlspace might call for careful calculations. Codes might require that vent **pipe**s slope 1/8 inch per foot. Some codes allow level vents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Water hammer arresters might be required for appliances such as a washing machine. Supply **pipe**s could need to be cushioned wherever they run through or against a framing member. This helps prevent **pipe**s from shaking or clanging against each other when the water flow suddenly stops. A water hammer arrester ($16, The Home Depot) creates a cushion of air that helps absorb the shock. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cutting a notch in a joist greatly weakens it. Whenever possible, bore holes through joists instead. This calls for careful work as holes for a **drain****pipe** must be at slightly different levels so the **pipe** will slope. Whether notched or bored, long spans will likely need doubled joists. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The installation of plumbing must not weaken the structure of a house. The inspector can require that you reinforce joists that have been cut to accommodate **pipe**s. Other requirements include the use of fire caulking around **pipe**s and placement of protective plates over **pipe**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use approved clamps or straps to secure **pipe**s. According to most codes, copper supply **pipe** must be supported every 6 feet, galvanized or black steel **pipe** every 12 feet, PVC or ABS **drain****pipe** every 4 feet, and cast-iron **pipe** every 5 feet. To be safe, install more supports than are required. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A bathroom sink uses a 1¼-inch trap. Showers and floor **drain**s use 2-inch traps. All other fixtures and appliances use 1½-inch traps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pipes that are glued without primer eventually will leak. Apply primer when joining PVC **pipe**s to ensure a secure hold. Some plumbing codes require you to verify that primer was used. Choose a purple-colored primer ($10, The Home Depot) so the inspector can quickly tell that the **pipe**s have been sufficiently primed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
