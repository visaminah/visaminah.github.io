## 14 Reference List: What Color Goes With Gold And Black Clothes | What Colors Go Well With Black White And Gold
-   Every color imaginable has been represented in a watch. So just apply the same color matching rules here as well. Classic colors like silver, gold and **black** tend to be the most versatile. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Green and orange are a bad pair. The color green is usually very neutral while orange is loud. Unlike grey or **black**, green is too colorful to be dulled down by a competitor. Skip this one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red can be paired with neutral colors like white or **black** quite easily. For classy outfits, go for grays, browns, or earthy tones. In summers, tangerines, blues, and mustards look vibrant. It depends on where you are headed and what your personal preference is, but here’s a list with a little bit of everything. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "Right," says Conway. "But you're doing this very bad trick, which is projecting those patches on a white background. Show that same patch on a neutral **black** background and I bet it would appear orange." He ran it through Photoshop, too, and now figures that the dress is actually blue and orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Combining different hues of red is a whole new ball game. It gives you the opportunity to create a bespoke outift with pieces you already have in your closet. These crimson red pants, red leather jacket, and **black** turtleneck do just that. Extremely stylish but not loud at all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best colors for men’s jewelry is more about which colors they’ll work with and less about the colors themselves. Most men’s jewelry comes in **black**, brown, gold, silver or bronze. Luckily for your style, these colors pretty much go with everything. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As for your evening bag, in all cases, don’t be matchy-matchy. For example, if you are wearing nude shoes, try a gold or **black** bag. You can even carry a similarly colored nude bag but in a different finish or texture. The bottom line is, to mix it up in terms of color/finish to look modern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black is one of the popular shoe colors. So if you want to wear **black** shoes on your wedding day, don’t worry because there exists a wide range of **black** colors for this occasion. So you can choose some special colors like **black** and silver or **black** and gold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s really the same. You can wear **black** or pewter shoes with a silver dress. The Navy can also work. I like silver shoes with a silver dress. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The fact that a single image could polarize the entire Internet into two aggressive camps is, let's face it, just another Thursday. But for the past half-day, people across social media have been arguing about whether a picture depicts a perfectly nice bodycon dress as blue with **black** lace fringe or white with gold lace fringe. And neither side will budge. This fight is about more than just social media---it's about primal biology and the way human eyes and brains have evolved to see color in a sunlit world. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grey and **black** is an (almost) criminally underused color combination. The subtle variation from grey to **black** creates contrast while at the same time being muted. The tint in darker greys is reflected in whatever piece of **black** clothing you are wearing. Ultimately, you capitalize on both the contrast and the complementary nature of the colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It might seem run-of-the-mill combination, but it looks uber chic when done right. However, don’t go for bold reds and **black**s because it looks pretty shoddy. Go for a mild tomato red when you want to wear **black**. Play around with patterns, cuts, and layers. Sheer skirts and printed leather jackets with a pop of red lipstick is also a classy way to go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bronze is gold mixed with **black**. Pewter is silver mixed with **black**. If you wear a bronze or pewter dress, **black** shoes will look wonderful because they’ll pick up on the **black** in the dress and balance the intensity of the dark metallic. See how striking the dress above looks with **black** sandals. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using the right colors and matching them perfectly can be a deal maker. Choosing the perfect color for an outfit is what sets you apart. And, that’s why color and its theories continue to be the pivot for not just **clothes**, but everything else like interiors, hair, makeup, and much more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
