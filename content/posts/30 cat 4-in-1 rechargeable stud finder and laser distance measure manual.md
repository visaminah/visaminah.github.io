## 30 Reference List: Cat 4-In-1 Rechargeable Stud Finder And Laser Distance Measure Manual | Best Stud Finder
-   The Vivreal Wall Scanner stands out for its versatility. It features four scanning types (**stud**, metal, wire, and deep scan mode) and comes with a graphical LCD display. Users can select the mode, adjust the signal strength, or perform automatic calibration. This **stud** finder is a worthy option for a do-it-yourselfer with a lengthy to-do list. Product Specs Type: Electronic - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Magnetic **stud** finders use powerful rare earth magnets to detect the location of metal screws or nails that hold picture frames, mirrors, and drywall panels in place. As you slide this **stud** finder over a wall, it is magnetically attracted to any spot directly above a nail or screw—you will feel it pulling in that direction, and you may even see the **stud** finder stick! (Most magnetic **stud** finders are lightweight and have magnets powerful enough that they will hold through the drywall.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best for Pros 4 Franklin Sensors ProSensor 710 Precision Stud Finder Photo: amazon.com SEE IT Nothing could be simpler, or more accurate, than the Franklin Sensors ProSensor Stud Finder. I already had this **stud** finder in my toolbox, but I wanted to know if its exceptional accuracy extended to the updated models. I wasn’t disappointed. I loaded the Franklin **stud** finder up with two AA batteries and started testing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like all technology, electronic **stud** finders have seen many improvements from the time they appeared on the construction market in the 1990s. To pinpoint the location of a **stud**, an electronic **stud** finder uses sensors that detect a mass behind the wall. They may come with a single sensor, in which case they will detect only the edge of a **stud**, or they may come with multiple sensors, giving them the ability to detect both edges as well as the center of the **stud**. Both single sensor and multiple sensor **stud** finders perform well on average. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Magnetic **stud** finders work to a depth of about ¾ inch, which is sufficient most of the time for finding **stud**s behind standard ½-inch or ⅝-inch drywall. When you locate a nail or screw, you’ve located a **stud**. Because drywall fasteners are located typically 12 to 16 inches apart, it’s recommended that you move a magnet-based **stud** finder over the wall in a sweeping “S” motion to more quickly detect one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the whole-wall test, the Vivreal wall scanner was also highly accurate, finding the center of each **stud**. It also found the wires running to the light switch. The back of the **stud** finder features three thin felt pads, which make it slide effortlessly across the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Standard wall framing is 16 inches apart, on-center (OC), meaning the center of one **stud** will be exactly 16 inches from the center of the next. Alternate spacing is 19.2 inches and 24 inches apart, OC. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Bosch also hit on live wiring in the wall and on metal fasteners in wood **stud**s. In addition, this multiuse **stud** finder can turn on a backlight in the display and mute the beeping noise, making it well suited for low-light situations or where someone might find the beeping distracting. Product Specs Type: Electronic - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The key to the precision of the ProSensor is the line of LED lights that runs along the tool. With the ProSensor, it’s possible to detect and distinguish between **stud**s located within a few inches of one another, as is often the case near a door or in the corner of a room, making this **stud** finder well-suited for remodeling contractors who need to find the locations of multiple framing configurations. Product Specs Type: Electronic - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Then, I tried the **laser**, and I was sold. Here’s how easy it is to use—in the upper center of the **stud** finder is a clear plastic depression with a hole in the very middle. I made a mark with a pencil on the wall and then lined up the hole in the **stud** finder with the pencil mark. I then switched on the **laser** function from a button on the side—a bright red **laser** beam shone out horizontally. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Any of the **stud** finders that earned a spot in this lineup are well suited to helping DIYers and pros pinpoint the location of **stud**s hidden behind drywall, but our best overall pick, the Zircon **stud** finder, ticks all the boxes. It offers both edge and center **stud** detection, and it identifies live wires as well. Our budget pick, the Craftsman **stud** finder, also detects both wood and metal **stud**s, it’s easy to operate with just one hand, and it comes at an attractive price point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sensors range in size. Stud finders with larger sensors have a few advantages, such as being able to cover a more expansive area and (sometimes) being able to penetrate thicker or more solid walls, such as plaster or concrete. Smaller sensors, on the other hand, can be highly accurate. For most home DIYers, sensor size is not an issue since a typical **stud** finder with smaller or larger sensors will be able to pinpoint **stud**s behind drywall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the features I liked most about the Bosch **stud** finder is its actual power button. There’s nothing for the user to hold down while scanning. Use the power button to turn the tool on, and it stays on until you turn it off. While this may lead to batteries running down more quickly if the device is inadvertently left on, I liked this feature immensely. With an always-on power button, I could hold the tool the way I wanted to rather than needing to grasp it awkwardly to keep a button depressed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That depends on the individual tool. Some beep when they detect the edge of a **stud**, while others beep when they detect the center of a **stud**. Some **stud** finders beep to let the user know they’ve just recalibrated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   , available on either magnetic or electronic **stud** finder, can assist you in leveling shelves or whatever else you’re attaching to the wall. Small bubble levels tend to be less accurate than longer, carpenter-type levels because they only record level over a very short distance. A built-in **laser** (electronic models only) is a step up from a bubble level. At the press of a button, you can shine a **laser** in a straight line from the **stud** you’ve located, either vertically or horizontally to help you align additional fasteners. A **laser** level makes it a snap to hang multiple photos or paintings on a wall—all at the same height. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   (electronic models only) allows you to switch from detecting **stud**s ¾ inch deep behind drywall to locating any number of objects up to 1½ inches beneath the surface. The ability to inspect further behind the surface is handy for detecting floor joists beneath additional surface coverings like wood, tile, or carpet, but you won’t want to run your electronic **stud** finder at this level all of the time. Increasing the depth adjustment takes more energy and runs the batteries down more quickly. Switching back and forth and primarily keeping it on **stud**-finding mode helps conserve battery life. Multipurpose electronic **stud** finders are designed to detect additional materials within the walls, such as live electrical wires and plastic pipes so that you don’t nail or cut into something that might be problematic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We decided to test a slew of them to help readers find one that suits their needs. I tested magnetic and electronic models in my quest to find the best **stud** finder options out there. Read on to learn what to look for in a **stud** finder, and find out which popular models scored highest during my tests. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because they detect metal instead of the **stud** itself, they can pick up any metal in the wall—e.g., a metal lathe used to secure plaster or a nail in a horizontal cross-board instead of a vertical **stud**—making false positives possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   (electronic models only) will alert you when it’s time to replace the batteries. While some electronic models take AA or AAA alkaline batteries, a growing number require the use of a small 9-volt battery to adequately power multiple options. An ergonomic hand grip makes holding and moving the **stud** finder easier and is available on both magnetic and electronic models. Some **stud** finders require depressing a button before scanning the wall for **stud**s. When choosing one of these models, look for a button that’s located in a comfortable spot to both press the button and control the movement of the tool. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most, but not all. Some outlets come with boxes that are designed to fit in a hole cut through the drywall. A **stud** finder that detects both **stud**s and live wires can tell the user if this type of outlet box is in use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I had my helper make a pencil mark about 4 feet away on the **laser** line. I then inserted two nails in each of the marks and tied a taut string between them. I checked the level of the string with my carpenter’s level, and it was accurate. For those who need to be able to define a horizontal level and detect wood and metal **stud**s, the Black & Decker **stud** finder does the trick. Product Specs Type: Electronic - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Stud finders fall into two basic categories based on the method they use for **stud** detection, either magnetic or electronic. One’s not inherently better than the other; instead, each one offers different benefits for different situations. We tested both types of tools in our hands-on tests with some pretty eye-opening results, so don’t miss those tests and reviews below our guide. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best Multipurpose 5 Bosch GMS120 Digital Multi-Scanner Photo: amazon.com SEE IT I found the Bosch Digital Multi-Scanner highly accurate for detecting a range of materials, even materials found in thicker walls. Like many electronic **stud** finders, the Bosch takes a 9-volt battery to run all its functions. It comes with user-friendly images on the front to detect wood, metal, and live wire, making it easy to use the device even without reading the instructions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   (electronic models only) give you some choice in how you want to “see” the **stud**. Some electronic **stud** finders let you preview a digital map of the **stud** beneath the wall on an LED screen; others feature LED lights across the top that blink when the finder is passed over a **stud**—both provide a reliable way to pinpoint a **stud**. A battery indicator (electronic models only) will alert you when it’s time to replace the batteries. While some electronic models take AA or AAA alkaline batteries, a growing number require the use of a small 9-volt battery to adequately power multiple options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the other hand, electronic **stud** finders rely on internal sensors rather than magnets to pinpoint the location of wood **stud**s. They sense a change in density in the space behind the wall. The best **stud** finders are precalibrated and are ready to go right out of the package—after inserting batteries—but a few need to be calibrated to ensure precise results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Bosch **stud** finder is self-calibrating. Turn it on, select the mode, and then hold it in place on the wall for a few seconds to calibrate it. During scanning, when the tool neared a **stud**, an orange light ring on the face lit up. As I slid the device over the **stud**, the light ring turned red, and the **stud** finder emitted a beep. When the tool was directly over the **stud**, the word “Center” appeared on the LCD display. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   feature (electronic models only) makes a small hole in the wall right over the center of a **stud**, which is the optimal spot for inserting a nail or screw—no need to carry a pencil to mark it. Varying visual displays (electronic models only) give you some choice in how you want to “see” the **stud**. Some electronic **stud** finders let you preview a digital map of the **stud** beneath the wall on an LED screen; others feature LED lights across the top that blink when the finder is passed over a **stud**—both provide a reliable way to pinpoint a **stud**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I tested the Black & Decker on the test wall to determine its accuracy. As I moved the **stud** finder toward the **stud**, a series of lines appeared at the outer edges of the screen to indicate the edge of a **stud** was detected, and the words “Stud found” appeared on the screen. To find the center of the **stud**, I marked the wall when the finder detected one edge, and then I scanned from the other side and did the same thing. The center was right between the two marks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not everyone can reliably rap on the wall and find a **stud**—most can’t—so using a **stud** finder makes projects go more quickly. Those who are new to the world of electronic and magnetic **stud** finders are in for a treat. Consider a few questions before picking one out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best with Laser Level 6 Black+Decker Line Laser, Stud Finder Photo: amazon.com SEE IT Say goodbye to crooked picture frames. Unlike other **stud** finders, the Black & Decker Stud Finder features an edge-type sensor, and the tool comes with a self-leveling, horizontal **laser** line. Together, the two functions make an impressive team for hanging a series of pictures or other artwork. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
