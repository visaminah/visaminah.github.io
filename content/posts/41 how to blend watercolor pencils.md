## 41 Things About How To Blend Watercolor Pencils | Blending Pencil
-   A wax-based pencil is a type of colored pencil that can be **blend**ed in the same way as wax crayons. Wax doesn’t dissolve when it’s treated with solvents like water or alcohol, but instead will “set” or spread color to other areas. It is the same kind of wax you get in a candle and will respond to heat better than a liquid. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Then I used a cotton swab to **blend** with baby oil. You can also use a tortillon, just dip the tortillon in a small amount of baby oil. This smooths out the colors but also lifts pigment from the page onto the cotton swab so the colors seemed lighter after I **blend**ed. I was able to go back and add more color to the page, though the surface felt a little more slippery and less toothy than before I **blend**ed it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Two-pencil gradient Use two pencils in different hues to fill in both halves of your paper using smooth lines drawn closely together. Overlay the colors to **blend** and mix into a new color. Use a variety of hues for unlimited combinations. Try this wet and dry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Great solvents to use for colored pencil **blend**ing are Gamblin Gamsol Odorless Mineral Spirits and Weber Turpenoid Natural. It’s best to use solvents in a well-ventilated area to limit your exposure to the chemicals (and, sometimes, the odor). Pour the liquid in a small, resealable glass container so that it’s easy to use and clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blending is actually easy to do and there are many different techniques you can use to **blend** pencils. We’ll go over some **blend**ing basics today and go over several different techniques so you can see which type of **blend**ing works best for you. After finishing this post you’ll be on your way to **blend**ing your pencils to avoid streaks and get soft, smooth color transitions! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another type of burnishing can be done with a white pencil. First we do our basic **blend**ing of several colors. Add a light layer: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Colored pencil **blend**ing was revolutionized by the Italian-American artist-inventor Ester Roi, who invented the Icarus Art Board. Basically, it’s a controlled heat plate that allows artists to work in colored pencil much faster by seamlessly **blend**ing the pigment while drawing. The boards, which come in three sizes, cost a pretty penny, but you’ll make for it in saved time and effort. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some colorists are concerned if they **blend** with Vaseline directly on a coloring book that there might be some Vaseline left on the top of their colored areas that could get on the facing page when the book is closed. You can lightly blot the finished area with a paper towel to remove any excess Vaseline before closing the book just to be safe. Some colorists even put a layer of tissue paper or wax paper between pages where they’ve used solvents to protect the facing page. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Watercolor pencils can be **blend**ed with water. You can use water to **blend** these pencils. You will see that it is like **watercolor** painting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also use **blend**ing pencil to soften the edges of un**blend**ed layers of pencil. In this case, I added a layer of **blend**ing pencil it to the un**blend**ed layers on the very top petal (the first one illustrated with the stripes of color) and noticed there was a lifting of pigment on the edges and I was able to smooth out the colors and get them **blend**ed. So **blend**ing pencil can also be used to soften edges between colors or streaks in your pencil work. Make sure to clean the pencil’s tip on a scrap piece of paper to remove any pigment that may have gotten on the tip of your **blend**er pencil so you don’t add them to the page you’re **blend**ing next time you use it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also use solvents to **blend** colored pencil. These solvents break down the binders (for Prismacolors, that binder is wax) holding the pigment in your pencil and allow you to push around the pigments on the page. When **blend**ing with solvents, I use the **blend**ing agents from light to dark to avoid pushing pigment from the darker colors into the lighter colors. There are a variety of solvents used to **blend** colored pencils. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I will use easy to find, affordable, less toxic options for my examples. If you are looking for a purer, residue-less solvent for **blend**ing, one option (not covered here since it is less common) is to use mineral spirits like Gamsol. You need to use more care when you use more potent materials like these (protecting yourself, your work area, and keeping things well-ventilated) but the results can be great! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 5 : Try some color **blend**ing! Have a bit of petroleum jelly on a pencil or two and softly color back and forth between the two colors on your page. I chose to do a : Try some color **blend**ing! Have a bit of petroleum jelly on a pencil or two and softly color back and forth between the two colors on your page. I chose to do a varying pressure technique between light blue and violet, and I love how it turned out! Notice I kept my pencils on my paper towel, though; once your pencils have petroleum jelly on them, they are rather like markers with their caps off, and they are bound to get color where you don't necessarily want it to go. Coloring on a protected surface or one that you use for such creative adventures is a good choice; this coloring technique is NOT for your fine dining table or plushly upholstered couch! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To **blend** basic colored pencils, start by lightly coloring in the area you want to **blend**. Next, use a lighter pencil to go over the area you just colored. Finally, use a paper towel or your finger to **blend** the colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When learning how to use **watercolor** pencils you can get started by creating a swatch chart. Draw a series of blocks. Color in the top of each block in each color. Then moisten with your brush pen, moving the color down the block to get a variant of shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s something magical about adding a dab of water to drawn lines and watching them turn into painterly strokes of color. This is the beauty of **watercolor** pencils and is why they’re popular with urban sketchers, art journalers, **watercolor** painters, and home crafters alike. So, if you’re wondering what are **watercolor** pencils and what’s so great about them, get ready, you’re going to love what they can do! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remember to draw on a smooth surface. A paper’s texture greatly affects the layering of a color — the more textured, the harder it is to fill in the paper’s tooth and **blend** the colors. Many artists prefer Strathmore paper or Stonehenge paper - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may need to add more layers of pencil before **blend**ing with a **blend**er pencil to eliminate white areas on the page. I tried going back with the original pencils to darken the colors, but the white spaces were filled with wax and the layers were burnished and I wasn’t able to get smooth color added. So bear in mind when you use a **blend**ing pencil try it out first to see how much pigment you want to lay down before adding **blend**ing pencil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take color from the pencil tip with a moist brush Each pencil contains a solid core of pigment. When you touch a wet brush to the tip of the pencil, it’s similar to using **watercolor** paint in its solid form. By adding more or less paint, you can adjust the lightness or darkness of the saturation. Since your lines will be done with a brush instead of by the pencil, they will be clear, yet indistinct. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most common method for **blend**ing colored pencils is to layer colors. This process is also known as burnishing, which involves applying heavy pressure to grind several layers together. This method is best used with lighter colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Burnishing is one of the ways you can **blend** colored pencil. It helps the pigments meld together and adds a smoother, more polished look to your page. Because burnishing flattens the paper’s tooth, no more layers can be added after it has been done, so it should be done at the end when you are finished with all the color layers you want on a page. The result is a slick, shiny surface and adding new layers is difficult or impossible because there is no tooth left in the paper to grip any new pencil layers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Practice makes perfect, so don't rush into it! Start by laying down the darker color first. It will be easier to **blend** later if you build up the colors gradually. You will notice a smoother finished piece after a few attempts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Burnishing is a **blend**ing technique of layering colored pencils with heavy pressure. It fuses and saturates colors while smoothing out the surface. The **blend**ing method rids the surface of any texture left in the drawing. In other words, burnishing allows the artist to polish the surface to its maximum smoothness so that it’s evenly filled with color, reducing deep saturated tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another solvent you can use for **blend**ing colored pencil is baby oil. Like alcohol, it breaks down the pigments to help **blend** them. Use sparingly and avoid touching uncolored paper to avoid stains. I **blend**ed my colors: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blending is a way to have smooth transitions from dark to light or from one color to another. Here is an example of three colors un**blend**ed. You can see the colors transition from light to dark, but they are clearly distinct from each other. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the left: **watercolor** pencil and water-soluble crayon. On the right: same with water brushed over them. Marion Boddy-Evans - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So here is the original color, (PC 1008) but I’ll add two more colors to show you some basic **blend**ing. I find that using more than one color adds depth to your work. I start by adding layers of the next darker shade of the same color at the opposite end (PC 932). I add more layers of the second color to the middle area and ease up pressure and add fewer and fewer layers as I get to the light color. I overlap the colors for a smooth transition. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now we come to olive oil. As someone who has Italian heritage, I always wondered if the old Italian artists used olive oil. I doubt it. But does olive oil make a good liquid to **blend** colored pencils? It - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Water-soluble pencils are available in a wide range of colors, as well as plain graphite pencils. Colored **watercolor** pencils aren't graded like graphite pencils are (from 9B, the softest, to 9H, the hardest), but their softness does vary between brands so it may be worth buying a sample pencil from various brands to ​see which you prefer before you buy a set. The softer a **watercolor** pencil is, the easier it is to put color or pigment down on a paper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I love to color, and I know you do too! It’s relaxing. But sometimes it feels like **blend**ing coloring pencils the proper way can get a little boring. That’s why I put together this blog post to satisfy the curious minds out there wondering what things you can use to **blend** your colored pencils with! There are so many options available, from water to coconut oil! Some work well, some don’t work so well and some don’t work at all. So let’s take a look at how to **blend** colored pencils with water and 6 other crazy liquids that will add some oomph to your pictures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can use olive oil to get a good **blend** if you are coloring in earth tones or need to lighten up gray areas with medium pressure strokes. This is because as the olive oil dries it oxidizes. Oxidation is the process of breaking down molecules and compounds to form new ones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because these pencils are activated by water, it’s important to use thicker paper that can handle moisture without buckling. For this reason, you should consider the density of the paper. The higher the density the better, with most professional **watercolor**ist using 90lb. (200 gsm) and up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So how do you apply water once you’ve drawn with the **watercolor** pencil? The best tool for this is the water brush. This brush has a barrel that can be filled with water to moisten marks to create blurred, smooth, transitional, and thin clear-cut lines. You use it the same way you use a traditional paintbrush. The Arteza Water Brush Pens - Set of 6 come with both fine-tips and broad-tip to produce a variety of stroke sizes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just like their cousin, the color pencil, these pencils also come in a far-reaching assortment of colors. And, just like color pencils, they can be used for **blend**ing and layering to create depth, dimension, and details. Where they differ is that they are water-soluble. When touched with water, your mark diffuses into a soft stroke of color. It’s like creating a **watercolor** painting without paint! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I used the Colorist Palette Reference Book to test these **blend**ing techniques — this book is a great place to try **blend**ing methods before you do them on a colored page or a book, because it allows you to test palettes and techniques on a coloring picture instead of just squares or rectangles. It also allows you to save your experiments and notes in one place for future reference. There is room at the bottom of the page to help you keep track of your colors, media, and make notes of whatever technique you used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another way to **blend** is to use Petroleum Jelly or Vaseline. There are two ways to do this. I layered my colors: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can use rubbing alcohol that contains 70 percent or less, as stronger solvents will reduce the pigment. You can also use rubber cement thinner to achieve a deep **blend**. Always use a paintbrush, cotton ball, or swab when using solvents to **blend** colored pencils. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike graphite or charcoal, colored pencils can’t be **blend**ed with paper stumps and tortillions. But there are several other tools and techniques that can achieve the same **blend**ing effects. In this post, we’ll go over some of the best tools and tips for easily **blend**ing with colored pencils - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re thinking about trying out **watercolor** pencils, don’t hold back on the number you start with. We recommend you get a larger set to get the most value for your money and the most colors for your creativity, such as the Arteza Professional Watercolor Pencils - Set of 72. These premium-grade pencils are all you need for any project knowing you have the most vibrant colors right at your fingertips. They are break-resistant and come in a convenient tin, making them easy to take with you anywhere you choose to paint or draw. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another type of **blend**ing can be done with a **blend**ing pencil. A **blend**ing pencil is essentially a colored pencil with only binders and no pigment. First, you layer your colors: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To apply solvents to your colored pencils, use a paintbrush, cotton ball, or swab. The thicker the base, the better the **blend**ing effect will be and the less likely it is to damage the drawing. To achieve the best results, practice applying a bit more pressure to your pencil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
