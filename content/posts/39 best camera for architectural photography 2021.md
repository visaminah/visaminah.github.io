## 39 Shocking Facts About Best Camera For Architectural Photography 2021 | Sony Alpha A6000
-   Alexander Rentsch is a Berlin-based architectural photographer born in 1983. He started developing an interest in **photography** around 2003, when his focus was on sports-related **photography**, in particular skateboarding, before starting to explore **photography** in general. Today his work is focused on architecture and portraiture, which allowed him to acquire new skills and build a digital audience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At the same time, other features such as in-body image stabilization (IBIS) can be quite helpful, especially when **camera**s are able to take advantage of sensor movements in order to track stars or to create high-resolution images using pixel shift technology. The ability to capture more dynamic range when shooting at higher ISOs, as well as the ability to focus easily in low-light conditions can also be vital for those who shoot the night sky. So if you are into astro**photography**, you might need to evaluate such criteria separately when picking a particular **camera** or **camera** system. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Joerg Nicht is a Berlin-based photographer which goes by the alias @jn. He focuses on architecture, travel and street **photography**. Joerg is one of Germany’s best-known and most followed photographers on Instagram. He has a doctorate with a focus on social networks and worked at Free University Berlin as an academic and published author. He has always been interested in both **photography** and social sciences. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Seeing Canon go from one of the least desirable to one of the top mirrorless **camera** options for landscape **photography** has been pretty incredible. While the original EOS R was a very odd **camera** with some quirks and issues (as detailed in our Canon EOS R review), Canon decided to address all the issues and release the ultimate Canon mirrorless **camera** for landscape **photography** needs in the shape of the EOS R5. Featuring a 45 MP sensor with a high-resolution optical low-pass filter, the EOS R5 demonstrates excellent image quality and wide dynamic range, making it a very desirable **camera** for landscape **photography** needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the best all-around **camera**s on the market today is also a killer choice for landscape **photography**: the Nikon Z9. The Z9 matches and in some ways exceeds the capabilities of the Nikon Z7 / Z7 II that are so high on our list, featuring a 45 megapixel sensor and a base ISO of 64 for incredible dynamic range. The only reason why the Nikon Z9 is lower on the list is because it’s frankly overkill if all you need to do is landscape **photography**. It costs $5500 and weighs more than almost all the **camera**s on this list, because it’s geared toward high-speed wildlife **photography** needs. Even though the Z9 is amazing for landscape **photography**, you can save some money and keep almost all the useful landscape-related features just by getting a Nikon Z7 II instead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While the first few iterations of the Sony A7R suffered from a number of issues, Sony really came around and addressed most of the concerns with the release of the A7R IV. Thanks to its superb 61 MP BSI CMOS sensor, great battery life, and a rich lens selection, the Sony A7R IV is our top pick among full-frame mirrorless **camera**s on the market today. Sony has also done an amazing job with its lens releases, giving plenty of options from ultra-wide-angle to super-telephotos for landscape photographers. Sony’s willingness to open up the E mount and work with third-party lens manufacturers resulted in the addition of many lens options in a relatively short amount of time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best Camera for Architecture Photography: One thing is for sure in architecture **photography** —your subjects remain still. Because of this, you don’t have to worry about getting the fastest **camera**. Stick to a decent DSLR that comes with a full-frame sensor. But, of course, even smartphones today can snap decent images if you know how to make most of their capabilities. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Marcel Wiest, better known as @marcel_travels, is a 31-year-old urban and architectural photographer from the south of Germany now based in Berlin. In 2017 he quit the military and started a life changing eight-month backpacking journey during which he fell in love with **photography**. After his trip, he relocated to Berlin and enrolled in a **photography** & social media school, before working in a professional studio for a year. He currently works as a freelancer and is busy delighting our eyeballs daily with the incredible architecture images he shares. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another strength of the Panasonic S1R is lens selection. With Leica, Panasonic, and Sigma being part of the “L-mount alliance”, there are plenty of great lens options available for the L-mount – from ultra-premium Leica glass to budget-friendly options from Sigma. Panasonic’s own zoom and prime lenses are also excellent and highly recommended for landscape **photography** needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Buildings aren’t small. That’s why it’s important to choose **camera** settings that can help you capture all their details — from tiny houses to majestic mansions. For example, try: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A good lens is essential to get an amazing photo. It does not matter how great a photographer you are, there is only so much that you can do with bad gear. If you’re looking at architectural **photography**, then remember to get the proper lens that allows you to fit into some tight corners to capture as much of the subject matter as possible in one shot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The urban landscape is a architectural landscape **photography** where the city is in front of you. Perhaps you know the English term «Cityscape«. This incorporates a structure between buildings, bridges and skyscrapers and combines it with some natural element, such as a river. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Every structure has the potential to be beautiful. This is why it is important to put down your **camera** first and appreciate the architectural creation before you. Check out the shapes, patterns, shadows, details and other elements that you can play with. You can also do some research in advance to find out a bit more about the structure. Once you’re ready, start snapping photos! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As of early 2021, there are many mirrorless **camera**s available from a variety of different manufacturers, including Panasonic, Olympus, Fujifilm, Hasselblad, Sony, Nikon, Canon, and Leica. Most of these **camera**s are capable of exceptional image quality, thanks to their high-resolution image sensors, wide dynamic range, and superb built-in features, making them all perfectly suitable for landscape **photography**. Let’s take a closer look at the **camera**s we picked from different manufacturers. The below list is sorted by our order of preference, although every **camera** we present is more than capable of yielding exceptional images. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a slightly more advanced lens but a tilt-shift lens will really separate your work from others around you. Tilt-shift lenses are invaluable when it comes to architectural and interior **photography**. The ability to adjust the composition, framing and field of view without tilting the **camera** up or down (which would induce skewed vertical lines) is the largest benefit of tilt-shift lenses. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For those on a tighter budget, the Nikon Z6 and Z6 II are also favorable choices for landscape **photography**. While these **camera**s have 24 MP sensors with low-pass filters, as long as you are not planning to make huge prints, they are still excellent **camera**s for most photographers out there. You can find out more about the Z6 in our Nikon Z6 review, while a comparison between this **camera** and its second-generation version can be found in our Z6 vs Z6 II article. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another well-rounded DSLR in our list is the Pentax K-1, which rightfully earns its spot, thanks to its 36 MP CMOS sensor with 5-axis IBIS that is capable of taking high-resolution images with pixel-shift technology. With pixel-shift, the Pentax K-1 is able to yield highly detailed, noise-free images up to 42 MP. While 42 MP might not sound like a lot when we have 45 and 50 MP **camera**s on this list, it actually yields more pixel-level details compared to other **camera**s. In addition, the ability to move the image sensor also allows the Pentax K-1 to capture moving stars with its “AstroTracer” feature, making the K-1 arguably the best **camera** on the list for astro**photography** needs. The Pentax K-1 comes with a great set of in-**camera** features for landscape **photography**, including built-in GPS and Compass which automatically get written into every captured image, which can be helpful for tracking the movement and position of the **camera**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the same boat as the Nikon Z9 is the Sony A1. It’s a fantastic **camera** for landscape **photography**, featuring a 50 megapixel sensor, a lightweight design, and a sensor-shift mode for even higher resolution. However, it costs $6500, and what you’re paying for are sports and wildlife features more than anything else. Stick with the A7r series and put your money toward the lenses instead. However, if you already have an A1 for your sports/wildlife needs, it still makes a stellar landscape **camera**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   the AF-S NIKKOR 16-35mm f/4G ED VR from Nikon is a flexible zoom ideal for landscape, cityscape, and interior **photography**. Its constant f/4 maximum aperture maintains consistent illumination throughout the zoom range and suits working in a variety of lighting conditions. The optical design contains three aspherical elements and two extra-low dispersion elements, which greatly reduce distortion and aberrations for a high degree of sharpness, clarity, and accurate rendering. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Play with the settings of your **camera** to create a balanced image. You can capture one that’s dark, one that’s bright, and something in between, and play with them during post-processing. You can also experiment with your shutter speed and exposure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although mirrorless **camera**s have been gaining quite a bit of traction lately for a number of reasons (see mirrorless vs DSLR), they still have some catching up to do with DSLRs when it comes to things like battery life and lens selection. For landscape **photography** needs in particular, none of the **camera** manufacturers have made tilt/shift lenses yet, so one has to either use adapters with them or resort to bellows systems to be able to tilt the plane of focus. Nikon has a wide array of tilt/shift lenses available today and although they are quite expensive, they are among the many lenses available for the system, giving lots of different options for landscape photographers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's easy to think of architectural **photography** merely as the photographing of buildings, but it's more than that. Architectural **photography** is not only about capturing the design and detailed representation of a building, but also about having the shots be aesthetically pleasing to the viewer's eye. Architectural photographers possess additional skills, from the use of dynamic angles and the formation of a creative composition to extensive research to be aware of the lighting conditions and the details of the building. It's also important to take into account that architectural **photography** boils down to two different types: exterior and interior. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For landscapes, you may want to go with one of the mirrorless **camera**s in this list instead due to lighter weight, but it all depends on how far you’re planning to hike with your **camera**. The Nikon D850 is such a proven and versatile **camera** that it’s usually our first recommendation. However, it’s at about the same level as the Canon EOS R5, Nikon Z7 II, and Sony A7R IV, all of which have their own pros and cons. Make the decision based on which one seems the best for your particular needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A Nano Crystal Coat has also been applied to control flare and ghosting for greater contrast and color accuracy in harsh lighting and backlit conditions. Additionally, this lens also sports a Silent Wave Motor for fast and accurate autofocus along with VR II image stabilization to minimize the appearance of **camera** shake by 2.5 stops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the most important parts of shooting architecture **photography** is your lens choice. In this post, I will show you the best lenses for architecture **photography**. Generally, you need three main types of lenses in your bag: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   In addition to excellent ergonomics and easy to understand menu system, the Canon EOS R5 has a tough magnesium alloy construction, superb weather sealing, and dual memory card slots (1x CFexpress and 1x SD UHS-II). Despite its high-resolution sensor, the EOS R5 is able to shoot up to 12 FPS using its mechanical shutter and up to 20 FPS when using the electronic shutter. Similar to Nikon Z, the Canon RF lens options have grown tremendously since the launch of the original RF mount (although Canon focused more on professional-grade zoom and prime lenses). And for those who like to shoot video, the EOS R5 is the only consumer-grade digital **camera** on the market today that is capable of shooting 8K videos. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Another Nikon DSLR that we highly recommend is the older D810, which is another phenomenal **camera** for landscape **photography** needs. We did not include it in this list because of the D850 that replaced it.

I later sold it off in favor of the Nikon Z7, which I talk about below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Check Thai Hoang's work here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After testing out the Nikon D850, our team at PL agreed that it is the most complete DSLR on the market today. It has a phenomenal 45 MP sensor with the capability to go down as low as ISO 64 and yield class-leading dynamic range performance, proven Nikon ergonomics and easy to use menu system, rich lens selection, excellent in-**camera** features, great weather sealing, and amazing battery life. In short, the Nikon D850 is the best full-frame DSLR on the market today. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Keep in mind that the sensor size is going to dictate the size of the overall system, its weight, as well as its overall cost. While medium format digital **camera**s offer the best overall image quality for landscape photographers, they are often large, heavy, and very expensive. For these and other reasons, most enthusiast and professional landscape photographers often choose full-frame DSLR and mirrorless **camera**s for their needs. Still, even full-frame **camera**s can end up being too heavy and expensive for many hobbyists, which leaves APS-C and smaller sensor systems as the best choices. In this article, we will first go over our top **camera** picks for landscape **photography**, then go over some of the budget options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although the original Z7 featured a single XQD / CFexpress memory card slot, Nikon added a UHS-II compatible SD memory card slot to the Z7 II. As explained in my Nikon Z7 vs Z7 II article, there were a few other important refinements delivered with the Z7 II, including dual EXPEED 6 processors, a much larger memory buffer and the ability to use a real battery grip with controls. Still, we do want Nikon to pay more attention to firmware updates, so we created our detailed wishlist of **camera** features we would like to see on Nikon Z-series **camera**s in the future. Even though Nikon has been able to address some of them, we hope to see more continuous improvements and innovations in these **camera**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
