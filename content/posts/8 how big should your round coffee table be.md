## 8 Facts How Big Should Your Round Coffee Table Be | Large Coffee Table Dimensions
-   As well as helping you to place a **coffee** table, this magic measurement can also help you earlier on in the selection process. ‘One way to work out what sort of **coffee** table you need is to start by mapping out that distance from each piece of seating, and see what size and shape you end up with,’ says Victoria. ‘Then stand back and take a look at the room to determine if it feels proportional.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The size of your **coffee** table should be guided by thoughts on how you’ll use it, and who will use it. ‘So much goes into choosing the perfect **coffee** table,’ says Kate Hayes, co-founder of Atlanta-based Hayes Little Studio (opens in new tab). ‘Start by considering the environment; do you have children and need a more practical finish for your table? Is it a loungey, relaxed living room or is it something more formal and even traditional?' What kind of **coffee** table decor are you considering? 'These aspects all play into the height and shape of the **coffee** table selection,' Kate says. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We’ve touched on this a little already, but getting the height of your **coffee** table right is a determining factor in its success within your living room. Thankfully, there’s another school of thought to follow that means you’ll get it right every time. ‘In terms of height, we'd always suggest getting something as close to the height of the seat height of the couch’, says Sheena Murphy at Nune. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘Unfortunately, I often see a **coffee** table placed so far away or so low down that it renders its purpose useless,’ says Keren Richter, co-founder and principal designer at White Arrow (opens in new tab). ‘You ideally want your **coffee** table to be a similar height to your seating, and we like them to be roughly two thirds the length of the sofa dimensions. If you’re using two smaller tables side-by-side, aim for the total length of these to hit the two thirds mark too.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another aspect you can experiment with is the material of your **coffee** table, as it’s a good place to introduce some contrast within your scheme or an element of surprise. ‘Materiality is also a consideration,’ says Stefani. ‘For me, it’s all about the mix of different textures and surfaces. In this room, the glass tops add a lightness and openness which provide a lovely sense of balance within the space.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For this gorgeous room by Lisa Staton Design (opens in new tab), the key was in the history of the house. ‘We wanted to honor the bones of the original house, but also infused it with a layer of clean and simple furnishings,’ explains Lisa Staton, Founder and Principal Designer. ‘The chairs are vintage, and there’s a mix of handmade textiles, so it made sense to then balance these rustic textures with a more modern **coffee** table. The bleached wood base and soft oval marble top are both contemporary, yet still feel suitably relaxed.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As helpful as rules are, this gorgeous project by Stefani Stein Inc (opens in new tab). is a lesson in always being sensitive to the needs of a space. A singular **coffee** table might not be right for every room, so it pays to be a little flexible and open to alternatives. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Perhaps one of the most important things to nail in any room scheme is the sense of scale. A larger room works better visually if it has furniture of a similarly grand proportion, just as a small living room will feel calmer and less cluttered with pieces that are more petite. The same logic can be applied to a **coffee** table; large sofas will overwhelm a tiny **coffee** table, while an enormous **coffee** table will be too distracting if your seating is on the small side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
