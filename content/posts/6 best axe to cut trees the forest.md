## 6 Tips for Best Axe To Cut Trees The Forest | Choosing an Axe
-   Gränsfors Splitting Axes are specially crafted to split wood. The **axe**s have a large and heavy head that is forged and ground into a concave shape with a relatively thin edge. The **axe**s are made to chop along the grain of the wood fibers, in contrast to Forestry Axes, which are made to cut across the grain of the wood fibers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The largest, the American Felling **axe**, is 90 cm long and weighs in at 2.2 kg. This is used to fell really big trees. The choice of Forestry Axe depends entirely on what you want to use it for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Gränsfors Splitting Axes come in four sizes: the Splitting Hatchet, the Small Splitting Axe, the Large Splitting Axe and the Splitting Maul. There is also a Splitting Wedge for use with the Splitting Maul. The three smaller **axe**s are all similar in design, differing only in the weight of the head and the length of the handle. The head of the Splitting Maul has a different shape, with a rather longer and heavier poll with beveled corners. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Always pay attention to the type of **axe** you are using. Due to the diverse shapes not all **axe**s are useful for all for all shapes. For instance a **forest** **axe** is not suitable for splitting wood and might even be damaged in the process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gränsfors Forestry Axes come in different sizes, with a range of **axe** heads and handle. The smallest, the Gränsfors Mini Hatchet, is only 26 cm long and weighs 0.3 kg. This **axe** can almost be used as a filleting knife, as it has an extremely thin edge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When splitting wood, the handle is put under great strain at the **axe** head, as the handle can easily hit the log being split. All Gränsfors Splitting Axes come with a metal collar to protect the handle. The handle is also grooved towards the end for an extra firm grip. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
