## 9 Interesting Facts How To Permanently Write On A Ceramic Mug | DIY Sharpie Plates & Mugs: How-tos, How-Dos & How-Don'ts!
-   DO place **mug**s and plates in a cold oven and set bake temperature to 425. Let bake 1 hour and allow to cool completely before removing. This should help prevent cracking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sharpie **mug**s have been popular for a few years and here's why, they are personal, really fun to make, and a pretty inexpensive gift to give. A few weeks ago I had my Activity Day girls make these (along with some homemade hot cocoa mix) and they had a great time! This was a perfect project for those 8 to 11-year-old girls and they came up with the most creative designs to go on their **mug**s. One girl drew their family cattle brand, one made the **mug** handle into an elephant nose, another did a fun snowman family, and yet another made the cutest panda **mug**. My kids made **mug**s to give as part of their teacher gifts, and I made a few to stick in the mail and send to friends. If you google "sharpie **mug**s" you'll get a million ideas for designs, funny quotes, and different simple things you can put on your **mug**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   DO use stickers or stencils to create fun designs on your DIY plates and **mug**s. I gently stuck a speech bubble to a plate and then used the black paint marker to outline it. I let the marker dry before carefully removing the sticker. You can also use letter stickers like in this kid-made scribble **mug**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   DO hand wash **mug**s and plates...unless you're still feeling lucky, then by all means take your chances with the dishwasher. Or the dog. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1. Start by washing your **mug** in warm soapy water to remove any stickers. Rinse and dry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I just love how personal you can get on these. You could do a monogram, add a favorite quote, make stick figures to represent a family, refer to inside jokes, or feature a favorite pet. The **mug**s my kids made for their teachers are so personal and really show their age. Grandma's go nuts over that kind of thing too right?! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Put some rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball and rub all over the outside of the **mug** (where you'll be painting it). This will help to remove any residues that might encourage your paint to not stick. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. Decorate with paint pens however you'd like (I did not put any paint inside of the **mug** since I assume the paint is not considered food safe). If you make a mistake use a cotton swap dipped in rubbing alcohol to wipe away any mistakes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   DON'T use dollar store **mug**s and plates if you're not. You may end up with random discolorations. You can see it in Madison's "pasta" plate above. Next time I think we'll try IKEA. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
