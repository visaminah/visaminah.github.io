## 46 Reference List: Best Rated Cordless Electric Hedge Trimmers | Best Commercial Battery Hedge Trimmer
-   Battery-powered **hedge** **trimmers** have a limited amount of power because they must convert energy from the lithium-ion battery to the electric motor. Corded electric **hedge** **trimmers** are more powerful because they have a direct connection to a power source. However, the most powerful type of **hedge** trimmer is gas because of the large combustion engine that burns gas at a controlled rate to drive the blades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These tough tools, which generally require both oil and gas to run properly, tend to work harder than their electric counterparts. The downside to more power is weight: Gas **hedge** **trimmers** may weigh more than 10 pounds, making it a challenge to reach up and around tall shrubbery. Electric **hedge** **trimmers**: Though they don’t provide quite as much oomph as gas-juiced models, electric **trimmers** are usually lighter, making them easier to wield at chest height or higher. Lower-priced corded models offer uninterrupted use but less mobility because they’re plugged into an outlet—a potential problem for larger yards if the gardener doesn’t have a lengthy extension cord. Cordless **hedge** **trimmers** use a battery to allow total freedom of movement, as long as the batteries are recharged or replaced regularly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Black + Decker 40V MAX is by far the best cordless **hedge** trimmer available. It has a 40-volt lithium-ion battery that fully charges in about an hour, and runs continuously for up to an hour and 20 minutes—which is equivalent to 6,000 square feet. of trimming per charge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The fuel capacity refers to the amount of fuel that a gas-powered **hedge** trimmer can hold in the fuel tank. The capacity is typically used to determine how long the trimmer can operate on a single tank of gas. This is an important feature that can help determine the suitability of a gas-powered **hedge** trimmer. Naturally, larger yards will benefit from a trimmer with a higher fuel capacity so that they can operate long enough to complete the required yard maintenance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   are ideal for the average user. They can take on large bushes, manage full-size **hedge**s, and trim smaller tree branches. 30-inch and larger blades typically fall into the commercial and professional category. These blades are for regularly maintaining large established trees, **hedge**s, bushes, shrubs, and other vegetation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are looking to buy a new **hedge** trimmer, I would strongly recommend a cordless model. In general, they are lighter, easy to use and maintain and less expensive than gas-powered models. Although they may not be ideal for commercial applications. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   At just 2.5 pounds, this 1,200 RPM tool with an ergonomic handle includes both **hedge**r and shear attachments, so it adapts to whatever kind of shrubbery you’re trimming. It has a rechargeable 7.2-volt lithium-ion battery (with charger) for easy cordless operation. Interchangeable 4- and 6-inch blades mean you can do all sorts of grooming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The chosen **hedge** **trimmers** cut branches ranging from ⅜ to 1 inch in diameter and have blade sizes ranging from 18 to 24 inches. We prioritized relatively lightweight tools with runtimes over 40 minutes for cordless electric and gas tools. Some models come with a battery and a charger included to get the user started with landscaping right away. Additionally, the list prioritized models with features such as dual-action blades, a comfortable grip, and anti-vibration systems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even though the trimmer is working hard, you’ll be spared the bulk of the labor. It is lightwieght, easy to maneuver, and has a soft and comfortable grip. It will allow you to cut cleanly through most branches with only one pass. It’s also quieter and has less vibration.

-   Our next pick is the best cordless **hedge** trimmer for the money. The Earthwise 20-inch has a 2.0An Lithium-ion battery that charges in about 45 to 60 minutes but only gives you 30 to 45 minutes of continuous use. This little gem, however, does sport a dual-action steel blade that will help you cut through ⅝ of an inch. At 2,600 SPM, you will be able to cut cleanly through shrubs and bushes with one pass, and it is also good for edging. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Good news! You don’t need to spend the major dough to get your yard in tip-top shape. While it’s true that you can spend hundreds on the best **hedge** **trimmers**, if you’re looking for something that won’t break the bank, there are some good options. For example, you can get 7.2 volts of power in a trimmer with multiple attachments for under 40 bucks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The DEWALT DCHT820P1 is ready to go right out of the box. Its steel blades are a good length to reach hard to get areas and are extremely sharp. It’s much lighter than most gas **trimmers**, and it cuts through **hedge**s like a pro. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This 20-volt 22-Inch cordless **hedge** trimmer weighs just 5.5 pounds and is easily maneuverable in multiple directions. It clocks 2,600 revs per minute with minimal vibration and guarantees the flattest tops around. At just $85, with battery and charger included, it’s pretty reasonable too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These are of course a vital feature of any quality **hedge** trimmer. It is these that do the cutting and as such will do the bulk of the hard work. There are two important elements to the blades: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This type of trimmer is designed to trim and not to saw through thicker branches or stems. The bigger heavier duty petrol **hedge** **trimmers** can handle that type of cutting. Most standard **hedge** **trimmers** come with a 15 - 20 mm gap which is enough to trim most **hedge**s. If you have mature **hedge**s or thicker **hedge**s then look for a trimmer with a 30 mm tooth gap. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Electric **hedge** **trimmers** have an amperage (amps) measurement that indicates the amount of energy flowing through the electric engine. The higher the amperage, the more powerful the engine. Most electric **hedge** **trimmers** range from 2.5 to 4.5 amps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The sharper your blades are the better of course. The sharpness also really helps keep down the amount of vibration you will get in your hands and arms when using your trimmer. You can buy **trimmers** that have laser cut or diamond ground blades which are sharper and will last longer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After looking at the factors above, you probably have an idea of what you need in a **hedge** trimmer. If you are still on the fence, consider the task at hand. What kind of weight can you handle? Is this for light work twice a year, or medium work once a month? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You will also have a difficult time with the weight of the trimmer, though it is quieter than most. In this case, though, the lack of noise indicates a lack of power. Unfortunately, this is not the best option for a **hedge** trimmer. You would probably be better off with a traditional hand-powered trimmer than spending money on this model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another factor to consider is handleability. Choosing a model that is too heavy or is not well balanced will make the trimmer very difficult to use. You also want to look into the handle and the type of trigger. For example, safety triggers are good, but can be tricky to use while maneuvering the trimmer. If you are not able to use the **hedge** trimmer correctly, it will affect more than just your strength, but the performance of the trimmer as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our third choice is dedicated to a **hedge** trimmer that can reach high and difficult places. The Earthwise 20-inch Pole Hedge Trimmer comes equipped with a telescoping pole that extends up to 9.5 feet, and has five adjustable positions that rotate about 180 degrees. This will help you trim anything out of reach without the use of a ladder. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Milwaukee 2726-20 is a commercial grade battery powered **hedge** trimmer. It has the ability to cut branches up to 3/4″ thick and provides a 2 hour runtime – when paired with the 9.0 battery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This unit is heavier than it looks….about 3 pounds more than most competitors. Due to the extra weight, this may not be the best **hedge** trimmer for smaller people. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Keep all body parts away from cutting blades. Carry your **hedge** clipper by its handle and make certain that the cutting blade is stopped. Keep this appliance away from children. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are not ready to join the ranks of physichally exhausted, extension cord bereft homeowners, you have come to the right place. Cordless **hedge** **trimmers** have gained a lot of popularity in recent years, and for good reason. However, choosing the right one for you can be easier said than done. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   is an appropriate blade size for small **hedge**s, weeds, and shrubs that are common in residential gardens. 19- to 30-inch blades are ideal for the average user. They can take on large bushes, manage full-size **hedge**s, and trim smaller tree branches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to feeling proud of your abode and peaceful at home, a well-manicured yard can make all the difference. And when you give the **hedge**s a fresh cut yourself instead of hiring someone else, you not only save money, but you also get bragging rights. In order to find the best tool to manage this achievement, there are a lot of things to consider: Do you want an electric trimmer, or would you prefer a battery-operated or gas-powered model? Do you need an extended **hedge** trimmer for extra-tall trees, or will something smaller and more detail-oriented be better? Then there’s the question of cordless vs. corded **trimmers**. Since we can’t all be Edward Scissorhands, here are the best **hedge** **trimmers** on the market to keep your lawn fresh this summer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Typically, cordless **hedge** **trimmers** will require blade lubrication at some point, and possibly sharpening. They could also need a replacement part, or have a wire come loose. The most common issue though is the lifespan of a battery. Looking into the cost of a replacement battery—if you can get one—is important. On that same thought, can you run other tools from that battery? A lot of companies, such as Black + Decker, allow you to interchange your batteries with other Black + Decker tools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On average, a **hedge** trimmer battery can last between 30 minutes and 1 hour, and it will take between 30 minutes and 2 hours to fully charge. Keep in mind that some **hedge** **trimmers** don’t come with a battery or a battery charger, so users may need to purchase the battery separately. If this is the case, it’s a good idea to get two batteries so that one is always charging while the other is in use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hedges establish boundaries in landscaping, add privacy, and benefit curb appeal, but to look their best, they must be groomed. Power **hedge** **trimmers** are designed for this very purpose. The best power **hedge** **trimmers** make it much easier to shape and otherwise control growth and vegetation in the yard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is no doubt that the Black + Decker 40V MAX Cordless Hedge Trimmer, 24-Inch is the best cordless **hedge** trimmer this year. Not only is it powerful enough to tackle most jobs, but it has a great battery operating time, makes clean one-pass cuts, and is easy to handle. There is not too much else you could want in a **hedge** trimmer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Read on to learn the key considerations to keep in mind when choosing these handy power tools—and check out the roundup of some of the top picks of the best power **hedge** trimmer models available.

-   If you tend toward one particular brand when it comes to your outside work gear, you’re in luck: There’s a wide range of companies that make outdoor tools at multiple price points. From the Black and Decker **hedge** trimmer to the Dewalt **hedge** trimmer, not to mention the various Milwaukee, Stihl, Ego, Echo, and Ryobi tools—if you prefer a specific make and model, it’s out there. But more important than the brand are your particular needs. Would you like a trimmer that’s cordless, so you can roam freely? Or, perhaps, a long-reach trimmer for those hard-to-get-to nooks and crannies? Think of functionality and brand as equally essential aspects of your purchase. If your favorite company makes the right kind of tool you ultimately need for the job at hand, that’s a win-win. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, there are a few features that can make it easier to hold and control **hedge** **trimmers**, including a padded front handle that gives users a better grip on the trimmer. Telescoping poles are another great feature that reduces muscle strain by allowing the trimmer to extend out to cut branches and leaves instead of trying to stretch or climb up and down a ladder repeatedly. Also, a tool that is well balanced from the front to the back usually offers better support and can reduce muscle fatigue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Greenworks 22262 is a lightweight, high quality **hedge** trimmer. It’s motor and battery combination offer good value, but in some cases can be under powered. This product is not meant for commercial applications. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Having a wider tooth gap makes it easier to cut through thicker branches and stems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Makita **hedge** trimmer has some good safety features. Its computer controls tell you when the trimmer is over-loading, overcharging, and overheating. The 22-inch steel dual action shear blade pumps out 2700 SPM. This option is also a light-duty winner, as it is good for shaping small plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is important then to know the width of your **hedge**. If you have a **hedge** that is less than 120 cm (4 feet) wide, then these blade lengths will do the job really well. If your **hedge** is wider than that, then you will need one with a longer blade, and when you do that, your choices reduce quite a lot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The WORX PowerShare 20” **hedge** trimmer is number 7 on our list. This 20-inch dual-action steel blade is very lightweight and compact. It is perfect for the novice **hedge** trimmer. The 20-volt battery lasts for only about 30 minutes of stop and go use. It also sports a D-shaped handle that makes it easier to work at different angles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the top item on your to-do list is getting your yard in fighting shape, then it’s time to purchase a **hedge** trimmer. Finding the best **hedge** **trimmers** for your needs is all about the space you’re working with, whether you want an electric cord or need room to wander, and how much money you prefer to spend. Figure that out, and it’s time to chop, chop! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Obviously, you want your **hedge** trimmer to offer versatility—maybe your backyard is huge while your front yard is more modest—but whatever model you buy should be easy to use and work efficiently. Blade size is the No. 1 thing to consider when investing in a trimmer. As a rule, opt for less than 16 inches for small to average-size **hedge**s, 18 inches for average-size **hedge**s, and 20 inches or more for large, thick **hedge**s and branches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
