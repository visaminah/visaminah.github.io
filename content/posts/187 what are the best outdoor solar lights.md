-   The number of **lights** will depend on the area and purpose for lighting. Generally, the yard, garden, patio, driveway, will require several **lights** at the same time. As a result, the majority of **solar** driveway **lights** on the market come with a collection of multiple **lights**. This involves a range of pack sizes such as a 6 light pack, an 8 light pack, and even a 10 light pack in some situations where a bigger pack is often preferable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
