## 7 Fun Facts Sink Grid For 33 Farmhouse Sink | sink grid for 33 farmhouse sink
-   The ideal **sink** **grid** should perfectly fit the dimensions of the kitchen **sink**. Most kitchen **sink** manufacturers will offer **sink** **grid**s that are compatible with their specific **sink** models. You should always opt for a durable **sink** **grid** from a reputable manufacturer that will withstand the test of time, lessen the chances of premature corrosion, and take the everyday abuse that a kitchen **sink** goes through. Metallic **sink** **grid**s should always have rubber feet to protect from scratching the surface of the **sink**; be sure these rubber feet are installed prior to placing the **grid** into the **sink**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Custom-designed to protect your kitchen **sink** from dishes and utensils, BLANCO’s stainless steel **sink** **grid**s also add a new layer of functionality to your kitchen workspace. The basin rack can be used for rinsing dishes or preparing vegetables, and can also be used an in-**sink** drying rack for glassware, utensils and pans. Made to complement the unique shape of your BLANCO **sink**, this basin rack is made to measure, so it’s always the perfect fit. Designed to protect the bottom of your **sink** from everyday wear and tear, the **sink** **grid** keeps your kitchen **sink** looking flawless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a kitchen **sink** and are in the market for a new **sink** rack to help protect it, the best bet is to look for the **sink** manufacturer name stamped somewhere on the **sink** top, around the drain, on the rear wall of the **sink**, or sometimes beneath the **sink**. This will greatly help to find the specific size you need for a perfect fit from the same manufacturer. If you are unable to locate the manufacturer name, you will then need to measure the **sink** width and depth as well as locate the center of the drain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sink **grid**s, also known as basin racks or **sink** racks, are a great accessory to have for use in your kitchen **sink**. They buffer the sound of pots and pans hitting the bottom of the basin, serve as a drainer, and protect dishes and cookware from scratching the finish on your **sink**. With so many sizes, shapes, and basin configurations available in kitchen **sink**s, **grid**s also come in a variety of sizes and shapes to complement them. Here's some tips on finding one that works with your particular **sink**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also note the curvature or radius measurement of the corners of your **sink**. You will want to match the **grid** to the same or similar radius. If the **grid**'s corners are sharper than your **sink**, it will not fit properly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To find the center of the drain hole, make four measurements from each side of the **sink**, starting at that same "just above the curve" point, but only measure to the center of the drain this time. You should now have six measurements in total width, depth, front to drain center, back to drain center, right side to drain center, and left side to drain center. A more ambitious approach would be to take a large piece of cardboard and slowly trim it down until it sits in your **sink** as you would like the **sink** **grid** to, then using a pointed object simply poke a hole in the center of the drain hole. Measure the completed template to yield the same six measurements as above. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
