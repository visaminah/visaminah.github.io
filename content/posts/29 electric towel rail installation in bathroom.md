## 29 Things About Electric Towel Rail Installation In Bathroom | Heated Towel Rails
-   Depending on the amount of space available, you can choose either a floor standing or wall mounted model; the latter being ideal where floor space is at a premium, for example in smaller **bathroom**s. If opting for a wall hung **towel** rail, ensure the fixings you used are appropriate for the wall and that the wall itself can take the load. If you are unsure, it’s recommended that you employ a qualified professional. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Versatile - With a wet system, there are often limitations placed on output of the radiator because of the size of the boiler. Being electric, our **towel** rails are not confined by availability of pipework, providing greater versatility when locating the product, making them ideal for refurbishing a **bathroom**. As Dimplex Towel Rails can operate completely independently, there is no need to worry about disturbing the existing system which is not only more convenient, but saves time and money. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking to equip your smaller **bathroom** with an electronic **towel** heater, then its shape is going to be incredibly important. Space is tighter in smaller **bathroom**s, and therefore it’s more valued. You need to choose a **towel** rail that is large enough to do the job it’s supposed to, and small enough so that it minimises **bathroom** clutter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here’s some good news. Purchase one of Eskimo’s revolutionary Gordon heated **towel** rails and you’re not only guaranteed of experiencing luxury. Your safety will be guaranteed to. Here’s why: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bathrooms are a very wet and steamy environment, which creates the perfect situation for mould to grow. This is evident during the winter months here in Warrnambool as **bathroom**s can stay damp for days on end. Heated **towel** rails not only keep your **towel**s dry but also prevents mould. Giving your **towel**s the best chance to dry in between uses also helps keep your **towel**s hygienic for longer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What about the **towel**s? Can they catch fire? Again, the answer is definitely not. While the heat generated is enough to dry and warm **towel**s, the total heat output is limited by the amount of power, which is generally around 200 Watts. This ensures the heated **towel** rail can never get hotter than its maximum temperature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In addition, the wiring from an electric radiator or **towel** rail is hardwired into the mains electricity supply. It is not connected via a traditional plug/socket and is not susceptible to possible water ingress. One of the main reasons that a qualified electrician must be required is to ensure this hardwired electricity connection is done safely and placed in the correct 'zone' of your **bathroom** - i.e. at a legally-required distance away from baths, showers, taps and any other water outlets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most heated **towel** rails use between 60-120W of power. This makes them a much more energy efficient way to keep your **towel**s dry and warm than running your ducted heating, radiator heater or putting them in your energy hungry 1800W clothes dryer. The energy efficiency of the heated **towel** rail can also be increased by installing a timer. This allows the **towel** rail to be programmed to only heat when required. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An electric **towel** heater’s power is measured in Watts, so be aware of this when you’re looking to purchase. Like anything else, it’s important to take your **bathroom** size into consideration. Obviously, the larger your **bathroom**, the more watts you need. The smaller your **bathroom**, the fewer Watts necessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another common question regarding safety is whether a heated **towel** rail can burn. This is perhaps a reasonable concern, as these products are a heating appliance, just like a radiator, are therefore the surface does heat up. It’s also true that some heated **towel** rails can get quite hot to the touch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Last but not least is the design of your electric **towel** heater. Like any element of decoration, your heated **towel** rail should work in sync with your **bathroom** synchronisation. However, **towel** rails are perhaps the easiest to buy because each design is so similar. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This silent operating, modern slim-line design appliance comes in standard and narrow models, in order to adapt harmoniously to any **bathroom**, even in the smallest ones. It is easy to install on the wall 30 cm above the floor. Just use a plug near the radiator and you are ready to go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although it is simple to believe that **towel** radiators are expensive to operate, this is untrue. In actuality, they cost less than the majority of alternative heating systems. They are quite effective and can save heating costs by up to 40%, so we should keep that in mind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you are purchasing a heated **towel** rail for hard-wiring or for plugging in to an electrical socket, check its IP Rating before you purchase. IP stands for Ingress Protection and specifies that a product is protected against intrusions of solid and liquid particles. For example, IP44 is protected from solid particles that are over 1 millimetre and against water splashing from any angle. Perfect protection for a heated **towel** rail. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   According to the IET 18th Edition Wiring Regulations, **bathroom** heaters, heated **towel** rails, lighting and other electrical devices within **bathroom**s need to comply with IP (ingress protection) ratings in particular zones. This means that when installed correctly the product should prevent the ingress of water and remain safe for use without the potential to cause harm to the end-user i.e electrical shocks or electrocution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Heated **towel** rails are growing in popularity through out Australia as more and more people are realizing the benefits. With the option of hard wiring the heated **towel** rail to your existing **bathroom** switches, there is no need to have any ugly cords on display. Modern electric heated **towel** rails are efficient, convenient and look great as a design feature in **bathroom**s. The windy cold winter months make heated **towel** rail installation in Warrnambool especially beneficial. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're looking for the convenience of an electric **towel** rail combined with the warmth of a powerful 1kW Panel Heater then the Dimplex BPH Range is for you with EcoDesign Compliant Lot 20 Controls. Or maybe a stylish ladder design our most popular **towel** rail is the Dimplex CPTS. We also stock the relevant **towel** rail controllers for Dimplex and Creda. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Modern electric **towel** rails use a dry heating element. This means they do not rely on heating liquid inside the rails like hydronic versions. This is more efficient as it does not lose as much heat to the surrounding room. When a **towel** is placed over the rails, the heat is trapped and causes the temperature within the **towel**s to rise to around 50-55 degrees. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, plug-in heated **towel** rails are also very safe. The proviso is that they are installed in a safe place in your **bathroom**. For example, you should never install a plug-in rail inside your shower (not sure why anyone would, but it’s worth pointing out!) or directly above a bathtub. In fact, make sure yours is installed well away from water sources altogether. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In recent years. Electric Towel Rails have become increasingly important. Not only are they a source of heat in your **bathroom** they’re also a fantastic platform for **bathroom** storage design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Particularly in winter, heated **towel** rails provide a convenient way to dry out your **towel**s while they’re hanging up between uses. This saves you from having to put them in the dryer to get rid of that musty smell. Being energy efficient is especially important when looking at heated **towel** rail installation in Warrnambool, due to there being so many chilly winter days! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With an electric radiator heater **towel**, it’s important it’s powered in a safe way.

-   On the surface this may seem like a fair question. After all, heated **towel** rails are an electrical item and we all know that electricity and water shouldn’t mix. However, let’s allay any fears you may have from the start. The vast majority of **towel** rails are safe and we’ll explain why in this post. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At Trade Radiators, we have a huge range of electric radiators and **towel** rails in stock with prices you won’t beat anywhere else. Our selection promises simple but effective heaters that will match the décor in any room. With excellent efficiency, reliability and high BTU outputs, our electric radiators allow you to get the best of both worlds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another convenience of having electric heating in your **bathroom** is that you can switch it on and off as and when you need it without needing to switch on your whole central heating system. This is a particularly popular reason people give when deciding to install an electric heated **towel** rail in their **bathroom**s or ensuites. It may not be necessary in summer, for example, to have the whole central heating system on but you can still opt to dry your damp **towel**s by manually switching on your electric **towel** rail. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because electric heaters are powered by connection to the mains electrical system, there is no need for taking up floor boards or chunks out of the wall to accommodate copper centra heating pipes. A qualified electrician can simply wall-mount the heater, connect it up to the system and switch it on. This ease of installation not only means less disruption, but also has the potential to be significantly cheaper. It's a popular solution for people who have a newly-created **bathroom** or a downstairs **bathroom** that is not served by your home's copper pipe network. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are various styles of heated **towel** rail that you can choose from depending on your own personal taste and the size of the space that you have available. For modern **bathroom** suites, go for a contemporary chrome plated or white painted design. If it’s classic chic you are looking to achieve, a more traditional style will be suitable. If space is at a premium, you can opt for a wall mounted design. The choice is yours! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first thing to consider before you buy is whether you’re going to connect the **towel** rail to the central heating system or use a heated element instead. The main difference between central heating **towel** rails and electrically heated rails is that centrally heated ones can only be used when the central heating is on, which is mostly during the winter. Therefore, to warm **towel**s in the summer months you will need to turn the whole system on and close the valves on every radiator, except the heated **towel** rail, so you can use it in isolation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In modern, insulated homes the installed location is less important, but ideally, your heated **towel** rail should be placed on the coldest wall of your **bathroom**. The outside wall with the window on it is often the best one. If this isn’t possible, try to fix it on one of the external walls of the room. This will ensure a good repetition of the heat throughout the room, which will gain in efficiency. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
