-   Sometimes, despite your best efforts, nothing works. As a young **architect**, I once got so desperate to collect final payment, that I went to the client’s place of business and told him I would be sitting in the showroom waiting for my money and that if anyone asked what I was doing there, I’d tell them. I sat about ten minutes before he cut me a check. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If this client has built other things, call the **architect** who designed them. Find out if they paid on time and if they tended to waste a lot of time. Often a lovely, well-intentioned client will require so much time in extra meetings, lengthy explanations, and wishy-washy decisions, that they’ll consume your entire fee. Another **architect** will be able to tell you the score. Other good resources are real estate agents and contractors who have some experience with this owner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The highest **earn**ers in the **architect**ural profession tend to be the directors, partners and principles. The level of income at this level is predominately factored by the size of practice and type of work they take on.

Simply because the projects at a commercial level are considerably larger and more expensive, and require a higher **architect**ural fees, but generally speaking, are much more efficient to procure, resulting in a higher profit to the design team. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

So from that standpoint, there's just a lot going on in this office. And we need as much help as possible to be able to focus on the **architect**ure.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, this fee schedule demands an almost impossible efficiency. This **architect** has a week and a half to design the entire building. And take a look at the construction administration section: If it takes 10 months to construct the building, the **architect** has just 2.5 hours a week to do the inspections, have all the discussions, sort out all the issues, and do all the paperwork. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Architects use so much software that they are bound to run into certain issues. How often have you turned to YouTube to answer your questions?

-   One thing I want to stress is that no matter which field you work in, knowledge of relevant software and some practical coding skills and experience can be highly valuable. This is also certainly true for **architect**s who rely heavily on many software like Rhino and Revit to deliver their projects. While there are other ways to get started making a side income with your **architect**ure skills, having some working knowledge of a niche software will not only be quite lucrative but also help you stand out in the job market, so I highly encourage it! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First of all, this sends the signal that you are operating a business. Second, it recognizes that an **architect** is essentially lending the client the cost of the services until they’re complete and paid for. If you were a bank lending that kind of capital, you’d check the financial health of your borrower. You can ask to see the construction loan, the line of credit, or the bank statement — anything to prove that the money they’re promising you is available to them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It all starts with this. Architects tend to be pleasers and problem solvers and often avoid the critical issues involved in running a successful business, like making sure the person you depend on to pay for your services will actually pay. Here are some things **architect**s can do to vet a client. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Exports are another good way of **earn**ing money. A workshop can bring in a steady income when inmates are trained in workshop safety. You can also train them further in Workshop Apprentice courses which allow them to make beds at carpenters tables which sell for a lot more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In 2021, there sure is a marketplace for house plans, and it's called Plantribe. While there are other plan marketplaces on the market, Plantribe is growing rapidly.

With the help of Plantribe, you can really increase your reach and market access across the globe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Payment problems and delays in construction aren’t just limited to the subcontractors and suppliers on a project. Architects have trouble getting paid, too. So, how do **architect**s get paid? And what obstacles do they face? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “I would like to see us expanding into more areas. I would like **architect**ure firms figuring out what other SaaS models that they can deliver to their clients to continue a relationship after a building is built, helping them operate and maintain buildings.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Our **architect**s actually do come into play with that (the feasibility phase) rather than just being like, ‘we're allowed to build a three-story building here.’ Our **architect**s will actually do some quick sketches on it and give it a little more taste of what's around that neighborhood.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In some ways, the cost of prison **architect**ure is not surprising, especially given the large number of people housed in them. For example, a prison with just ten inmates needs a simple holding cell, not a massive cell block. The cost of keeping an older inmate in jail is $16 billion annually, and it’s no wonder that prison **architect**s are raking in the dough. Another way to cut down on prison **architect** costs is to think twice before embarking on a major building project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Charge for expenses. This seems obvious, but **architect**s are notorious for quietly absorbing expenses. Your contract will likely —and should — spell out charges for miles driven, reproductions, postage, and even some forms of project delivery. BIM (Building Information Modeling) is now often charged as an additional expense. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
