## 14 Tips to How To Load Test A Deep Cycle Battery With A Multimeter | How To Load Test A Deep Cycle Battery Without A Load Tester
-   Connect the battery **test**er to the battery. It is done by connecting the positive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the **test**er. And the negative terminal of the **test**er to the negative terminal of the **test**er. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your battery shows a voltage rating from 12.7V to 13V then the battery health is very good. Showing voltage below 12V means the battery requires recharging as soon as possible. For such circumstances recharge the battery using a standard battery charger and re**test**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For doing this, you must know the correct ways to **test** the AGM batteries. Because incorrect diagnosis will lead you to take bad decisions which wonâ€™t be fruitful in the future. There are several automatic and manual ways to **test** the AGM batteries. This article would help you to select teh best possible way to **test** the AGM battery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best way to determine the health of the battery is to perform a heavy load **test**. The battery load **test**er pulls out some massive power in amps. If the voltage of the battery is maintained properly then the health of the battery is considered to be good. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A Cranking Amps (CA) or Cold Cranking Amps (CCA) rating is for **test**ing batteries for engine starting. A deep cycle battery needs to be **test**ed with a capacitance **test**er. Better still is to do the following **test**: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   AGM or lead-acid batteries do not come with a digital display that shows the amount of charge it has. In order to know the exact amount of charge your battery is retaining can be known by some actions. For this, you have to have a digital voltmeter, wattmeter, or **multimeter**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you get a value lesser than 10 percent then recharge the battery to the fullest using a quick battery charger. Run the **test** again for confirmation. If you still get a high-value difference then the calculated value then the battery health is highly depleted. It means the electrode plates have been worn out completely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This process is simple and only requires a digital **multimeter** or voltmeter. After fully charging your battery you have to connect the battery to the volt measuring device. Fully charged batteries show a voltage reading of more than 13V. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Load **test**ing is the same in all the batteries. It is better to keep your battery charged up to 80% or more for a more reliable result. For load **test**ing, you can use the automatic smart chargers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You have to divide the CCA of the battery in half. Now, it is done to measure the health of the battery. Considering your battery shows a reading equivalent to half of the CCA after the load **test**. Then the battery is supposed to be in good health. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If considering your AGM batteries fail to retain power, hold the charge and drop in voltage rapidly. Then you should think of replacing the battery with a new one. A load **test** will also help you know the battery status. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the battery health is good, the voltage during the **test** never drops down to 10V. But the battery is depleted the voltage omes below to 10V. This means the battery requires replacing or maintenance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Considering, the battery has crossed the warranty limit and showing some problems. Then you can perform the initial **test** to check out the battery health in order to save some buck. You can determine the state of charge of the battery by analyzing the voltage availability of the battery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Check out the volt reading in the **test**er or the voltmeter. When fully charged the reading should be around 12.5-12.6V - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
