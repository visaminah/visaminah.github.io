## 35 Shocking Facts About Best Stylus For Drawing On An Android Tablet | Best Note-Taking App Android S Pen
-   You never have to charge the S Pen for simple handwriting or drawing. But the **stylus** has a battery that is charged inductively just like on the iPad Pro. In this case, the battery is needed for wireless gestures only. Most of these are just a gimmick but there are a couple of useful once. You can use the S Pen as a remote in Microsoft PowerPoint, for instance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Besides being a **tablet**, the Microsoft Surface Pro 7 can behave just like any other Windows PC can. In fact, the internal hardware is the same. Depending on the version, you can get it with an Intel Core i3, i5, and i7 processor, as well as with up to 16GB of RAM and an up to 1TB SSD. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As I said at the beginning, I’m reviewing almost every **tablet** that gets released. And there are a couple of other devices that have been released in the last couple of years that haven’t made it to the main part of this list. That’s because, for most, I think the upper ones are a way better choice. But if you’re looking for something specific, you might be interested in one of the following ones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Inside the iPad 8 sits an Apple A12 Bionic processor with 3GB of RAM which is faster than many Android **tablet**s. When buying it, you can choose between 32GB and 128GB of internal storage and you can get cellular versions. The performance is noticeably weaker than the iPad Air or iPad Pro. But it’s a great gaming **tablet** too – you just might not be able to play everything with the highest graphics settings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like all devices on this list, the Lenovo Tab P12 Pro does support an active **stylus**. The Lenovo Precision Pen 3 is included and feels like a real pen. It’s charged inductively by the **tablet** as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Microsoft Surface Pro 7 was the best Windows **tablet** until the Surface Pro 8 got released. It’s still an interesting choice if you want to save some money. You can get it with the Microsoft Surface Pen which supports 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity and is being powered by a replaceable battery. You’ll have to buy it separately. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Other premium features are included as well. We get four great speakers, fingerprint scanners, a USB C 3.1 port on each **tablet**, as well as a microSD card slot. If you want, you can also buy an official keyboard cover. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The iPad Pro series plays in the highest league regarding everything else too. Its Apple M1 chipset is faster than many pricier laptops and much more powerful than every Android **tablet** out there. You can use it to play the newest games with the highest graphics settings and cut 4K videos and render them fast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The performance is quite a bit weaker but good enough for most apps and the Samsung DeX desktop mode runs great too. Inside the WiFi, version runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G processor, while the 5G variant features a Snapdragon 750G chipset. Still, it’s more powerful than entry-level **tablet**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Microsoft Surface Pro 8 is the best Windows **tablet** with pen support. It’s an interesting choice if you need Windows 11 and/or want to replace a proper laptop with it. That’s what you can do with the Surface Pro 8 for sure because the hardware is the same as in many notebooks. Except that you can also use it as a pure **tablet** with a **stylus**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Usually, I use the pens to write down handwritten notes and, if the **tablet** supports it, to edit photos in apps like Adobe Photoshop. Handwriting notes in apps like OneNote are a great way to test if the **tablet** supports palm rejection and how good it is. All **tablet**s on this list are very good at that. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite 2022 Edition is a bit weaker and smaller version of the Galaxy Tab S7 FE. It competes with the Apple iPad 9 and it’s the cheapest **tablet** with an active **stylus** that I can recommend. Even though it’s so far down on this list, I can recommend it. Especially if you want to save some money. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That’s the only major downside of the iPad 8 and one reason why it can be so much cheaper than the iPad Air 4. You’ll have to buy the Apple Pencil 1 separate, of course, but it works as well as it does on the iPad Mini. All the software features of iPadOS are the same here too. Yes, that also means you can use almost desktop-class Photoshop on this inexpensive **tablet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The built quality with its magnesium body is fantastic. I like that there’s a kickstand built-in and you can get it with the Microsoft Type Cover which is an excellent keyboard cover. Together with that keyboard, you can easily replace a full notebook with this **tablet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Apple iPad Mini is the best 8-inch **tablet** and since it supports the Apple Pencil 2, it’s also the best 8-inch **tablet** with a pen. I love this form factor and that’s why it’s my favorite **tablet** at the moment. Sadly, it’s lacking competition because there’s no 8-inch Android **tablet** with a pen out there that can compete with the Mini. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Which is the best **tablet** with a **stylus** in 2022? There are a lot of choices with Android, Windows 11, and even iPads. I review almost every **tablet**. Scroll down to find the best ones with pen support. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Due to its Exynos 9810 processor, it’s faster than all other 8-inch Android **tablet**s and gets close to the iPad Mini. You can play demanding games like Fortnite. When buying it, you can choose between 64GB and 128GB of internal storage. All versions have 4GB of RAM. The LTE version is interesting too since you can use it to make phone calls and send text messages. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, there are some downsides, of course. The biggest drawbacks and also one of its highlights is the design. It’s a very rugged **tablet** for tough work environments and that’s what it looks like. Sure, it’s by design and meant to be this way, but it just looks like an old device. Right now, there’s no real competitor running Android though. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sounds fantastic but no **tablet** is perfect. In addition to being very pricey, the 12.9-inch version suffers from a blooming effect in certain situations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I loved the Samsung Galaxy Tab Active 3 during my review. It features a pretty 8-inch full HD screen that you can navigate with the S Pen **stylus** which is included. The pen is smaller than the one for the Galaxy Tab S7 but the basics work the same. You can use it for handwritten text or to annotate PDFs in Samsung Note, draw with it, sign contracts, and so on. The pen is very responsive and just works great. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At 10.2 inches, the display is a bit smaller than the Air but it has the same brightness of 500 nits and it’s a 60Hz panel as well. Sadly, the screen is not laminated and that’s the only big downside of this **tablet**. It means there’s a visible air gap between the IPS panel and touchscreen. That’s why it sometimes seems like the pen is not touching the screen directly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Inside Windows 10, the Surface Pen is well supported. There’s a handwriting recognition built-in which works great. The **stylus** seems to be made for Microsoft OneNote which is a good note-taking app for Windows and other platforms. You can use the Surface Pen in lots of other programs like full Adobe Photoshop too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best overall: Apple iPad Pro (on Amazon*). The Apple iPad Pro is the best overall **tablet** with pen support because it has very pretty 11-inch and 12.9-inch screens, is faster than all Android competitors, and the Apple Pencil 2 is well supported on the software side. You can get lots of great note-taking apps, as well as professional programs like Adobe Photoshop. Due to their 120Hz screens, drawing with the Pencil looks super smooth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can see it as a smaller iPad Air. Just like with that one, the screen is a very good one, it’s 500 nits bright and supports 60Hz only. At 8 inches, it’s very handy and about the size of a small paper notebook. I think this size is perfect for handwriting and it’s also much lighter than other **tablet**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Which is the best **tablet** with pen support for yourself? That depends on your personal needs, of course. First, you should ask yourself if you specifically need a certain operating system. Do you need a **tablet** with Windows 10 because you also want to run a program that does not exist for the other ones? That narrows down your options quite significantly. Or do you want an iPad because you’re also using an iPhone? Or do you prefer a Samsung **tablet** because you’re using a Galaxy Note smartphone and want to use the same pen? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here, we get a 12.3-inch PixelSense display which is very pretty and works well together with the **stylus**. This is a standard 60Hz screen though, just like all the other **tablet**s further down this list. It means that compared to the iPad Pro and Galaxy Tab S7, you can sometimes notice that the drawings lag behind the pen a bit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **tablet**s themselves are great too. With their Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+ processor, they’re not as fast as the iPad Pro but faster than any other Android **tablet**. You can get versions with 6GB and 8GB of RAM, as well as 128GB up to 512GB of internal storage. The operating system is Android 10 and Samsung promises to update it for at least three years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In addition to Apple’s apps, you can install tons of others. A big advantage of iPads is that the selection of apps that are specifically optimized for **tablet**s is huge. You can get many different professional drawing apps and photo editing apps like Adobe Photoshop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pens for **tablet**s haven’t been popular for a long time. However, that changed with the Microsoft Surface Pro and Samsung’s S-Pen **tablet**s. By now, you can even get all current iPads with an active **stylus**. And even though Apple is late to the game, they managed to release amazing **tablet**s with pen support. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Galaxy Tab Active 3 is a very versatile **tablet**. Thanks to Android 10 and Samsung’s OneUI you can also use the Samsung DeX desktop mode. Once attached to an external monitor, keyboard and mouse, the **tablet** can behave similar to a desktop machine. So, it can be a normal 8-inch **tablet**, a phone, and a desktop device. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All three **tablet**s have a fingerprint scanner, fantastic speakers, premium metal bodies, and good cameras. Pre-installed is Android 12 including the Samsung DeX desktop mode. And just like Apple, Samsung is also offering two different kinds of keyboard covers for their **tablet**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The performance of the Apple A15 processor is a bit weaker than the M1, but it continues to be faster than almost every Android **tablet**. We get a premium metal body, it weighs under 300g, and we get a Touch ID fingerprint scanner. It has a USB C port, two good stereo speakers, as well as two good cameras. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 11-inch and 12.9-inch Apple iPad Pro are the best **tablet**s you can buy right now. And since both support an active pen, they’re also the best **tablet**s with **stylus** support. You have to buy the Apple Pencil 2 separately and like the other pens on this list, it’s pressure sensitive and supports over 4000 levels of pressure sensitivity. It’s charged inductively by placing the pen on the side of the iPads. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To get comparable results, I review all **tablet**s the same way. Usually, I start by running a couple of benchmarks to test their performance. I also do a battery test and check if they’re capable of running Netflix in HD. After I’m done with that, I use them as my daily driver. I watch YouTube and Netflix, play games, browse the web, and work with them with apps like Microsoft Word. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **tablet**s of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 series directly compete with both Apple iPad Pro – in fact, regarding many aspects, they’re very similar. Based on my reviews, they’re the best Android **tablet**s on the market today and all three versions come with the S Pen included. That’s the active **stylus** from Samsung which unlike the Apple Pencil never has to be charged. You can charge it, if you want, though. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
