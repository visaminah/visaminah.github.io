-   ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because you noticed it and a lot of times, the truth is, owners don‚Äôt know. Because when you live in a home, you don‚Äôt smell the things that other people smell. And so it‚Äôs important to point it out to the owners. So you can at least have an honest conversation about how other people will react when they walk in the **house**.‚Äù - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The chamomile scent has the amazing ability to remove any bad odours, like dog smell, and set in a beautiful, fresh aroma in its place.

-   Your **house** would feel so much cleaner if our **house** smelled amazing all the time. Well, if you own a dog, or did in the past, then you know how many different smells our little companions exude. The overwhelming dog smell should be removed and controlled at all costs. Otherwise, your **house** will become a bearer of the foul odour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You love your fur children, but you can‚Äôt deny that they make your home smell a little‚Ä¶funky.

-   Traditional **house**hold cleaning products such as vinegar, baking soda, soap, and the like seem to work at first because they eliminate some of the components of your pet‚Äôs urine. White vinegar in particular is highly alkaline, which means it can act as a deodorizer for spaces marked with dogs' urine. But dog urine stains are tough because they actually have organic enzymes that won‚Äôt be removed by vinegar alone, so although it might solve the problem temporarily, it won‚Äôt solve it long term. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The chamomile scent has the amazing ability to remove any bad odours, like dog smell, and set in a beautiful, fresh aroma in its place. The best thing is that chamomile oil can be used directly on your dog (again, in small quantities and diluted).

-   "In my experience, the average cost of smoke remediation from cigarette smoking is between $4,300 and $4,500. However, it‚Äôs maybe lower or higher depending on how distributed the damage is in your **house**," says Andrew Barker, Founder of HomeownerCosts. "You may need to pay more if every room in your home needs to be treated. Damage from toxic chemicals from cigarettes is not only harmful to you and your family but also to your home." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Having a mop and vacuum handy will also be helpful. Oh, and once you clean your wet dog, you'll need to keep him or her away from furniture and carpet surfaces while you tackle the rest of your **house**. A good game plan here might be sending your pup on a playdate or having a family member take them for a fun outing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although they won‚Äôt get rid of a doggy smell, (pet-friendly) air fresheners and scented candles will at least disguise it, as will simply opening windows and letting some fresh air in. "Keep rooms aired by opening windows often, and consider using incense, scented candles or pet-friendly air fresheners to keep rooms **smelling** pleasant," suggests Jones. "But don‚Äôt spray the dog!" - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Okay, so we‚Äôve established your **house** smells a bit like the local kennel. Does it matter to you? Maybe not, but it matters to your guests. If you‚Äôre looking for a quick cover-up that lasts a couple of hours, any store-bought deodorizer will do the trick in a pinch, but do they actually eliminate smells in the long term? Nope. You'll just be temporarily masking odors, leaving your home **smelling** like a floral-scented doggy funk cloud. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   When you open up your front door, you want to be greeted by your lovable pooch - not his smell! Our canine companions bring warmth to the home, but they are definitely still animals. They drool, shed, and secrete oils (and worse) all over your furniture and floors. But mostly, many mutts themselves just kind of stink. Without intervention, your abode can start to smell more like a barn than a **house**. So, how do you get rid of that funky scent without banishing your fur-baby? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should be washing your linens regularly, especially any that your pets use often (for instance, if you let them get on the bed or the couch). Vacuum up what hair you can and then toss the linens in the washer and run a cycle according to the tags. Clean your bed linens, pillowcases, couch cushion covers, blankets, curtains‚Äîeverything that can go into the washing machine. You should also regularly wash your clothes to keep them **smelling** fresh and to cut down on dandruff and hair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ilsa and Stella tolerate this Waterless Pet Wash from Spruce (neither one are into taking baths, getting wet, or anything that involves them getting clean). You can imagine how much easier this is than fighting to give them a bath and they smell clean and just-bathed. Doesn‚Äôt Stella look so happy to be **smelling** fresh and clean? This is the soft, clean cloth I use to wipe clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Past smoking can potentially expose you to the effects of thirdhand smoke long after the last owners have left the **house**. According to the Cleveland Clinic, ‚ÄúWhen you smoke in a room or car, toxic chemicals like nicotine cling to walls, clothing, upholstery and other surfaces... Results of a study published in 2010 found that when this nicotine reacts with nitrous acid in the air, it forms carcinogens.‚Äù This can be especially concerning when you have children, due to the impact secondhand smoke can have on child development. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Accidents happen‚Äîit‚Äôs natural. Practice patience and use positive reinforcement with puppies and dogs that are being **house**trained. If your dog is already potty trained but has started to have accidents, take them to the vet to see if there is a medical cause. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
