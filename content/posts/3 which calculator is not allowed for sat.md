## 3 Tips to Which Calculator Is Not Allowed For Sat | Ti Calculator
-   If you don’t know your multiplication tables, you have to spend time entering even silly data into a **calculator**. Not only does this kill time, but it creates an opportunity for **calculator** error. How many times have you said, “Oh, I put that into my **calculator** wrong?” If you don’t need to use your **calculator**, you eliminate that risk. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can’t bring a laptop. You can’t use your flip phone or smartphone **calculator**, an iPad, or other stylus-based tablets. You can’t use your Apple Watch. Use your common sense: no Bluetooth, nothing that records video, nothing that has a QWERTY keyboard. These are **calculator**s that are allowed on the SAT, not machines more advanced than you’d need to operate a data-gathering **sat**ellite in space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Students often overlook the way numbers relate to each other when they are **calculator**-reliant. Some questions on the SAT are designed to have elusive answers if you use your **calculator**. For example, the fraction 4/16 might clearly illuminate the answer to a question about a portion of sixteen people, but ¼ or .25–which you’d get on a **calculator**–distracts from it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
