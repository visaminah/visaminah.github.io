## 75 Tips to Best Mouse For Macbook Pro Reddit | Magic Mouse
-   Having stressed how good ergonomics should be for photo and video editing **mouse**, here's an exception to the rule: Apple's Magic Mouse 2. Its sleek shape makes zero attempt to be comfortable in the hand, but on the plus side, it will slide into a laptop bag much more easily than a chunkier alternative, and it's suitable for right or left-handed users. What's more, most travel-friendly laptop mice are usually so small that they're far from comfortable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you **mouse** with your left hand or prefer something smaller, get the Microsoft Bluetooth Mobile Mouse 3600. The symmetrical shape works for lefties and righties, and our panel testers liked its grip, shape, button selection, and scroll wheel. But it’s smaller than our other picks, it has fewer buttons, it can connect to only one device at a time via Bluetooth, and it’s compatible with fewer operating systems than our top picks are. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Logitech Ergo M575 Mouse is the hero your strained wrists have been waiting for. With it, you won’t need to move them at all. Just lay your hand on your **mouse** once, and you’re all set for eight hours straight without needing to move it again (aside from getting up to go to the bathroom). Of course, your thumb will be getting a workout the whole time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That’s because this **mouse** uses a trackball to move the cursor. It’s not a new approach, but at $50 and with 2.4GHz and Bluetooth support, the Ergo M575 is more advanced than what you would have gotten in the ‘90s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Internally, **mouse** performance all comes down to its optical sensor, which tracks your **mouse**’s movement relative to the surface below it. (For a deeper discussion of **mouse** resolution, see our buying guide to the best overall mice.) The thing is, nowadays, excellent-performing **mouse** sensors are very common. It’s pretty rare that you’ll find one that isn’t precise enough for most work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first word in any conversation about mice for Macs has to be “Magic.” Apple’s Magic Mouse 2 and Magic Trackpad 2 have been around for many years now and serve as the de facto standard for Mac users looking for a **mouse**. The Magic devices have a key feature that only a few other mice even try to replicate: gesture controls. You can swipe in different directions along the top of the Magic Mouse, as you would with a laptop touch pad, to trigger shortcuts and hotkeys. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What even is a “best **mouse**,” anyway? Don’t you just need a way to point your cursor without too much delay and without hurting your hands? If this sounds like you, the Logitech M510 will be your new best friend. Its no frills design makes it one of the most inexpensive mice on this list at $20, while its 2.4 GHz connectivity keeps it lagless. Meanwhile, its comfy, ambidextrous body should fit nicely into most hands and its two side buttons are accessible across palm, claw and fingertip grip styles. Its software, Logitech Options, is also robust enough that you can easily get more advanced with it later on, once you’ve started to see the light of fancy mice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the gaming-**mouse** world, some advanced specs come into play, such as how quickly you can move the **mouse** before it stops working correctly, but these matter only to really competitive players. Gamers care more about **mouse** weight. A lighter **mouse** can take microseconds off a reaction and be easily pushed with the fingertips. Check out our guide to picking the best esports mice for a more thorough explanation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Logitech Ergo M575 Best Thumb-Style Trackball for Mac 4.0 Excellent Bottom Line: The Logitech Ergo M575 is a well-built, more ergonomic alternative to a traditional **mouse** that's held back only by a design that won't quite fit everyone's hands or workflows. PROS Ergonomic design - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Knowing the lay of the land is just the first step. Now it’s time for the fun part: picking out the right **mouse** for you! Here’s a list of our favorite Mac-friendly mice right now, from the classic Magic Mouse 2 to all kinds of specialty mice that may catch your eye. If you’re also looking for a keyboard to go with your new **mouse**, check out our list of the best keyboards for Macs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Few people realize that resting your hand palm-down on a conventional **mouse** isn't all that ergonomic. It's actually preferable to have you hand rotated round to a handshake position, as it would be if you let it rest by your side. It's exactly this position that the strange looking Anker AK-UBA Vertical Ergonomic Optical Mouse encourages. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cannot use the **mouse** while it is charging. Shallow design doesn't fill the curve of your hand. Sold By List Price Price Amazon $99.99 $99.99 Check Stock (Opens in a new window) Read Our Apple Magic Mouse 2 Review - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Microsoft Ergonomic Mouse The best wired **mouse** for photo and video editing Specifications Buttons: 5 Sensor precision: 1000dpi Connection: Wired, USB 2.0 Type-A Ergonomic: Right-handed Features: Ergonomic shape, metal scroll wheel Reasons to buy + Ergonomic shape + Reasonably priced Reasons to avoid - Not wireless - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like the Logitech M510, the M575 is compatible with the Logitech Options software, which lets you remap its three extra buttons, check battery level, swap the left/right click and adjust DPI. The customization on offer here is fairly robust, and allows you to set a button to open programs, control media, enter certain key combinations and the like. Plus, you can set the **mouse** to use different settings depending on which program you have open. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the Triathlon is unavailable, we recommend the Logitech M585 Multi-Device or the quieter—but otherwise identical—Logitech M590 Multi-Device Silent. The M585 and M590 are a little smaller than the Triathlon and have one fewer button, but most of our testers still found both mice comfortable. Like the Triathlon, the M585 and M590 connect via USB dongle or Bluetooth, but each Multi-Device **mouse** can pair with only up to two devices rather than the Triathlon’s three. Logitech claims two years of battery life for both models, and you can customize any of the five buttons through the Options software. Like the Triathlon, these mice are also designed for right-handed use and don’t track on glass or mirrors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main feature with this **mouse** is its silent scroll wheel, or rather, the fact that it's silent while still maintaining a click feel to its motion. Useful if you want to maintain a low profile on public transport. Maintaining the silent theme are special pads on the underside of the **mouse** for quieter **mouse** movement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you can’t stand having cords connected to your computer, you may want to consider a wireless, Bluetooth **mouse**. However, there are also few things more annoying than a **mouse** that won’t connect, so you need to choose something that has a strong signal and minimal connectivity issues. Long battery life is also essential. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With just a left button, a right button and a scroll wheel that can’t tilt to the side, this **mouse** isn’t meant for more than basic work. The scroll wheel’s push-in button can be remapped to input a key combination, open the screen snipping tool or even input a macro, but that’s the most advanced usability you’ll get out of this **mouse**. Otherwise, all its software will let you do is swap the left and right click, change how fast the wheel scrolls (and in which direction) and adjust your DPI. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   9. Logitech M330 Silent Plus The best **mouse** for photo and video editing on the go Specifications Buttons: 3 Sensor precision: 1000dpi Connection: Wireless (2.4GHz) Ergonomic: Right-handed Features: Silent scroll wheel, quiet feet, 2-year battery life Today's Best Deals View at Walmart (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Dell (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Silent click-feel scroll wheel + Compact + Wireless with long battery life Reasons to avoid - Not particularly ergonomic - Only 3 buttons - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Other considerations come down to price and whether you want a wired or wireless **mouse**. These days even entry-level mice are often wireless and offer very reliable pointer tracking. You also needn't worry about replacing batteries every five minutes, as most wireless mice can last many months and even years on one or two AA batteries. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many elite productivity mice allow you to connect wirelessly to multiple computers and quickly switch between or among them. Also, in the gaming world, customization is very important, and it can be helpful to have extra buttons for hotkeys or custom commands. And if long-term computer use has taken its toll and you feel pain when holding a **mouse**, a vertical **mouse** or a wrist-stilling trackball can help reduce strain on your hand and wrist. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hi, I have a Mx Master 3 with Logi Options+ and if buttons work fine, the scroll wheel is a pain. The **mouse** is not faulty since a Mx Master of a friend has the same behaviour, it skips lines or doesn't get the scroll, no app can fix this. Is there any good alternative? I was looking at Logitech G502 Lightspeed and G903 Lightspeed, are these **mouse**s fine for M1? Any experience? I need a wireless **mouse** for web browsing, light gaming and photo/video editing, with buttons and a battery which lasts at least a week. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   6. Logitech M185 Wireless Mouse The best cheap **mouse** for photo and video editing. Specifications Buttons: 3 Sensor precision: 1000dpi Connection: Wireless (2.4GHz) Ergonomic: Neutral Features: Compact, ambidextrous design Today's Best Deals View at Walmart (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Dell (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Affordable + Good choice for left-handed people + Long battery life Reasons to avoid - Only 3 buttons - Not particularly ergonomic - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But, that’s not all. It also features Microsoft’s BlueTrack technology so you can skip those pesky **mouse** pads, as well as Bluetooth connectivity with up to 33 feet in range. Although we haven't fully tested this **mouse**, verified users have praised it for boasting effortless glide as well as an accurate, responsive performance. It has nice, clicky buttons that might be a little too loud for some, but those buttons are also extremely satisfying to press. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your **mouse** should function as an extension of your hand and arm, not a separate entity. You’ll want a **mouse** that can move and click as fast as you, without any lag time or lack of response. If you spend a lot of time at your computer, you might want to get an ergonomically designed **mouse** to alleviate and prevent pain in your hand, wrist, or shoulder. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **mouse** can tilt sideways between 35 and 70 degrees to pivot your wrist for optimal comfort, and then there's ATS: articulating thumb support. This enables the thumb rest to be tilted up, down, forwards, backwards, and even in and out relative to the rest of the **mouse** body. The idea is to minimise the amount of effort required to grip the **mouse**, and thereby reduce possible muscle strain. 6 programmable buttons ensure a decent level of settings control. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another must-have is good ergonomics: the **mouse** must fit well in the hand and promote good wrist and arm posture. In fact, buying the best **mouse** could well make the difference between years of comfortable editing versus the onset of aches and pains... so why wouldn't you? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Created by Apple, the Magic Mouse incorporates gestures into its top surface to adapt the same fluidity of a trackpad. The seamless design is made of anodized aluminum and one single piece of glass. This brings the same renowned Apple build quality to a **mouse**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This certainly isn't the case with Contour Design's Uni**mouse**. While it's available in regular right-handed form, the Uni**mouse** is also offered in a proper left-handed guise, retaining all the same ergonomic features as the right-hander, just mirrored. And this really is one seriously ergonomic offering. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At first glance, the Logitech Triathlon M720 **mouse** doesn’t appear to offer much for its $40 price that the more basic, $20 Logitech M510 **mouse** doesn’t already have. It’s got one extra button hidden away in its left thumb rest, which itself is more prominent than the thumb rest on the M510, plus a switch hidden under the scroll wheel that swaps it between ratcheted and smooth scrolling. But it’s also got one other additional, non-remappable button on its side with a “123” printed next to it. This button is where you’ll find the Triathlon’s unique use case, which is its ability to pair with up to 3 computers at once and swap between them on the fly either with that button or through Logitech Flow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   5. Anker AK-UBA 2.4G Wireless Vertical Ergonomic Optical Mouse The best vertical **mouse** for photo and video editing Specifications Buttons: 5 Sensor precision: 1600dpi Connection: Wireless (2.4GHz) Ergonomic: Right-handed Features: Vertical design Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at anker (opens in new tab) View at Newegg (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Good for long sessions + Affordable + Wireless Reasons to avoid - Vertical mice take time to get used to - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mice are designed for different uses, so finding the best computer **mouse** to suit your needs can be a challenge without some guidance. If you're looking for a gaming **mouse**, you'll need an option with low click latency and great sensor performance so that it feels responsive and accurate. If you're looking for an office **mouse**, ergonomics will likely be more important since you're going to use it for hours each day. You may also prefer something wireless to get rid of cable clutter. Not all mice are made with the same use or user in mind, so it's important to know what you're looking for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Corsair Dark Core RGB Pro SE Best Wireless Gaming Mouse With Wireless Charging 4.0 Excellent Bottom Line: With an upgraded sensor and remodeled side buttons, Corsair's Dark Core RGB Pro SE updates a great **mouse** to keep it in the front rank. PROS Remodeled side macro buttons - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take a look at our picks of the best mice for different users with different needs and budget. Some of them are incredibly affordable while others are a little more on the pricey end. Luckily, early Black Friday deals are live now, and a lot of these are already getting discounts so you can save money. For your convenience, we're keeping track of those deals and making them available here. All you need to do is choose the right **mouse** for you, select the best price available, and hit buy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Originally I was thinking regular **mouse** but saw the Logitech MX Ergo and was intrigued. I've never used a trackball **mouse** before but it actually might be a good idea for a cramped space/tiny desk (hospital bed table lol). I'd lose significant percentage of desk space with a **mouse** pad, plus a track ball I could probably lean back in my chair and use on the arm rest or a clip board. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Maybe the most unfortunate change here is to the side button placement. Rather than being in the divot where your thumb rests, like on the MX vertical, the side buttons here instead rest on the **mouse**’s top edge. You’ll have to strain your thumb to reach them, which hurts this device’s otherwise strong ergonomics. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Microsoft Modern Mobile Mouse is a thin little credit card of a pointer that presumes that the most comfortable form factor for a **mouse** is to have as little **mouse** in your hand as possible. This makes it great for travel and style, especially with its 8 available colors and Bluetooth connectivity. At 78 grams with batteries installed, it’s easy to carry around with you and push around a table. At the same time, its sleek rectangular exterior makes it difficult for certain grip types to handle it, and it doesn’t come with extra buttons or too much configurability. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   8. Logitech MX Ergo The best trackball **mouse** for photo editing Specifications Buttons: 8 Sensor precision: 2048dpi Connection: Wireless (Bluetooth & 2.4GHz) Ergonomic: Right-handed Features: Adjustable **mouse** angle, easy switch to connect to different devices Reasons to buy + Trackball design + Adjustable tilt angle + Rechargeable battery Reasons to avoid - Right-handers only - Less advanced than MX Master 3 - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We've tested a lot of mice, putting them through their paces so we can make the right recommendations, whether it's the best gaming **mouse** you need or one for productivity. It isn't the cushiest part of the job, as some mice are unbalanced or heavy or do not glide effortlessly, even when paired with the best **mouse** pads. But, we suffer through the annoying arm and shoulder pain to ensure that you don't. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I checked yesterday some mice and read, that Logitech doesn’t support M1. Was thinking to get a Bluetooth one but with the connectivity problems I don’t know. Was also considering to get a Logitech g502 because let’s be honest this is the best **mouse**. Actually I’m clueless rn and wanted to know which mice you can recommend and which you are using. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The wheel's milled steel construction and silent operation further enhance this **mouse**'s premium feel. It's so quiet, you might be tempted to do a little bit of productive work when you're on a phone or Zoom call. Preset shortcuts for the supplementary **mouse** buttons are available for Photoshop, Premiere, and other popular programs, plus there's even gesture control. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   HyperX Pulsefire Haste Gaming Mouse Best Budget Gaming Mouse for Mac 4.5 Outstanding Bottom Line: Lightweight, comfortable, and reasonably priced, the HyperX Pulsefire Haste is the best esports **mouse** to come along in some time. PROS Extremely light - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, it's designed especially for macOS, as Apple built both this **mouse** and operating system. Native support for smooth inertial scrolling and gestures are guaranteed. Swiping between pages in Safari, Smart Zoom, Mission Control, and switching between full screen apps all have their own unique gestures, saving the user time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These include the natural, 57-degree "handshake position" angle and the many programmable buttons. There’s one fewer button here than on the MX Vertical, making for a total of 6, but the DPI is much more customizable than on Logitech’s **mouse**. Here, you get to set 3 specific numbers from 800 to 2400, and you can still swap between them on the fly with a single button press. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Trackball mice aren't for everyone, but they offer a level of pointer precision that some find unbeatable. Add the reduced muscular strain from not needing to move your wrist and lower arm, and trackballs can also be a blessing if you suffer from conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome. In fact, Logitech claims the MX Ergo can reduce muscle strain by as much as 20% when compared to using a regular **mouse**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wireless mice are convenient—they don’t clutter up desk space with wires, and they can make for faster and easier navigation than a trackpad. They’re also inexpensive and reliable enough to make more sense than a cheap wired **mouse** for most people. We’ve researched and tested mice for years with several different panels of testers, and we’ve found that the Logitech M720 Triathlon is more comfortable for a variety of hand sizes and grip styles than nearly every other wireless **mouse** we’ve considered. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Lift has a vertical design, which puts your hand at an “optimal” 57-degree angle — also known as the “handshake angle.” This angle is more natural than the typical horizontal angle mice normally have, but this design does lift your hand away from your desk. If you’re used to a regular **mouse**, it may take you some time to get used to this new position (and you may never get used to it, especially if you work with very precise movements — it’s harder to be precise when your hand is further from the desk). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Enter the Razer Pro Click Mini . This **mouse** is the second productivity focused pointer from Razer, and features quieter switches and a smaller footprint than the first. But unlike other productivity focused mice, it’s also got a high max DPI (12,000), a 1,000 Hz polling rate, 7 programmable buttons, and 2.4GHz wireless connectivity. Plus, it’s got 5 onboard memory profiles and you can remap buttons, including the 4-way tilt wheel with both infinite and ratcheted scrolling, in Razer Synapse. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Everybody needs a **mouse**. Even the simplest computing—web browsing, word processing, dragging files—is made better with a precise, comfortable way to control your cursor. On a Mac, you have a couple of very special options in Apple’s Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad, but there’s also a wider world of Mac-compatible mice that offer features and benefits you won't find on Apple’s peripherals. Whether you’re looking for a little bit of that classic Apple “magic” or something new, here’s what you need to know about picking a **mouse** for your Mac. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Still, this is a good **mouse** for Bluetooth devices, casual use, travel and those who prefer lightweight and small accessories that stay out of the way. It also looks good. But its functions are limited, and it’s not the most comfortable for all types of users. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ergonomic mice don’t have to come with a higher price tag. The Microsoft Bluetooth Ergonomic Mouse is proof of this. It’s also a terrific value, offering more than just a comfortable grip, natural hand position, and light weight that this Bluetooth **mouse** offers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Magic Trackpad, being the touch pad it is, takes things a step further, allowing you to fully replicate the laptop touch-pad experience in a desktop setup. Both devices fit in quite nicely with most of Apple’s computers, completing that sleek silver-and-white signature Apple look. If you think of a MacBook laptop of some kind as your “default” computer setup, the Magic Mouse is a best-of-both-worlds scenario. You get the more accurate, comfortable scrolling that comes with using a **mouse**, while also having access to those familiar swipes and taps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Then we test its performance, including speed, accuracy, and reliability, by using it in our day to day workloads and in gaming, especially if it’s a gaming **mouse** . We also check its buttons and scroll wheels to see how easy and comfortable they are to use. If you’ve been using a cheap **mouse** your whole life, you’ll certainly notice the difference between that and a great **mouse**. And, that’s what we look for here, regardless of whether it’s a productivity **mouse** or a gaming one, a wired **mouse** or a wireless one. If it’s wireless, however, we also test its connectivity, range and battery life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're only going to use your **mouse** with one PC, consider one that connects through a USB receiver — especially if you're going to game with it on the side. Generally, you can get a reliable, lag-free connection this way. Bonus points if there's dongle storage inside the **mouse**, so you don't lose it when it's not plugged in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Beyond two clickers and a scroll wheel, the best **mouse** might have additional buttons that you can program to suit your computer needs. If you’re left-handed, you’ll want to invest in a **mouse** that’s ambidextrous or specifically designed with ergonomics for the left hand. If you’re a laptop user who travels frequently, you’ll want a **mouse** that is lightweight and travels easily. Above all, you’ll want to pick a **mouse** that fits in your price range and gets the job done without being overly expensive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I'd be using it with my MacBook pro at a small desk at home, for work. Just doing sales presentations on zoom, showing slide shows and navigating/demo-ing a website. I do use the track pad swipe things constantly (sliding between "desktops" on the MacBook, and 3 fingers up for mission control, 3 fingers down for desk top. I'd really prefer a **mouse** that has some type of ability to do those things on a MacBook. But worst case scenario I can flick my hand over to the track pad real quick and then back to **mouse**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the other hand, an excellent **mouse** is designed with accuracy, speed, and your comfort in mind, making sure that it does more than the bare minimum in terms of performance and preventing long-term pain and injury during long sessions of PC use. So, whether you’re a creative professional, gamer, business owner, student, office worker, or even a casual PC user, you absolutely need to invest in the best **mouse** for you. If you've already invested in the best keyboard and the best laptop, you will want to get the best **mouse** as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Instead of a scroll wheel, the **mouse** wants you to flick your finger to scroll. This results in stilted scrolling that requires a lot of extraneous flicks, even on the highest sensitivity setting. Not only do you lose precision with this, but you also lose comfort, which goes against the point of the **mouse**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Apart from this ultra-ergonomic stance, the **mouse** is pretty straight-forward, with a typical complement of thumb-operated shortcut buttons and a decent (though not spectacular) 1600dpi max tracking resolution. A 2.4GHz wireless link keeps things cable-free, and the **mouse** is powered by two AAA batteries. But best of all, you can have all this for a fraction of the cost of what a similar vertical **mouse** like Logitech's MX Vertical would set you back. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   7. Contour Uni**mouse** Left Hand Wireless The best left-handed **mouse** for photo and video editing Specifications Buttons: 7 Sensor precision: 2400dpi Connection: Wireless (2.4GHz) Ergonomic: Right or left-handed Features: Ergonomic left-handed shape, highly adjustable Reasons to buy + Ergonomic left-handed design + Wireless + Highly adjustable Reasons to avoid - Vertical orientation not for everyone - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Roccat Kone XP beats a lot of wired gaming **mouse** in terms of performance and versatility. Thanks to its heat-treated pure PTFE feet, 19K DPI optical sensor, and Titan optical switches, it can keep up with the fastest and most action packed games. Not only is it super fast and responsive, but we also found that it feels more lightweight than it is, thanks to those feet, as well as comfortable to button-mash with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So last time I've tried a wireless **mouse** on an M1 MacBook Air, It was really jittery and laggy, so I'm using a wired one at the moment, which has been very inconvenient. I'm looking for **mouse**s that don't have the same problem, any help would be appreciated. TIA - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best **mouse** for photo and video editing needs to promise two main things. One is a precise level of control, so you can make fine edits to your images and footage, quickly and easily. And in that regard, the more buttons there are, the better. This allows you to assign frequently used commands and shortcuts to each button, saving you lots of time navigating through menus or executing keyboard shortcuts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Logitech M720 Triathlon can pair with, and quickly switch between, three devices via Bluetooth, or you can connect it via the included USB dongle. It also has six buttons that you can customize using Logitech’s Options software and a scroll wheel that toggles between ratcheted and smooth scrolling. And its single AA battery should last for two years, according to Logitech. But the Triathlon is contoured for right-handed **mouse** users—so it’s not ideal for lefties—and it doesn’t work on glass or mirrored surfaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The M185 uses a 2.4GHz wireless link with a 10m range. The system is so power-efficient that a single AA battery is enough to run the **mouse** for around 12 months, and the USB wireless receiver is so small you barely notice it. The main downside to this **mouse** is its lack of thumb-operated buttons, limiting your options for defining custom **mouse** shortcuts in photo editing software. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Logitech Lift Best Vertical Ergonomic Mouse for Mac 3.5 Good Bottom Line: The design-forward Logitech Lift is an affordable, versatile vertical **mouse** with an ergonomic bent, but its compact size won't please users with larger hands. PROS Handsome, compact vertical design - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1. Logitech MX Master 3S The best **mouse** for photo and video editing overall Specifications Buttons: 7 Sensor precision: 8000dpi Connection: Wireless (Bluetooth & 2.4GHz) Ergonomic: Right-handed Features: Easy switch to connect to different devices, USB-C quick charging, gesture button Today's Best Deals View at Dell (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Walmart (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + High precision + Quiet operation + Very ergonomic Reasons to avoid - Right-handed use only - Pricey - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These Logitech Options features aren’t unique to the 510, but it’s good to know that you can still access them even if you go for the most basic of Logitech’s mice. Speaking of basic, this **mouse** glides well with its 4 rubber feet and boasts a 24 month battery off its two AAs. At 0.28 pounds, it’s also easy to lift and travel with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take the Ergo M575, which has both 2.4 GHz and Bluetooth compatibility. I easily connected the M575 to one device via 2.4 GHz and one device via Bluetooth, then swapped between them on the fly via the button on the bottom of the **mouse** that changes the M575’s connectivity standard. It’s a more hack-y solution, and requires you to turn the **mouse** over every time you want to swap devices rather than using an easy side button, but it does take away one of the Triathlon’s unique strengths. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although we haven't finished our review of the Magic Mouse – long overdue, we know – we've been using ours for months now, and it's still the best **mouse** for productivity and creative workloads we've ever used. If you find yourself doing a double take when looking at the specs, as there are no buttons on the Magic Mouse. This **mouse** is completely controlled by gestures, giving it all the benefits of a trackpad, as well as a **mouse**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can set the DPI up to 1000 with Logitech options, for instance, although it’s somewhat obliquely presented as a “pointer speed” slider that refuses to give actual numbers. You can also swap the left and right **mouse** button functions, easily view battery life and map any number of functions to 5 of the **mouse**’s buttons. These include keystroke assignments, common functions like copy or paste and even a “gesture” toggle that works with **mouse** movement to open up even more mappable actions. What’s even better is that you can set the **mouse** to have different profiles per application. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1. Logitech MX Master 3S The best **mouse** overall Specifications DPI: 8,000 Interface: Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless Buttons: 7 Ergonomic: Right-handed Features: up to 70 days battery life, USB-C charging, Logitech Flow-enabled, app-specific customizations specifications Colour Black, Grey, White Condition New Today's Best Deals View at Dell (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Walmart (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Quiet tactile clicking + Long-lasting battery life + Customizable seven-button inputs Reasons to avoid - May be uncomfortable for smaller hand - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of these issues, aside from the **mouse** not being well-suited to games, are easy enough to fix with practice. And once you do, your wrists will thank you. Your desk might thank you too. While the M575 is a bulky **mouse**, it also paradoxically has a small footprint because you don’t need to move it when using it. It doesn’t even need a **mouse**pad, making it great for people with small desks or keyboard trays. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The advantage with picking a gaming **mouse** over a traditional conventional is they're built to withstand serious abuse. Plus, in the case of the G604, you get more buttons than on a 1980s Hi-fi. There are 15 in total, with six operated by the thumb alone. That gives you scope to assign loads of Photoshop or Final Cut shortcuts to each button, so assuming you can then remember which does what, you can seriously speed up your workflow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Logitech MX Master 3S isn’t the cheapest **mouse** on this list, but it’s worth every penny because it will make you more productive if you make use of all its features. The 3S combines a comfortable, sculpted design with helpful features such as an electromagnetic scroll wheel, a separate thumb wheel, and a ton of customization options. It can also use the Logi Flow software to switch its connection seamlessly between three different devices — even carrying clipboard contents with it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
