-   While floors come in many different materials, Miller said that mop heads made out of microfiber are a good choice for a versa**tile** and effective mop, especially for dry and wet mopping. "A good microfiber mop actually has a natural static charge to it," he said. "So when you're cleaning a floor, that static charge attracts dirt and debris and hair and lint and all that stuff." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drips, drops, and spills are bound to happen in your home, but if you are diligent, you can stay on top of cleaning your ceramic **tile** floors. For those stains that have set in, consider using a mild detergent to lift the oil and grease, and for tougher jobs, a borax and water solution may be just what you need. Ultimately, regular cleaning can help you to reduce your cleaning later on down the road. A Narwal T10 robotic vacuum and mop combo can help make your life easier and can help you avoid deep stains on your ceramic **tile** floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Steam mops can get up to boiling temperatures and are ideal for sanitizing floors or cleaning **tile** or sealed laminate. However, Miller warns that steam mops can be damaging to certain floors. "We never suggest using steam on a wood floor; the steam mops are vapor water and that vapor water is forced into the wood, the open wood cells, and cavities and will damage wood and also damage finishes," he said. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First things first, you need to make sure that your ceramic floors are free from any debris and dirt. Keep in mind that dirt and dust bunnies love to hide in crevices like grout. In fact, grout is a porous substance that absorbs grime and dirt. It's important to be thorough when cleaning dirt from your floors because when you actually start cleaning and wiping the **tile** floors, little pieces of dirt or stone can cause scratches on the **tile** floor. As you begin to scrub away, you may actually cause scratches on your floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ceramic **tile** floors add a level of beauty and sophistication to any room they are in. They are also incredibly durable, and able to take lots of wear and tear. Ceramic **tile**s are perfect for kitchens, walkways, and bathrooms, making them one of the most widely used flooring materials on the market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ceramic floors, however, require a bit of cleaning, especially because dirt and grime can get hidden inside the grout.

In this article, we'll look at the best cleaning tips for keeping your ceramic floor in pristine condition. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, itâ€™s important to sweep your ceramic floors at least once a week to reduce the amount of sand and dirt on the floors, which can dull them and cause scratches. A good **broom** works really well to get into the hard-to-reach spots, like underneath cabinets or around appliances. If you own a vacuum that is great at cleaning hardwood and ceramic floors, you can use that to clean up all the dirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For that stubborn stain that you can't seem to get rid of no matter how much you scrub, it may be a good idea to rent a commercial steam cleaner. Steam cleaners can be one of the best machines to clean **tile** floors because steam can lift dirt out of grout. One thing to keep in mind when using a steam cleaner is to make sure not to fill the steam cleaner with any harsh chemicals which can have a harmful effect on the **tile** and grout. As well, most steam mops have rotating bristles which can get down into grout. Also, for regular cleaning of the grout, invest in Narwal T10, which features deep bristles to wipe the dirt out of the deepest crannies and add the luster and shine back to your **tile**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most ceramic **tile**s are nonporous, meaning that they don't absorb dirt and grime, however, grout is a porous substance, similar to mortar or concrete. Therefore, you need to watch the cleaners that you use on them because some cleaners can actually do damage to the grout on your floors. Even something as simple as vinegar may cause harm to your grout because it can penetrate its crannies and cause it to deteriorate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grout keeps water out and holds together ceramic **tile** floors, but, as mentioned above, grout is a porous material that can easily absorb oil and dirt, causing it to become discolored. There's nothing worse than stained grout. One splendid solution is to seal all grout on your ceramic floor. There are several effective grout sealers on the market. Even after you seal your grout, you may need to reseal them once or twice a year. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just like any chore around your home, it'll take a little elbow grease and determination to rid yourself of any deep-set grime in the grout of your **tile** floors. Mix borax, a white powdery household cleaner, and laundry detergent booster, in water, to make a safe cleaning solution for your grout. After mixing the borax in water, it will become a thin paste, which you can leave on the grout for 10 minutes and then scrub using a brush. It may take you a couple of tries, but as you continue to work away, you should be able to lift the dirt out of the grout. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
