White is an exceptional choice if there is a loud color scheme in the room or you have a couch in a dark color.

-   Everything that sparkles deserves to be in any room and as we know, a metallic finish is a decorative element that adds detailing, the glue that brings the different elements together. The rustic style may be exactly that – slightly unrefined in its finish – but that doesn’t mean an injection of glamour alongside rustic **furniture** and **brown** leather sofa can’t be used. Gold coloured accessories are ideal with its yellowy glow that is so very attractive. As well as gold coloured bases to lamps and frames, using refined gold coloured accessories such as a gold rug and scattered cushions are also a great way of bringing out **brown** leather **furniture** in all its glory. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown **furniture** is available in a wide range. Furniture in your kitchen, dining room, living room, or bedroom could be in various hues of **brown**.

-   You’ve heard before that white goes with just about every color, and **brown** is no exception to that rule. Pairing any shade of **brown** with a crisp white will give you a clean contrast that works well in a room like a formal dining room or living room. If white and **brown** are your two main colors in any room, make sure you vary the shades to keep it interesting. Shades of dark **brown** or woods such as teak pop well against white too. For this living room they chose to use white as the main color, with **brown** **furniture** and wood accents providing the contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another way to subtly introduce black into your **brown** interior is through fittings such as door handles, plumbing fixtures, and small **furniture** items like dining chairs. If the desired mood of the interior is of an industrial or more masculine manner, this color scheme is the way to go. If masculinity is not entirely what you are after, incorporating white **furniture** pieces or using white as the backdrop of the space will in turn soften everything and create balance in the space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since **brown** and orange are such similar colors you might shy away from pairing them together, but we’re here to save you from that mistake. When placed in a primarily **brown** space, orange accents will serve as the perfect energizer for the room. A pop of orange in a **brown** room comes across as trendy or artsy, especially against darker woods. For a more warm, sophisticated color scheme, you can try pairing a dark chocolate background with orange and cream accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a leather **brown** sofa, you can create a rich and luxurious look by pairing it with deep jewel-toned walls such as burgundy or emerald green. You can also use accessories to add color and interest to a room with dark **brown** **furniture**. Consider using throw pillows, area rugs, or window treatments in brighter colors or patterns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown includes a wide range of hues, including tans, beiges, and taupes. Plus, you have darker tones like camel and chocolate, but these are only the tip of the **brown** color iceberg. There are so many shades of **brown** to choose from, so there is one that will coordinate with your **brown** **furniture**, no matter what kind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   13. Emerald and Teal. Brown **furniture** and jewel paint colors like teal and emerald green make statement color combinations. The depth and richness of these colors adds personality to any room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many people think of dark, heavy wood pieces that can overwhelm a room when you mention **brown** **furniture**. So in recent times, the trend has been more toward light-colored **furniture** like grays and white or natural wood. However, designers are incorporating **brown** back into interior design models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   8. Yellow Walls. The pop of yellow adds energy to the space while the deep wood **furniture** tones add a sense of sophistication. Overall, the combination of these two bold hues creates a beautifully balanced and warm living room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you enjoy warm nights in front of the fire and would rather stay in and watch a movie than go out on the town, this soothing vibe is for you. If you have dark **brown** **furniture** and want the room to be your sanctuary, mid-tone walls are the way to go. Think about incorporating golden yellow, soft blues, grayish-greens, soothing greys, and creamy beiges. With these tones, the walls seem to welcome you in rather than pop for attention. If your sofa is a lighter **brown**, use deeper shades for the walls like navy blue or slate grey. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A rug has the power to bring a room together. It can create an atmosphere that you want to relax in. The perfect rug will make guests feel warm and welcome. Likewise, accidentally putting a rug that doesn’t go well with **brown** in front of a **brown** sofa can make the room feel chaotic and uninviting. If you are wondering what color rug goes with a **brown** couch, these rug ideas will help you find the perfect rug for your living space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adding a pair of yellow curtains to the room may be a fantastic way to add some brightness to the space. The yellow curtains can also help make the dark **brown** **furniture** feel softer, less intense, and looks more casual. And since yellow is quite intense, coming just as an accent can still give a lot of positive impacts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Much like a **brown** and white pairing, **brown** pairs well with black to create a classic color palette in any room. When using black as one of your main colors, you must make sure to balance it well. Lighter shades of **brown** or light woods work better so the room doesn’t appear too dark. In spaces with black **furniture**, **brown** accents can add depth and interest to the room, whereas black can create drama against **brown** **furniture**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   7. White Wall Paint. If you decorate an old house and enjoy traditional home design, it is hard to find a paint color that would complete old **furniture** better than white. We can’t help admiring the charm of the old dark **brown** **furniture** (that is, by the way, 150-year-old and passed down in the family) and how the whites make it the star of the show. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You could also use a light **brown** couch or chair. And if you want to add even more depth, you could use a dark **brown** rug. Whatever option you choose, have fun with it and experiment until you find the perfect combination! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Metals should also be considered when deciding what colors go with **brown**. People tend to struggle with pairing different metals with **brown**. The reason for this is that the tone of **brown** is not taken into consideration when choosing metal fixtures throughout. The rule of thumb is to pair warm metals like copper and bronze with warm **brown**, and cold metals like chrome should be paired with cool **brown**s. If, for example, you have wooden floors throughout your house that have a very warm, orange undertone, copper fittings, and fixtures are a great option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Orange, of course, has a tan or **brown** base, more so with the darker autumnal shades but if you feel that it is too bright and garish within your rustic styled room, why not opt for **brown**? Use a darker shade than your **brown** leather sofa or **brown** leather armchair to really bring out its natural **brown** colour and grain. There are some beautiful coffee shades of **brown**, such as deep chestnut, russet and sepia. For an orange base, mahogany or sienna shades of **brown** either. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Think about the overall style and theme of your room. Is it a traditional room or a more modern space? The style, theme and decor of your room will ultimately determine whether you go for a darker or lighter shade of **brown**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When considering the best colors to go with **brown** in your home, yellow should be at the top of your list. You could opt for a lively shade of yellow to give you a needed pop of color, or consider a rich shade of golden yellow. Pairing **brown** with yellow creates a contemporary vibe in a bedroom or sitting room. Using the 60-30-10 rule would work well when pairing yellow and **brown**. 60% of the room should be a neutral shade such as white, with 30% of the room decorated in various shades of **brown**, and the last 10% is reserved for yellow accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   15. Dark Brown Walls. If you plan to use dark **brown**s for the paint color, wood floors and **furniture** with the same undertone will mesh well. However, don’t make them central to your design. Instead, reverse engineer the recommendations above and use white, cream, red, yellow or other shades that go with **brown** to create contrast against the dark walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most colors look great with **brown**, in moderation, but always consider earthy, natural colors when making your **brown** color combination choice. Natural greens, ocean blues, and so forth.
