## 40 Facts Best Ipad Pro 12.9 3Rd Gen Case | Ipad Pro 12.9 3Rd Generation Case With Pencil Holder
-   When trying to determine which of the many options on the market will serve as the best iPad Pro **case** for your needs, you’ll want to consider whether your Apple tablet is going to be a constant road dog, something that stays at your bedside, or perhaps somewhere in between. No matter what you’re going to do with your iPad Pro, you’ll want to make sure that it’s protected from accidental drops, which are easy to make even if you’ve got a **case** on the tablet. You’ll want to consider whether you’ll need a keyboard or if you are interested in features such as in-**case** Apple Pencil charging or antibacterial protection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Apple's most impressive **case** is the $299 Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro and iPad Air. This keyboard **case** and trackpad combination transforms the iPad into a viable laptop replacement. The **case** uses a clever magnetic design to create a one-piece stand and keyboard that is both thin and highly functional. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With our Keyboard Folio **case**, we’ve hit a middle ground of value and ultra-durable build quality. A removable backlit keyboard, sturdy and enjoyable to type on, is the key feature here. A soft silicone **case**, complete with iPad-cradling microfiber interior detailing, rounds out what we think is the best value-for-money keyboard **case** out there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Twelve South StayGo Mini USB-C Hub for $60: This tiny USB-C hub might be all you need, and it's seriously compact. It's a little taller but narrower than a Zippo lighter, and you get a 4K HDMI port, a USB-A, an 85-watt USB-C port with pass-through charging, and a headphone jack. I had trouble fitting it on an iPad protected by a **case**, but Twelve South includes a female USB-C to male USB-C cable that solves this issue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unfortunately, none of Apple's own **case**s for iPads are very protective. While they usually cover the screen and the back, they often leave the iPad's edges unprotected. If you want better protection, you'll do better by looking elsewhere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What’s more, the absolutely gorgeous green marble print on this variant is a unique way to show**case** your own style. SaharaCase’s Folio Case is also available in a whole range of colors and patterns that are befitting the iPad Pro’s 12.9’s artistic chops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Magic Keyboard lacks protection on the sides of the iPad. (An iPad of ours suffered a crack in the screen when it fell inside the previous generation Magic Keyboard **case**). There are other worthy keyboard **case**s on the market that address this problem, but few are as well-made as the Magic Keyboard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you are taking notes in a virtual classroom or board room, the Logitech Slim Folio Pro stands out amongst third-party iPad Pro **case**s as a practical choice for the best iPad Pro **case** for note-taking. And if you’re looking for a **case** with a keyboard that isn’t quite as expensive as an official Apple product, this sells for less than half the price of an Apple Magic Keyboard. Logitech aims to provide a laptop-like experience with the keyboard, ergonomically speaking, so you won’t be creating knots in your fingers that shouldn’t be there when you type. It’s compatible with the Apple Pencil 2, should you prefer to take notes by actually writing them down, but doesn’t have the sturdiest stand if you want to use it for propped-up drawing. Though it requires a lithium-polymer battery, you shouldn’t have to recharge it more than once every three months if you use it for around two hours a day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When shopping for the best iPad Pro **case** to fit your lifestyle, it’s good to know that you don’t have to shell out a lot of money to get decent protection for your Apple tablet. However, if you do want some bells and whistles, like leather or a stand that actually works, there’s a wide market to serve you. After you’ve made sure to look at models that are actually protective and that have the features you want, it then comes down to your personal taste and whether you want a **case** to be an extension of your personal style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The real standout feature of the Muse, however, is the whopping 10 (yes, 10) angle options for the stand, held firmly in place by strong magnets. This just might be the artist’s definitive dream **case**. However, since none of us here at SaharaCase ever progressed past wobbly stick figures, we’ll never know for sure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When deciding which iPad Pro 12.9 **case** would best suit different users, we considered popular functions of these Apple tablets. While some people employ the iPad Pro for leisure activities such as watching a movie or playing a game, many consumers who opt for an iPad Pro use it for drawing and other artistic pursuits. In order to address these differences, our subcategories of best iPad Pro **case**s include specific recommendations for illustrators and writers and DJs, for example. Once we thought about how people use their iPad Pro, we looked at how people like their iPad Pro **case**s, combining critical and public opinion with our own staff experiences to select the top options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These sleeve **case**s are a class act guaranteed to impress the whole office. Waterfield's sleeves are made from rugged waxed leather or durable nylon and come with an attachable strap. The sleeves are easily transportable and TSA friendly, though we can't guarantee you won't be stopped with questions about where you bought your slick **case**. The interior is lined with shock-absorbent neoprene for added protection, and there's a dedicated space for Apple Pencil storage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hyper HyperDrive 6-in-1 Dongle for $100: It has a 60-watt USB-C port, USB-A, MicroSD slot, SD card slot, 3.5-mm audio, and 4K 60-Hz HDMI. You can stick it into your iPad's USB-C port and have it sit flush and firm with the edge or swap to a flappy, short cable. You need the cable if you have a **case** on your iPad, and Hyper provides the screws and screwdriver to swap the part out (it took me two minutes). Just remember to unplug it when you're not using it, as it will slowly drain your tablet's battery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We look for **case**s that, first and foremost, are ultra-durable and designed to last. A **case** that looks good and a **case** that actually absorbs impact damage are often two different things. Affordable price. If you’re plonking down the big bucks for an iPad in the Pro line, a quality **case** should certainly not be an afterthought in terms of price. That said, we think any product that advertises itself as a protective **case** should have some merit in the shock-absorbing, scratch-deflecting department. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   iPadOS has come a long way in helping you get your work done, and unless you’re looking to do intense video editing, programming, or design work, there’s a good chance you might be able to replace your laptop with an iPad. To do that, though, you’ll need a good keyboard **case** that works as well on your lap as it does on a coffee-shop table or airplane tray. Apple’s Magic Keyboard has a versatile hinge that lets you adjust the viewing angle of your iPad just like you would on a laptop, though it’s a bit more limited. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This expertly-designed, ultra-protective **case** from SaharaCase takes the cake as a top contender because of the sheer level of functionality that’s been packed into a single **case**. In addition to multi-layered protection and shock-absorbing corners, we’ve added features that anyone using the iPad Pro (especially artists) will love. That includes a multi-stage kickstand for turning your iPad into a veritable digital easel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Folio-style **case**s are a dime a dozen when it comes to iPad Pro 12.9 **case**s, but SaharaCase’s repair engineer-designed offering stands apart. Premium materials and thoughtful usability considerations, including a multi-stage stand feature, make this a functional **case** that well outpaces its price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are plenty of keyboard **case**s out there. Apple’s own offerings are undeniably well-designed and impeccably constructed, but they’re also expensive. On the other hand, you can certainly find cheaper keyboard iPad Pro 12.9 **case**s than this offering from SaharaCase, but they’re sporting hollow-feeling, cheap plastic keys and a build quality that’s left wanting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We hope this list has given you some inspiration in your own search for the best iPad Pro 12.9 **case**. When you’re ready, head on over to our website for an entire range of protective **case**s for Apple’s whole ecosystem, from iPhones, AirPods, and beyond. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Logitech’s Combo Touch can transform your iPad into a makeshift laptop thanks to its trackpad, keyboard with backlit keys, and adjustable kickstand, which Snell says makes it perfect for students. Pair it with the Apple Pencil, and you’ve got a note-taking powerhouse, he says. The **case** has four “modes” that are essentially different viewing angles — there’s one for sketching, one for typing, one for watching video, and one for reading. It’s sturdy, and there’s a convenient nook to store your Pencil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Its detachable PC shield is an optional third layer of protection that can snap over the front screen for storage or over the back to act as a kickstand. The detachable shield also has a slot to hold an Apple Pencil 2, which is nice since this **case** doesn’t provide easy access to the tablet’s Pencil charging dock. You have to open a side flap to access this, which is far clunkier than, say, opening the **case**’s rubber charge port cover. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For those that normally wouldn’t outfit their tech in a **case** at all, we like to recommend a minimal, ultra-affordable **case** as a gateway into the wide world of device protection. Plus, a piece of gear like the iPad 12.9 deserves at least some protection. Enter the ESR Rebound Soft Shell Clear Case, a basic-but-functional clear **case** that won’t cramp your iPad’s style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This well-appointed iPad Pro 12.9 **case** from ZUGU is an ideal option for an artist who uses their iPad for creation. The Muse’s dual injection PC/TPU outer shell and microfiber interior gently cradle the tablet, while an integrated Apple Pencil holder keeps that invaluable tool close at hand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spigen is one of our favorite brands if you’re looking for uncompromising protection in your iPad 12.9 **case**. This rugged-looking **case** certainly looks the part with industrial lines and a jet-black design that would look at home in a Navy SEAL’s shoulder bag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros have almost edge-to-edge screens, Face ID, and USB-C. That means there's more screen to see—and shatter. Not to worry; we found a number of **case**s that will fit the portability needs of your Pro. Plus we've included some for older iPad Pro models, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Apple products usually come at a premium, and that's no different with its iPad **case**s. Apple's **case**s are expensive, but also sleek and functional. The $49 Smart Cover is a thin piece of polyurethane that protects the device's display and connects magnetically to the iPad. It comes in a variety of colors and can be folded into different positions to create a stand for reading, viewing, and drawing. The design is simple and effective, but leaves the back and sides of the iPad unprotected. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No one reasonably expects their iPad **case** to take a hit from Thor’s hammer and have the tablet come away unscathed, but a good **case** should withstand everyday drops and scratches. If you’re the type of person who throws their keys into their bag where they might rub up against your iPad screen, anti-scratch protection will be important. Pay attention to whether the **case** covers the edges, corners, and buttons too, so they don’t get damaged if your iPad sees a lot of jostling, whether in your bag while you’re on a train or from a kid who demands to play games on it all the time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Material and protection: There are sleek leather **case**s that add low-profile durability. Soft nylon **case**s can be tough and offer some cushion, while remaining light enough to carry around. Rugged hard-shell **case**s can give your iPad a coat of armor that absorbs the impact of bumps and drops and shield it from scratches and abrasions. The material of your ideal **case** will be a matter of preference, but depending on how you use your iPad, you might want something more durable or lightweight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Excellent protective quality. We look for **case**s that, first and foremost, are ultra-durable and designed to last. A **case** that looks good and a **case** that actually absorbs impact damage are often two different things. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Nillkin Case is one of the cheapest tanks around. The heavy-duty protection includes the bumper leather **case** and a sliding camera cover. The **case** only comes in two colors, black and navy, but the minimalist design works well in many settings. After all, your on-screen art/work should be the main star of the show. There's also a built-in slot for Apple Pencil protection and a stand for easy on-the-go work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can certainly count on Spigen’s meticulous build quality with shock-absorbent layers and raised bevels that go a long way to divert shock away from the vulnerable iPad screen. A built-in kickstand is a welcome feature that goes a long way in making this one of our picks for the best iPad Pro 12.9 **case**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There can be downsides to using a **case**. If you buy an iPad Pro **case** that isn’t made well and is ill-fitting, there can be lots of crevices and gaps that can trap crumbs, dirt, and other debris in between the **case** and the tablet and damage your expensive device. Fortunately, there are many well-made **case**s on the market, and some even have antimicrobial properties. In addition, a **case** will add some weight and width (though this isn’t always a detriment). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike the Combo Touch, the Magic Keyboard has one flat base, making it easier to plop on your lap to get some work done. That, along with its excellent keyboard and trackpad, more closely replicates the look and feel of a traditional laptop than Logitech’s — or anyone else’s — offering and makes it worth the extra money for anyone who wants a more seamless work-from-anywhere experience. Apple also added an extra USB-C port to the side of the Magic Keyboard, so you can use the iPad’s port for data transfer and the **case**’s port for charging, all without needing a dongle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The OtterBox Defender Series Case might not be the most practically proportioned iPad Pro 12.9 **case** but it is certainly the most rugged. This makes it the go-to choice for protecting your tablet from everyday wear and tear. This **case** employs both an inner TPU sleeve to absorb shock from drops and an outer PC shell to absorb scratches. It is military-grade drop tested and has a built-in screen protector as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you can look past the added bulk and the high price tag of the OtterBox Defender, you will find that it is definitely one of the best protective options for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. But for now, keep in mind that OtterBox hasn’t released an official 5th gen version of this **case** yet, so you may also have to settle for an ever-so-slightly less than perfect fit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Illustrator Maggie Stephenson recommends the Targus VersaVu iPad **case** for its security and reliability. “The exterior is non-slip and has a comfortable and cool feel that you’ll appreciate if you have to hold your iPad for a long period of time,” she says. She also likes that the **case** accommodates the Apple Pencil really well, helping it to stay attached to the iPad’s magnetic smart connector. “I use my iPad every day for hours at a time and have found this **case** to be the most robust, but also the most comfortable one around,” she says. The Targus can stand up your iPad in either landscape or portrait modes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All precious jewels deserve a special **case**! add some style to your iPad with a KHOMO Dual Series **case**. We've got you covered. Custom made for: Apple iPad Pro 12.9 Inch 3rd Generation - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll absolutely want to protect that investment with a **case**. But don’t worry, we’ve done the hard work for you, spotlighting 12 options for the very best iPad Pro 12.9 **case**s out there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With essential features included like support for Apple Pencil charging and raised screen and camera bezels, this **case** punches above its price but does it all in a practically invisible style. If you’re ordering an iPad Pro 12.9, drop this in your cart too, you’ll hardly notice it’s there at all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fintie is another one of our favorite **case** makers because of their inventive spirit. Their Rotating Folio iPad Pro 12.9 **case** is no exception to that trait, sporting a unique form-factor that allows your iPad to be stood up in either orientation (portrait or landscape). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
