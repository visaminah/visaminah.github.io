## 86 Shocking Facts About Best Clear Stain For Cedar | Cedar Stain Color Chart
-   When retaining **cedar**'s aromatic qualities isn't a priority in interior woodwork, a seal coat makes the wood easier to clean. When a hard glossy surface is desired on a tabletop or window ledge, a seal coat of thinned varnish or lacquer sanding sealer makes **cedar** easier to smooth in preparation for one or two top coats of varnish or lacquer. Cedar accepts most finishes well, including penetrating oils, such as tung oil and linseed oil. Penetrating oils are especially effective for sealing the grain while leaving the wood looking raw and natural. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cabot’s **stain** is only available in five wood tones, ranging from cooler gray to warmer browns. And in particularly harsh weather, or with an especially thick coat, you’re at greater risk of suffering cracks, which can end up requiring more routine maintenance. But if you’re going to use a shade of brown and want something that will need as few regular reapplications as possible, Cabot is a great choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cedar offers a durable option for exterior and interior building projects with natural resistance to rot and decay, so a protective finish is optional. If you want to enjoy the aroma of varieties such as Western red **cedar** and incense **cedar**, leave the wood unsealed. If you're using **cedar** for an outdoor project, however, give it a light seal coat to guard against moisture and sunlight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wood **stain** is one of the best finishes for **cedar** siding due to its shiny and transparent outlook. It also serves as a protective layer on your **cedar** siding, keeping it safe and strong for a longer period. However, the issue with wood **stain** is that it attracts mold and mildew. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Stain is essentially a sealer that has a pigment added to it. The pigment provides coloration as well as adding protection against UV, which can cause fading and cracking. However, **stain**s will naturally fade over time, and most will need to be reapplied every two to five years. Generally speaking, darker colors and solid **stain**s have the most lasting power. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cedar is often used for fencing because it has natural oils that keep insects out. This type of wood is also resistant to rot. With that said, should you **stain** it, or let the natural color show? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just like exterior applications, your interior sealing projects should start with clean **cedar**. Open a window or door in the room to help ventilate the area. Brush or roll the chosen sealant onto the interior **cedar** piece. Let the coating dry completely before you apply another coat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you’re done with sanding, all that should be left is your bare **cedar** siding. Use a damp cleaning rag to wipe off the sanding debris. Wipe off your **cedar** siding with a dry cleaning rag for the final cleaning. Your work is done, and you can either re-**stain** your **cedar** siding or keep it bare. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The easiest way of applying **stain** to **cedar** decks is with a pump-up garden sprayer, or a car wash brush. An airless sprayer can also be used, but it’s still a good idea to back-brush after spraying, as this will break any surface tension and ensure that the **stain** penetrates down into the wood. A regular paint brush is great for posts, railings and areas up close to the house that may need trimmed. Apply the **stain** in the direction of the grain and focus on the seams, joints, and edges for best results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ready Seal wood **stain** is good for exterior projects, especially fences. It is best known for its ease of application. According to the manufacturer, the priority during this **stain**’s formulation is ease of use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best **stain** for new decks will largely depend on aesthetic preferences and the quality of the materials you’re using. But in almost any case, Ready Seal 512 will be a serious contender. One of its most appealing features is that this **stain** is only slightly thicker than water. As a result, this formula doesn’t require back-brushing, making the application particularly fool-proof. You don’t have to worry about streaks or runs unless you’re exceedingly sloppy when applying it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing which is better between water based and oil based deck **stain** is not a cut and dry issue. Different manufacturers make different claims as to the durability, and endless experts weigh in online extolling the virtues of both. So rather than continue to muddy the waters by making claims about which type of deck **stain** is better, we will stick to what we pretty much know for sure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally, oil-based **stain**s are prone to attracting mold and mildew. This is due to the naturally occurring particles in oil-based **stain**s that are technically food for mold and mildew spores. Moreover, these oil-based **stain**s usually retain humidity; a humid place is a great breeding place for mold and mildew. Add the aging factor to the mix, and you’ll discover that the wood **stain** applied to your **cedar** siding quickly becomes an eyesore. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because it is easy to apply, contractors and homeowners save valuable time on their wood projects. As the name suggests, it is a sealer and **stain** rolled into one. The **stain** comes in one or five-gallon containers. There are 10 colors to choose from. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At Longhouse Specialty Forest Products in Parksville, B.C., we specialize in Western Red Cedar and coastal Douglas Fir custom cut to your project specifications. Our products range from posts and beams, siding (including pre-**stain**ed siding), board and batten, shingles, and decking (available in many custom profiles). Contact us today to get started! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Film-forming **stain**s make a film on top of wood surfaces, forming a solid barrier between the wood and the environment. A film-forming wood **stain** is excellent for covering blemishes and providing UV protection and will typically last several years before needing refreshing. These type **stain**s are great if you have both new and old boards on a deck. It will hide the uneven appearance that’s created when replacing boards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After waiting for 24 hours, your **cedar** siding should be dry enough for sanding. If you run your finger across it, you’ll notice that the wood **stain** is almost gone. A thin layer of wood **stain** is all that’ll be left for you to scrape thoroughly with sandpaper. If sanding with sandpaper is too strenuous, you can use an electric hand sander. In all, ensure that you do a thorough sanding job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll need to apply the chemical wood bleach to strip off the protective layer of wood **stain** on your **cedar** siding. Use a paintbrush to slowly apply thick chunks of bleach to your **cedar** siding. Start your bleach application from the top siding, spread evenly across the siding, and move down gradually. Ensure that you apply the bleach generously across every area of your **cedar** siding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many people consider Ipe oil the golden standard for deck **stain**s, but if you’re balancing quality against cost, Ipe is rarely your best choice. For that, you’ll want Cabot’s Australian Timber Oil. It’s arguably the best deck **stain** for pressure-treated wood, as this darker Amberwood pigmentation provides both beauty and lasting power. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As is often the case, we recommend trying a small patch first to test your methods. In an area that isn’t too noticeable you could **stain** a small portion that is sanded and a one that is not. From there you can determine if it will be worth it to you to add that extra step of sanding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tip: Thinking of spraying it? Greenlight. I researched garden sprayers for spraying **stain**: this is the way to go for light **stain**s, not solid or opaque. In another post, I selected hand pump sprayers that can handle clear, transparent and semi-transparent **stain**s. The low-cost plastic sprayers cannot do it all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you plan to do two coats of **stain** when renovating your **cedar** deck, it’s best to go with the manufacturer’s recommendations on the can. But in general, you should wait at least 4 hours between applications and avoid **stain**ing at midday or in direct sunlight. Depending on temperature and humidity, allow 24 - 48 hours of drying time before using your beautifully restored deck or porch, and if you did decide to go with oil **stain**, expect for it to smell really badly and make everyone around feel ill for a week or two... - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cedar accepts paint, but more than any other wood except pine, it needs a coat of primer before you paint it. The natural oils in **cedar** can bleed through latex and oil paints and produce dark areas around knots and oil-rich sap lines. To prevent this, use a high-solid primer before you paint it. An alkyd oil-based primer offers strong protection against discoloration. Priming with a product that has a high percentage of pigment not only prevents bleed-through, it increases the coverage of the top coat and decreases the time it takes to apply it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cedar wood is a versatile material that you can use indoors and outdoors. Cedar decking is extremely popular, as are **cedar** fences and **cedar** siding. Cedar is a soft wood, and because of it’s oily nature, it’s naturally weather resistant. Although **cedar** has natural water resistance, it still needs to be protected as over time, even **cedar** will begin to break down and deteriorate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Defy Extreme Semi-Transparent Wood Stain is a clear wood **stain** that contains zinc nano-particles, which act as the wood's sunblock. It adds color and highlights the wood grain. It doesn’t only **stain** the wood but also seals it against moisture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Deck **stain**s can be applied in several different ways. Using a pump-up garden sprayer and roller are two popular methods. Regardless of how you apply your wood **stain**, keep a paint brush at hand for smoothing the material as well as getting between the cracks between deck boards. To see a selection of very low VOC deck **stain**s, sealers and tools online, see here, and Ecohome may get a commission as per usual if you choose to buy some*. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This wood **stain** can be used on fences. Like the first two options, this **stain** also protects wood from UV Rays. It also defends fences from damage caused by water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Removing wood **stain**s from **cedar** wood requires proper care and the right tools. For instance, the chemicals used in making wood **stain** are potentially harmful to your skin; hence you need to be careful when removing the wood **stain**. Simply scraping away at the wood **stain** would ruin your **cedar** siding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Keep in mind, getting it done is better than not doing it, so if you have a weather window without rain and you need to **stain** through the day, then don’t lose sleep over it if you are close to the ideal situation. Waiting for the perfect conditions of sun, temperature and humidity, along with a time you can spare to do it, may simply not be possible and weather forecasts are not always perfect. If it gets too hot or it rains too soon after **stain**ing, the world will not stop spinning and your deck will not spontaneously combust so don’t sweat it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another suggestion we would make would be to see about buying more **stain** than you need as long as you are able to return it. It’s difficult to accurately estimate the required quantity of **stain** for old decks, and going back to return cans of deck **stain** would be preferable than running out and hoping you can find more of the exact type and color of **stain** that you've just coated 90% of your old deck boards with. The other thing is, for the new deck **stain** to be durable, it needs to have a thick enough layer applied, which is why the general recommendation is to apply 2 coats of new **stain**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first coat of deck **stain** on freshly cleaned older **cedar** decking planks seals the weatherd wood, and the second coat is what gives it lasting water resistance and UV protection. The second coat of deck **stain** goes on quicker, uses a lot less product and comes after hours of pressure washing and sometimes scrubbing and sanding. Putting on a second coat - if that's what the manufacturer recommends - is a small price to pay for extended peace of mind and enjoyment of a better looking renovated deck. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, you can **stain** a deck with a roller, you can also use a mop or a pad. This deck was **stain**ed using a roller, and for the best results a thick and absorbent roller was chosen than holds a lot of **stain**. A roller will not get in the spaces between boards however, so best is to progress about an arm’s length at a time so you can swipe a brush between the boards to properly coat the edges. Rollers, mops or pads work fine for the decking boards themselves but a brush is more suitable for **stain**ing decking railings and spindles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   From experience, I’d say that these days the top deck **stain** is Extreme Wood Stain from DEFY, is made in the USA and that means a lot to us. It comes in 7 shades counting clear. A very good price and easy to clean up (water-based). Definitely one of the best deck **stain**s on the market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing the right deck **stain** for your **cedar** wood deck depends mainly on what you want. Some deck **stain**s are easier to apply, while others require a bit of extra work. You can also choose from **stain**s that enhance the natural beauty of **cedar** surfaces, or you can choose something that covers up any blemishes that your **cedar** surface has. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The easiest cleanup job after **stain**ing a deck is the job that was prepared and protected ahead of time. If you have living space below the deck, such as another wood deck or a patio, lay down tarps first to avoid **stain** blotches. Have a pouring station with a large piece of cardboard to hold cans, brushes, rollers and trays. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The SEAL-ONCE Nano+Poly Ready Mix Penetrating Wood Sealer & Stain is a highly rated product in the industry. It provides great protection against the sun, it’s mildew-resistant, and eliminates warping & cupping. It’s also great for protecting materials against water damage and cold weather conditions, like rain, snow and ice. Additionally, the **stain**’s proprietary nanotechnology penetrates deep into the wood’s fibers to create a barrier, making it arguably the best **stain** for old decks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even the toughest decking materials can be gradually worn down by elements. Sun exposure and UV rays can cause surfaces to fade, moisture can promote rot or infestation, and even changes in temperature can expand and contract organic materials, such as wood decking planks. Using a deck **stain** is one of the best ways to minimize these problems over time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For new **cedar** surfaces, like rough sawn **cedar**, your first step is to allow the wood to weather. 3-6 months is ideal. Allowing the wood to weather gives time for some of the natural oils in the wood to dry out, and will give you better **stain**ing results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An effective option is a semitransparent **stain** containing **cedar**-colored pigments. You can refresh it as needed to maintain the natural colors. If weather-resistance is your main concern and you aren't concerned about color, use a water-sealing finish. Most of these products contain paraffin that forms a light coating inside the grain and sheds water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is also sealer and **stain** rolled into one. Because it is also a sealant, it is good for preventing water damage. It has advanced polymers which provide fade resistance. The finish is mold and mildew resistant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This wood **stain** is good for all outdoor wood projects. It has UV protection and is water-repellant. It is good for quick repairs or retouches on your fence. Its drying time is 24-48 hours. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Water-based **stain**s have better UV-resistance, and consequently, avoid fading better than oil-based **stain**s. They’re non-flammable, environmentally friendly, dry faster, have fewer odors, and their breathability prevents moisture from becoming trapped in the wood. However, they also take longer to apply. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Primer can go onto the **cedar** via brush or roller. Like other coatings, it's important to start with a clean surface. If the **cedar** was previously painted, make sure any loose or peeling paint gets removed before priming. Cover the **cedar** completely with the primer before applying your paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Transparency refers to the amount of natural **cedar** surface that shows through the **stain**. The less transparent the wood **stain**, the more the grain and blemishes will shine through. The more opaque the wood **stain**, the less of the wood surface you’ll see. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Getting the best results starts with a clean deck. Both composites and wood should be clean and dry before you start. Wood may also need to be sanded, treated, or stripped of old **stain**s. With a bare surface, you can ensure an even finish and a long-lasting, great look you’ll love. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Semi-solid **stain**s split the difference. They allow you to hide modest wear-and-tear, while still seeing a fair amount of wood grain, but they also fundamentally change the appearance of your deck. You can also find dozens of different shades of brown, as well as less traditional options like green or purple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you choose a water-based **stain**, allow the wood to visibly dry, then you can **stain** the deck. If you choose an oil based **stain**, you’ll need to allow the wood to dry for 24 hours, or until completely dry. Start with a small portion of the **cedar** fence or deck that’s out of sight. This is your test spot to help you see the final color before applying it to the entire deck. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Keeping your deck **stain**ed will require a bit of maintenance and care, but the results are worth it. Stained **cedar** decks retain their appearance, and your maintenance schedule depends on the type of **stain** you’ve chosen. Oil based **stain**s will normally need reapplication every year, while semi-transparent water-based **stain**s can last longer. Water-based, solid **stain**s can last for up to five years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For an untreated deck to be restored to this look after 15 years is an indication that pressure washing and **stain**ing an old **cedar** deck will significantly rejuvenate it and almost make it look new again. That's really a thumbs up for natural red **cedar** as a superior decking material, and speaks volumes for how durable this option is. In our opinion the extra cost over what you would pay for basic pressure treated pine decking boards - especially if you like the look of natural red **cedar** and are intending staying in the home for a few years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A thorough cleaning with a high-quality, oxygenated bleach wood cleaner will ensure that you **stain** wood and not dirt, mildew, or impurities remaining in the wood. The best method is to apply the deck cleaner with a pump sprayer, then pressure wash to rinse. You can also use a deck brush as a gentler treatment, but this may take longer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Staining an old weathered **cedar** deck can be quite different than **stain**ing a new one. First, pressure wash the deck to remove the old gray color and all the build up of grit and **stain**s. Try to always blast the water with the direction of the grain or you will end up having to sand it all too. And, the bigger the deck, the bigger the sanding job will be so its worth taking the time to be careful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Jump below to the complete list with details: best deck **stain** and sealer. (Also, check out our page all about deck tools and other supplies.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the end, the right wood **stain** choice for exterior surfaces like **cedar** decks, an outside **cedar** fence, or outdoor furniture is up to you. Oil based **stain**s will penetrate better, be easier to apply and more forgiving. Water-based **stain**s will last longer (assuming the wood has been cleaned and brightened), resist mold and mildew better, and be better for the environment. The right wood **stain** will provide protection and enhance the natural beauty of the wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This wood **stain** contains less than 50 grams per liter of volatile organic compound content. Moreover, it is odorless and safe to use. This makes #1Deck Stain best in being environmentally friendly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Removing wood **stain**s from your **cedar** siding is a pretty tough job. Chances are that you’ll keep procrastinating or end up with a botched job. Rather than waiting till the time is right – which never really happens, you’ll be better off paying professionals to handle it. You’ll easily get the job done quickly and properly if you let the professionals handle it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What makes the Ready Seal 512 the best semi transparent deck **stain** is basically a combination of selection and ease of application. It’s available in 9 shades of brown, and that wide range of color selection makes it easier to find a shade to perfectly match your project. Like other types of Ready Seal, their formula is great at ensuring you don’t have to worry about runs or streaks during application. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As we mentioned, since old wood will absorb much more **stain** than new wood, any color you choose will appear darker on older deck boards than new ones. Before you commit to a color for renovating your weathered **cedar** planks, we would suggest you pick up a few samples of deck **stain**s - especially if it's a pretty big deck like the one we photographed for this article. You should be able to find very small cans of deck treatment to test, and some companies even have tiny sample packs of **stain** for exactly that purpose. To pick the perfect **stain** color you like when renovating your deck, remember to go slightly lighter if it's old wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Benefits of Cedar Cedar is naturally resistant to rot, but that isn't its only benefit as a building material. It's lightweight yet harder than most other softwoods, including fir and pine. It's structurally more stable than most wood species, which means that **cedar** is less likely to crack and split. Cedar's rot-resistant oils are highly aromatic, which makes **cedar** an effective insect repellant. One common species, Western red **cedar**, has such a high thermal coefficient that structures made from it remain cool on hot days. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We pros save an enormous amount of time by spraying the **stain** with a low-pressure insecticide sprayer. I take my time and protect non-decking with plastic sheets and tape and paper. This saves a large amount of time: no cleaning overspray in the end: that’s a drag. Read the list of deck tools, and just pick what you need. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As mentioned above, wait at least 4 hours to do a second coat of deck **stain**, but give it 12-24 hours if you can. Usually, 48 to 72 hours of curing time is recommended before you replace furniture and begin full use of your deck. Generally speaking, the more time and care to get everything right before applying **stain**, the better the result. And the same goes for giving the deck **stain** sufficient time to harden properly before using it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Similar to their solid color **stain**, Restore-A-Deck’s semi-transparent wood **stain** is formulated to maximize the penetrative potential of a water-based **stain**. That allows it to provide a highly protective and potentially long-lasting **stain**, along with a low-odor application, and a lifetime of easy cleanup. While you can opt for more opaque options, Restore-A-Deck also offers a variety of semi-transparent tones to match the natural beauty of several popular kinds of wood, including **cedar**, dark walnut, light walnut, as well as natural and cottage gray finishes that work well for a more lived-in effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Removing wood **stain**s from your **cedar** siding can take the whole day, depending on the area you’re working on. Get your equipment ready, and possibly get a ladder or an elevated platform to help you reach the top siding. Put on your respiratory mask, safety goggles, and gloves. The wood bleach or chemical wood stripper you’ll use can overwhelm your nostrils and bare skin – which is why you need chemical-resistant gloves and a respiratory mask. Also, you’ll need your safety goggles, as debris is bound to fly once you start scraping. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Semi-solid Staining – A semi-solid **stain** is slightly more transparent than a completely opaque **stain** color but will still completely change the look of the wood. The best use of a semi-solid **stain** is for old wood that lacks character and needs life and color. However, since a large part of the appeal of **cedar** decks is their unique character and natural weathering, choosing a semi-solid **stain** may not be the best option for your new **cedar** deck. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Semi-Transparent Staining – These **stain**s add pigment that provides a subtle hint of color, but are transparent enough to allow the wood grain to show through. The best semi-transparent **stain** is one that protects your **cedar** wood surface while bringing out the character and grain of the wood. Semi-transparent **stain**s aren’t very good at hiding blemishes, so if you have an old deck that’s in bad condition, you may be better off with a more opaque option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brushes with water based **stain** can of course be cleaned with water. However mineral spirits (paint thinner) or turpentine is needed to clean brushes, hands and containers with oil based deck **stain** on them. Sediment will drop to the bottom of a container of paint thinner so you should be able to use it repeatedly provided it’s been in a sealed container. A wide mouth glass jar is ideal. What we like to do is cycle them – use old thinner for a first rinse of brushes covered in gooey deck **stain** and move to final rinse with new and clean thinner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Semi-solid deck **stain**. This product comes in between transparent and solid deck **stain**s. More protection than a transparent **stain**, and less than an opaque **stain**. If you go this route, give a look for Cabot Semi-Solid. There are not many choices out there as most folks go semi-transparent or full solid (and paint). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you’re done applying the wood bleach, wait for about 20 minutes. Your waiting time is to allow the **cedar** siding to absorb the bleach properly, making scraping smooth and easy. If the bleach you’re using has a different waiting instruction, stick to it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hybrid **stain**s are usually a type of oil based resin that’s encapsulated in water. This is more of a recent technology as tougher VOC restrictions have forced **stain** manufacturers to come up with newer VOC compliant versions of their **stain**s. They’re a happy compromise between the ease of use of water-based products and the functionality of oil wood **stain**. They’re becoming more common, and many times, they’re simply referred to as “oil based” but with soap and water cleanup. They typically still don’t last as long as an acrylic water-based **stain**, but they do offer some of the advantages of both oil and water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some **stain**s and sealants are not pet friendly. In addition to preserving, protecting, and enhancing your **cedar** fence, Seal-Once Nano Penetrating Wood Sealer is also good for your beloved furry friends. Because it has low VOC levels, it is non-toxic and won’t harm plants, people, or pets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By combining oil and resin, Cabot Wood Toned Deck Siding Stain provides everything you might expect of the best oil based deck **stain**. It’s great at keeping out moisture, protecting from mildew and mold. It’s resistant to cracking and peeling and dries after about an hour or two after application. The oil-based formula helps ensure its long-lasting, and the resulting matte finish speaks for itself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Water-based **stain**s are easy to apply and easy to clean up with soap and water. They are usually lower in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which means they’re better for the environment. The only downside is you have to properly prep the wood before applying a water-based **stain** if you want the longest lifespan. The good news is once the wood is prepped properly with a cleaner and brightener, a quality, water based **stain** will far outlast most oil based **stain**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you choose a water based or oil based deck **stain**, it is still best to wear a full-face or half-face respirator suitable for organic fumes such as a P100 filter when **stain**ing an older **cedar** deck as you're going to be using much more treatment products. This is most important when using oil based **stain**s, but wise even with water based acrylic deck **stain**. Wearing safety glasses will protect your eyes from mist or droplets spraying from brushes or rollers. To further reduce your exposure, notice if there are any prevailing winds and try to stay up wind of the **stain**ed areas. Think of it as self preservation, at the same time as preserving your deck! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   I’ve been using **stain**s since my very first painting apprentice job in 1977. I’ve learned the difference and here I review the good and less good (read ‘bad’). My advice: be conservative and choose the best deck **stain** you can afford. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the bleach has been fully absorbed, it’s time for your scraper to get to work. When scraping, follow the path of the wood grain. You’ll notice that the wood **stain** feels a bit lose – if it’s still hard, you need to apply more bleach and wait a little more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because of its rot-resistance and stability, **cedar** used for outdoor projects, such as furniture, fences, siding, and play structures, lasts for years without any finish.

You can prevent it from turning gray by finishing it with a material that reflects the ultraviolet sunlight that breaks down the surface fibers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best deck **stain** and sealer will protect the wood better if it contains some solids (resins, etc) to cover and block the sun. The more solids in your deck **stain**, the better your protection. So this is a factor that you have to balance with your desire to have a low-maintenance deck. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wood **stain** is used to color the wood. Apart from coloring the wood, **stain** is also applied to bind the wood and make it stronger. Staining is permanent so you have to be careful in choosing the **stain** you’ll use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Solid **stain**s are a good choice for decks that have some visible imperfections. They’re also great for instances where you’d like to totally change the color scheme of your deck. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Penetrating **stain**s move through the wood grain, penetrating down under the surface. The **stain** wraps around each wood fiber, making it stronger and more resistant to water damage, rot, and insects. A penetrating deck **stain** still allows the wood to breathe but will protect it from harsh elements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Staining a deck in the sun on very hot days can lead to it deteriorating quicker over the long run, so best is not to do it on days of extreme heat. The ideal conditions are when ambient surface temperatures stay between 10°C (50°F) and 32°C (90°F) for 24 hours after **stain**ing. In the summer, morning and evening are best when the deck surface isn’t as hot. Deck **stain** is also best applied when the relative humidity is between 40% and 70%. Too low and it can dry too fast, too high and the humidity could affect the gloss and the extend the drying time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The first variable to consider when finding an appropriate weather window to **stain** a deck, is the manufacturer’s recommendations for temperature range and drying time and that should be listed on the can. But in general, for proper penetration and even color, a deck should have a few days without rain before **stain**ing and ideally a few days after. A bit more time with oil based **stain** as it takes longer to dry, but predicting the weather is an inexact science. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
