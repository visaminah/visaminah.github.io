## 93 Tips to What Paint Colors Go With Brown Trim | Exterior House Colors With Dark Brown Trim
-   LRV 41 SW Svelte Sage is exactly as its name implies, sage. Not as green as some sage paint **colors** can be, Svelte Sage is more muted and toned down. You have to be careful when choosing and green paint color to complement red brick. Why? For the simple fact that you don’t want your home to look like a red and green Christmas decoration. That’s why Svelte Sage is a great muted green exterior paint color option to pair with brick. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are numerous ways to introduce **brown** into the facade of a home. This property uses mostly warm gray siding, but introduces several areas of rich **brown** fieldstone as well. The fieldstone has some hints of gray in it, which helps tie the two materials together, creating a unified and cohesive design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may choose between a light or dark **brown** roof, depending on your climate. Dark shingles can help keep your home warm if you reside in a hot environment. Running the air conditioner is the only way to keep the house’s interior cool. Use your trim to your advantage. An option is to use a contrasting color to bring attention to your house’s curves and accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Much like blues, gray has a wide range of shades that will look great with dark **brown** furniture. Gray is a modern neutral where white and beige used to be popular. If you're looking for an alternative to white that will brighten a room but have a softer contrast, you can use a lighter shade of gray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to use **brown** for the siding, consider a medium, chocolate **brown** shade paired with a white trim. This creates a rich, deep design that doesn’t make the facade too dark. The blue/gray roof on this home adds a little contrast to the property, and helps make the walls seem taller. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Metals should also be considered when deciding what **colors** go with **brown**. People tend to struggle with pairing different metals with **brown**. The reason for this is that the tone of **brown** is not taken into consideration when choosing metal fixtures throughout. The rule of thumb is to pair warm metals like copper and bronze with warm **brown**, and cold metals like chrome should be paired with cool **brown**s. If, for example, you have wooden floors throughout your house that have a very warm, orange undertone, copper fittings, and fixtures are a great option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a **brown** roof on your home, it may be dark, medium or light **brown**. Beyond that, **brown** can have undertones of red, orange or yellow. You’ll also find that some **brown**s are slightly grayed—like weathered wood. We’ve developed carefully curated color palettes that will make it easier to choose perfect complements for your roof, stone and brick. And if you want to explore more siding color combinations, visit the LP® SmartSide® Home Visualizer, our siding visualizer tool. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re using different trim **colors** in adjoining rooms, they need to work well together. “Doors tend to stay open, so you’ll have the trim color from an adjoining room in any given space on a regular basis,” observes painter Susan English. So, let’s say you have a barn-red door opening into a room with pale yellow walls. “This can be an effective accent color in the space where it ­doesn’t ‘belong’—if it’s carefully considered.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark **brown** furniture is an elegant choice for any room. It can take on any style you wish, from fun and vibrant, to dark and sophisticated. Whatever look you are trying to achieve can be reached through adding paint and accent **colors** to make the most of your furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An earthy, muted **brown** has a grounding effect, especially when painted adjacent to whites and light grays. It’s a classic, beachy tone, reminiscent of the stones cast onto the shore by the sea. Because of this, it’s perfect for coastal spaces (and even the trendy coastal grandmother look ). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Reusable These peel & stick paint samples are super affordable and allow you to test a paint color in all different areas of a room without the mess of a traditional paint sample!

Check them out for yourself, you won’t be disappointed. TRY SAMPLIZE NOW - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Much like a **brown** and white pairing, **brown** pairs well with black to create a classic color palette in any room. When using black as one of your main **colors**, you must make sure to balance it well. Lighter shades of **brown** or light woods work better so the room doesn’t appear too dark. In spaces with black furniture, **brown** accents can add depth and interest to the room, whereas black can create drama against **brown** furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adding washes of bright **colors** into the room will help to counter the darkness of the furniture. An easy way to do this is with bright throw pillows or throw blankets. You can also use a colorful rug or other accent pieces to bring color into the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just to recap, these are 10 exterior house color ideas for brick. I choose 5 Benjamin Moore and 5 Sherwin Williams paint **colors**. All absolutely amazing choices if I do say so myself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is possible to have a dark, medium, or light **brown** roof on your property. Red, orange, and yellow overtones are all common in **brown**s. Like worn wood, certain **brown**s have a grayish cast to them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Second, we want the paint **colors** to complement red brick, not work against it. One way to do this is by pulling **colors** from the actual brick itself. Generally speaking, red brick has a variation of **colors** in it. Choosing one of those color variations will keep the home looking cohesive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Consider the **colors** of green you choose to decorate the front of your house. You should avoid using dark greens as a primary color. Aside from that, the viewer’s attention will be drawn away from the **brown** roof. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Deep chocolate **brown** and rich mahogany furniture are popular because of their sophisticated look and practical style. Dark **brown** furniture is a neutral staple in home design, but it doesn't have to be boring. When styling your room around your dark **brown** and wood furniture, certain wall **colors** will bring out the best in your furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Any shade of red, from cherry to maroon, will bring out the red undertones in dark **brown** furniture and make it look muddy. It doesn’t do mid-**brown** furniture any favors, either, as the combination tends to read dull. Fuchsia. The combination of **brown** and pink had a big moment back in the 90s, but the problem with trends is that they quickly become dated. Pale pink with **brown** is fine if you’re decorating a little girl’s room, but for grown-up rooms, pass on the pink and opt for more sophisticated shades that carry a punch like orange, lime green, or brilliant sky blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown furniture tends to get a bad rap for being boring, but when put in the right setting, it can actually be extraordinarily stylish. The secret to elevating your favorite (and even your not-so-favorite!) pieces of **brown** furniture is to choose the ideal wall **colors**. Whether you’ve inherited your grandmother’s mahogany dining room table or fallen hard for a sleek chocolate-**brown** sofa, follow these interior design tips for choosing paint **colors** to set them in the very best light. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When styling dark **brown** furniture, you want to use **colors** that complement your furniture and make it stand out. A good rule of thumb is to use lighter shades that help your furniture shine instead of washing it out. Here are the best options for your walls! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pro2Pro Tip: If you find yourself paralyzed at the paint store, unable to choose your color sample cards, Krims offers this tip: Look at the darkest color at the bottom of the strip. “If you can live with the one at the bottom, you know you’ll like the middle and top, but if you choose by looking at the top, lightest **colors**, all the cards in that category start to look the same.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a dark **brown** sofa or other furniture, the best way to complement them is with mid-tone walls. Think warm golden yellow, soft medium blues, restful grayish-greens, creamy tans or soothing greys. Our creative director Danielle suggests looking through Benjamin Moore’s Historical Colors palate for inspiration and ideas. The key is to think “soft” – you don’t want your walls to pop so much as envelope you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While all shades of ivory walls complement **brown** beautifully, the harshness of pure white takes away from its warmth, so be sure to stick with softer, mellower tones. You want a tonal contrast, not a stark one. A few of our favorite ivory **colors** include Benjamin Moore’s Swiss Coffee and Navajo White. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a larger home, it’s sometimes helpful to break up the siding into sections so you can better see the different elements in the facade. This home features lap siding, half round shingles and straight edge shingles in two different **colors**. The shingles are a medium **brown** that sets them apart from the cream color of the rest of the facade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A more unexpected pairing that you might not come up with yourself is pairing **brown**s with purple. Deeper shades of purples and **brown**s can make larger spaces feel cozy in a way that brighter **colors** can’t achieve. When pairing purple and **brown**, always focus on the opposites. Darker woods like walnut pair well with pastel purples, and lighter **brown** woods pair well with deep shades of purple like plum or bright shades like amethyst. Brown and purple work very well in a room with yellow accents as well, if you’re looking to add a third color to your color scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, sometimes lowering the ceiling visually creates a welcome feeling of enclosure. In his own 19th-century **brown**stone, Ken Charbonneau painted the dining room ceiling Pompeiian Red. “People love to ask if the red paint doesn’t bring the ceiling down too much. But you’re sitting the whole time you’re in a dining room, and you want to create a warm, cozy, intimate feeling, so why not?” Of course, his ceilings are 11 feet high. In a house that has ceilings just 8 or 9 feet high, painting a bedroom ceiling a pale robin’s egg blue, for instance, would be a way to create a similar, soothing effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . A light **brown** shingle and a pale tint for the walls will make your home look larger, whereas your house will seem even more cramped if you decorate it with dark hues. When selecting shingles, keep energy efficiency in mind. You may choose between a light or dark **brown** roof, depending on your climate. Dark shingles can help keep your home warm if you reside in a hot environment. Running the air conditioner is the only way to keep the house’s interior cool. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing **colors** that go well together is a key part of painting your home. The accent **colors** will tie together the exterior and give the frame of your home some definition. You can choose **colors** that give your home a classic look or you can create a modern style. You can choose the features that stand out on your home as well. Colors can do wonders for your home, and they will make your home stand out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I often get calls from homeowners who are struggling to pick paint **colors** that go with honey oak trim. Here in Des Moines, many of the houses built in the 1980s and 1990s and even 2000s prominently feature glossy, lacquered, honey oak trim. The prospect of painting all of that wood trim, whether it’s your own time and labor or paying a professional, can be daunting. (Update: We just had the oak trim painted in our new house, and it cost a small fortune, but it was so worth it!) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Beige is another great neutral for dark **brown** furniture. Beige acts as a highlight to complement the undertones of wood furniture. It's light enough that it doesn't become muddy as darker **brown** shades would. Because these are both earth tones, you can liven up the room with bold accent **colors** like turquoise, purples, or deep yellows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If bold and bodacious is your calling, a punch of color to accentuate your **brown** furniture is in order! Thanks to the iconic brand Hermes, nothing says upscale chic more than deep **brown** and orange. Plus, orange walls add a big dose of happy to any space. Choose an orange that is as close to an actual orange as possible; even tangerine is great when combined with **brown**. Add in an ivory rug or other pieces of furniture, some twinkling brass accents, and you’ve got a fabulous 70s-inspired glam pad worthy of Charlie’s Angels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown might not be the first color you think of when decorating your daughter’s bedroom, but you’d be surprised how well it can pair with shades of pink. Pairing **brown** with shades like rose or fuchsia creates a feminine space without overdoing it. If you’re going ahead with a pink room, the natural order would be to start with a **brown** base and **brown** or wooden furniture, using shades of pink as your accents in things like pillows, curtains, or artwork. You could choose a more subtle, subdued shade of pink for the wall as well, like this room with a pink-peach shade on the walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Every shade of **brown**, from pale sand to deep chocolate, becomes ultra-sophisticated when paired with creamy ivory walls. The high contrast with the **brown** color provides a rich, upscale feeling that is timeless. For accent **colors**, consider adding in a sophisticated cornflower blue for contrast, or stick with a tonal palate of neutral **colors** like ivory, sand, camel, toffee and cocoa. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Beige can be described as one of the most apparent **colors** that go with **brown**. Beige is essentially a much lighter shade of **brown**, and the shades in between these two can be combined to create a satisfying and monochromatic color scheme. Beige accents look great with **brown** as the base color and vice versa. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since **brown** and orange are such similar **colors** you might shy away from pairing them together, but we’re here to save you from that mistake. When placed in a primarily **brown** space, orange accents will serve as the perfect energizer for the room. A pop of orange in a **brown** room comes across as trendy or artsy, especially against darker woods. For a more warm, sophisticated color scheme, you can try pairing a dark chocolate background with orange and cream accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Quickly, let’s talk about testing paint **colors**. Instead of physically going to your nearest paint store to grab your samples, you need to try Samplize Peel & Stick paint samples. Why should you try Samplize? Super affordable - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is a great color to use when you are aiming for a calm and natural environment. It serves great as a neutral backdrop to pops of color and can also stand firm on its own. More **colors** go with **brown** than **colors** that don’t. The most important factor to consider when choosing what **colors** go with **brown**, is whether the specific **brown** has a warm, cold or neutral undertone and take it from there. Also, keep in mind that **colors** that show up in nature are bound to match well with **brown** because of their sense of familiarity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **colors** look great with **brown**, in moderation, but always consider earthy, natural **colors** when making your **brown** color combination choice. Natural greens, ocean blues, and so forth. These **colors** look very natural next to **brown**, as we often see them in nature. Brown complementary **colors** like orange for a cool blue, works well when used in moderation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown represents strength, quality, reliability, and safety. One look at a large oak tree can confirm this connection that has been drawn. High-end brands like Louis Vuitton make use of **brown** in their branding and their products for this exact reason. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re more inclined to hit a hiking trail than a shopping mall, you will enjoy living in a space inspired by nature. Luckily, this is easy to create with **brown** furniture…Mother Nature herself used a savvy decorating eye when she chose **brown** as the grounding color of the soil and the trees! Here you can really lean into earth tones to create an inviting color scheme. Think burnt umber and warm peach for a southwestern palate, rich terra cotta and mustard yellow to invoke a sun-baked Tuscan landscape, green for a verdant jungle vibe, a jumble of grays and ivories to mimic the natural mosaic of river rocks, sky blue for a brilliant contrast to bark **brown**. If you’re not sure where to start, just look outside your window for inspiration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lighter shades of green are ideal for rooms meant for gathering. We associate green and **brown** with nature, which can have a calming and harmonious effect, according to color psychology. Putting this palette in rooms meant for a gathering can help your guests to have a calm and relaxing time, even if the room becomes noisy and crowded. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It may not sound like two of the most appealing color choices, but hear us out! There’s a time and a place for using mustard yellow in your home. It’s not a color that you want to overdose on, but it’s a great stabilizing color. Mustard yellow can bring contrast to a room primarily built around **brown**s and other earth tones without being too vibrant or overwhelming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red. Any shade of red, from cherry to maroon, will bring out the red undertones in dark **brown** furniture and make it look muddy. It doesn’t do mid-**brown** furniture any favors, either, as the combination tends to read dull. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Taupe is a versatile color that you can customize by adding a tint to it. You can use gray or green to create the perfect look for your home. Use a combination of white trim and a rich **brown** for the shutters and the front door to really make your home look warm and inviting. This is a natural look that works well for people who want to feel closer to the outdoors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For those with a mid-**brown** sofa or medium wood furniture, up the cozy factor by choosing wall **colors** a few shades deeper. For instance, Benjamin Moore’s Hale Navy or Knoxville Gray create a gorgeous balance against a camel-colored sofa or a walnut coffee table. Again, your aim is to keep things soft and warm, so avoid vivid or stark **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are looking at a dark **brown** color and there is no visible warm or cold undertone, it can be considered a neutral **brown** that can be combined and look great with almost any color, as it is a true neutral in every sense of the word. This type of **brown** works well with other neutral **colors** such as white and black, as it is very contrasting and makes a contemporary statement. Black and **brown** work great together as textile patterns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Referencing the earth symbolism of **brown**, teal is naturally one of the **colors** that go with **brown**, as it represents the ocean and completes the earth-ocean duo. Teal looks great with any shade of neutral **brown**. Defer from pairing teal with a very warm **brown** or an overly cool **brown**, as this will clash. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ve heard before that white goes with just about every color, and **brown** is no exception to that rule. Pairing any shade of **brown** with a crisp white will give you a clean contrast that works well in a room like a formal dining room or living room. If white and **brown** are your two main **colors** in any room, make sure you vary the shades to keep it interesting. Shades of dark **brown** or woods such as teak pop well against white too. For this living room they chose to use white as the main color, with **brown** furniture and wood accents providing the contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you paint your home, it is important to make sure that you use **colors** that work well together. The color should make your home look its best, and the accent **colors** should tie your home together with your roof. Take a look at some of the best **colors** to put with your house paints. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you’re considering the color for the exterior of a home, don’t overlook the roof. A rich **brown** roof can add dimension to a property, but it needs a lighter colored siding to help keep the exterior from getting too dark. This light gray siding with cream trim complements the **brown** roof, while keeping the space from getting too dark or heavy in its design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As with the above example, if you are faced with a very light **brown** that doesn’t seem warmer than it is cool or vice versa, it can be considered a neutral light **brown**. A light **brown** is a great neutral to work with, as it is very modern and goes with any color, whether it be very bright pops of color or toned-down pastels. Light **brown**s also work well as monotones, as it creates a very calming atmosphere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Be aware of the intensity of the **colors** in a room. “If you have an Oriental rug with five or six strong **colors**, don’t paint the walls in equally strong hues. Let the rug be the focal point and the walls a lighter color,” says Sherwin-Williams’s Sheri Thompson. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another way to subtly introduce black into your **brown** interior is through fittings such as door handles, plumbing fixtures, and small furniture items like dining chairs. If the desired mood of the interior is of an industrial or more masculine manner, this color scheme is the way to go. If masculinity is not entirely what you are after, incorporating white furniture pieces or using white as the backdrop of the space will in turn soften everything and create balance in the space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When considering the best **colors** to go with **brown** in your home, yellow should be at the top of your list. You could opt for a lively shade of yellow to give you a needed pop of color, or consider a rich shade of golden yellow. Pairing **brown** with yellow creates a contemporary vibe in a bedroom or sitting room. Using the 60-30-10 rule would work well when pairing yellow and **brown**. 60% of the room should be a neutral shade such as white, with 30% of the room decorated in various shades of **brown**, and the last 10% is reserved for yellow accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just to do a quick recap, I gave you 8 white trim **colors**, three from Sherwin Williams and five from Benjamin Moore. Some are cool whites and some are warm. There is a white trim paint for everyone here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to use a darker shade, consider the function and lighting of the room. Dark **brown**s maintain their beauty against darker grays, but it can also darken the room as a whole. This may be perfect for a bedroom if you want it to remain a dark and calming space. However, if you want to brighten up these darker tones, you can add whites in the form of comforters, throw pillows, or rugs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cool **brown** means that there is a visible undertone of blue. This **brown** hue is usually associated with good quality and masculinity. The complementary color of blue is orange, which makes orange a great combination with cool **brown**. An earthy orange, like terracotta, works best with a cool **brown**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to trim, baseboards, doors, moldings, etc. a white paint color is the most popular choice. It provides a beautiful contrast to the wall color, really making it pop. Not all white paint **colors** are created equally so before you decide on one for your trim, you need to access the situation of your room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I take my dogs on daily walks all around my neighborhood. I’m constantly looking around at all the homes I pass. I love to see what people choose as their exterior paint **colors** and how the color works with the characteristics of the home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for a stylish home color, yellow is the one for you. The **brown** roof and a warm yellow house provide a touch of **brown** to the yellow to create an almost homogeneous look. The combination of the two hues creates a modest yet appealing contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a bolder approach, try using two different **colors** in the same room. For example, paint a built-in bookcase or niche a shade of green in a room with blue walls, which will highlight the items on the bookcase or inside the recessed area. Of course, architectural elements can also provide continuity throughout a house if they are painted the same color in every room. Starting in the Federal period and continuing today, white and off-white have been the traditional choice for molding, windows, and doors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown may have red or gold undertones, ranging from light to dark. This earthy tint is the most popular option for paint color for houses with brick or stone exteriors. As a warm hue, **brown** is an excellent choice when paired with a complementary color scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is a color perceived as natural and neutral; pairing it with green plays into the grounding feeling of nature, bringing it into your home. Lighter shades of green like mint soften the darker furniture in a room. Using darker shades of green paired with dark **brown** accents or wooden furniture creates a darker, moody vibe that would work for a den or office space, as seen in the photo below. There are few combinations of green and **brown** that wouldn’t complement each other thanks to the two **colors** being natural foils in nature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You won’t find **brown** on the traditional color wheel, but since its closest shade is orange, many use blue as a complementary color for **brown**. Combining blue and **brown** tones can make a relaxing environment out of an ordinary bedroom. Brown leather paired with navy blue makes a room feel rustic and refined, whereas pale blue paired with beige or a lighter wood creates a more serene environment. The cool tones in shades of blue mix well with the warm **brown**s of darker wooden furniture without leaving the room feeling too dark or heavy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Orange is a gorgeous warm tone that can brighten dark **brown** furniture when done right. Most orange shades mesh well, but darker shades, especially in a room that isn't well lit, can become dark and feel smaller. If you want to paint your walls orange, lighter shades will brighten your room and give it a warm and energetic vibrance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brick homes have a ton of character and charm to them but sometimes pairing brick with the right paint color can be a difficult task. You want to find a paint color to complement the red brick without taking away from the charm of the home. Follow along as I share the 10 best exterior paint **colors** that go with brick homes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If orange isn’t your thing but you still crave glam, consider painting your walls a deep, glossy **brown**. It may seem counterintuitive to go **brown**-on-**brown**, but this can actually create a sensational and rich continuity. The key to keeping your room from feeling like a cave is to choose a high-gloss paint for the walls to help reflect light. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many different shades of **brown** siding, and all of them can add their own characteristics to the home. This lighter **brown** shade works well with both the white trim and the lighter, warm gray roofing shingles. The home has richness and personality, without one color taking over or standing out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lately, I have been particularly interested in red brick homes. Mainly because they can be difficult to pair paint **colors** with. Whether it’s a home with brick as an accent or a home with brick on the full-body, you want to make sure all the **colors** you chose play well together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   First, we know red brick is more muted and toned down. So we want to keep that in mind when it comes to finding paint **colors** to work with it. For example, if you were thinking of using white, choose a creamy white as opposed to a bright white. The bright white can sometimes appear a little too harsh against red brick. An off-white will give the appearance of white against the brick, but a little softer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Are you looking for a way to keep track of all the paint **colors** in your home? Have you ever had to touch up some paint in your home and forgot what the paint color was?

My simple paint color tracker can keep you and your paint **colors** organized! GET YOURS NOW - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to carpet flooring, dark **brown** is an anomaly. While most great carpets are light-colored ones, dark **brown** is the one and only awesome dark choice. This carpet combines glam and elegant look with a welcoming and inviting vibe, that’s why a lot of homeowners choose this amazing carpet to cover their entire floors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, as I say in all my paint color posts, make sure you swatch the paint **colors** you are thinking about using. The **colors** you see on the computer look differently than a swatch on your home. So choose a few **colors** you want to try and swatch those babies. Trust me choosing the wrong paint color is an expensive mistake, especially when you are dealing with the exterior of your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Always remember that while there are thousands of paint chips at the store, there are only seven **colors** in the paint spectrum,” says Krims, referring to red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet (what Color Theory 101 students are often taught to remember by the mnemonic device, “Roy G. Biv”). “I always suggest eliminating a couple even before you go to the paint store.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you like the idea of a dark siding, but aren’t sure that plain **brown** is the right choice, consider a shade closer to an autumn red. This rich, red-**brown** is the perfect choice for farmhouses. Paired with a crisp white trim, the contrast between light and dark lets the features of the house shine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally, crisp whites can make a space feel bigger and more open, while warm **colors** create a sense of intimacy. At the most rudimentary level, large rooms generally can handle more color than small rooms. “Lighter hues can open up a small space, while darker **colors** give the perception that the surfaces are closer than they are,” says Debbie Zimmer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This home makes great use of the tone-on-tone look that you can create with different shades of the same color. Lighter **brown** siding is paired with a darker **brown** trim, which makes the trim stand out and better highlights the windows, doors, and roofline. The dark gray roof adds some contrast in both color and tone, so the home doesn’t appear too monochromatic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What are the best white paint **colors** for trim and baseboards? Believe it or not, there is no lack of white shades in the world of paint. I can rattle off about 20 white paint **colors** from Sherwin Williams and Benjamin Moore off the top of my head. And I don’t have the best memory so that’s saying a lot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is a neutral and natural color that, when used in the right environment, can create a warm, stable feeling in any room. An excess of **brown** or wooden furniture can create a dark, heavy feel in your space. That’s why it’s important to integrate shades of **brown** into a color palette with **colors** and shades that complement it. When looking for a neutral shade to paint your home with **brown** is often passed over for whites or grays, but you shouldn’t rule it out! It’s all about knowing the **colors** that go with **brown**—and the best ways to incorporate them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most other whites are either warm—with yellow, rust, pink, or **brown**ish undertones—or cool, with green, blue, or gray undertones. Behr’s Mary Rice says: “Use warmer whites in rooms without a lot of natural light, or to make larger spaces seem cozier.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This home has a more subtle color palette that blends the siding, trim, doors, and roof together perfectly. The siding is partly done in a light **brown** and partly in a gray/**brown** that matches the trim and helps to create a bridge to the gray garage doors and the roof. The three **colors** blend perfectly with one another to give the home a subtle, rich appeal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   LRV 47.22 Himalayan Trek is yet another greige paint color that would look great with brick. The thing that makes Himalayan Trek different from some of the other paint **colors** I have mentioned is that it has taupe undertones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you have your **colors** in hand, consider the finish you’ll be using. Though today’s flat paints have increased stain resistance, conventional wisdom has long held that a satin (also called eggshell) finish is best for walls because it is scrubbable and doesn’t draw attention to imperfections. Semi-gloss and high-gloss finishes, it was thought, were best left to the trim, where they could accent the curves of a molding profile or the panels of a door. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Homeowners often wrestle with indecision when choosing wall **colors**. Painting the crown molding , baseboards, and other trim pieces in your home in a classic white opens up the door for considerable options, ranging from a neutral like linen to a bold accent such as electric orange. Browse through these recommended paint **colors** that go with white trim as you start your interior painting project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is a versatile choice for living room or dining room furniture, as it can take on many different moods. Depending on what it is paired with, a room anchored by **brown** upholstery or wood can be warm and enveloping, earthy and natural, elegant and sophisticated, or full-on glam. Your first step in choosing walls to enhance your **brown** furniture is to determine what overall mood you’re looking to create. Read on to help you determine your **brown**-furniture personality… - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I like the thought of going bolder and darker on shutters. It adds something a bit unexpected but once again not over the top. Blue gray paint **colors** work really well with brick too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown complementary **colors** can be determined through the assessment of the undertone of the specific **brown**. The complementary color of warm/red-**brown** is green, which makes green one of the best **colors** that go with **brown**. Using greenery in the form of plants is a great way to bring color into a space as well as accentuate your wooden furniture, without it being too thematic. This is a great natural and earthy color combination that you can never go wrong with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How­ever, “by using muted, dustier values, there’s a better chance the **colors** you choose will flow into one another,” says ­Tami Ridgeway, a color stylist for Valspar. She recommends leaning toward **colors** softened by a bit of gray; these are ­often found in historical palettes. Bright **colors** can be injected in small doses as accents—in furnishings, floor coverings, even flowers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many ways to introduce classic **brown** shades into the exterior of a home. Whether you want to add just a hint of richness to the design or you want to carry the color throughout the exterior, this classic color never fails to impress.

"The best exterior **colors** are contextual to their environment," Rill observes. Here, 15 color scheme combinations that hit the mark. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown has always been evident in interior design, but it is rarely recognized as a favorite color, which renders it difficult to sell if not understood. What most seem to underestimate is the ability of **brown** to stand firm on its own, without the additional help of bright **colors** that most seem to gravitate towards. Brown has always been evident in interiors throughout the centuries, no matter the style of that time. In comparison to other neutrals such as gray or black, which were missing during certain periods, **brown** can be seen as a timeless color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
