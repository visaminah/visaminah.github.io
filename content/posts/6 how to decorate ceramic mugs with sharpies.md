## 6 Fun Facts How To Decorate Ceramic Mugs With Sharpies | How To Write On Ceramic Mugs
-   After 24 hours, put your **mugs** in a cold oven on a cookie sheet. Then start preheating the oven to 425 degrees. Some other Sharpie mug methods say 350 or 375, but the hotter the oven, the more the original white glaze will melt and allow your Sharpie paint to set in, so I like to bake my **mugs** at 425. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I used my Silhouette Cameo to cut out text from a scrap of adhesive vinyl. You can also use stickers, but I wanted a specific phrase, so I made mine custom. ðŸ™‚ (By the way, if I had to do this again I would use a thicker font; in the finished **mugs** the font is totally legible through the polka dots, but itâ€™s not super obvious from far away.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wow, four different designs all in a striking gold metallic color make this set of **mugs** special and unique. The combination of dots, triangles, herringbone and lace give them a modern look. This set of **mugs** would make a wonderful gift for someone who appreciates a personalized item. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the oven is done pre-heating and has reached 425 degrees, leave the **mugs** in the oven and set a timer for 30 minutes. As the **mugs** bake, the paint may start to smell. The smell is normal, but you can open a window or turn on a fan to help air out your kitchen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once these **mugs** are baked, you can definitely hand wash them in warm, soapy water. The paint doesnâ€™t come off if you lightly scratch at it with your nail, and it wonâ€™t come off with handwashing either. I have tried these in the top rack of the dishwasher as well, and they were still fine when the dishwasher was done! (The dishwasher definitely puts more wear and tear on the mug, so I donâ€™t know how well the paint will hold up years from now. For the longevity of the paint, I suggest handwashing the **mugs**, but if you need to throw them in the dishwasher, theyâ€™ll still survive!) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using initials on your **mugs** can help keep things straight when it comes to whoâ€™s mug it is in the morning. No more arguements over who didnâ€™t clean their mug or which mug of coffee is yours. Using a gold metallic Sharpie makes the initial on this design really pop! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
