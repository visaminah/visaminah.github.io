## 5 Things About What Color Quarter Round Should I Use | How To Paint Quarter Round
-   Installed the floor and painted the cabinets because of a stagger's recommendations in preparation to sell the house. I don't know how to finish this though. Do I just use the Golden Oak to finish it off? Do I use white trim and **quarter** **round**? I know I can get **quarter** **round** in the same color as the floor, should I use that? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both types of trim moldings start as long **round** dowels that are then rip-cut and milled into their respective shapes. They are stocked in very long lengths and racked vertically at the home improvement store or lumber center. This extra-long length is so that you can use full-length pieces to cover most walls. Although you can join shorter pieces to cover a long wall using scarf joints, most carpenters try to avoid this since full-length pieces give the wall a smoother look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another way to think of **quarter**-**round** molding is to imagine a **round** dowel. From the end, the dowel is cut into four pie pieces. Each resulting piece would be a **quarter**-**round**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Carpenters like to use these bottom trim pieces because they reduce the need for complicated baseboard scribe cuts. Professionals like to attach shoe molding with a nail gun rather than with glue. Nailing ensures a snug, consistent fit and allows you to access the area underneath the trim if necessary. If you're new to trim installation, the best tool for nailing shoe molding or **quarter**-**round** is an electric brad nailer. This tool will automatically set or recess the small finish nails you need for **quarter**-**round** trim, and can greatly speed up your work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's up to you if you want to paint **quarter**-**round** before installing the trim—there's no right or wrong way. Most carpenters like to finish the long trim pieces before measuring, cutting, and installing them—either by painting or applying stain and varnish. This is considerably easier than trying to finish the **quarter**-**round** or shoe molding after it is nailed in place. Some touch-up work will be needed after the trim is installed, but this can be done with a brush. The only downside of pre-finishing is that you may have nail holes you'll need to fill in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
