## 8 Interesting Facts How To Build A Bug Net In Terraria | Terraria: How To Fish In Lava? Simple Guide
-   Towns with NPC characters increase the chance for certain bugs to spawn, and fireflies are one of the best bugs to catch with this method. You'll need to **build** a few structures to create a town and then get NPCs to live inside of your newly built houses. Fireflies spawn throughout the surface; however, they don't spawn inside of a **build**ing, so you'll have to journey outside of your structures during the night to catch them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That’s just about everything concerning Duke Fishron in Terraria. He is a difficult boss with a decent array of attacks that each hit harder and faster the longer the fight goes on. Try your best to keep up with him and **build** a sufficient arena around the ocean to ensure you have enough room to maneuver. Since his fight is relatively difficult, try to fight him after facing Plantera to ensure you have the best options for the fight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Short Grass Long Grass Dirt piles Spawn limit 0.25% chance per tile 0.5% chance per tile 16.67% chance per tile 5 **terraria** fandom - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can increase their spawn rate by constructing a high platform. Since terrestrial creatures will have no place to appear, you’ll see more Fireflies emerging. When catching them, try to **build** interconnected platforms or use wings to expedite the process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And, for the better potions, you should be doing Angler quests. It's a pain in the damn ass to make an artificial fishing spot for some places, like Underground Tundra or Sky Lakes but the more quests you do, the more bait you **build** up, the better accessories you find, and finally the better rod you'll get so you can fish up important potion fish like Armored Cavefish (for a potion that reduces damage by 10%) http://creativegametheory.com/ Tower Defense Game ~ Greenlit on Steam!@~! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like most insects, you'll need to have a bug net with you to catch fireflies. You can use fireflies for fishing, and although they aren't particularly common, **build**ing a town is a great method for farming them. Since fireflies are a light source, you'll have no problem spotting them at night. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Certain bugs are more likely to spawn in towns with NPC characters, and fireflies are one of the greatest bugs to collect with this strategy. To develop a town, you’ll need to construct a few structures and then recruit NPCs to dwell in your freshly constructed homes. Fireflies spawn all over the surface, but they don’t spawn inside **build**ings, so you’ll have to venture outdoors at night to collect them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
