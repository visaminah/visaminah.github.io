-   Water-based paints are simple to clean up, as all you need is a warm, damp cloth. Oil-based paint **pens** are harder to clean up, as you will require chemicals to remove them.

Be careful when working with chemicals as you do not want to damage the **wood**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

We recommend that you try testing out your pen on an off-cut of the **wood** to see if it will work properly. You could also be causing the paint to bleed by pressing the pen too hard, as pressing down on the tip causes more paint to be released. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
