## 6 Fun Facts 2-Way Vs 3 Way Vent Register | Residential Sidewall/Ceiling Registers & Grilles
-   Having your **register**s in the ceiling frees up floor space and gives you more options for arranging your furniture. Ceiling air **register**s are also less prone to debris buildup than floor **register**s. Even so, you’ll need to climb up and clean your ceiling air **register**s once a year to keep them efficient and maintain your indoor air quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Floor **register**s are typically placed under windows to let the warm air they deliver mix with the cool air coming from the windows. Near an interior wall is another common location. Depending on the location of your air handler, if you want floor **register**s, you might also need to build a duct chase under the floor, which will increase the cost and complexity of installation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Over a window, with the **register** directed to blow air toward the window, is a popular location for ceiling **register**s. Less often, a ceiling **register** is placed near an interior wall so that it blows toward the wall opposite the door or toward the room’s biggest window. This placement requires less ducting than a **register** over the window, making it a little cheaper to install. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **register**s are tricky to install and connecting the ducts to them is a challenge even for a professional. When you’re upgrading an existing heating and cooling system, wall **register**s might not be an option unless you’re also doing extensive remodeling. In most existing homes, you’ll have to choose between either floor or ceiling **register**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wall **register**s are positioned either low on the interior walls in cold climates or high on the interior walls in hot climates. Unlike ceiling **register**s, high wall **register**s don’t blow air directly down on you. Instead, the air they deliver flows across the upper part of the room and mixes with the room air. As this air moves, it draws room air up toward it, which improves air circulation even more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you live in a climate where you need heating more often than cooling, floor **register**s are usually the most logical choice. Warm air naturally rises. When your warm air comes from the floor, it heats the room as it rises toward the ceiling. Place your **register**s on the ceiling, however, and much of your warm air will pool in the upper part of the room where it won’t do you much good. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
