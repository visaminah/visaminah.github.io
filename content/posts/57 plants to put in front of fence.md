Roses do best in full sun and well-drained, fertile, loamy soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Euonymus is a flowering woodland plant that is also known as the wintercreeper that is generally a small tree or evergreen shrub.

-   Chocolate vines are named so due to their dark purple flowers. This perennial vine is known as a great addition to backyard **fence**s for extra privacy. It will tolerate shade but grows best in full sun. While it is native to Japan and Korea, it has naturalized through much of North America. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'The best options for driveway greenery are **plants**, hedges or trees that are resilient to weather changes and able to grow off hardscapes such as concrete, gravel or paving stones' advises Kane Hughes, from MyJobQuote (opens in new tab). 'These include hardy geraniums, succulent **plants**, fragrant lavender or thyme and bay trees. If you are in the countryside, consider maintaining a garden and growing organic fruits and berries instead. If you are not an avid gardener, opt for the ‘less is more’ approach and choose only two potted varieties that frame your doorway'. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This ornamental evergreen shrub is commonly called the red tip photinia because of the striking, fiery red leaves that change to a dark green as the seasons change. It is very low-maintenance and has great aesthetic appeal when planted near any **fence** line or used as a solo privacy screen. Red tip photinias grow 6 to 12 feet in height and grow well in zones 7 through 9. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Any well-drained soil Soil pH: Acidic, neutral, slightly alkaline Enticingly sweet-scented and pleasing to pollinators, butterfly bushes are also easy to grow throughout the South. Plant in full sun in average soil (heavy clay soils could use amending to improve drainage). Choose a dwarf type if you want a more compact shrub; otherwise expect your butterfly bush to grow up to 12 feet tall. These **plants** appreciate moisture but are drought-tolerant once established. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, you might be worried that if you plant a climber it will be up the **fence**, over the roof and heading for next door in no time. It depends on the climber. These five are ideal for **fence**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This type of climber uses roots to clasp onto vertical surfaces. Unlike the other climbing **plants** it does not need to wrap around an object to grow. Ivy and Hydrangea seemannii are common types of aerial root climbing **plants**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These pretty trees, with colorful, fragrant blooms, make one of the best **fence**s for your yard. However, do give them full sun and yearly pruning. Also, remember to remove dead branches to encourage better growth and healthy flowering. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Privet is fast-growing – offering you the privacy you need. It’s perfect for **fence** lining. When given proper care, the hedge can grow 2 to 3 feet each year. You’ll need to prune and water it regularly. Every spring, the plant produces a thick cover of sweet-smelling flowers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a plethora of privacy **plants** out there. Look at what you have for growing conditions at the moment, consider what you want (fully enclosed backyard versus partial privacy), and do your research before buying. You can do some beautiful things with a well-maintained and thoroughly researched privacy hedge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light, well-drained Soil pH: Acidic While some azaleas are petite, Southern Indica hybrids such as 'Formosa' can grow as big as a bus. The short picket **fence** in front tames the azalea just a bit while also framing the blossoms in spring while the shrub is in bloom. After that, the **fence** will help define space. You can create the same sort of effect with other vigorous spring-flowering shrubs such as forsythias, spiraeas, loropetalums, mock oranges, flowering quinces, and weigelas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Working with these **plants** is tricky as the thorns show no mercy. You will need to make sure that you wear thick leather gloves and other appropriate safety equipment. Children and pets must be kept well away from them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although the initial planting and training may seem like a lot of effort, the results are definitely worth it. Most climbers are rapid-growing so you get fast gratification for your exertions. Take care of your climbing **plants** and you will have many years of enjoyment in return! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   OK, it may seem an unnecessary distinction but rambling roses are different from climbing roses. Yes, really. And it’s the climbers you want for a **fence** as most ramblers are just far FAR too vigorous and will climb to the tops of trees given half a chance. So check the tags. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although many climbing **plants** need something to wrap around, it doesn’t mean you can’t grow climbing **plants** if you have solid panels. If you do want to give them a little extra help, consider adding some wire or a trellis topper. Alternatively, the Canterbury Combi panel has a built in slatted style **fence** topper which is useful for growing climbing **plants**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Known as the queen of climbers, clematis is a lovely grower when planted near **fence**s, trellises, or arbors. Its blossoms are purple, pink, blue or white, and they create a rich tapestry of color. These lovely **plants** grow upward and not out, making them perfect for even gardens that are quite small. Fencing is the perfect thing for these flower vines to climb upwards on, and even better when they spill over the top in their lovely royal purple shade. Clematis grows best in zones 4 through 9 and will perform best in full sunlight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bamboo is one of the world’s fastest-growing **plants**, so it may quickly grow into a lush and exotic privacy screen. To keep it under control, choose a bamboo type that spreads slowly and forms clumps, or plant it in raised containers. It adds an elegant and beautiful look to any type of landscape design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mesquite is a very effective perimeter plant, but it can be invasive. Young **plants** are fast-growing, and the shoots will spread rapidly and crowd out other plantings. As the shrub matures, its growth slows, and fewer thorns adorn the branches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pruning is an integral part to keep the timber **fence** in top condition. It's essential that climbing **plants** are pruned and maintained to ensure the timber **fence** is kept in good condition. If **plants** are left they could create in-ground conditions and disqualify you from our 25 year guarantee. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Good **fence**s make good neighbors, especially when combined with beautiful blooms. Rose-purple azaleas draped over a white picket **fence** create an iconic picture of spring in the South, while sweet-scented climbing roses are a welcome sight in summer. If you're looking to add charm to your own **fence**, here are our favorite easy-to-grow flowers and flowering shrubs for every season. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll want to start by planning what you want out of a privacy border. And the first aspect to look at is the level of privacy you need. Do you want complete coverage or is something you can still sort of see through okay? That will determine the type of **plants** you use and their spacing. Some **plants** only grow four feet tall, while others can go far higher. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   They come in a huge range of colours and all the best have a fabulous fragrance. Look for the five star scent rating on labels and for names like ‘Old Spice’, ‘Fragrantissima’ and ‘Old Fashioned’. You always used to have to grow your own sweet peas from seed but not any more. Garden centres now stock **plants** in the spring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here is a guide to some choice **plants** that will add interest to your garden (and the **fence**). If you go to the bottom of the first page, there are a list of evergreen shrubs. You should have some of the border planted with evergreens to disguise the **fence**, though having some deciduous shrubs as well, particularly those that have nice berries or bark in the winter, will add some interest and texture to the garden. One plant that is not on the list, Euonymus kiautschovicus 'Manhattan', is a semi-evergreen to evergreen shrub that is dense and covers a **fence** very well, without growing very deep. It can be clipped like a hedge if you want to have a more formal appearance, or just to control size. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Holly comes in lovely colors, shapes, and sizes – as tall trees, dense shrubs, or climbers. The plant has signature sharp, spiny leaves and red berries during fall and winter. Its white flowers during spring further enhance the beauty of any yard. This living **fence** can adapt to a range of growing conditions, including tropic and temperate zones. If you’re looking to prevent wandering wild animals in your yard, holly is a good choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Poet Robert Frost said it best, “Good **fence**s make good neighbors.” But, barricading ourselves behind 8-ft. walls isn’t very practical, and in some cases, your homeowner’s association (HOA) may not even allow that, but creating a private oasis with **plants** may be the solution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just about the only variety whose **plants** and seeds are easy to find is called ‘Heavenly Blue’ – and it’s exactly that. And it twines its stems around anything. Grows to around 2-3m tall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Well-drained but moist Soil pH: Mildly acidic to alkaline This tropical vine is grown as a summer annual in much of the South, trained to grow along **fence**s and frame trellises. Mandevilla prefers moist, well-drained soil and doesn't blink an eye at hot, humid, or coastal conditions. It can be grown year-round in USDA hardiness zones 10 and 11, where it may appreciate some afternoon shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Long before the advent of electronic security systems, **plants** were used as “biological razor wire” to protect homesteads from marauding outsiders, or as livestock enclosures. By strategically planting thorny, spiky, dense bushes or hedging, you can create an effective barrier to deter intruders without compromising the look of your landscape. Many ornamental shrubs have vicious thorns or spiny foliage, and with careful placement, they can add a layer of security to your home without resorting to barbed wire or expensive fencing.

-   Set the scene with a wooden decked pathway leading up to front door. This rustic wooden design infilled with pebbles offers a softer approach to a front garden path, rather than paving slabs and brick alternatives. The look can be soften even further with thoughtful planting either side of the path with wild overgrown foliage, **plants** and lavender. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Fouquieria genus contains 11 species of semi-succulent desert **plants**, and includes the bizarre-looking boojum tree, F. columnaris – often described as resembling something straight out of a Dr. Seuss book. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fertile, well-drained, moist Soil pH: Acidic, neutral, alkaline This native vine's cheerful yellow blooms appear just as spring is beginning to warm the garden. Carolina jessamine grows upward very quickly, but when planted away from trees and structures it will gracefully drape over a **fence** or arbor. Plant in full or part sun, and try to limit pruning in fall so you'll have loads of flowers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are very few **plants** that ooze charm more than the faithful Wisteria plant, a deciduous climber with large pinnate, dark green leaves and drooping racemes up to 1m in length. The fragrant lilac flowers, which bloom in early summer, add a flourish of colour while offering a floral scent to welcome you through the front door. It's important to prune wisteria to control the size and prevent it growing into guttering and windows. Pruning also encourages the growth of the flower buds. Wisteria is best used where it they can grow freely, unimpeded by other branches or foliage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moist, well-drained clay or loam Soil pH: Acidic, neutral, alkaline Don't rein in the magic when spring and summer-blooming hydrangeas put on a boisterous show. Granted, folks will be jealous, but share a bloom and they'll soon get over it. Try hydrangeas such as 'Nikko Blue,' 'Endless Summer,' 'Little Lime,' 'Ruby Slippers,' 'Incrediball,' 'Bobo,' 'Quick Fire,' and 'Bluebird.' Provide full morning sun and afternoon shade, planting in fertile soil along a sturdy split-rail or picket **fence** for the best display. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Well-drained, tolerates clay Soil pH: Acidic, neutral, alkaline Unlike walls, most **fence**s aren't solid, so **plants** don't have to choose one side or the other. Perennials and reseeding annuals can start out on one side, spread by roots or seeds through the pickets, and bloom for you on the other side too. Black-eyed Susans are great for this. Other good choices include asters, bearded irises, bee balms, daylilies, four o'clocks, goldenrods, mums, phlox, purple coneflowers, Queen Anne's lace, and spider flowers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fertile, well-drained Soil pH: Acidic If you live on a shady lot, camellias are the obvious choice for a **fence** planting that will wow the neighbors. Camellias can be fall or winter-blooming, with some growing into small shrubs and others developing into attractive evergreen trees. Plant in acidic, fertile, well-drained soil in part shade and you won't need to provide much more than a light pruning after it flowers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Beautiful **plants** for **fence** lines can make your yard look straight out of a magazine cover. And, they can give you privacy. We have some fantastic low-maintenance **plants** for the **fence** line that will add to your curb appeal and camouflage an otherwise boring **fence**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nicknamed the “aristocrat of hedging **plants**,” the boxwood is famously found in many formal gardens, often carved into geometric shapes or even topiaries. Its crisp, high hedges make it perfect for **fence** lining or as a privacy hedge, serving as a type of fencing itself due to the fact it keeps its foliage all year. This evergreen shrub grows well in hardiness zones 5 through 8. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Plants should be pruned each season after flowering. Pruning climbing **plants** involves tying in new growth, trimming back long shoots and removing any dead shoots. If necessary, you can then trim back excess growth to keep the plant tidy. After pruning, mulch and feed your **plants**. It is important to prune at the right time, otherwise your plant may fail to bloom and thrive the following year. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The five foot depth suggests against using red maples or other trees. Even narrow ones will become deep over time and shade the yard (and your neighbor's yard). (Also, maples exude allelopathic chemicals through their root systems that inhibit plant growth so you will need to choose carefully what you grow underneath.) You could use some tall shrubs instead to disguise the **fence** and mix perennial and lower shrubs in front for color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This hardy low-maintenance plant grows well on a trellis or a **fence**. The thick screen of dark green foliage and the fragrant purple blooms during the early summer season add a lovely charm to your property. The plant requires regular pruning as it can spread pretty quickly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes, installing a **fence** is not an option for your yard. Or sometimes, it’s not enough to make your home look exclusive. You can utilize greenery to reflect your property lines. Plants do not just provide the much-needed privacy, they make your property charming too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take inspiration from meadows and wild areas of nature when setting out borders to hit the garden trends. Choose a selection of **plants**, varying in heights, colours and textures. To get the balance right, set the **plants** out in pots before committing to digging and planting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moist, well-drained, fertile Soil pH: Acidic This elegant shrub can grow anywhere from 6 feet tall to 20, depending on the species, but viburnums have in common beautiful white snowball or lacecap blooms and lovely fall color. The Chinese snowball viburnum is popular for the huge, hydrangea-like blossoms it bears in spring. Plant viburnum at the **fence**line so the flowerheads can droop over and delight the neighbors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Often when you move into a new house or a newly renovated rental property, the builders have very thoughtfully **fence**d the garden. OK, it’s probably an ugly old chain link wire **fence**, but at least it keeps the dogs in (or out). Or perhaps you’ve moved into an older property and the **fence**s are falling down or the previous people never thought to plant climbers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Known as America’s fastest-growing hedge, the privet can grow up to 3 feet each year, averaging a height of 8 to 12 feet at its maturity. This makes the privet the perfect privacy hedge for **fence** lines, or even to be used in lieu of a **fence** altogether – hence the common term “privet **fence**.” The privet is an exceptionally popular plant addition to any **fence** line because of its highly attractive, dark green foliage. It will grow well in zones 4 through 8. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And remember to take into account the level of upkeep the living privacy **fence** will require. Though all living **fence**s will need some upkeep, options like shrubbery will need regular trimming to maintain a clean look. If you’re not willing to spend a lot of time with your yard, you might choose options that don’t require regular trimming seasons, like willow trees or cactus. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Loamy or average, moist Soil pH: Acidic, neutral, alkaline Trumpet vine's exuberant flowers may look tropical, but these **plants** are hardy in most of the South. In fact, the native version, Campsis radicans, can be grown in USDA zones 4–10. Grow these **plants** in average soil in full sun (non-native species prefer loam), and prune established vines back hard each year to keep the growth under control. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fertile, moist, well-drained Soil pH: Neutral, slightly alkaline Some favor clematis for the mailbox, but these vining **plants** are even more charming growing along a **fence**. Initially you'll need to use wire or twine to attach it loosely, until the vine builds its own scaffolding to scramble up. Clematis blooms best in full sun, but prefers a bit of shade around its feet, which can be provided by the **fence** itself or by other plantings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
