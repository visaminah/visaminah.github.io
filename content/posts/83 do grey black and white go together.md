In Sweden, it is connected with bureaucracy and boredom. Inga-lill Cras - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Individuals with such a preference (black and **white**) tend to resolve issues thru crisis, thru unmeditated sudden actions. Individuals going thru puberty, hospitalized children, and head of corporations tend more toward such preferences (what a group!). Regards, Mac - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you feel that monochromatic colour schemes are just too simple for your styling you can add just a touch of another colour without spoiling the effect. This is always best achieved with a natural colour, for example some timber or terracotta, as in the image above. Elements of gold and copper work well too with a black and **white** colour palette. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The options here are limitless; just look at the list of tried-and-true favorites above. Another easy way to think about pairing **grey** with colours – pair lighter shades of **grey** with darker-toned colours, and darker **grey**s with colours in softer hues. Of course, this isn’t a strict rule, but having this contrast can help guarantee an outfit that is balanced and well put together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Colour trends come and go.

It can be difficult to keep up so you should opt for what you like. However there are two colours that are always in fashion – black and **white**. How we use them changes, but there is no doubt that this classic partnership can work in so many different settings and is always on trend. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like all colors, gray can evoke a particular emotional tone when it is used in painting or design. The idea that gray is little more than a combination of black and **white** and evokes feelings of gloom and melancholy misses the mark. Just as in life, the gray area offers an expansive range of possibilities for emotional and symbolic expression. What you can evoke with a shade of gray depends on its hue and the colors that accompany it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The colors **white** and black are not usually thought of as shades of gray, but they can be thought of as shades of achromatic gray, as both contain equal amounts of red, blue and green. White is at the extreme upper end of the achromatic value scale and black is at the extreme lower end of the achromatic value scale, with all the colors normally considered tones of achromatic gray colors in between. Since achromatic colors have no hue, the hue code (h code) is left blank for achromatic colors (usually marked as a dash). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Achromatic grays are colors in which the RGB (red, green, and blue) values are exactly equal. Since achromatic grays have no hue, the hue code (the h in the hsv values of the color) is indicated with a dash. Achromatic grays are the axis of the color sphere, with **white** at the north pole and black at the south pole of the color sphere. The various tones of achromatic gray are along the axis of the color sphere from **white** at the top of the axis to black at the bottom of the axis. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Interior designer Chris Carroll of TLC Interiors says the best thing you can do is explore multiple shades of red before settling on one. “Maroons, magentas, burnt oranges and other similar shades won’t look so aggressive,” writes Chris on his website. “A **grey** wall can help tone down bright red, and less is generally more.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purple may not be an obvious choice when looking for what goes with **grey**, but when combined produces a very pleasing look. Different shades of purple combined with different shades of **grey** can create looks for every season – a lighter **grey** with a lavender shade of purple would work well in summer, or a darker shade of **grey** with a rich, royal purple will accommodate those colder months. Whichever shade you choose, adding purple is another fun way to brighten up the neutral tones of **grey**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black and **white** are, in fact, shades. They are devoid of color. So we would actually refer to black and **white** as an achromatic color scheme. In between the brightest **white** and the deepest black are countless shades of gray. Shades of black? Shades of **white**? You could technically name it any of those, but you get the picture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With such an array of styles, it is no wonder that jeans are one of the most widely worn clothing items. Jeans have been popular for decades – durable and fashionable, providing a canvas of endless opportunities. Everyone has a favorite pair, and the good news is – they all go great with **grey**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue is another color that was made to go with **grey**. A versatile color – in countless shades – sure to provide you with limitless options. Blue and **grey** are two cool tones that go together, so naturally, it is difficult to get this pairing wrong. We’ve already covered navy blue – which is a perfect choice for balancing with contrast, but light pastel and medium sky blue hues can create looks just as pleasing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing lighter shades of **grey** to go with the blackest of blacks will give you a classic look. On the other hand – when pairing darker charcoal with black – don’t forget you can always add a pop of color here too for interest. A colourful or patterned scarf, tie, or shoes are just a few options to complete and balance a darker outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grey is one of the most popular colours in interior design owing to its versatility and the myriad of shades available. Pale and lilac-toned **grey**s are used in cool Scandinavian homes, deep graphite **grey**s can be moody and romantic in traditional settings, whilst the beige-toned 'greige' is the go-to shade for minimalists. Whether you're decorating your living room or renovating a bathroom, **grey** is always a safe choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The point though that I want to convey here is the importance of tonal variation in such a simple scheme.

This combination will give you a light and airy feel to your decorating scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is all very well and good knowing how to use different shades of gray in a painting, but the essence of this article is to show you how to make these different shades yourself.

The first involves simply combining black and **white**, the second involves using primary shades, and the third uses complementing colors to create a variety of gray hues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black is the absence of color and **white** is the blending of all colors. Can you suggest a simple way to demonstrate or prove this to a young child ?

You won't get a jet black, but I think the point will be clear. J Hope - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Jeans come in all colors these days, but classically they belong to the blue family, and as explained above, blue is a perfect match for **grey**. Jeans come in all sorts of washes, from very dark – navy to acid washed – basically **white**, all hues complemented beautifully with a **grey** tank, blouse, or sweater. Jeans paired with a **grey** top can make up an outfit for any occasion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   White is a color, the perception of which is evoked by light that stimulates all three types of color sensitive cone cells in the human eye in equal amounts and with high brightness compared to the surroundings. A **white** visual stimulation will be void of hue and grayness. White is the lightest possible color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you opt for an all-**grey** outfit, you have the perfect backdrop for any statement piece you want to show off. A large pendant necklace would garner attention over a soft **grey** sweater, and a bright belt or pair of shoes would be an invited pop of color to an otherwise neutral outfit. Grey is the perfect companion for any bold accessory – it will highlight the special item instead of stealing the show. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are uncertain of how dark you want your gray paint to be, it is best to begin with your **white** paint and add small drops of black incrementally. As they always say, it is much easier to add more black than to take it away. Black is the stronger of the two colors, and you only need a touch of black to darken your gray significantly, but a lot of **white** to lighten it by a small amount. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black and **white** colors combined do make a gray and are known as neutral gray. However, this does tend to make a dull and flat, basic gray. Sometimes, the simple addition of **white** and black can create a muddy and less appealing gray color. So, what colors make gray brighter and cleaner? Try adding orange and blue for a warm and cool hue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grey pants are a great item to have in your wardrobe. Neutral and versatile, yet still providing an edgy and unique look. As a general guideline, pairing darker **grey** pants with lighter colored tops – and vice-versa – will always give you pleasing results. However, because of its flexibility, there aren’t too many restrictions that need to be put on what colors to pair with **grey** pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pairing **grey** with other neutral tones can give you a very sleek outcome and shouldn’t be overlooked. Don’t think that the lack of color will make any outfit boring.

Sometimes, less really is more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another match for **grey** that can’t be ignored is yellow. The most cheerful color on the spectrum is the perfect match for the muted tone that **grey** provides. The neutral **grey** can help tone down a very bright shade of yellow; in contrast, a sunny shade of yellow can provide the perfect lift to a toned-down **grey**. With so many possibilities, try and choose shades that complement each other well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   01 of 21 What Goes with Gray? Kim Cornelison Far from boring, gray is the neutral of choice for many designers. More complex than cream or **white** (and typically not as yellow or glaring), gray comes in a variety of shades and tints to provide a soothing backdrop or set the perfect scene to showcase an accent color. Whether mixed with a dab of black, green, or blue, the range of grays and possible color palettes are endless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   There are several combinations that make gray shades. The most basic color combination to create gray is black and **white**, but there are many other options.

Grey can handle the brightest brights and loudest prints and still create a well-put-together look. Even outfits in varying shades of **grey** will be sophisticated and well-balanced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But what happens if you add too much of one color, for example, blue. Simply add in colors that lean towards warmer or lighter colors. Add in identical, tiny amounts of **white** and orange to your blue-gray paint. The orange will make it brighter, while the **white** will lighten the color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grey belongs in the “neutral” category, which means it can go with almost any other colour. It comes in many different shades, which adds to its versatility and ability to coordinate well with other muted or neutral tones, as well as with bold pops of colour. For these reasons, **grey** is an irreplaceable addition to the base collection of any wardrobe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once again, combine your orange and blue in equal parts to produce a lovely cool and quite dark gray shade. Ultramarine blue is a little warmer than the other two, so the gray you will get from it and cadmium orange will be slightly more muted. If you want your gray to be even darker, use a darker shade of blue. If you want to lighten your gray, you can add a touch of **white**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   16 of 21 Chic Gray Color Scheme Emily Followill Soft Gray + Hot Pink Hot pink is a standout against warm gray walls and **white** linen.

-   At the other end of the tonal scale, you may opt to simply use the dark **grey**s and black for your scheme which creates an entirely different mood.

Sticking with fashion, black, gray, and **white** became popular during the Renaissance and Baroque periods, specifically in Italy, Spain, and France. During this time, gray was also used in paintings. A painting technique named grisaille stands out in this case as it involves working with gray monochrome colors, mostly in intimate sculpture pieces. Gray was and is also used as a background color for skin tones, used to create highlights. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A simple combination of black and **white** is a neutral color, however, when using complementary or primary colors, you can affect the color bias.

-   11 of 21 Eclectic Gray Color Scheme Robert Brinson Weathered Gray + White Walls + Vibrant Brights Gray makes a beautiful backdrop for bolder colors. Here, **white** walls and quiet washes of gray on doors and window sashes take a backseat to the vibrant kaleidoscope of color supplied by the room's rug and hot fuchsia accents. To maintain interest elsewhere (and refrain from competing with the rug), the designer layered weathered and woven textures in furnishings and accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thanks to its neutrality, **grey** is also the perfect choice when you want to add something bold to your outfit. Since it is subtle on its own, a bold or bright print can work wonderfully with a solid **grey** item. It also pairs well with textured materials – such as a chunky knit or fabric in a patterned weave. This neutral tone can even help you get away with a unique or unusual cut that could come across as tacky or unfashionable in another color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Monochromatic black and **white** palettes also work well for wallpaper and textile designs as this combination gives a very classic look. The appeal is in the simplicity as you can get away with using more elaborate designs when you have a plain colour palette. The pretty design in this wallpaper works well as it is partnered with strong blocks of **white** and black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Toned-down shades of **grey** can make some otherwise “out there” garments acceptable. A plunging neckline or open back will look much posher in a neutral tone than a bright color. The neutral **grey** tone can also bring a more conservative feel to a super-short mini dress or pair of pants with cut-outs down the leg. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I'm geographically located in Hawaii. When I hear the word "**grey**", what comes to mind is "in the middle". For example, "**grey** market" is something that could be or couldn't be illegal. "**grey**" also make me feel that something's not clear to me. It's kinda like the "I'm trying to think but nothing happens" syndrome, where your mind come to a complete blank. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The child of prominent parents black and **white**, gray can be professional, modern, sophisticated, and sleek. It’s neutral and unemotional but makes the perfect backdrop for bright and vibrant colors. Gray is versatile because when the script calls for it, it can also evoke gloom and hopelessness.

-   A garment in a solid **grey** tone provides the perfect complement for something bold or bright. In the right shade, **grey** can be paired with just about any pattern – floral, stripes, paisley, and more, or a fun texture – like leather, lace or even a metallic sheen. The neutrality of **grey** will tone down those louder items, keeping things sophisticated instead of coming across as gaudy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This first method is probably the easiest and most common way to create a shade of gray. If you want to know what two colors make gray, the answer is black and **white**. You simply need to combine equal parts of black and **white** paint, to create a lovely neutral shade of gray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can mix complementary and primary colors to create gray. For example, red and green, purple and yellow, or orange and blue. However, to lighten these colors, you will need to add **white**. If you use red, green, and yellow, you can also lighten the gray color using a lighter hue of yellow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink and **grey** is a long-standing favorite and another combination that is as versatile as there are shades of pink. Light pink can be paired with light **grey** for a very pleasing aesthetic. Or opt for brighter bubblegum pink for something fun and exciting. You can choose a **grey** accent piece for a predominantly pink outfit, or a pink accessory – such as a handbag – can provide the perfect pairing for an otherwise monochrome look. The options are endless with this combo. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first step in creating the ideal shade of black for your needs is understanding what black actually is. Black is the darkest hue we can perceive, created by a complete absence of light. It’s essentially the opposite of **white**, which appears at the other end of the spectrum. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **grey** top would also look great with any length skirt – mini, midi, or maxi. Keep it tight with a pencil skirt for business casual or opt for something fun and flowy for the weekend.

-   20 of 21 Art-Inspired Gray Color Scheme Brie Williams Antique Pewter + Historical Hues Every color scheme needs a starting point. For this dining room, antique artwork provided inspiration. Gray shades such as mushroom, khaki, blue-gray, and cream show up in the chandelier shades, sisal rug, and off-**white** trim. Striped chairs and a vibrant bouquet of orange dahlias play to the secondary colors in the artwork. Wallpaper in an oversized paisley pattern animates the soft gray walls without overpowering the art. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At right is displayed the color medium gray, or gray in the X11 color names, which is lighter than the HTML/CSS gray shown below. The coordinates in the X11 were set at 190 to avoid gray being displayed as **white** on 2-bit grayscale displays.[7] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The most popular and obvious of all these possibilities is the most simple of all – the classic and much loved black and **white** decorating palette. It is sophisticated and timeless. This colour combination is excellent to use for a classy Parisian feel or for a more contemporary look. The beauty is that a black and **white** palette lends itself to either a very traditional and classic way of decorating or a more modern cutting edge look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another downside of using this method is that you are typically limited to the black or **white** you have in your palette, again reducing the variety of gray shades that you can make. Finally, many shop-bought black shades have base colors like green which can begin to show through when mixed with **white**. As a result, you have little control over the final gray shade when using this method. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black and **white** works with pretty much any interior style. Remember that it is the mood you need to consider, rather than the style.

It may be trickier to figure out which shades work best together at first, but don’t give up! A little trial-and-error will eventually lead to an outstanding match. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black and **white** are technically not colors as they are used to create shades and tints of various other colors. A basic neutral gray is the combination of equal amounts of black and **white**. The shade can be determined by the amount of black or **white**. For example, more **white** will create a lighter shade of gray and vice versa.
