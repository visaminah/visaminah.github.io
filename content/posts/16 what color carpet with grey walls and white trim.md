## 16 Things You Should Know About What Color Carpet With Grey Walls And White Trim | Is gray paint going out of style? Here's what the color experts say...
-   'Display black and white photo prints in gold frames, and add pink as an accent in the **grey** interior. A pink pouffe, pink pillows, or a throw makes the perfect accessory and lends a softer side to your living room.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like with most things in the world, we need balance and equilibrium in our homes too. So if you're going to go for a dark **grey** living room – keep the floors light. Now, if you have wooden floorboards, you can either strip them back to a very light wood or try painting floorboards in a lighter, softer **grey**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use soft warm **grey**s and mix them with pastel decorating ideas for a pretty **grey** living room. Prevent it from feeling too sweet and sugary by accenting with darker, moodier shades seen here with black and white cushions and dark wood table. The result is a calm living room suitable for the whole family. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Repurpose your outdoor seating in an indoor space to get the most out of your purchase. We love this calming **grey** and white living room with shiplap walls and lots of indoor plants. Perfect for an all-year round botanical aesthetic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'Display your minimalist posters in black frames to create contrast with the **grey** walls. To maintain balance and a cozy vibe, add a **grey**-scale rug, or pillows in similar shades. A living room with a minimalist **grey** decor makes room for unique details and the motifs on the walls.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to add some more **grey** tones to your living room, this is a really easy and effective way to do so. Rather than go all out painting a **grey** accent wall, instead learn how to paint window frames. See how in this space the two tones of **grey** help bring out the cooler tones of the blue and complements the pale wood of the floors and ceiling also. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you can't decide between a beige room or a **grey** one, it's actually a perfect warm-toned color that combines the two hues. We love how it's been styled in this living room with splashes of sage green and pale mustard yellow. So what is the perfect greige shade? Well, we recommend Farrow and Ball (opens in new tab) Stony Ground. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink and **grey** where the color power couple for a moment back there, but we are loving this new, more grown up take on it. Mixing a pale, cooler **grey** with a lovely warm blush pink creates an almost neutral space, especially if paired with white walls and wooden furnishings as seen here. Add in a touch of muted light blue to bring out the cooler tones of the **grey**. Very chic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We actually did had a recent debate over is **grey** still in style? And the overwhelming majority said yes. Thank god, because it's our personal fave color to decorate with and we think it works in every room of the home. There is however a trend towards much warmer greigey **grey**s recently, so consider choosing a **grey** that has a more earthy undertone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grey living room ideas are just so classic. They suit any space and any style, which is precisely the reason why we have a whole gallery dedicated to them. Whether you are a lover of cool-toned **grey**s that work amazingly in minimal homes or, if you're keen to embrace the dark side with dark **grey** and deep charcoal hues for a cozy and enveloping finish – you'll be able to find the perfect shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can always warm up a **grey** living room with accessories too. Pick our warm wooden furniture, add in some cute rattan baskets, pick out cane lampshades too. Oh, and nice slubby linen cushions will help – check out H&M Home (opens in new tab) for our fave picks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to add a touch of luxury to a **grey** living room, velvet is the way to do it. The obvious choice is to go for a gorgeous **grey** velvet sofa, that will be the focus of your space. Opt for a deep charcoal – practical and pretty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'It’s a color in the neutral spectrum that references a contemplative state of mind and design. Not arresting nor aggressive, this understated yet glamorous **grey** creates a soothing, impactful common ground.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tash from Lick (opens in new tab) agrees: 'Cold, flat **grey**s are out and rich, warm **grey**s are in! The trend for a **grey** with warm or rich undertones changes the way we feel about them. Having a **grey** with a green undertone (like our Grey 07) makes you feel stable and brings energy to the room. Whilst Grey 03/04 which have a lavender undertone makes this neutral feel warm and full of life.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We all love on-trend colorful sofas but sometimes we want to keep it simple and uncomplicated. That’s where a **grey** sofa really comes into its own. It suits all styles of living room, from country cottage to industrial to contemporary, and anything in between. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'Display your black and white posters in a collage, and mix in oak frames to elegantly add wood details to the **grey** decor. Oak frames paired with other accessories, such as wooden side tables, brown leather pillows, and green plants, make a living room more lively while contributing an elegant balance.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
