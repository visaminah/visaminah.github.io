## 13 Interesting Facts Convert Cubic Feet To Linear Feet | Cubic Feet To Linear Inches
-   Cubic **feet** is actually another word for volume. So if you learned that in school, you can figure **cubic** **feet**. It is length times width times height. Here are a few things sold by the **cubic** foot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gravel – gravel is usually sold by the load or **cubic** **feet**. This is because it is usually poured into ditches, gaps, and patios. So the easiest way to figure how much gravel you need is to measure the **cubic** **feet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – another thing that is poured is water. Water is almost always measured in **cubic** **feet** if in large amounts. There isn’t any other good way to calculate how much water is needed or present. Stone – this is solid stone, as we already talked about gravel. Solid stone, marble, and other similar natural minerals are calculated in **cubic** **feet** because they are solid and surface area wouldn’t be useful knowledge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – there it is! Of course, boxes and containers are calculated by **cubic** **feet** because you need to know how much they will hold. This is how moving vans and even shipping containers are calculated. Plaster – plaster and even cement are usually calculated in **cubic** **feet**. Because sometimes, you need to cover a thin surface, and other times you need to put it on **feet** thick. So it needs to be calculated by the **cubic** foot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That’s a good way to remember which one is which. Linear is one measurement, the square is two measurements, and **cubic** is three measurements. This is a consistent way to keep them straight in your mind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Measure the length of one wall first. For a 10×10 room, this will be ten **feet**. This is a linear measurement. Then, you take that same wall and measure the height. This is another linear foot measurement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – this is solid stone, as we already talked about gravel. Solid stone, marble, and other similar natural minerals are calculated in **cubic** **feet** because they are solid and surface area wouldn’t be useful knowledge. Boxes – there it is! Of course, boxes and containers are calculated by **cubic** **feet** because you need to know how much they will hold. This is how moving vans and even shipping containers are calculated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is completely different than square **feet**. For example, the square footage of a 10×10 room is 100. But the linear footage of a 10×10 room is forty because each wall is ten **feet** long. Make sure you don’t confuse the two. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Square foot covers a surface area and is the most common type of measurement used in construction. It is two measurements, length times width. Here are a few things that are measured by square **feet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most paint covers about 350 sq **feet** a gallon. But you want to make sure you do two coats in most cases. So this room needs two gallons of paint as one gallon will do one coat. You can also buy pints for cheaper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Convert that number to **feet**, which is around 3×7. Do the same for windows. Let’s say you have two windows that are 3×5 for this example. Let’s use those three numbers to calculate our total in the next step. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are two general measurements used to sell materials. Square foot and linear foot. But another important measurement is the **cubic** foot, which measures the length, width, and height, rather than just one or two measurements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to calculating the linear **feet** of a room’s walls, you need to get that measuring tape out. Learning how to measure linear **feet** is quite easy. You simply measure the length of a wall. then, measure the length of the opposite wall in the same room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
