## 28 Tips for How To Prevent Outdoor Spigot From Freezing | How to Keep Outdoor Faucets From Freezing
-   Disconnect garden hoses, clean them, drain them, and store them indoors as outlined in step one above. Turn off the valve that supplies the hose bib with water. Next, open the outdoor valve to drain any remaining water from the line. Protect the outdoor **spigot** with a foam insulative cover. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fortunately, this fixture is easy to protect with a freezeproof faucet (aka a freezeless or frostproof hose bib, sill cock, or faucet). A standard hose faucet freezes because the supply pipe connect to the faucet outside the heated house. This exposes the water to **freezing** temperatures. A freezeproof faucet, ranging from 4 to 24 inches in length, extends back into the house, and its valve seat—where the water stops when the faucet is off—is all the way inside. So once the handle is turned off outside, the water never makes it farther than the warm side of the wall; any water trapped in between just drains out the faucet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Much like faucets and pipes, your outdoor fountain can freeze, causing anything from a small crack to significant structural damage. Its important fountains are fully drained before **freezing** temperatures hit your city. It’s a good idea to keep an eye on your weather forecast in your area, so you’re never caught off guard. To learn more about keeping your fountain safe, read our guide on How to Winterize Outdoor Fountains. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Normally, the atoms within liquids move around very quickly, creating a very flexible, fluid matrix. However, the cold can change that quickly, especially with water. Whenever the temperature outdoors dips to 32 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, the molecules within water slow down and can cling onto one another, forming a solid ice crystal. These crystals can spread quickly throughout the supply line or pipe, especially during prolonged periods of **freezing** weather. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a properly installed frost-free faucet, you shouldn’t need to winterize it. A frost-free faucet has a long stem and turns off the water well inside the wall, keeping the faucet from **freezing**. A properly installed frost-free faucet will have a slight downward pitch which allows water to drain out when the faucet is shut off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes, two wrongs really do make a right Some older houses in Minneapolis and Saint Paul don’t have a shutoff valve for the outside faucet, and the faucets never get winterized… yet they never have a problem with **freezing**. How can this be? Here’s a hint: On older houses with no insulation at the rim space, there can be so much heat loss occurring here that the outside faucets never get cold enough to freeze. I call this two wrongs making a right. It’s certainly not a reliable method of preventing freeze damage, but it can work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most Minnesota homeowners know it’s important to winterize the outside faucets to prevent them from **freezing**. Freeze damage can destroy the faucet or lead to a burst pipe, or both. The problem is that many people don’t quite get it right; winterizing the outside faucets in the fall seems like a simple thing to do, and it seems like it should be straightforward and easy, but there are a few tricks you need to know to really get it right. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   During cold spells, it also helps to keep the HVAC vents throughout your home open to circulate heated air. Keep cabinet doors and pantry doors open throughout the night when cold weather hits to give heated air the chance to warm walls where pipes may be housed. Open the faucets to fixtures on exterior walls to create a trickle that keeps water from **freezing**, while also alleviating internal pressure in case a freeze does occur. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many newer homes are built with frost free hose bibs. These bibs are designed with **freezing** weather in mind and contain a shutoff valve that is situated far within the home, where the temperature is common. The entire supply line is sloped downwards from the shutoff valve to the **spigot**, allowing gravity to push water out of the pipe if a freeze does occur. The outdoor faucet is also situated at more of an angle to prevent water from sitting within the **spigot**. If you don’t have frost free **spigot**s, ask a plumber to perform this upgrade before winter hits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even better? They do all the work for you. In fact, because frost-free **spigot**s are self-winterizing, you won’t need to go through all of those steps above (though you’ll still need to disconnect your hose). But what exactly are they? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many people think that only those in typically cold climates encounter problems with **freezing** pipes. That is actually a grave misconception. In reality, homes in warmer climates are more prone to iced pipes problems because they are often built and designed for warm climates. Hence, the pipes and plumbing are often exposed to the outdoors or are uninsulated against extremely **freezing** temperatures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Prevent frozen pipes by insulating **spigot**s and plumbing lines wherever you can. Styrofoam bib covers keep people from tampering with **spigot**s during the winter and insulate the space around the bib to keep water from **freezing**. These covers are inexpensive and easy to install, creating an added barrier between your **spigot** and the cold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Congratulations. You’ve completed the first and most basic method for winterizing your outdoor faucets. But there’s more you can and should do, which leads us to the frost-free **spigot**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   During cold weather, open any cabinet doors covering plumbing in the kitchen and bathroom. This allows the home's warm air to better circulate, which can help prevent the exposed piping from **freezing**. While this won't help much with pipes hidden in walls, ceilings, or under the home, it can keep water moving and limit the dangerous effects of **freezing** weather. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most faucet covers use one of two styles. Either they are made of rigid thermal foam with a flexible gasket along the edges, or they are flexible insulated bags that secure around the **spigot**s. If they are properly installed so that they seal tightly around the base of the faucet, either style provides good insurance against **spigot**s rupturing due to **freezing**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The frost free sill cock keeps the water inside your pipe from **freezing** by placing the outdoor faucet’s flow valve deeper into the house. By keeping the flow valve further away from the **freezing** cold outside, the chances for a burst pipe are greatly reduced. The anti-siphon valve of your frost free **spigot** will keep unsanitary hose water from backing into your pipes and contaminating your plumbing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should see the individual shutoff valves for each line leading to a faucet. If you don’t have individual shutoff valves, consider installing a hose bib, or sillcock. A frost-free sillcock runs inside the house where it’s warmer and prevents the water from **freezing** and causing damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Disconnect, drain and store all hoses. Next, close the shutoff valve on the **spigot**’s water line inside the house, and open the faucet to let the remaining water drain outside. Leave the faucet slightly open until you plan to use it again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most likely place for a frozen pipe is often right outside your front door. Exterior pipes, especially ones that provide water supply to outdoor **spigot**s, are very vulnerable to the cold if they aren’t appropriately prepared and protected. Use these steps to protect these lines. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How much value does one dripping faucet have? A lot, if it keeps your home's water pipes from bursting during frigid weather. Burst pipes are one of the most common causes of property damage during a bout of **freezing** temperatures, with homeowner claims averaging more than $10,000, says the Insurance Information Institute. The cost of a water leak from frozen pipes is even higher for business owners, where claims average about $27,000 but can occasionally reach into the millions, notes a Philadelphia Insurance Companies report. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Keep in mind that while there are specialty outdoor **spigot**s marketed as “freeze-proof,” there is no guarantee that these faucets will not freeze in the coldest weather. Even these faucets can benefit from outdoor faucet covers properly installed. Long term, though, installing freeze-proof **spigot**s is a good next step to avoiding problems. This is best done while the weather is still above **freezing**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A good starting point is to winterize outside faucets (hose **spigot**s). This is relatively easy to do with simple insulated covers that fit over the **spigot**s, which cost between $10 and $20 at home improvement centers. Installing these covers, along with performing a few simple winterizing procedures, can prevent outdoor faucets from rupturing due to **freezing**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Water pipes will burst from the pressure building within them. However, they won’t burst at the point of **freezing**. Protecting your exterior faucets results in protecting the pipes within your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit is the magic temperature that puts your faucets at risk. If you and your pipes and faucets are not ready when the cold weather hits, you could end up paying the plumber a lot of money to fix the water damage. Here’s how to keep your outdoor faucets from **freezing** in the winter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If temperatures are dipping below **freezing** and will be staying there, remember to drip your indoor faucets and leave your cabinet doors open in the kitchen and bathroom. Running water will prevent pipes from completely **freezing**. Leaving the doors cracked will allow warm air to reach your interior pipes and will prevent **freezing**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Built-up pressure in pipes during winter months can cause a pipe to burst or fracture at its weakest link. As the water in the supply line freezes, it expands, pushing against all the water between it and your home. Allowing a faucet to drip during extended **freezing** temperatures can help mitigate any potential trouble you may experience from a pipe **freezing**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your pipes are already on their merry way towards **freezing**, wrapping them with warm towels might do the trick. You can cover them with the towels first and then pour boiling water on top, or use already-wet towels -- if your hands can stand the heat (use gloves for this). This should help loosen the ice inside and get your system running again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A hairdryer (or heat gun) can be a godsend when your pipes are **freezing**. If hot rags aren't doing the trick, try blowing hot air directly on the pipes. Important note: You don't want to use a blow torch or anything that produces direct flames, which can damage your pipes and turn a frozen pipe into an even worse disaster. You're trying to melt the ice -- not your pipes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
