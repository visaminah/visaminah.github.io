## 46 Things You Should Know About Turning On Water Line To Fridge | What to Do When Your Fridge Water Line Fails
-   : The shutoff valve for a dishwasher is generally located inside a lower kitchen cabinet, and may even be under the kitchen sink, depending on the proximity of the dishwasher to the sink in the kitchen layout. Turn off this valve before repairing or replacing the dishwasher to avoid flooding the kitchen. Refrigerator : Not all refrigerators have a water **line**, but for those that do, the shutoff valve is typically located behind the refrigerator. Simply pull the **fridge** out from the wall to access the shutoff valve before you move, disconnect, or replace the refrigerator. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To test your water valve for an electrical failure, locate the valve near the bottom of the **fridge**. You’ll want to check the continuity of the valve solenoid coils by using a digital or an analog multimeter. Here’s a step-by-step guide on testing your water valve for electrical failure: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Installing the new **fridge** water **line** is straightforward. Simply thread one end of the new water **line** through the shut-off valve located under the sink or behind the **fridge**. Attach the other end of the new water **line** to the intake valve located behind the refrigerator. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An ice maker can start to show signs it needs servicing when you see ice cubes that are smaller than average or ice that has a lot of extra frost on them. Sometimes there is a large chunk of ice that is blocking the **line**. Other times, you may notice there is no ice being made at all. Any of these symptoms show that an icemaker is in trouble, which means it’s time to troubleshoot the issue and find a solution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If any water droplets form, tighten up the nuts. Re-examine the shut-off and intake valves. Be sure to avoid standing in water puddles that may have formed during the water **line** replacement task. If the floor is completely dry, it is safe to plug in the refrigerator. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So, you’ve finally got that refrigerator with ice maker that you’ve always wanted. What’s the problem? There’s no water **line** that runs to the refrigerator! Don’t worry. Running a water **line** is something that many homeowners are capable of doing themselves, without spending money on a professional. Here’s how. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your refrigerator stores dinner leftovers and keeps food fresh for your family’s next meal, making it one of the most important appliances in your home. Whether upgrading from an old model or installing a brand new one, you will need to install a water supply **line** to enjoy crisp water and ice. Get an idea of how to install a new **line** on your own by reviewing the guide below, then dive into your model’s installation instructions for full details. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   : Not all refrigerators have a water **line**, but for those that do, the shutoff valve is typically located behind the refrigerator. Simply pull the **fridge** out from the wall to access the shutoff valve before you move, disconnect, or replace the refrigerator. Washing machine : In most cases, you can find the shutoff valve behind the washing machine, though it can also be installed off to one side or even above the machine so that it’s easier to access. If you are working on the washing machine or replacing it, then you need to pull it out from the wall anyway. Take this opportunity to turn off the shutoff valve before continuing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The water **line** is typically a small copper **line** with a t-valve attached to it. Once you find the valve, you will be able to turn off the cold water running into the **fridge**. With the water turned off, you can make repairs to the freezer and ice machine as needed before turning the valve back on, and allowing water to flow into the freezer again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Inspect the plastic supply **line** for any breaks or tears. Handling the **fridge** water **line** can help locate pinhole leaks. The water **line** must be replaced with one of equal proportions (dimensions and length), but not necessarily the same type of material. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It isn’t always possible to follow the water **line** back to the shut-off valve, so you may have to look at all the nearby possible connection points to find it. A sure sign that you found the right one would be that the shut-off is connected to a 1/4” water **line**—much thinner than the other water supply pipes. Also, the refrigerator **line** is often flexible plastic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Attach one end of the tubing to the valve. Turn the water back on, but don’t actually attach to the **fridge** just yet. Let the water fill and drain into a bucket to get rid of the impure water. After this is completed, connect the hose to the water dispensing valve on the **fridge**. Activate the water dispenser, and you are good to go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Flex water supply tubes are available in either a tough plastic nylon mesh or braided steel. Although the braided steel is considerably more expensive, the extra strength it provides is well worth the investment. It can be very inconvenient to move a refrigerator to get at a water **line** that has failed, so buy the best-quality water supply tube you can. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, disconnect the water supply **line** connected to the valve. Set the multimeter to R X 1 ohms. Put a probe on one of the terminals, and place the other probe on the other terminal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Shut off the main water **line** to your house. We used a water meter key for this, which you can pick up for under $20, but you can probably also use pliers if yours isn’t stuck. Drain remaining water from the **line**s by turning on a faucet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The refrigerator water **line** typically hooks into the water **line** under the sink or into a water **line** installed specifically for the refrigerator on the wall behind it. The **line** under the sink often has a shutoff valve with a male connector. The designated refrigerator **line** also has a fitting with a male connector. To be able to connect a smooth plastic or copper **line** to the fittings, you use a female compression nut and ferrule, which is a small tube that fits inside the nut. Once these fittings are in place, you can complete the water hookup to the refrigerator. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the new water **line** has been connected, examine the shutoff and intake valves to ensure neither of the connections have been loosened during the process. The final step is to switch on the water supply **line**. Watch for signs of leaks in the new supply **line**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   : In most cases, you can find the shutoff valve behind the washing machine, though it can also be installed off to one side or even above the machine so that it’s easier to access. If you are working on the washing machine or replacing it, then you need to pull it out from the wall anyway. Take this opportunity to turn off the shutoff valve before continuing. Sink : Faucet repair and replacement is one of the most common DIY plumbing jobs, so it’s important to know that the isolation valve for these fixtures can generally be found under the sink. In some instances, the hot and cold water **line**s may have independent valves that need to both be turned off to stop the flow of water through the faucet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you change the **fridge** from water to ice, the switch inside the electrical circuit energizes the solenoid-operated water valve. The solenoid water valve allows water to flow through the valve and into the ice cube trays freely. When the water has frozen, it will then dump the ice into the tray where it can be chopped or pushed as whole cubes through the system and into a cup. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most homeowners have a refrigerator with a built-in water **line** for the freezer and ice maker. The automatic ice maker has been known to cause trouble with homeowners in the past. However, modern ice makers do have fewer problems causing leaks and other headaches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The water main shutoff valve could be in a number of places, depending on the age of your home and the climate of your location. Valves can sometimes be buried inside drywall or behind the furnace. If your valve is in one of these tight locations you may need a professional plumber to relocate the valve or to install an easy-to-access secondary valve further down the **line**. The shutoff will either be a gate valve, which looks like a circular spigot, or a ball valve, which has a lever-style handle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A refrigerator runs 24 hours a day to keep its contents chilled and fresh. When the **fridge** features a water dispenser or an ice maker, it requires a water **line**. This water **line** has the potential to fail. Here’s what to do when your **fridge** water **line** leaks or breaks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   : Faucet repair and replacement is one of the most common DIY plumbing jobs, so it’s important to know that the isolation valve for these fixtures can generally be found under the sink. In some instances, the hot and cold water **line**s may have independent valves that need to both be turned off to stop the flow of water through the faucet. Toilet: The shutoff valve for most toilets is located behind the toilet or slightly off to one side. This valve can be used to turn off the water for repairs or replacement, but it can also be used to quickly stop the flow of water into the toilet to prevent it from overflowing in the case of a clog. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Signs of water damage include water **line** stains, mold growth, mildew, cracked paint and swelling along the baseboards. The caulking material around the baseboards might show damage, such as splits in the caulking material or holes. The wall space behind the **fridge** may also show water damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because water and ice service has become a standard feature for most refrigerators, newer homes have a water **line** connection and shut-off valve inset in the wall behind the refrigerator. But the water **line** has to be retrofitted at older homes, and it's usually connected to the nearest exposed cold water pipe, and next to a shut-off valve for another plumbing fixture. This could be under the kitchen sink, at the top of the water heater, under a bathroom sink, or sometimein the crawl space or basement under a home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Find a spot behind the **fridge** to attach the outlet box. You’ll want this to be next to a stud. We cut a small hole first because we knew there are electrical **line**s in that area. After locating those **line**s we traced an on**line** of the outlet box and cut the sheet rock using a utility knife. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The connections on either end of the new water **line** should be tight. Homeowners who have opted for a stainless-steel water **line** will find it features a rubber gasket to prevent leaks. Copper or plastic **line**s require a compression sleeve or ring in order to secure the compression nut. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The water intake valve is secured to the supply **line** via a compression nut. Loosen the nut by turning it counter clockwise with an adjustable wrench. Once the nut is loosened, remove it. The **fridge** water supply **line** is now disconnected from the valve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unplug the **fridge** from the electrical socket. Water and electricity do not mix, so be sure to avoid standing in any water puddles near the **fridge**. Ensure a safe environment by keeping the appliance unplugged during the entire duration of work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you run into trouble with the plumbing at any step of the way, call a licensed plumber. Residents of the Pittsburgh area can contact Terry’s Plumbing, day or night. With 30 years experience and a 24 hour rapid response **line**, we’re here to help with this process in any way we can. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For this reason, it’s recommended to locate and test your main shutoff valve now, instead of scrabbling to try to find it when water is pouring into your home from a broken water **line**. The valve should work properly without relying on any tools. If you find that it is seized or that the valve doesn’t completely shut off the water to the home, then you should contact a plumber to replace the valve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once a leak is confirmed, it is important to address it right away to prevent further water damage. (unaddressed water damage can be disastrous and expensive to fix). The first step is to locate the water **line**, which is connected to the back of the refrigerator. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Disconnect the water supply **line** from the water valve. Place a bucket beneath the water supply **line**. Switch on the water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We bought a new refrigerator, and naturally had to have one that dispensed water and ice. But we did not have a water **line**. So I’m going to take you along and show you how we installed one. Hopefully this will help you out if you are thinking about the process of installing a water **line**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turn off the valve that supplies water from the home’s water supply to the refrigerator. This valve may be found under the kitchen sink or behind the **fridge**. If the valve is behind the **fridge**, take precautions when pulling the **fridge** away from the wall (a ruptured pipe spews water). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Connecting the water dispenser and the ice maker starts essentially in the same way: connecting the water supply **line**. To start, you need to turn the water off and unplug the **fridge**. Find your cold water source, which is usually under the sink. If you can’t go to the sink, you may have to head to the basement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turning off the water to the entire home will also stop the flow of water into the water heater. However, if you have a tank-style water heater, then the water inside the tank may still flow out of the water heater. Open a faucet on the lowest level of the home to drain any water remaining in the **line**. If the hot water continues to flow, locate the isolation valve above the hot water heater and turn it off to stop the flow of hot water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you are done making repairs or your plumbing emergency is no longer a problem, turn the water back on by rotating the valve counter-clockwise. The faucet that you previously opened will spit out some air as the water fills the pipes throughout the home. Allow a few minutes for the water to force out any air left in the **line**s, then turn the faucet off again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Running a water **line** to a refrigerator to supply its ice maker and drinking water dispenser has never been easier. At one time, this was typically done with 1/4-inch bendable copper tubing that was snaked from the refrigerator to the nearest source of water and tapped into the water **line** using a saddle valve or other fitting. Now, there are convenient 1/4-inch flexible water supply tubes in lengths from 1 to 20 feet that can be used, and convenient "Adapt-a-Tee" fittings that can be installed pretty much anywhere there is an existing shutoff valve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main water shutoff valve is usually located on the main water **line**, where it enters the home. In most cases, this will be in a basement, cellar, or crawlspace because the water **line** extends from the neighborhood water main and enters the home from under the ground. In warmer areas where freezing pipes isn’t a concern, the main water shutoff might also be found outdoors on an exterior wall, or buried near the street. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **fridge** water **line** is connected to the home’s water supply. The refrigerator water **line** is capable of delivering filtered water through the **fridge**’s water dispenser or into the ice maker. The **fridge** water **line** is unnecessary in **fridge**s that do not feature a water dispenser or ice maker. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After setting up all the delivery details you patiently wait for your new **fridge** at home. Picture this, your new **fridge** is being delivered and you’ve had the movers place it near the spot your old **fridge** occupied. You begin to hook up all the cables so you can put the food you took out of your old **fridge** into your new one. Then you run into a little bit of a problem. Your old **fridge** didn’t have a water filter on it; therefore, you aren’t sure if you have a water **line** or if you need to purchase a new one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is important to install the new **fridge** water **line** correctly. An improperly installed water **line** can cause water leaks, and, consequently, water damage. When you are faced with water damage, consult a professional for immediate water damage cleanup. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Measure the failed refrigerator water **line** to determine the correct length needed for the new one. Purchase a new **fridge** water **line** from a local hardware store or on**line**. Homeowners should remember they have three tubing material options: plastic, stainless steel and copper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the event the **fridge** water **line** leaks, a homeowner will see visual cues. A small amount of water may accumulate around the base of the **fridge**. If the leak has been present for a lengthy period of time, the baseboards will show evidence of water damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before calling a plumber, it might be best to read through this seven-step guide on how to run and install a water **line** to your new **fridge**. Step one gives you a pep talk to psych yourself up for the project you didn’t know you were going to have to accomplish. Step two talks about if you already have a water supply pipe available and what to do if you don't. Step three instructs you of what's needed. Steps four through seven finish up with how to connect everything. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
