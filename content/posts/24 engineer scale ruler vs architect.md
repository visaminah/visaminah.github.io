## 24 Things You Should Know About Engineer Scale Ruler Vs Architect | Staedtler-Mars Engineer triangular scale, passed down to me from my mother. I'll never need another ruler.
-   The weight and heft are classic Alvin. The markings come in 6 different dimensions, and the faces are all made out of plastic with a bamboo core. This gives the Alvin **ruler** the heft you’d expect out of aluminium **ruler**s, with the safety features of plastic **ruler**s. A win win situation! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The color coded grooves are easily visible and make your job much simpler. However, the markings are embossed and not etched – and time is not kind to embossed markings. Clearly, there have been some compromises made as per the price. The fact remains, however, that it is a fairly sturdy and inexpensive **ruler** that gets the job done. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Coming to the point of accuracy, the markings are precisely embossed and will last for a fairly long time. This **scale**s are all machined to a high quality and will give you years of no-nonsense operation. We would like to note that this product is geared squarely for professionals, and students should make sure they can handle the edges before use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That’s true for a lot of **scale**s out there, though at the same time, they tend to be priced much higher than this one is. This **scale** is perfect for those who are just starting off with their use of an architectural **ruler** and/or need something cheap but relatively long lasting. Another plus point is that this **ruler** comes with both imperial and metric demarcations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This will influence not only the material, but the kind of lettering to go with the **scale** too. If you have something more than a passing interest or are transitioning from being a novice to an amateur, we would recommend going in for an aluminium **ruler**. Plastic **ruler**s are best suited as secondary or spare **ruler**s, or as a first **ruler** for those just starting out with drawing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If quality and robustness of use are what you’re looking after, your search is likely to end right here. It offers the right mix of weight, sturdiness and ease of use – it is not heavy enough to intrude into your work, but holds well enough to give you accurate measurements. The **scale**s have been machined precisely and are cogent enough for all operations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **scale**s available on this **ruler** are 3/32, 3/16, ⅛, ¼, ⅜, ½, ¾, 1, 1-½, 3, 16 (which means 16 gradations from 0” to 1”). The lettering, just like the finish, is truly unique – this is distinctive and readable, and the user experience is made just that much better by these small changes. However, do make sure that you take care in using it – it does not have finger protection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A choice of 11 different **scale**s on three sides makes for a versatile **scale**, but the major compromise here has been differentiation – it is rather hard to get a hang of the various **scale**s. The dark background means you’ll have to have suitable lighting under any case. However, all things considered, this makes for a long lasting architectural **ruler**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **scale** is very sturdy for a **scale** that costs very little, and is likely to last long. The markings are not etched, but instead are printed on – however, the legibility of the **ruler** is not in any way compromised by the fact of the numbers being printed. The **scale**s themselves will take some time to get used to because they’re not demarcated in any way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **scale** is one of the regular listings on various “top 10” architectural **ruler**s across a number of renowned architectural blogs. This **ruler** comes with 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 3/8, 3/16, 3/32, 1, 3 and 16 **scale**d markings across 3 colour-marked sides. The sides of the **ruler** are coated with plastic which protects you from sharp metallic edges which can cause cuts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This one has the most impact on which **scale**s you will be considering for purchase. This is for the sole reason that plastic **ruler**s offer the flexibility, lightness, safety and ease of use which aluminium **ruler**s just cannot. On the other hand, aluminium rules the roost when it comes to sturdiness and long term use. Aluminium is also a fair bit more expensive than plastic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is no surprise that architecture majors end up working much longer than most other majors. Hence, tools which come in bundles have a distinct edge over singular **ruler**s. This set (three **ruler**s) comes with two architectural **ruler**s with different **scale**s, and one simple aluminium **ruler**. All of the **ruler**s are 12 inches long as is the standard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another major win in the favor of this set is that the finish on the architectural **ruler** is a far cry from the drab silver which is present on almost every **ruler**. The laser etched grooves and markings make reading measurements a far less painful experience than it is on other comparable **scale**s. All in all, this **scale** scores major points for novelty and ease of use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The gradations are marked clearly in inches, and the edges are tapered for best possible use. The usage of this instrument is not limited to just architectural students and architects, however – these are useful for people across a number of different fields. Be careful about the corners, which sadly have no plastic coverage – a nitpick on an otherwise useful **ruler**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   VGOOP has brought a rather interesting product to the market lately. This product comes with a number of different features which set it apart from your garden variety architectural **ruler**. This **ruler** actually comes in a bundle – a rare turquoise aluminium finished architectural **ruler**, coupled with a standard aluminium **ruler**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Aluminium **ruler**s further offer the choice of getting the lettering either embossed or laser etched onto the **ruler**. Laser etched **ruler**s tend to be more expensive, but people report theirs having lasted for over three decades. Hence, you should have a clear idea about your intended use before you go out there and buy an architectural **ruler**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This one is a blast from the past, figuratively speaking. This **scale** was the bread and butter requirement of most architects way long back before aluminium and plastic had made their entry into the market. This one, however, still holds its own among the hordes of aluminium and plastic **ruler**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This set of **ruler**s has been on the market for while. The **ruler** is a standard triangular architect’s **ruler**, with three color coded sides for ease of use. All three sides have different **scale**s, hence the color coding helps with remembering which **scale** is on which side. There are six **scale**s spread over three sides on this **ruler**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll surely appreciate the bending which never occurs on account of the incredibly sturdy construction. The company offers a full refund if the products are not to your satisfaction – the first we’ve heard of in the entire market. The fibre laser etched markings will definitely last much longer than a plastic **scale** – and won’t bend or break. It’s definitely worth the outlay. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **scale** comes in at a much cheaper price, mostly because it’s made from plastic and not metal as a lot of people are usually used to. However, it comes with no compromises in terms of sturdiness or legibility, and the machining has been done incredibly cleanly. The length of the **scale** is, as is standard, a cool 12 inches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **scale** is one of the best all round **scale**s, and it comes with a certain finish which is not commonly seen in architectural **ruler**s. This matte aluminium finish is truly outstanding and feels much more premium than most aluminium **ruler**s on the market. Further, it is light enough due to its hollow metallic construction – giving the best of both possible scenarios. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This point is slightly more technical. This point squarely depends on how many **scale**s offered are of any realistic use to you – most **scale**s go for the full fledged 11 **scale** treatment which is neither feasible nor usable for many architectural users. Hence, you should make sure you only go for the **scale**s you actually need, rather than going in for the novelty of all 11 **scale**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **ruler** does all that you’d expect from an architectural **ruler**. It has a number of **scale**d markings which give you the requisite accuracy as well as precision for getting the results you deserve. Then, we come to the measurements, which are legible (albeit embossed rather than etched). The **ruler** comes with three colored markings, which are red, green and silver. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **ruler** comes highly recommended from both students and professionals worldwide – and the major reason is that it does the job incredibly well. The readings are coherent and precise, and accurate to a fault. The machining of the aluminium **ruler** set makes it much safer and intuitive to use than most other products on offer, making sure kids and students can use it without worry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
