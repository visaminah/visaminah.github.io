## 13 Facts What Is The Complementary Color Of Red Light | What Is The Complementary Color Of Violet
-   Red, yellow, and blue are the three primary **color**s. These three **color**s are the basis of all others; yellow and blue combine to make green, blue and **red** combine to make purple, yellow and **red** combine to make orange. Orange, purple, and green are the secondary **color**s, which can be further combined to make the tertiary **color**s like magenta, yellow-green, teal, and so on. If you place all of the **color**s on a wheel, with the primary **color**s equal distance from each other and the secondary **color**s in between them, and the tertiary **color**s in between them, you end up with the **color** wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   #"Cu"^(2+)# is blue in aqueous solution. #"CuSO"_4# has a #lambda_(max)# of about #"635 nm"# (**red**). It reflects the **color** blue, so it absorbs mostly **red** light, the complementary **color**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Color can be described using three properties: hue, saturation, and value. The hue is the **color** itself: blue, purple, yellow, magenta, etc.. The saturation is the intensity of the **color**. Value describes how light or dark the **color** is. We can use these terms to describe any shade of any **color** that we can see. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Analogous – Analogous **color** schemes use **color**s that are adjacent on the **color** wheel. This creates a pleasant, unified look, with more variation than monochromatic schemes. In the following shot from O Brother, Where Art Thou?, yellow-green, yellow, and orange are the significant **color**s used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The basic idea of **color** psychology is that different **color**s carry different intrinsic meanings. Studies have shown that when seeing the **color** **red**, people experience an elevated heart rate; when we see blue tones, our breathing and heart rate slow down. Color theorists have assigned all sorts of meanings to different **color**s. Some are obvious, some might surprise you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Different **color** schemes are described in terms of the location of the **color**s in a shot on the **color** wheel. Harmonious **color** schemes us **color**s that are equidistant from each other on the **color** wheel. However, it’s also perfectly acceptable to deliberately use a non-harmonious **color** scheme to introduce tension or foreshadow conflict. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Discordant – As the name implies, discordant **color** schemes deliberately break from the harmonious schemes described above. Sin City – with its splashes of **color** amidst high contrast black and white footage – is an obvious example, but there are subtler ways of achieving this effect as well. For example, a pop of blue will sometimes be inserted into the otherwise complementary **red**/green scheme of Amelie. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Monochromatic – Monochromatic **color** schemes use only one **color**, with variations in saturation and value. Black and white film is obviously monochromatic, but **color** film can be as well. For example, there are many shots in The Matrix that are monochromatic green. Steven Soderbergh’s Traffic uses multiple monochromatic schemes to represent different areas and themes in the film. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The interesting thing about **color** psychology is that the meanings aren’t fixed. Warm **red** and yellow tones might represent safety in one film and danger in another. Individual characters can also have **color**s associated with them, which carry throughout a film. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This week, we’re talking about **color**. This could be conside**red** more of a general cinematography topic than a lighting-specific topic, since the **color** in a shot is defined by location, props, and wardrobe, as well as lighting; not to mention the crucial role of **color** correction in post-production. However, lighting plays a vital role in the **color** composition of a shot and some understanding of basic **color** theory is important for everyone behind the camera. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Complementary – Complementary **color**s are opposite each other on the **color** wheel. This is a very common **color** scheme because it creates a visually-pleasing tension in the frame. Orange and blue are a common combination today, but other complementary pairs are frequently used as well. Many shots in Amelie are almost entirely **red** and green. Generally, one half of the complementary pair is p**red**ominant with the second **color** used for accents and highlights. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Triadic – Triadic **color** schemes are somewhat uncommon; they involve three **color**s equally spaced on the **color** wheel. Yellow, blue, and **red** is probably the most common triadic combination, as seen in the following shot from Superman. Triadic **color** schemes are usually bright and vibrant – almost cartoony – because they rely on hues with so much variation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **color** wheel is a hugely important tool for a cinematographer. It allows us to look at the relationships between the **color**s in a shot and judge how harmonious or chaotic they are. For a “standard” **color** wheel, **red** should be across from green, yellow should be across from purple, and blue should be across from orange, forming three primary/secondary pairs with the tertiary **color**s in between. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
