So easy to accomplish and will cost a lot less then buying a new set. It was a quick transformation and now I am set for the summer with my “new” set! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paint is the easiest and cheapest way to update your old furniture. Which is why I decided to spray **paint** my boring beige patio table and chairs as part of my deck makeover. Learning how to **paint** outdoor metal furniture has definitely had a big impact on my outdoor decor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Update: It has been 3 years since I **paint**ed this furniture set, which we use all the time. While we have replaced the wood table and rug, the **paint** job looks great! Despite it being in full sun and all the elements, there is only a little bit of wear on the arm rests. While it could last even longer, I expect another 2-3 years out of it. Not bad for a project that was less than $200! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, you should always follow standard safety procedures while **paint**ing, like wearing gloves, safety goggles, or a full-face respirator for full coverage. Some users have complained that the **paint** has a powdery finish that comes off on their hands after drying time. However, you can reduce **paint** chalking by cleaning the metal surface and covering it in a high-quality primer before **paint**ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **paint** is suitable for indoor and outdoor use. Its chemical composition is resistant to UV light, which is great if you need to **paint** a metal structure that will be sitting in full sun. Plutonium **paint** maintains its vivid color and resists weathering, for pleasing long-term results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. If you have a few cans of spray **paint** in your **paint** supplies, try switching out the nozzles. This usually helps get the can spraying again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wait for the **paint** to completely dry. If you sand too soon you will create a gummy mess that will be hard to remove. If this happens, use **paint** remover to remove the **paint**, clean well and start over. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next you’ll start priming. Lay your metal outdoor furniture on your drop cloth and spray with the Rustoleum primer. Apply light coats and let dry thoroughly between each cost before moving on to the next area to spray **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 4 – Setup for spray **paint**ing outdoor furniture. Generally speaking, you will want to elevate the chairs or furniture so you can get around the bottom and undersides. If you have a table, that’s great, or you can use bricks, cement stones or 4×4 pieces of wood. Lay a drop cloth over it and you are ready to **paint**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I recorded my process, so that I can show you my actual labor on these outdoor metal furniture pieces. I seriously spent more time sanding then **paint**ing because I will always tell anyone that prep is just as important if not more then the actual **paint**ing. Spend the time and really prepare your surface before **paint**ing. I used the hammered metal finish because I know that I was going to have a little bit of a rough surface, with years of old **paint**. The finished result looks great! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   POR-15 Top Coat has a direct to metal (DTM) **paint** that doesn’t need primer or undercoat to adhere. It can be used on bare metal or surfaces that have already been **paint**ed, with the same result. This makes it a versatile addition to any **paint**er’s toolkit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **paint** is designed to be used either inside or outside. However, it truly excels on exterior structures made from either metal, wood, concrete, or masonry. Its chemical compound is resistant to weather and corrosion, ensuring that **paint** finishes are long-lasting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is also completely free from lead, cadmium, chlorinated solvents, chromates, and mercury. While no **paint** is good for the environment, you can feel relatively guilt-free if you choose the low impact Seymour variety. It’s also safer for you to use, although you should still use personal protective equipment just in case. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also read the back of the can. Some brands say you should get all re-coating done in under 30 – 60 minutes. After that, do not re-coat at least for 24 – 48 hours or the **paint** may wrinkle. Again…read the label for specifics. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 4 piece set was left behind from the previous home owner. The original piece was **paint**ed in white and by the time we arrived it was more like a white and rust combination. We never got rid of it because it fit our front patio so well that it always worked. Most likely from the 1950’s these timeless sets do not go out of style. They just need to be updated with a new color and cushions! Through the years it has needed a refresh and this year I am giving it an ultimate makeover and **paint** my metal outdoor furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As with any **paint**ing, ensure the surfaces to be **paint**ed are clean, dry and free from loose **paint**, grease and contaminants. Top Tip! Previously **paint**ed surfaces should be abraded to provide a key. Inspect the **paint**work, if it is flaking or cracked, use a wire brush before sanding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Please check out all my **paint**ed furniture projects here on Double Arrow Designs . I do a range of different furniture. Hope you enjoy! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some users have reported that the finish has small bubbles in it. You need to be mindful of lacquer **paint** that it can dry like this if you don’t apply it correctly. It’s important to spray thick layers quickly and suitably prepare the metal to remove any scratches, bumps, or dirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. The **paint** particularly excels in exterior applications because it is resistant to fading, UV, and rust. Therefore, you can confidently use Rust-Oleum on metal that will be in full sun. You can expect that after using this **paint** that your metal structure will resist sun damage for several years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All **paint** takes time to fully cure – up to 30 days. What curing means is that that **paint** and underside of the **paint** takes time to become completely hard and durable. So even if your spray **paint**ed finish feels dry to the touch, it may not be dry on the underside – so be gentle with the item for a few days. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It can be used either inside or outside. The Krylon **paint** is moisture-resistant, making it a great option to stand against the elements. It also fairs well in the kitchen or bathroom because of these properties. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One criticism of this **paint** is that it sprays in a mist. This is great if you’re trying to cover large areas quickly, but could pose a problem if you’re trying to **paint** on a windy day. Furthermore, you will need several coats to get an even covering of your metal surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sand, clean well and dry your piece before **paint**ing. Use a primer and make sure the spray **paint** you are using is made for that specific surface. Read the label. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Step 3 – Clean. Lastly, to prepare the outdoor piece, you will want to give it a good cleaning with a mild soap (car soap is a good) to remove any grease, dirt, or debris. Thoroughly dry the piece, particularly if you have rust problems already. I actually sand before cleaning because why clean twice?! This will ensure a good bond for the **paint** and primer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Now this project was a lot of fun. I was really into polka dots and I still like them. After the spray **paint** dried I aged the silver **paint** with Caromal Colours Toner. The toner adds depth and character to **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now that all of your patio furniture is clean, you want to sand it and remove all of the sheen from the old finish. If you **paint** over a glossy surface, the new **paint** will have a hard time bonding to the old finish. Whereas if you sand it to a dull finish, this means you have thoroughly scratched up the old **paint** and given the new **paint** a surface that it can easily bond to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I also chose to go with a flat (or matte) **paint** (as opposed to satin or glossy). That’s because it’s easier to get the finish to look right. And if you do need to do some touch-ups in the future, they blend right in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you have **paint**ed your outdoor furniture, you will have to touch up periodically. I am hoping that the rust Reformer will help out, but I recommend in keeping an extra can of the specific **paint** that you used on your outdoor furniture.

-   The stenciled table is an oldie but a goody. You need to see this project. I laid out stencils all over the table and used the oil rubbed bronze spray **paint** over the whole thing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It has an oil-base, which allows it to adhere to metal surfaces easily. The base serves a dual purpose of protecting the metal and preventing rust without other rust-prevention sprays. You can also apply it directly to rusted surfaces, allowing the **paint** to start its protection from scratch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   When using spray **paint** it is so important to first read the directions. Make sure you spend some time shaking the content of the can before you start. Then when applying to remember to keep about 8-12 inches away and spray in a methodical back and forward motion. If you haven’t fully covered your surface, remember that you can re-apply additional coats over your first once dry.
