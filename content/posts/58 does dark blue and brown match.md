-   But, as we all know, there isn’t just one shade of red.

If white and **brown** are your two main colors in any room, make sure you vary the shades to keep it interesting. Shades of dark **brown** or woods such as teak pop well against white too.

-   'Grey can be surprisingly versatile and will happily layer with many colours such as inky **blue**s, smoky greens and rose pinks,' explains Patrick O’Donnell on behalf of Farrow & Ball.

'However, if you want to keep the palette more monochromatic, layer tones of grey like Ammonite with Mole’s Breath.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The combination of dark **brown** and fuchsia is unexpected, but it looks natural in this living room from Liz Levin Interiors.
