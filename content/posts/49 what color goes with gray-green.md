-   This **green** color has a lot of **gray** undertones to it, making it not feel too bright. It instantly makes a room feel cozier. It’s definitely on the **green**er side for bluish **green** paint colors, but there is blue to it that can be brought out using blue accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mentally, I’ve designed a speakeasy bar using this color. It’s the darkest of the bunch thus far, and would be best suited for someone who has light colored furnishings and window treatments so that paint color sets it off. Definitely on the **gray**er side, but that hint of **green** is delicious. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Jewel tones come to mind with this **green** **gray** paint color. Think burgundy, eggplant type hues and brass touches galore. This color is warm, not too dark, not too light and would look amazing with most decor styles, especially transitional ones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are so many possible colour combinations to choose from for a kids room, apart from the more common pinks, blues and whites. One of our current favourites is grey and **green**. When we went looking for inspiration to share with you, we were surprised as how under used this colour combo is. It’s such a beautiful choice so hopefully, these rooms will inspire more people to go for it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the best parts of using a grey and **green** colour combo is that you can easily mix it with lots of other colours, like in this room above where we have pops of pink in a range of different shades. There is plenty of **green** in a few different tones on the wallpaper and then we have a big splash of grey from the wardrobe. This all combines beautifully with the wood and pink tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'My favorite element to pair with light grey is gold,' says Randi Baldwin, interior designer and co-founder of Relaxing Decor (opens in new tab).

I especially love light **gray** and gold in kitchens or bathrooms.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   OK – so this is really a **gray** paint color. But, it is a **gray** with blue **green** undertones. It’s a popular neutral but just **green** enough to fit in well on this list. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Is your goal a light paint color with the slightest hint of **green** with a dash of **gray**? Grecian Green is the color you want. It is so incredibly soft that you’ll likely have to squint to see the **green**. Perfect for a serene, calm space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a light blue **green** color that people even consider neutral. But, it’s definitely **green**. It’s a great option if you want a hint of **green** without it being too in your face. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Neighbors on the color wheel, **green** and blue are cool colors that form a refreshing combination. Choose vibrant shades of these analogous colors on walls and furniture for a bold look. In this dramatic sitting room, vivid cerulean blue wall color is balanced by an equally bold apple **green**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yet another idea is to combine soft, minty **green**s with dark grey. This creates a very dramatic look because of the big contrast between the two colours. In the room above a lot of the furniture is painted in a soft **green** plus there are minty **green** accents dotted around the room but the rest of the room is dark grey. So if you like a bold look, this is the grey-**green** colour combo for you. You could also flip it and choose a deep, dark **green** combined with soft, pale greys. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you are ready to remodel a room or just want to add some excitement to an existing one, **gray** is a great color option. While many consider this to be a neutral, forgettable color, it can add a touch of subtle luxury to any space. Additionally, **gray**s are so versatile — there are hundreds of shades of **gray** to choose from, so you can find the right one to pair with your aesthetic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ’When introducing colour accents to lighter greys, think about the undertones of the pairing first and then the contrast you wish to achieve. Ammonite a soft stony grey will team beautifully with blues and **green**s such as Inchyra Blue or Hague Blue as both have the gentle undertones of nature, such as the delicate brown note found in Ammonite and the **green** in Inchyra Blue.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Green paint gives a space a natural or boho feel. But, **green** can also be a neutral. Wild, I know! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Baldwin recommends using a large variety of shades of **gray** in your decor. For example, if you have a light **gray** couch, add medium and dark **gray** pillows as well as a charcoal **gray** throw blanket. 'You'll also want to use plenty of white to keep your space looking bright,' she adds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Get creative with your color options and go bold with an accent wall. Keep it neutral and paint one wall a deeper shade of grey than the others, or make a statement and add a pale yellow accent wall to offset the ashy paint around the rest of the room. We also recommend adding different shades of your accent color throughout the space, bringing the color into your furniture, area rugs, art, or throw pillows. For a more luxurious design, paint your bathroom bright white and choose a soft **gray** vanity and shower curtain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a beautiful earthy **green**. It’s slightly darker than light **green**, with both blue and **gray** undertones. It really transforms in different light! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'When using charcoal **gray**, my top recommendation is to use plenty of white in the space,' says Baldwin. 'This contrast will help brighten it up and prevent your space from feeling too dark.' According to Baldwin, this is important for lighter **gray** as well, but even more so for charcoal grey. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, if you prefer a more minimal look, you can opt for greys with grey-**green**s like in the room above. Green with a grey tint is a great option for a wall colour or for painting furniture. It’s an absolutely timeless colour that is so pleasing to the eye and it seamlessly fits with any shade of grey. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Woodlawn Blue and Wedgewood Gray are two of the best blue paint colours. So many of today’s most popular blues have a lot of **green** in them – not these two. These are almost true blues and only have a small amount of **green** in them, which stops them from looking icy cold and helps them hold up a bit better in a north-facing room (which could look TOO cold with a real true blue on the walls). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s no secret that I love decorating with **green**. Pretty much our whole house is **green** or blue-ish **green**. But, even I admit that **green** can be a lot for a wall paint color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'A silver **gray** looks fantastic with a deep teal or pastel turquoise,' shares Chris Campbell, Partner at The Charming Bench Company (opens in new tab). 'Various hues of aquamarine with black and white accents give a timeless aesthetic that looks contemporary but also classic.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'One of my personal favorite color combos is **gray** and **green**. Specifically, look for cool, mid-tone **gray**s with blue undertones and cooler **green** hues (pistachio, light olive, etc) as well. This combination adds naturalism and freshness to whatever space it is in,' says Kazimierski. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mix just the right tones and you'll create a modern-country look with a very particular mood. This chartreuse **green** and dark grey living room has been given a cosy cabin vibe with a white wood wall panels. Such a zingy sofa colour needs a grey of equal depth so works perfectly with the charcoal tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
