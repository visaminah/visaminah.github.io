## 50 Fun Facts What Colors Look Good With Turquoise Jewelry | Which turquoise jewel to wear according to your skin tone?
-   If you want to go with a modern style piece of **turquoise** **jewelry**, make a statement! Bauble Bar is my favorite place to go for the trendiest pieces that won’t necessarily become heirlooms. I love this Capri Amulet and the Poseidon pendant. The Rhodes Pendant combines three of my favorite things – a **turquoise** focal, seed bead tassels, and pendant style. Plus the red white and blue tones are a more subtle way to get patriot this summer than literally wearing a flag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s so much variety in **turquoise**— because it’s a natural stone, each one is completely unique in color and markings. You can have a more blue **turquoise** stone or one that looks more green. Some **turquoise** has a lot of dark veins while others are smooth and clear. It’s a wonderful stone to wear because each **turquoise** stone is one of a kind {just like you!} - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What Colors Go Best With Turquoise Jewelry? Wear what colors of **turquoise** **jewelry**?? Make **turquoise** pop by mixing it with neutrals. A rusty red is another great choice with a deeper color value than blush this season, and it’s a great off-complement to the blush. You can pair **turquoise** with nude or tan tones to make it a little bit sexy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When I designed my new collection of **turquoise** **jewelry**, I wanted to capture all this stone means to me. My designs made with **turquoise** were created to bring peace and brightness into your life. A **turquoise** crystal bezeled in bright sterling silver is a beautiful piece when you’re looking to add some color into your life! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to picking the colors of your outfit, **turquoise** will always stand out among muted and neutral tones. So if you’re wanting to make your **turquoise** **jewelry** the star of your outfit, pick colors like white, cream, black, and tan. The bright blue stone also looks amazing with earthy colors like sage green or rusty brown, where the contrast creates a very fun and sweet look. If you’re feeling bold, you could also wear your **turquoise** **jewelry** with other bright colors like yellow or pink. How fun! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turquoise Necklace: People, usually celebrities really love to wear **turquoise** necklaces with everything from jeans and t-shirts to cocktail dresses and gowns. This is one of the most popular ways because it can be worn with everything. You can also choose a necklace with a lot of **turquoise** stones or one with a long chain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The green **turquoise** cabochon, from an American mine, might become part of a designer’s unique **jewelry** piece. The even blue color of the cabochon on the right would be called “Persian blue” in the trade. Photo: Robert Weldon/GIA, Dr. Eduard J. Gübelin collection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you go all black in your clothing, pops of bold **jewelry** in white metals give you a mod vibe — think Emma Peel in The Avengers (the original TV series or the more recent movie). A slim black top and pencil skirt creates a minimalist background for a bold silver cuff, a white gold and black-and-white diamond fashion ring or twinned necklaces of black and white pearls. A white top with black bottoms sets the stage for black pearl earrings, a black diamond pendant or silver-and-black enamel ring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Does Turquoise Jewelry Go With Everything? Divaris said **turquoise** complements black, white, and denim perfectly. Keep in mind: A little **turquoise** goes a long way toward making your outfit pop. A cowgirl with **turquoise** and denim is modern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turquoise represents peace and protection. Its vibrant color is a reminder that there is so much beauty around us. The clear blue color represents the clarity and wisdom we gain over time. When I wear **turquoise**, I am reminded that there is grace in this moment—we can live with light hearts. It’s a calming breath of air and a beautiful reminder to be present in the moment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is what happened: Leslie Mann kept the **turquoise** theme going. She matched everything from the bracelet to the earrings to the eyeliner to make it look like she had a lot of **turquoise** on her face. To finish the look, Leslie chose a bun with a lot of texture and a Naeem Khan dress. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turquoise is weighed in carats, and five carats equal one gram. Turquoise is available in a wide range of sizes. All sizes, even very small stones, are used in Native American **jewelry**, and large pieces of **turquoise** rough are popular for carvings. For any size, the quality and evenness of the color is the overriding value factor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turquoise is a soft stone, but howlite, which looks like **turquoise**, is even softer. This means that if you scratch your stone and it is easy to scratch, you most likely have howlite. But if your stone is very hard to scratch, you have real **turquoise**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Real **turquoise** can sometimes be a bit of an investment, but just remember that real **jewelry** lasts forever. It can be so easy to add another piece of more affordable **jewelry** to your collection, but it just won’t stand the test of time the way that a genuine piece of **turquoise** **jewelry** does. For this reason, I like to invest in classic-shaped pieces or handmade artist styles that will stand the test of time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Green, of course, is another one of the great colors that go with **turquoise**. Jewelry with green gemstones will look great with **turquoise**-colored clothing or a **turquoise** overcoat. This look is always a great option in the fall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Choose a blue or green stone but with a strong tone. The more contrast there is with your skin, the prettier it will be. Dare to go for example towards Kingman **turquoise** (Arizona) which offers beautiful shades ranging from a very bright sky blue to a darker and deeper blue. Do the same if you are going for a green **turquoise**: dare to go for an emerald or flaming green, and don't hesitate to go for **turquoise** with beautiful visible matrices. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Blue is a calming color, reminiscent of the ocean and clear morning skies. But **turquoise** is unique because it also includes hints of green.
