## 16 Interesting Facts How Much Does It Cost To Get Car Painted Matte Black | How Much Does it Cost to Paint a Truck - DIY & Professionally
-   The reason why you’ll find a **matte** finish on high-end vehicles more than any other option is because of the cost of the auto detailing supplies. The products are more expensive to purchase, which means every job is going to drain your wallet. It can be a way to create a unique custom look if you don’t mind the expense, but drivers that can afford the overall cost of the vehicle in the first place have the means to manage these circumstances. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   UV rays can cause a lot of trouble for **painted** surfaces, whether they are **matte** or glossy. When you have sunlight raining down on the vehicle each day for hours at a time, discoloration and fading can occur. A clear coat helps to resist this issue, but that’s not a one-stop fix. You’ll need a sealant to provide another shielding layer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The popularity of **matte**-paint finishes has made them become more available from many of today’s automakers. That benefit comes with a price tag that will make some people think twice about the issue. If you are in the market for a Mercedes-Benz, then you can expect to pay at least $2,500 more for the privilege of this surface. It can be an expense that reaches more than $4,000 more for some makes and models. If you’re trying to keep costs down, there aren’t too many options available in today’s market at the moment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you decide to have the manufacturer apply a **matte** black car paint surface for your new vehicle, the exterior is not going to come with an additional warranty. It doesn’t **matte**r that the product is more delicate than the average glossy product. That’s why taking care of the paint must become a top priority. The regular care of your car is going to be in your hands. Even if you take the vehicle to a professional, anyone familiar with the characteristics of a **matte** surface is going to want you to sign a waiver against holding them responsible for any damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The requirements for **matte** finish care are very different than what you’ll experience with glossy paint. You cannot use any detergents when trying to care for the paint. You should not use anything that could polish the surface either as that can lead to a lot of unwanted shine. A clay bar is sometimes an option to remove contaminants with other surfaces, but not when you have a **matte** black car paint finish to protect. That’s why the online advice you’ll find recommends that you use a professional service. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The idea of **matte** black car paint is more for the vehicles that remain in storage more than they drive. When you can keep the surface clean, then there isn’t a better look available on the market today. The issue is that the surface is almost impossible to keep clean, so the flat factor begins to dull after only a few weeks of daily use. It can be a way to make the vehicle feel like it is unique, almost stealthy, but the best way to preserve it is to keep it in the garage. Think of this option as more of a museum piece. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Those days are gone. Although a glossy finish is still a popular option, the idea of having a **matte** **painted** car is gaining some traction. This flat finish creates a distinctive look that everyone will remember when driving down the street. It creates a softer look that tends to accentuate the trim of the vehicle while working to hide the imperfections that might be on the **painted** surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You must take every step possible to reduce the threat of a scratch happening when you have **matte** black car paint. That means you need to stay away from any equipment that might have an abrasive brush. You can’t use washing products on the vehicle that have chemicals in them that could erode the finish. Even a contaminated towel could cause a problem for you. Want to go through an automatic car wash? Forget it – that service is too much risk. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You will need to invest in **matte** paint cleanser and wash your car by hand. Sheepskin cloths and mitts are your primary equipment option – not microfiber. Then, a **matte** sealant and protection film are necessary to ensure the best possible result occurs each time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll experience the most benefits of **matte** black car paint when the vehicle is under direct sunshine.

The disadvantage of choosing this option is that the soft textures can often show visible dust and dirt when compared to the other options that might be available. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Glossy finishes allow you to use polishing, waxing, or wet sanding to help the paint restore its finish. None of those efforts will work when you have **matte** paint on the care. You’ll also be stuck with fading if the work was done more than a few months ago, which means you either live with the damage or pay for an expensive repaint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your car manages to collect a small scratch for any reason, then it is going to stand out prominently if you use **matte** black paint. That’s why you’ll see most vehicles operating with a glossy finish instead.

-   Andrew Fine told The Globe and Mail in 2016 that his 2011 BWM with a factory **matte** finish became more stressful to maintain as the years passed.

-   It is true that almost every vehicle that comes with a **matte**-paint finish has a premium price tag to consider.

-   In 2014, the **matte** finish for dealerships in Canada for this specific vehicle accounted for about 1 in 5. Transactions. Over the next 24 months, that figure rose to be 1 in 3 sales. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
