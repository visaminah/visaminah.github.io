## 11 Fun Facts Difference Between 30 And 21 Degree Framing Nailer | Best 30 Degree Framing Nailer
-   Additionally, once you've found the range of nails your **framing** **nailer** will accommodate, you must figure out what is necessary for your job. While something like building a fence won't call for specific nails, something like **framing** a house will. If you choose a smaller nail, your specific building code will likely require you to use more nails per joint to account for the smaller size. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Failing to keep your free hand away from the surface you're nailing will eventually lead to a deflected nail going through your hand. For this reason, your free hand should always be far from the surface you're nailing, even when you're supporting the material. Nails can easily deflect if they hit a nail or other foreign object in the material, and eye protection should always be worn when operating a **nailer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If a **framing** **nailer** component breaks or a piece such as a trigger gets lost, it can likely be purchased directly from the manufacturer or repaired at a tool repair shop. If parts aren't available and their absence compromises the function or safety of the tool, the **nailer** should no longer be used. If the tool begins to have issues like consistent jamming or nail deflection, it may be due to damaged components on the interior or exterior. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you might expect, you can't just load any nails into any given **framing** **nailer**. First off, **framing** **nailer**s are only designed for large nails, within a limited range of sizes and types, that are intended for, you guessed it, **framing**. This means anything smaller such as finish nails, brads, and pin nails won't work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Secondly, each **framing** **nailer** is different and the magazines vary in the degree to which they are mounted to the **nailer**. This means the angle of the row of nails you're loading into the magazine has to match the angle of the magazine. Common magazine angles are 21-degree, 28-degree, 30-degree, and 34-degree. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When shopping for a **nailer**, it's important to know what you're looking for. Framing **nailer**s are great for tasks like **framing**, fastening sheathing, building decks and fences, attaching subfloor, and many other uses that call for large nails. However, there are many other types of **nailer**s available that are suited for many other applications. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Framing **nailer**s are available for rent, but the rates don't justify this decision for most users. Because of this tool's use, it's unlikely that most individuals would need one for less than a day and it would likely make more sense to purchase it instead. Additionally, pneumatic **nailer**s also require a compressor and air hose, which would have to be rented as well if not already owned. For professionals, it's a definite good buy. For DIY enthusiasts, the best option may be to buy, use as needed, and resell once no longer needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **framing** **nailer** will last for years if taken care of. Basic maintenance like keeping the tool clean, oiling it before every use (if using an oiled unit), and using it properly will ensure it operates as it should. One of the biggest mistakes people make when using **framing** **nailer**s is treating the safety tip as a hammer and banging material into place before nailing. If you notice you have this tendency, break the habit before you break your **nailer**. It's better to keep a hammer in your tool belt for instances where you need to move material. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These alternative **nailer** options include pin **nailer**s, pneumatic staplers, brad **nailer**s, and trim **nailer**s. Each of these **nailer**s is great for a variety of applications including installing trim, building furniture, assembling picture frames, and even heavier-duty applications such as installing wood paneling on ceilings. However, none of these **nailer**s can match the power of a **framing** **nailer** and should not serve as a substitute. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Number of tools being used x the number of nails each tool will drive per minute x 1.2 (safety factor) x the Amount of Air per Shot (SCFM) at the operating pressure (psi). This number is found on the chart in the tool schematic and parts list provided with the **nailer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Visually Inspect and Set up Nailer Look over the **nailer** to ensure no components are broken, loose, or missing, addressing any issues you find. Once you've determined the tool is in working condition, follow these steps to set up the tool before connecting its power source. Set the depth adjuster somewhere in the middle of its overall range (you can adjust further if this proves too strong or too weak). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
