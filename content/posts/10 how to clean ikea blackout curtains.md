## 10 Reference List: How To Clean Ikea Blackout Curtains | Ikea Lenda curtains and shrinkage
-   If you want an eye-catching color-blocked look and excellent room darkening, IKEA’s Marjun Curtains are a solid choice. They’re the least expensive of our picks, and though they don’t provide 100 percent darkness, they come pretty close—they even block a bit more light than our favorite darkening **curtains**. The downside is they come in only gray, blue, or lilac and only in one length, making them the least versatile curtain we recommend. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fill the bath with warm soapy water. We recommend using the instructed amount of soap for a small load of laundry. Blockout Curtains must be hand washed because the machines can easily ruin the layers. Gently squeeze and scrub the curtain fabric with your hands. Once the entire curtain has been washed, drain the bath and rinse the **curtains** with clean water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you shop for blockout **curtains** online with Quickfit, you’ll find curtain panels that are triple lined with off white and black acrylic material that act as tough defense against outside light and weather. The front of the curtain is your traditional curtain fabric, which gives the room a great look. These special **curtains** require different cleaning practices than traditional **curtains** since you cannot simply throw them into the laundry and let the machine do the work. Instead, follow these tips. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sebastian Insulated Total Blackout Window Curtains are among the few **curtains** that completely blocked all light during our testing. They’re the best choice for people with extreme light sensitivity and for shift workers (or anyone else) who sleeps during the day and needs a pitch-black bedroom. They aren’t the prettiest of our picks—the fabric is very, very shiny—but they look better than the other total-blackout **curtains** we’ve found. We’ve tested them twice, and when installed properly they’ll keep a room cave-dark. Available in six colors and five lengths, these should work with most windows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ring the **curtains** to remove excess water. Line dry the **curtains** making sure the coated surfaces do not touch. Hang the **curtains** back on the rod or hooks to dry completely. Keep different curtain panels separated for faster drying. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Start by vacuuming the dirt off both the front and back of the curtain panels. This gets the dust out of the way before you get into the deep cleaning. The easiest way to vacuum your **curtains** is with a dust attachment while they’re still hanging. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Crate and Barrel Silvana Silk Blackout Curtains are the most beautiful **curtains** we recommend, but they block the least light. The fabric is higher quality and drapes better than the other **curtains** we tried, so they’re perfect for adding luxury (and some room darkening) to your home decor. This is our only pick made with natural fibers; the front is a blend of silk and linen, while the liner is 100 percent polyester. They look better and feel lighter than any other blackout **curtains** we’ve tried, but don’t expect them to create a totally dark room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remove the **curtains** from the hooks or rod. Then, place a small drop of soap on the problem spot, rub gently with a warm cloth, and then rinse with clean water. We recommend testing this in an inconspicuous spot on the curtain first to determine that your laundry soap will not alter the colour of the fabric. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cleaning blockout **curtains** is quite simple. Do you agree? Not a fan of the blockout **curtains**? Learn more about cleaning sheer **curtains** and single panel fabric **curtains** in our upcoming blogs. You won’t want to miss these tips from Quickfit Blinds & Curtains, the expert for **curtains** online. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I bought the Lenda **curtains**. They're 96" long and need to be shortened. I've read posts where people say after washing and drying they will shrink as much as 4-5 inches. The washing instructions say not to put them in the dryer. If you want them to shrink would you dry in the dryer (maybe for a limited time like 15-20 minutes)? Or follow instructions and hang to dry? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
