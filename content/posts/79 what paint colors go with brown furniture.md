-   Another great match for **brown** furniture is a cool color like light blue. This color idea works particularly well with light **brown**, or in this case, light wood, furniture.

The pastel-colored bedding ties the whole look together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you think of **brown**, you probably think of trees, rocks, and the teddy bear-**brown** hills of winter (or summer, if you’re a Californian). When choosing your paint **colors**, then you can’t go wrong, pulling hues from nature. Try a cloudy, creamy white; neutral greige; or dark, leafy green, (Gratefully Grass is a right choice) — or, like this room, a combo of all three. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Suede tan club chairs add texture and are a welcome touch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let's take a quick look at how we get **brown** to help us better understand it. Brown is a composite color because its creation comes by combining different color pigments. From an RGB perspective, it comes from red and green. However, mixing yellow, red, and black or orange and black to yield **brown** is more typical. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A classic pairing of black and **brown** looks bold and sophisticated. Here, shiplap wall paneling is painted in the darkest shade of ebony, while a traditional dresser and matching throw pillows add warmth.

-   The combination of dark **brown** and fuchsia is unexpected, but it looks natural in this living room from Liz Levin Interiors. Brown pairs best with other warm **colors** and fuchsia makes sense in this context. The light blue touch in the wallpaper cools the overall warm design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The deep purple walls create a rich backdrop for this wooden chest. Try this look in a foyer to create a look of drama. If you like this color purple, use Brinjal No.222 from Farrow & Ball.

-   If in doubt, take cues from nature and notice how the **colors** exist in the outdoors.

-   Even your bathroom can benefit from the perfect shade of **brown**. This room achieves its elegant design by pairing **brown** with pale blue.

-   One of the best ways to make the most out of **brown** furniture is to team it with beige walls. Beige is like a lighter color of **brown**, so putting the light and dark together makes the eyes wander to the **brown** furniture. The neutral tones in beige basically act like a highlighter which compliments the undertones of the **brown** in wood, for example. Both being wonderful earthy tones just makes them suit each other so well.

-   There's no denying the soothing power of neutral color palettes, and it doesn't get any better than **brown** and greige. This boho living room design showcases the combo beautifully. The grayish-beige walls add a dash of color but still allow the midcentury furniture pieces to take center stage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Milky cocoa linen sofa upholstery could be dull against too much color, but it comes alive with vanilla cream walls -- like a foamy cappuccino or hot cocoa with whipped cream steaming in a cup. The combination of soft medium **brown** and flat weave fabric looks even richer with walls that fill the room with light but are soft enough to blend with the sofa, clear polycarbonate end tables, an antique trunk coffee table and safari animal silhouetted lampshades. Keep trim the same color as the walls but up the shine factor with a slightly glossy trim finish. You could work with velveteen in the same easy cocoa shade as the linen for sofa upholstery. A plain sisal or soft ivory and **brown** rug is serene in this room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
