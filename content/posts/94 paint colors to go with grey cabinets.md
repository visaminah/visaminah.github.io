## 94 Facts Paint Colors To Go With Grey Cabinets | The 16 Best Wall Colours for Cream Cabinets & Trim
-   My E-Design client hired me to fix her kitchen, but it wasn’t as easy as changing the paint colour. Sure, the backsplash and paint colour were well-coordinated, but the granite and cream **cabinets** were doing their own thing and didn’t suit EITHER of the other surfaces. Accessible Beige (and the backsplash) look too taupe/flat compared to the yellow/cream of the **cabinets**. – it’s a bad combination that just makes the **cabinets** look more yellow and dated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you have gray **cabinets**, the color complements both dark and light **colors** allowing it to be an easy transitional shade if you have a light, airy kitchen not overwhelmed by white color. You may want to paint your cabinet in dove gray then pair it with something like a colorful appliance or a complex backsplash tile to give that unexpected contrast. Also, dove gray looks elegant with wooden countertops or marble, and if paired with silver and gold cabinet hardware, it makes a perfect look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remember, the above samples weren’t INTENDED to be coordinating wall colours, they were for a different project. However, seeing these colours in this light ON the **cabinets** helps us see how they just don’t work. This is one reason why I like to keep the sample photos that come in as they often come in handy for OTHER reasons! But regardless, whether your **cabinets** are this warm or not, gray, greige, taupe or beige paint colours in the LIGHT end of things can be a big stretch. This is one reason why it’s SO DARN HARD to partner with today’s popular gray and greige paint colours with cream **cabinets**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Looking for a super quick way to create a grey kitchen? Paint! Just paint a feature wall in a lovely versatile soft grey to transform your space. We love this dusty lilac grey combined with the richly textured wooden cabinetry. But if you don't have wooden **cabinets** just bring in some of those natural textures with a collection of chopping boards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many homeowners worry that grey is going to be boring in their homes and they do not want to make the room boring or uninteresting, especially if they are looking to sell. Grey, when it is used well, can be unique and exciting. There are many grey **colors** that you can choose to fill up the space that you are in and make it look nice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best strategy is to research and work with the undertones of any color you like. Creamy's primary undertone is yellow, which comes as no surprise. It is, however, not as yellow as other **colors** like Sherwin Williams Dover White. (Jenna Kate At Home, 2020) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Lightening and brightening is often the goal in rooms with cream **cabinets**, HOWEVER, these options won’t make your room look light and bright compared to traditional off-white and light paint colours. But it’s not these paint colour options that are stopping you, it’s your cream **cabinets** and trim, they have limitations (and don’t kill the wee Ginger messenger!). Your room might look brighter than it USED to if it happened to be painted a darker colour, but that’s as far as you’ll get short of painting your walls the same colour as your **cabinets** or painting your trim/**cabinets** white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'The trick is to look at the tones within the grey, and go from there,' says Livingetc editor Pip Rich. 'Some greys have purple or blue in them, and work well with those **colors**, other greys have black or brown in them and work best with black and brown.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re worried about making small spaces feel even more small, think again. Imagine a blue color for the island paint, a white subway tile backsplash, stainless steel appliances, white oak **cabinets**, a farmhouse sink, and white dove walls. When I imagine this, I envision an airy kitchen that feels modern, clean, and yet still cozy and inviting. This type of kitchen sounds like a place I’d love to cook and entertain! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The trick is to get the right grey. 'Grey is never just grey,' says Marie Soliman, who designed this space. 'There are two greys, one that comes between white and black, which I call "cold grey", then there is the richer one which is a mix of two opposing **colors** on the color wheel. This warmer grey has real charm and can be used with any color.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As anyone who has wondered what **colors** go with grey will tell you, white is the perfect pairing. Its starkness gleams out against the dreaminess of grey, making both shades seem more sophisticated than they would on their own. Here, the grey marbling of the island carries to designer Suzie McAdam's modern kitchen backsplash ideas, both of which sing out against the white walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another thing is that gray **cabinets** tend to stand the test of time. You have seen gray in most of the Scandinavian kitchens. These kitchens have a cutting edge when it comes to design. Although grays are not too trendy for the conventional or traditional kitchen designs, they still offer unique features, and they hold their own space when it comes to the contemporary kitchen world. So, if you plan to remodel your kitchen, you may want to think gray – it’s stylish, offers warmth, and stands against dirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   White cabinetry can pair well with most wall **colors**. To brighten and expand your room, select a light color like white, yellow or beige. One of these shades will likely make your kitchen feel cheerful and pristine. On the other hand, if you’d prefer to darken the room, try darker **colors** like red or mocha. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grays with purple or blue undertones will create a fresh, cool ambiance, while a warmer shade will feel earthy and warm. Pale gray can be as luminous as white, while a dark shade of charcoal gray can read as black. Gray works with neutrals for an industrial or modern farmhouse look; adds contrast to wood tones; and is a great foil for metallic accents like gold or copper, and **colors** ranging from pink to green, to practically every color in between. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grey is uniquely poised to add this vintage sense to a kitchen, as paint washes and worn textures can feel truly charming. This does take time, however. 'Waxing the **cabinets** was a long process, and a bit of a headache, but we got there in the end,' Mark says. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Their original goal was to find a warm white, but it just wasn’t going to work with these **cabinets**. Through the process of eliminating other potential options (ie. beige), we landed on Antique White 25% lighter which is as CLOSE to white as we’ll get! Even though the match isn’t 100% and varies from one side of the wall to the other, they got the brighter look they were going for! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Does anyone have recommendations for a wall color that goes with gray **cabinets**? Preferably Sherwin Williams (it’s local). Cabinets are Painted Stone by Waypoint. Gray **cabinets** are so popular but all the pics I’ve seen have little wall space or are just painted white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Repose Gray can be paired with Urbane Bronze and Tidewater to create a unique color scheme. Urbane Bronze is actually Sherwin Williams' Color of the Year for 2021. It's earthy and dark, and it would look great on a feature wall, **cabinets**, or as a bold trim. Tidewater is a beautiful blue-green that would look great in a room next to it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When designing a space, the first step is to choose a color palette or scheme. You'll always have a blueprint or vision of what **colors** to use if you choose a group of **colors** that go well together.

-   When choosing the right wall color to match your new kitchen **cabinets**, first consider the material and appearance of your **cabinets**.

-   And while it’s okay with some of the MORE MUTED and lighter cream paint colours, it’s too taupe for others. The reason it’s in this section is that sometimes it’s just that happy medium between cream **cabinets**/trim and surrounding finishes. My BEST advice is to try it 25% darker as you’ll have a better shot by lowering its LRV. Or even better, check out the darker version, Tony Taupe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The good thing with blue-gray is that it satisfies even the most boring or neutral of palettes. It is elegant when you paint on kitchen **cabinets**, and even more when you pair it with metallic accents like gold or nickel.

-   SW 7015 Repose Gray Color has purple and blue undertones, whereas Agreeable Gray has green undertones. This is despite the fact that they are both gray paint **colors** with strong beige undertones. Agreeable Gray appears to be lighter than Repose Gray in general. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

You may want to leave these test samples up for at least a week to get a good idea of what the color looks like in different lighting and times of the day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s not easy when it comes to picking a color for the décor of a room. Before you can settle on a particular palette, you need to pick a style while also thinking about functionality. One thing with gray is that it’s very versatile. It can adapt to every space and style. A kitchen with grey **cabinets** will look stylish in a majority of situations and allow balance to dominate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to showcase your **cabinets**’ color for all to see, pick a wall color that will emphasize them.

A bright, bold shade can make your **cabinets** less noticeable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Repose Gray serves as an anchor paint color for these cooler shades in the final color scheme. Naval is Sherwin Williams' 2020 Color of the Year. It is a deep navy blue that works well as an accent wall, built-in **cabinets**, or furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   High-quality hardwood flooring also looks fantastic when paired with quartz countertops, especially Caesarstone’s 6600 Nougat. The coarse-grained, almost sand-like tones found in 6600 Nougat pair well with wood floors and gray **cabinets**, creating a fresh, nature-inspired kitchen design. To complete the look, add gold-colored accent pieces for some intrigue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Regardless of what you call it, blue kitchen **cabinets**, light gray, dark gray, gray **cabinets**, and so on continue to grow in popularity, and it’s no wonder why. The classic feel of the primary color blue makes blue gray **cabinets** a great choice. The best thing is how easily blue gray **colors** pair with many other **colors** allowing your kitchen **cabinets** to coordinate with the existing color scheme in your home easily. Not to mention how absolutely amazing it looks paired with white countertops, brass hardware, and wood tones (we’ll get into this more later!). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pick a color that is bright and easy to clean off. You know that the kitchen can get messy and you will need to clean off the **cabinets** at some point. Changing up the color to bright white is going to show some of these messes as well. If the paint is easy to wipe off, you will find that it is easier to keep them clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is always a tough one, and at some point, you can only get so close to finding your exact colour match when **cabinets** have a glaze on them. Do your best to figure out what the ORIGINAL colour might’ve been and add a few LRV points for the extra depth added by the glaze. This is an important step as this number will help guide you towards a STARTING point when looking for compatible paint colours. Yes, glazed cream **cabinets** or trim add another layer to the beast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Besides, having a kitchen with grey **cabinets** is great bacause they look good with different countertops. You have seen gray **cabinets** paired with solid surface and marble countertops – these two are popular choices for countertops. However, gray also pairs beautifully with laminate and butcher block, especially if you want a budget-friendly solution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do you think blue paint **colors** are not a good choice for kitchen **cabinets**? Well, think again! White **cabinets** are, of course, still a stylish choice; however, in 2022, people are expanding their neutral paint **colors** to include blue gray kitchen **cabinets**. Having a bold color in the kitchen is a trend that continues to rise. Although painting kitchen **cabinets** a blue gray color may be a new trend, these color choices have deep roots in history and are very traditional. Because of this, blue gray painted kitchen **cabinets** aren’t like other home design trends. These **colors** aren’t going anywhere anytime soon! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You'll be surprised at how much grayer Repose Gray is. Both Repose Gray and Revere Pewter are excellent **colors** for use throughout the house. Revere Pewter can look muddy at times, whereas Repose Gray never does. (Kylie M Interiors, 2020) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'Grey is a beautiful color on its own but it also works so well with every other color because it's the ultimate neutral. This is brilliant if you like grey - but don't want to have it on every wall. Explore **colors** that work with grey like Concrete Grey (opens in new tab), Spiced Honey (opens in new tab) and Vintage Smoke (opens in new tab).' says Shillingford. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Notice how Worldly Gray (left) sits a BIT better than Popular Gray (right), HOWEVER, neither are any screamin’ glory.

-   Creamy will look fantastic in the living room, dining rooms, and kitchen **cabinets** when paired with repose gray walls.

If you are possessed with black color, and you are worried the kitchen space won’t get sufficient light, you can go with gray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

The LRVs of Repose Gray and Agreeable Gray is very similar. This means they will return nearly the same amount of light into the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Almost any color you can think of will look great with SW 7015 Repose Gray. Repose Gray is a warm, inviting color that isn't sterile or harsh.

-   When you combine texture and color into your kitchen design, you can create a beautiful, inviting room in your home.

'When you juxtapose something soft against something bold you create a certain voltage.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Don’t forget to consider the existing **colors** in your home when making your decision. Perhaps you want to establish a cohesive theme throughout your house. Maybe your kitchen is part of an open layout, and you want the wall color to work well with adjoining rooms to avoid clashing **colors**. In that case, you may want to use different shades of the same color to add depth and differentiate between rooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for a more youthful and light blue gray paint color, a great option is Sherwin Williams Stardew. This blue gray color has more blue undertones than gray making it the best choice for lighter blue **cabinets**. This paint color is described as youthful since it is a much lighter blue than the first two popular blue gray paint **colors** I mentioned above. Stardew gives me more coastal vibes, but I think this would still look amazing on kitchen cabinetry in the woods. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1. The trim is WHITER than the **cabinets**, making the **cabinets** look more yellow in comparison. Overall, the trim looks to be a considerably BRIGHT warm colour with a reasonable yellow in it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   One option that can look nice in your kitchen is to use different **colors** like grey and white **cabinets**. This helps to create a type of gentle contrast.

This just makes a nice contrast, especially if you can get some greys that will go with one another. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your **cabinets** are made of metal, find a color that will complement their sleek, reflective look. Typical kitchen wall **colors** may not be a great match with metal **cabinets**. Instead, consider pairing them with a dark gray, red or white if your **cabinets** are metallic grey. For white **cabinets**, most cool **colors** will work well as a backdrop. Metal **cabinets** stand out and attract attention, so you can choose a color that accents them well or tones down their metallic appearance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By choosing complementary colours that sit closely to one another on the colour wheel, you can create a seamless and calming effect.

-   If your **cabinets** suddenly look yellow next to the white paper, they are a warm white. If they look bluer, or about the same as the white paper, they are a cool tone.

You can choose cement gray for your wall **cabinets** or stained mahogany cabinetry for the island. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the reasons why you would want to use gray **cabinets** is because the color does not show dirt as white does.
