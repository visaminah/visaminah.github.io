## 4 Things About Pur Vs Zero Water Reddit | pur vs zero water reddit
-   Hi all, I'm moving to LA pretty soon and I'm used to NorCal tap **water** which tastes (imo) delicious. I have lived in SoCal before and I know I don't like the **water** taste, even filtered through a Brita. Can anyone recommend a **water** filtration system (whether it goes onto the faucet or in a pitcher/dispenser) that makes a significant change to the taste of the **water**? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I live in an area with hard **water**(170ppm+) that really does not taste good. As a person living in an apartment, I cannot do any installations on my own to my kitchen sink, and have been using portable **water** filters like Brita or Zero Water. So far Brita didn't really change the taste of the **water**, so I switched to the latter brand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tldr; Filtered pitcher **water** costs 12.5 cents per liter and bottled **water** costs 19.9 cents per liter. You save about 7.4 cents per liter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The cheapest amount of bottled **water** I could find per liter is $3.98 for a 40 pack of **water**(0.5L each bottle). This would cost 19.9 cents per liter to buy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
