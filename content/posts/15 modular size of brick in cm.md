## 15 Interesting Facts Modular Size Of Brick In Cm | Nominal Size Of Brick In Cm
-   In a stretcher course, all the **brick**s are flat and parallel to the wall; in a header course, all the **brick**s are flat and perpendicular to the wall. As a result, it will take more **brick**s laid side-by-side in a header course to complete the same wall width than if you laid them side-by-side in a stretcher course. It will also create a thicker wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Standard **brick** sizes vary from country to country, with dimensions written as depth x height x length (D x H x L). Standard **brick** dimensions may be expressed in either imperial units, in terms of inches, or metric units, as millimeters. Here are the specified dimensions of standard **brick**s in a few different countries. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are several **brick** types, which can be made using materials including clay; concrete; sand and lime; and fly ash and water. Fly ash **brick**s are lighter but strong and provide good insulation. They’re also called self-cementing **brick**s because of their high calcium oxide — or quicklime — concentration. Calcium oxide is a chemical derivative used in cement production. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let your imagination run wild! Despite their simplicity, you're not limited to a standard-sized **brick**. The Belden Brick Company manufactures **brick** in a wide selection of sizes and shapes, ensuring you'll find the perfect option to bring exemplary character into your project. Use our dimensions guide below for selecting your desired size face **brick** and structural **brick**. For help in estimating the savings that you can attain by using our oversized **brick** on your next project, be sure to use our Oversized Brick Cost Calculator. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Initially, mud **brick**s were made in warm climates where they could be dried and hardened in the sun. Egyptians added straw to clay **brick**s to add stability and durability by helping the clay bind together. Today, **brick** can be laid by hand or with the help of heavy equipment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brick can be ranked according to quality, with first-class **brick**s being the best. Fourth-class **brick**s can break easily and aren’t used in building structures. They can also be classified as facing **brick** (smoother and designed to be attractive) or common **brick**, which doesn’t undergo any special surface treatment or color alteration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All courses are stretchers, as with the running bond, but each **brick** is placed directly on top of the one below it, with the joints in line. This creates a more symmetrical aesthetic look, but it has little structural value and is typically used as a veneer over load-bearing walls. Header Bond: All courses are headers and the overlap occurs at the half width of the **brick**s. This is often used for thick **brick** walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Alternating stretchers and headers in each row. This option provides a slightly more symmetrical look than the English bond, but is a little less sturdy, although it’s still thick. Stack Bond: All courses are stretchers, as with the running bond, but each **brick** is placed directly on top of the one below it, with the joints in line. This creates a more symmetrical aesthetic look, but it has little structural value and is typically used as a veneer over load-bearing walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Alternating rows of header and stretcher courses. This creates a wall that’s both thick and sturdily built, even though it’s just one **brick** thick. Flemish Bond: Alternating stretchers and headers in each row. This option provides a slightly more symmetrical look than the English bond, but is a little less sturdy, although it’s still thick. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A series of stretcher courses, as in the running bond (see above), but with a header course every fifth, sixth, or seventh course. English Bond: Alternating rows of header and stretcher courses. This creates a wall that’s both thick and sturdily built, even though it’s just one **brick** thick. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You might be able to save money by using non-**modular** **brick**s, in part because larger **brick**s are cheaper. In fact, a wall made of non-**modular** king **brick** can be 25% less expensive than the cost of a wall constructed from **modular** **brick**. Keep in mind, though, that larger **brick**s are also often used as facing **brick**s and may not have the same structural capabilities. Special sizes may also increase costs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The anticipated dimensions of the **brick** itself, apart from the mortar, are the specified dimensions. These are used in the project specifications, purchase orders, and when working with non-**modular** **brick**s. Actual dimensions: As you might expect, the actual dimensions are the dimensions of a **brick** once it’s manufactured: the actual end product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While it’s important to keep in mind that sizes do vary, we’ll be focusing on U.S. **brick** sizes from this point forward. The sizes provided are industry standards for common **brick**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Non-**modular** **brick** sizes aren’t standard, so you won’t be able to fit them easily into a conventional pattern or structure, such as around window openings or doors. Instead, they’re meant for unconventional builds that may call for odd sizes. Again, to put it another way, these **brick**s have specified and actual sizes, but not nominal dimensions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All courses are headers and the overlap occurs at the half width of the **brick**s. This is often used for thick **brick** walls. Stretcher Bond: A bond made up exclusively of stretchers (sometimes used interchangeably with “running bond”). It creates less wasted material because the **brick**s don’t need to be cut to size. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
