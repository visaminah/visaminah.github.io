## 5 Unexpected Facts About How To Fix Fertilizer Burn In Potted Plants | Fertilizer Burn On Leaves
-   Fertilizers of all kinds, from synthetic granular **fertilizer**s to composted manures, have three numbers on the label written as # - # - #. These numbers stand for the percentage of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) in the **fertilizer**. These are the three macronutrients that plants use in large concentrations as they grow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For houseplants, choose a **fertilizer** for your specific plant if available. Apply half the recommended strength when you see active growth and make sure the pot drains well to eliminate excess **fertilizer**. Flush plant soil with clean water every couple of months to avoid **fertilizer** build-up in the soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We apply **fertilizer** to promote healthy plant growth including budding, flowers, fruit production and, in some cases, seed or nut production. Plants use a tremendous amount of energy to flower and produce fruit, seeds and nuts while continuing to develop a healthy root system and grow leaves for photosynthesis. Fertilizer helps plants to do all these things. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some synthetic **fertilizer**s are also available as slow-release. These are pellets that dissolve slowly over time and slowly feed small amounts of **fertilizer** to the plant. They will not burn a plant and are easy to apply. These are great for containers. Apply at planting time and later in the summer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The only way to know the proper balance of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium for your specific soil is through a soil test. While you do not need to do this every year, testing your soil every couple of years will help you to make sure youâ€™re adding enough nutrients without overapplying others. Your soil test will provide you with a recommended balance of N, P, and K and the pounds needed for your gardening space. With that information, you can choose a **fertilizer** source that best matches your needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
