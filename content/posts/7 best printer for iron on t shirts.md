## 7 Things About Best Printer For Iron On T Shirts | Best Laser Printer For T-Shirts
-   Name-brand ink made for your **printer** helps ensure the best quality, too. While remanufactured and refilled ink cartridges may work fine, there is always a chance they won’t yield the results you are expecting. If your prints are coming out streaky or the colors don’t look quite right, you might need to replace your print cartridge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   • A design that you want to print and **iron** onto your t-shirt. This can be anything from your favourite photo to your favourite poem. There’s really no limit to what you can print! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now for the exciting bit! Once you've picked a design to print for your t-shirt, simply load the Canon Iron-on Transfer Paper into the Canon Pixma **printer**, check your settings and press 'Print'. You’ll soon see your custom t-shirt design come to life as it is printed directly onto the transfer paper. Using your scissors, cut out your design while being careful to stay as close to the edges as possible without cutting into the design itself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have an inkjet **printer** and ink, you likely already have everything you need to successfully print on transfer paper. Keep in mind, though, while any type of **printer** will work, you may get better results if you upgrade to a higher-quality **printer**. If you notice the photos you print aren’t crisp and clear or your designs appear blurry and you are using a low-end **printer**, it may not be capable of printing at a high enough resolution to ensure a crisp design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are thinking about purchasing a new **printer** specifically for this purpose, choosing one that uses pigmented ink rather than dye-based ink may offer one slight benefit. Pigmented ink is more resistant when exposed to UV rays which means your design–once applied to a garment–will be less likely to fade if worn in the sun. In most cases, though, this advantage is so slight that it isn’t worth going out and buying a new **printer** specifically for printing on transfer paper. This minor advantage is just worth noting if you are already in the market for a new **printer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to using transfer paper to print designs on wholesale hooded sweatshirts, t-shirts, sweat pants or other garments, the magic doesn’t lie in the **printer** or the ink. It lies in the transfer paper itself. As long as you follow the instructions and the process is completed properly, the result will be a transfer that, once applied to a garment, will be durable, washable and last for a long time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Clear a space so that you're ready to start **iron**ing your design onto your t-shirt. You can use an **iron**ing board or any other table, whether it be in your kitchen, dining room or office. If you do not use an **iron**ing board, just be sure to lay down a sheet of cloth to protect your table, as well as a few sheets of paper to place under your t-shirt as you begin to **iron**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
