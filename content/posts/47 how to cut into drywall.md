## 47 Things You Should Know About How To Cut Into Drywall | How To Cut Drywall Straight On Wall
-   The setting for Jackson’s video is a bathroom remodel for which he needs to remove the tile and **drywall** from the floor and walls. The video begins after he’s already stripped the floor to the bare plywood and removed a partial wall, leaving a bundle of wires and device boxes hanging. All that’s left is to demo the **drywall** from the back wall, which is about 6 feet long. He could use a hammer, but “when there are finished surfaces involved,” he says, “I don’t like to hit things that hard if I don’t have to.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you prefer something handheld to other tools, consider the Fiskars Pro Drywaller’s Utility Knife (US$19.98, Amazon). Part easy blade razor knife, part jab saw, this is one of the best tools for tasks such as **cut**ting small holes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To make fast work out of **cut**ting **drywall**, go with an oscillating multi-tool. The Milwaukee M18 FUEL oscillating multi-tool includes a **drywall** **cut**-out tool and a variable speed trigger. The variable speed allows users to set the tool between 10,000 and 20,000 oscillations per minute. This cordless machine also includes an LED light spanning 180 degrees for better visibility. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you can see, the process of **cut**ting **drywall** and avoiding damage to the studs need not be complicated. All it takes is some initial planning and patience to create the opening manually. Let’s dive deeper into how to **cut** **drywall** and fix it onto studs and how to remove **drywall** from a wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether dealing with existing **drywall** or prepping new **drywall**, there are some tools that are vital to the process. Much like sanding tools, **drywall** screws, or carpenter’s pencils, the right **drywall** **cut**ting tool is necessary for a smooth and efficient job. Whether the work is a large task or a simple project, there are **drywall** **cut**out tools to meet every need. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “This makes **cut**ting sections of **drywall** a snap,” wrote one satisfied customer. “What surprised me was the dust collection, even with no vacuum attached this did a great job of collecting the dust inside of the clear dust box. I used this on my ⅝-inch **drywall** and it had no issues **cut**ting it, very comfy grip and following my mark was simple due to the V guide on the front of the base.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “I have 50 years' experience as a carpenter/remodeler,” explained a customer. “This tool is well made and has multiple pilot drills for different materials, including several carbide bits and several sets of different **cut**ters, all arranged in a convenient storage box. The central arbor/driver has a spring to ensure continuous contact of the clear acrylic cover with the ceiling, and the cover is held onto the arbor and spring with a reverse threaded nut.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Locate a spot without any beams or circuits behind it. Once you’ve done so, press the blade of a handsaw into the wall. Then, use your palm to push the saw into the **drywall** gently. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drywall is literally all around us. If you’re reading this in an office, chances are that every wall surface around you is made of **drywall**. And if you’re at home, your walls and ceilings are most likely made of **drywall**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Strike a line or use a t-square as a guide. Cut through the paper on the front of the **drywall**. Turn the piece of **drywall** over and snap it along the line of your **cut**. Then fold the sheet of **drywall** and **cut** the back paper to finish the job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “This compact saw is so darn handy, lays easily in my tool bag, is more convenient than my larger traditional circular saw to tote around that it's becoming my go-to saw for small to intermediate **cut**s,” wrote one reviewer. “It has a nice/precise/quality rip fence and angle **cut** feature and the knobs are quick and secure to set any angle **cut**.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a deeper **cut**, it includes a jab saw. It hinges open for easy cleaning and can store both blades. The carbon blades are designed to stay sharp much longer than average even when you **cut** **drywall** regularly. It’s like having an extra tool along with the utility knife. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Normally you’ll need two people to use a chalkline. But there’s a simple trick to use the chalkline when you’re working by yourself. Let’s say you need to **cut** a 4’X 8′ sheet down to 20″ X 96″. Mark 20″ on one end of the board. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, dry fit your **cut** piece of **drywall** and press it in to the outlet or switch. The toothpaste will transfer to the back of your **drywall** showing you exactly where you’ll need to **cut**. If you have an extra outlet box, use that to trace around your transfer marks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To score a straight line when **cut**ting **drywall** panels, a utility knife is a handy choice. The Fiskars Pro Drywaller’s Utility Knife is actually a two-in-one tool. To create more shallow **cut**s, there is a standard **drywall** blade with a retraction button at the top and a magnet to keep it in place. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “This saw has been perfect for **cut**ting **drywall** and wood,” wrote a professional. “I repair **drywall** full time and I love this thing… When used properly, it's great. If you have the proper blades it's great. The blade change is also good since it has a tab to push-turn the blade unlocked.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One reviewer pointed out, “Professionals love the RotoZip because it can do that task faster and more cleanly in experienced hands.” Another buyer wrote, “This tool zipped through 5/8 in **drywall** and 1/2 in **drywall** with ease.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fold this **cut** portion of the **drywall** so it snaps off from the back. Turn the sheet over and **cut** the remainder of the **drywall** using the utility knife. Hold up the **cut** piece of **drywall** so you can check the fit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most demolition crews remove **drywall** by banging holes in it with a sledgehammer, then tearing it off in pieces. The last step is to remove any chunks of **drywall** surrounding the screw and nail heads, and yanking or backing out the fasteners. Actually, that’s the next-to-last step; the last step is to shovel and sweep up mounds of crumbly **drywall** while trying to contain clouds of dust. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Be sure to change out the blades once they are dull. (**drywall** is hard on knife blades!). A dull blade is more dangerous to use than a sharp one is because it takes more effort which makes it more likely you’ll lose control of the blade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A hole saw is a tool you’re only going to use if you’re working on **drywall** that’s already in place. So for instance, a hole saw comes in handy when you want to make the hole for a recess light fixture. Having a hole saw makes a great addition to any toolbox, but it is by no means essential. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some tools come with features that help control the amount of dust that comes with **cut**ting **drywall**. Certain tools, often hole saws, have a specially designed dust shield. Many power tools include a dust-sealed switch to prevent dust from getting into the machine and causing damage. Consider looking for these features when shopping for **cut**ting tools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With the power and capability of a full circular saw, and at a great price too, the Rockwell compact circular saw is one of the most lightweight and easy-to-use tools to **cut** **drywall**. Compared to traditional circular saws, this corded circular **cut**ter is much lighter and has an inline grip for greater control and comfort when **cut**ting **drywall** panels. The adjustable depth setting lets users choose the **cut** they need, and the built-in port for a dust-vac prevents unmanageable debris. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With the panels removed in one piece, all that’s left is to score and fanfold them [4], and carry them down to the truck for disposal. No shoveling, no trail of dust on the carpet. “I’m able to surgically remove these pieces of **drywall** without building clouds of dust or creating buckets and buckets of crumbs,” Jackson says. “Plus, there’s much less risk of damaging existing surfaces, when the **drywall** is taken out in an orderly and controlled manner like this.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Welcome to the Thomas guide to the best **drywall** **cut**ting tools 2022. Thomas has been connecting North American industrial buyers and suppliers for more than 120 years.

-   “This is a must-have if you're going to be **cut**ting holes in **drywall**, for whatever reason,” wrote another buyer. “Being cordless makes it quick and easy. It also has the power to do any job with speed and it's very easy to control.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing the right **drywall** **cut**ting tool for the project at hand is important. Cutting **drywall** can be a difficult and dusty process. Without the right tools for the job, it can be a major challenge—but the right **cut**-out tool depends on the job ahead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We all need to know how to **cut** **drywall**. It’s going to come up in many renovation projects. Knowing how to **cut** it is one thing. Knowing how to do it like a pro is another! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, **drywall** and spinning blades don’t mix except in the possible case of saws with dust collection systems. There are few circular saws that offer it, but one alternative is a track saw with dust collection. This is undoubtedly a specialty tool and hasn’t yet been widely accepted for this application. It’s certainly an option to get the job done when you need to **cut** many sheets at the same length. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cutting into **drywall** to create an opening comes with its challenges. The last thing you want to do is **cut** into the studs located behind the gypsum board. Drywall is usually layered over wood studs or beams that are used to support the **drywall**, and it can get tricky to remove this layer without damaging the studs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are two steps to prevent **cut**ting the studs behind the **drywall**. The first is to identify exactly where the studs are located and then work carefully around them. The second step is to manually **cut** the surface little by little, using a utility knife or jab saw to avoid **cut**ting too deep and too quickly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This inexpensive little tool is used to shave material off the edge of a board of sheetrock. Think of it as a block plane for **drywall**. It’s held and used in the same way a block plane is used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Jackson starts by pulling the free end of the lower panel away from the wall while pushing on the upper panel just above the seam between panels [3]. The crease this creates makes it easy to **cut** the seam, this time with a regular, short-handled utility knife for better control. After a little fiddling with the drain line, Jackson lifts the free end of the panel and it comes away cleanly. The upper panel comes away even more easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, you want to run a measuring tape across the surface of the wall and studs to determine the width of the **drywall**. Start measuring from the edge of the last sheet of **drywall** and take the tape up to the adjoining stud. Then, mark the center of this stud. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When the blade **cut**s through the **drywall**, begin sawing in a gentle to and fro motion. You want to ensure that your blade isn’t perpendicular to the wall but at a flattened angle instead. This way, you’ll feel a slight bump as soon as the blade comes in contact with any stud behind it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drywall is composed of a sheet of gypsum sandwiched between two paper backings. Cutting **drywall** doesn't usually require **cut**ting through all three layers -- if you **cut** through one paper face and score the core, you can usually snap the back face along the line without having to turn the sheet over and **cut** through it. Unlike **cut**ting the sheet along its width, to **cut** lengthwise, you don't hang a **drywall** square from the top of the sheet to mark the line; instead, mark the line horizontally using tools you probably already have. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What remains now is the **drywall** face paper on the side that you didn’t score, but which you should have no trouble **cut**ting it away at this point in the process. Once more, use your trusty utility knife to get the job done. Only be careful to avoid tearing the paper, particularly if your project is going to involve taping **drywall** seams. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drywall ceilings are made to last a long time. However, you could be just one unexpected pipe leak away from needing to repair or replace yours. Even if you need to hire a pro to handle pipe and ceiling joist repair, removing and replacing the **drywall** ceiling yourself could save on overall project costs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take your knife and slice into the end of the **drywall** board going all the way through the sheet. Slide the end of your chalkline into the **cut** you’ve just made and it will hold securely in place. Now you don’t need a helper to hold the other end! Just unreel the line till you’re at the other end of the board, and snap the line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When shopping for power tools for **cut**ting **drywall**, whether you’re a professional **drywall**er or dabble in some DIY, consider this list of the best tools for the job based on thousands of **drywall** tool reviews. The best specialty tool for **drywall** **cut**ting is the DeWALT 20V MAX rotary tool (US$149, Lowe’s). Among power tools, it offers a strong performance and straight **cut**s as well as a durable design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first point to consider is the overall scope of the job and the **cut**ting power that’s needed. With a large task, a power tool can save time while still providing accurate **cut**s. If the job is smaller, however, a hand **cut**-out tool might be a more simple option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We hope you’ve gained some knowledge from these 6 methods for **cut**ting **drywall**. If you’re a Pro, and you have a **drywall**ing tip, add them in the comments below—or contact us with your own Pro tips. Happy **drywall**ing! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use a utility knife to **cut** through the face of the **drywall**, as this will allow you to apply ample pressure without damaging the **drywall**. If you’re looking for a utility knife, a good choice is the REXBETI 2-Pack Utility Knife from Amazon.com. It is ultra-sharp, double-hardened, and comes with extra blades included. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This tool is perfect for a small job where **cut**ting **drywall** is required. A keyhole saw, also known as a jab saw, is great for quick, albeit rough, **cut**s. This WilFiks Razor Sharp hand saw uses heat-treated blades for strength and durability and has a slim body design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the section of **drywall** bridges a joist, but you only want one side of the **drywall** removed, **cut** with your saw alongside the joist. Be sure to **cut** the inner portion so that the adjacent section of **drywall** is still fastened to the joist. Shown here, the section of **drywall** that remains is on the right; the portion to be removed is on the left. Lee Wallender - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because of the gypsum that the **drywall** is made with, it makes it harder for a fire to spread during an outbreak, this is one important reason why people proof their walls and ceilings with it. It will suffice to add that **drywall** are quite flexible to work with as opposed to other of its alternatives. Drywall obviously comes with a lot of benefits but installation also causes worry because of the higher tendency of dust maturing the place when going through this process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “When using **drywall** stilts on a job site, I hated having cords from **cut**-out tools and strip-fed **drywall** screw guns,” noted a buyer. “This had the same power as the corded and along with the cordless screw gun and strip magazine attachment, I [am able] to maintain capacity and capability while keeping a cord-free floor.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
