-   LVLP **gun**s are a combination of conventional Air**spray** and HVLP Air**spray**. LVLP is an acronym for Low Volume Low pressure which means that it uses less air volume (5-18 CFM) then HVLP (10-25 CFM) and lower air pressure (10-30 PSI) than a typical conventional Air**spray** **gun** (35-60 PSI). LVLP **gun**s have large air passage like the HVLP **gun**s but the air caps have slightly smaller holes. The smaller holes create more air pressure at the air cap which creates better atomization. LVLP **gun**s are not limited to 10 PSI at the air cap but can still be compliant by delivering 65% or better transfer efficiency depending on your application. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What you won’t get is professional quality. The cup is plastic, and the adjustment dials are sloppy. You’ll be fighting over**spray**, and you might not get the atomization you want for really smooth paint.

-   Conventional **gun**s have a transfer efficiency of approximately 45 per cent but HVLP **spray** **gun**s transfer more paint to the job and reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Now all the talk is HTE **gun**s. Anest Iwata's Karl Isherwood explains. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using between nine and 12 cfm of air for a standard refinish **gun**, transfer efficiencies of up to 90 per cent are being achieved, depending on paint type. For optimum results, these **gun**s have been designed to operate at lower inlet pressures, typically around 2 Bar ( 28 psi). This low atomisation pressure, combined with the **spray** **gun**'s flat and thin pattern shape, provides a more even cover of paint over the full pattern width. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Reduced Pressure or RP Spray Guns: Reduced pressure **spray**ers also known as RP **spray** **gun**s are a good alternative to HVLP **gun**s. These **gun**s offer better coating results and higher transfer efficiency than HVLP **gun**s.

-   You might be let down if you are a bit more serious about your finishes. Yes, the kit does include everything you need to do it all. It just won’t be at the quality of the higher priced **gun**s like the Finishline we recommended. The atomization of the material just won’t be quite as good, and the parts will be a little bit more likely corrode. If you aren’t that hardcore, then this set is perfect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The DeVilbiss JGA is a quality gravity fed **spray** **gun** also available in pressure feed or suction feed.

It’s a very inexpensive **gun**, but that doesn’t mean you want to replace it after one use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All HVLP **gun**s have a learning curve, but the Semi-Pro 2 makes it easy to overcome by providing you with everything in one convenient package. You won’t have to worry about dialing in an air compressor or finding the right hose. At 25ft, the hose isn’t going to hold you back. You won’t have those awkward moments when you walk too far around a project and come unplugged. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike the standard siphon **spray** patterns, the gravity feed paint **gun** has a cup at the top of the **gun**. This cup holds the paint released into the **spray** **gun** chamber. The pressurized air will blend with the paint and release it to your surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   LVLP Spray Guns: LVLP **gun**s are turbine driven units that use a low volume of air to atomize the paint at low pressure. They are ideal for small area painting where little patterns are required. LVLP requires low air volume which means there is no need for large compressors when using this type; small compressors can serve the purpose without ceasing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **spray** paint **gun** can be used for several applications, from restoring an entire vintage vehicle to adding details like racing stripes or an embellished stencil.

-   The only issue is that you won’t want to do any big projects with this little unit. Even though you can buy and install a bigger reservoir, the included 12oz cup will have you spending more time mixing paint than **spray**ing. The compressor isn’t big enough to lay down a large volume either. If you need to do bigger jobs, check out the Semi-Pro 2’s bigger brother on the list here. Just be prepared to spend a lot more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Wagner Spraytech Complete is for the DIY painter on a budget. You get everything you need to start **spray**ing at a very reasonable price. The turbine isn’t super powerful, but it’s enough for medium-sized jobs. Mostly, the straightforward design means even first time painters will quickly get the hang of it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is all metal. That sets it apart from other budget options. You’ll be able to take it apart and clean it without issue. The only thing that can be annoying is the plastic cup. Plastic will get stained and need replacing long before the rest of the **gun**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The TCP set is not as easy as others on the list. Three times the number of options means three times the amount of parts to adjust and keep clean. There is something to be said about having those options, though. If one **gun** is not working out for you, swap it for another and see if it works better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mostly this unit is all about speed and volume. You can **spray** unthinned material and **spray** a huge amount of it in a short amount of time. Even the powerful compressor on the Fuji Mini-Mite on this list pales compared to the size of the job that a pressure pot can handle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most recent addition is the LPH80. A compact centre feed gravity **spray** **gun**, it is perfectly suited for use in touch-ups and small area **spray**ing like custom graphics and for use with candy colours. Continual investment in research and development by Anest Iwata has resulted in two new **spray** **gun**s for the users of this HVLP technology. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The biggest drawback to the Wagner Spraytech is the plastic. The entire thing is made of plastic, and plastic has a bad habit of wearing out over time. That should be fine if you only plan on **spray**ing a few projects here and there. It’s also okay if you are looking for a first step into a new hobby. It doesn’t make sense to buy a high-quality, expensive machine like the Fuji on this list if you don’t even know that you like painting, or only expect to infrequently use it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Why we like it: The TCP HVLP Set gives you a **gun** for primer, a **gun** for paint, and a small **gun** for airbrushing and touch up at a fantastic price.

-   This is the only pressurized system on this list. You can learn more about it down the page here. In short, it uses air to pressurize the reservoir and force the material into the **gun**. That gives you the most control over the **spray** that you can get and allows you to **spray** in any position. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **gun** is on the list for those who need to **spray** thick materials like bed liners or rubberized coatings. The TCP Global Air Gun is a dead-simple siphon **gun** that can **spray** anything that fits through the straw in the reservoir. Being simple is also the reason it will probably last forever: there’s nothing to wear out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **gun** is easy to clean. There’s only a couple parts, and they are metal. Simply scrub it down with solvent and call it good. The only thing that stops this from being the most accessible device on the list is the need for an air compressor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your project requires you paint a large surface area, a longer hose length can come in handy. Every airless paint **spray**er has a maximum compatible hose length. If you think you’ll need to paint a fence, for example, you’ll want a long hose length. If you’re painting a car, a shorter hose should work fine. Also keep in mind that any corded electric airless paint **spray**er will need to connect to an outlet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The drawback is that you don’t get any kind of fine control. You won’t be airbrushing ghost flames with this paint **gun**. Since it’s for things like bed liner and single component undercoatings, that’s probably not an issue. Just make sure you tape off anything that you don’t want **spray**ed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **gun**s themselves are easy to keep clean, which is always nice. They are all metal and break down easily. However, you might have to tighten screws and fiddle with the knobs more often. Loose tolerances are an issue you will find on any budget **spray** **gun**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Automotive paint **gun**s can be purchased with either a siphon feed or gravity feed. A siphon feed is a more traditional type of paint **gun** with the cup located at the bottom whereas a gravity feed has the cup on the top of the **gun**. Both have their own advantages and disadvantages. If you're looking for one that is easier to use, you may want to choose the gravity feed. These require less air pressure and are easy to operate, especially for a beginner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll also be laying down beautiful coats with low over**spray**. The high-efficiency gravity feed design will complement both years of practice and neophytes picking up a **spray**er for the first time. It included extra tips and tons of adjustment dials.
