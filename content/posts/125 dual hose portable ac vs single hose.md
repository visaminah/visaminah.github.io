## 125 Things You Should Know About Dual Hose Portable Ac Vs Single Hose | Dual Hose Portable Ac Vs Window Ac
-   Window air conditioners perform the two basic functions of any true air conditioning system; cooling and dehumidifying. Warm air from inside your living sp**ac**e is drawn into the unit, passes through an air filter and then over a component called an evaporator that is very cold. Moisture from that warm air condenses on the cold evaporator coils and drips into a pan on the bottom of the unit. Because of this, the window AC should be mounted with a very slight outward tilt so that water that has been removed from the air in your living sp**ac**e will run out a drain tube to the outside of the building. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Single-**hose** units most of us are familiar with draw the indoor air via air gaps, usually located at the bottom of the unit. The single-**hose** serves only one purpose: as an exhaust **hose** for hot air. The net effect is that indoor air is cooled, yes, but also sucked outdoors, creating negative indoor pressure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Room size: The high efficiency of dual **hose** system makes it more suitable for cooling large rooms. As compared to their single **hose** counterparts, these air cooling solutions are faster and offer better cooling performance. Single **hose** systems are more suitable for cooling smaller sp**ac**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our recommended size br**ac**ket for most rooms is 12,000 BTUs (under the old ASHRAE raw-performance rating), but manage your expectations on hot days. If you don’t care about noise and portability, a bigger model will cool more effectively in large rooms. Just remember that you’re going to need to be working (or sleeping) close to these beasts to really stay cool. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After five summers of testing in the California heat, our tests show that the best portable air conditioner overall is the dual-**hose** Whynter – ARC-122DS Elite. The best window air conditioner is always going to cool more effectively than a portable, but the Whynter will at least minimize the amount of cold air that’s wasted. This 12,000 BTU Whynter is also fairly quiet compared to the company’s big 14,000 BTU model that we also tested. For this 2021 update, we tested a new single-**hose** portable air conditioner, SereneLife 12,000 BTU, and were equally impressed by its cooling performance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Wi-Fi-enabled Midea portable air conditioner seems to have been designed with convenience in mind: It can be controlled via a smartphone app or paired with Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant to respond to voice commands. With 10,000 BTUs of cooling power, it can cool a room up to 200 square feet with a temperature range between 62 degrees Fahrenheit and 90 degrees Fahrenheit, **ac**cording to Midea. It also comes with a 24-hour adjustable timer. The Midea has a 4.2-star average rating from nearly 2,000 Amazon reviews. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Having passed over the cold evaporator, the cooled air is now blown b**ac**k into your room. Meanwhile, the heat from the warm room air has been transferred to condenser coils on the b**ac**k of the unit and blown into the outside atmosphere. The overall result is that both heat and humidity have been removed from the room, giving you a much more comfortable sp**ac**e to live in. Window AC units are generally only designed to cool a single room or living sp**ac**e rather than the entire home, as does a central AC system. However, some of the largest units will do a fair job of cooling a small apartment with a fairly open floor plan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Keep in mind your portable air conditioner needs proximity to a window and electrical outlet. These models also require some simple maintenance, including draining the water from the unit as needed and repl**ac**ing the air filters every couple of weeks. This will help avoid mold growth in your unit, which can decrease your room’s air quality, said McKeon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   12,000 BTU is generated using 1100W electrical input; with an EER rating of 10.9. That’s very high but below the most energy-efficient dual-**hose** units. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Single **hose** system: In this system, as the hot air generated by the compressor is pumped through the exhaust to the outside , a negative air pressure is created. This is attributed to the f**ac**t that the single **hose** system draws in cooled air from the room, to cool the system. Besides causing a wastage of already-cooled air, the loss of air creates a negative pressure in the room. As a result, following the principle of heat transfer, warm air from outside flows into the room through openings and cr**ac**ks found in the walls and doors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Higher efficiency and moisture control: Dual **hose** portable air conditioners are more energy efficient and therefore cool a room more quickly than their single **hose** counterparts. They also will dehumidify, and are much better at removing the moisture from the room than single **hose** units. In very humid environments, excess water will be diverted to a holding tank. This will vary greatly from one brand and model to another. Some models also have the capability of having a drain tube connected to the tank to drain continuously. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Honeywell MN14CEDWW has the 2nd highest airflow (229 CFM) among the top dual-**hose** portable AC units. On top of that, it has very low noise levels. On the low setting, it will generate only 51 dB of noise. That’s on par with the quietest portable AC units. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is the ex**ac**t opposite result of what we get using EER. The LG LP1419IVSM now appears to be the more efficient unit. And in a real world application, it would be the more energy efficient unit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dual-**hose** portable air conditioners are the new-age efficient AC units. They solve many problems single **hose** AC has; including negative air pressure and system overheating. If you’re looking for a capable portable AC unit, the best dual-**hose** portable AC units are the smart long-term choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With outside temperatures climbing from 92°F to 102°F in the afternoon, the dual-**hose** Whynter was finally working in conditions where the different design pays off. The LG held on early in the testing day, but when peak temperatures hit, the single-**hose** system drew in hot air more quickly than it could cool the room. (It was **ac**tually a few degrees cooler outside on the day we tested the LG, but that didn’t help.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Approximately 118 million homes in the U.S. use air conditioning to help cool their living sp**ac**e. Of these, about 32 million use individual AC units; that is, air conditioners that are not part of a central AC system. The two basic types of individual AC units are window air conditioners and portable air conditioners. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A single-**hose** air conditioner can be useful in smaller sp**ac**es, and in some cases, is more cost-efficient than a dual-**hose** model. In most situations though, the dual **hose** system is the clear winner. Dual **hose** air conditioners are vastly more efficient; they work faster using less energy to cool larger sp**ac**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cooling Cap**ac**ity: 12,000 BTU Recommended Coverage Area: 250-400 sq ft EER Rating: 10.9 Max. Airflow: 188 CFM Noise Levels: Up to 56 dB Power, Voltage, Amps: 1100 W Dimensions (HxWxD): 16.5″ x 20″ x 34″ Weight: 71 lbs Price: $ $$$ Rating: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At HVAC .com, our writers create solutions that put you in control of your HVAC system. Our product reviews and recommendations are researched and b**ac**ked by real buyers and industry experts, not dictated by our partners. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Clean the filters on a bi-weekly or monthly basis. If washable, wash and rinse the filter thoroughly in warm water and using mild detergents. Remember to dry them completely before repl**ac**ing in the unit. Some units have a carbon filter, these should be handled as per the instructions on the unit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Secondly, they take very little sp**ac**e. Most portable ACs are comp**ac**t in size and they look slick and minimal enough to fit well into any home interior. A portable AC is also easy to install and most importantly it is affordable to run for it does not draw too much power. And lastly, a portable AC is an ideal choice for an RV or a trailer when you need efficient cooling during travelling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Honeywell HF0CESVWK6 can connect via Wi-Fi to be controlled by your smartphone, which means you can control it from anywhere in your home. The HF0CESVWK6 weighs just under 63 pounds, and you can use your voice to power on the m**ac**hine, as well as change the temperature and adjust fan speeds. It has a 4.2-star average rating from more than 130 Amazon reviews. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once we moved the portables into a 450-square-foot great room, the 14,000 BTU size with its more efficient dual-**hose** system started to show its superiority over the others. But it was still disappointing for an air conditioner in a room that it’s nominally “rated for.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   (Editor’s note: Frigidaire has discontinued manuf**ac**turing this 12,000 BTU model. However, three newer 13,000 BTU models are available at appliance stores. Check Frigidaire’s website for more information.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the Midea Duo isn’t available, the single-**hose** LG LP1419IVSM is another great option for a portable AC with an efficient inverter-powered compressor. It has a similar setup overall, with a built-in **hose** and a top-mounted fan that makes the AC sound as if it’s breathing in and out with steady wafts of white noise and cool air, plus all the same smart-home features. It’s slightly more expensive than the Midea, and some readers have complained about the timbre of its sound (though we never had any problems with that ourselves), but overall it’s still one of the best portable air conditioners you can find. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our recommendation: opt for a single **hose** portable air conditioner for sp**ac**es under 500 sq. ft. and a dual **hose** for sp**ac**es 500-600 sq. ft. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you’re trying to decide between a portable AC unit with a **hose** or an evaporative cooler (sometimes called a portable air conditioner without **hose**), consider the humidity of where you live. If you live in a very humid pl**ac**e, chances are an evaporative won’t work too well since it adds moisture to the air and can even lead to problems with mould growth. However, if you live in a climate that has little humidity, using an evaporative cooler could be beneficial since it adds moisture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The biggest problem with Haier HPND14XCT is the unknown noise levels. The lowest noise level is 50 dB but it’s not known what is the noise levels on the highest fan speed setting. The price of the unit is also above the best Whynter dual-**hose** models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The ARC-14S creates these pressure differences as it exhausts air out of the room. Since it’s a dual **hose** unit it does pull in almost as much air as it exhausts – but not ex**ac**tly the same amount of air. The unit also pulls in air from the conditioned room through a grille on the b**ac**k of the unit. All of this amounts to a pressure difference – less of a difference than what a single **hose** unit would create – but a difference nonetheless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Frigidaire Gallery Cool Connect GHPC132AB1 impressed us not only with its ability to maintain a steady chill throughout the room within one-half of a degree but also with its surprisingly low-volume performance. Although it doesn’t have the same power or efficiency as an inverter model like the Midea or the LG, the single-**hose** Frigidaire somehow inexplicably managed to run at an even lower volume in our tests, beating both of t**hose** portable ACs by about 2 decibels. However, its window-installation kit wasn’t quite as robust, and while it offered all the same smart-home capabilities, we encountered some frustrations with the way they worked. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally, a 12,000 BTU portable air conditioner will cover 350 to 400 square feet, while the more powerful 14,000 BTU units will cover up to 500 square feet. However, this is only a rule of thumb and does not take into **ac**count ceiling height (cubic sp**ac**e), insulation type (building construction), geographical location (ambient temperature), heat emitting sources (people, electronics), sun exposure (excessive windows) , etc. Therefore, we recommend customers be conservative and buy slightly more BTU's than they think that they might need. Also keep in mind, the rated cap**ac**ity and coverage area cannot be applied if the air conditioner is being used in pl**ac**es like a: high output kitchen, server room, sun room or any area that l**ac**ks standard building insulation. What is the difference between a single **hose** design and a dual **hose** design? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With 14,000 BTUs of cooling power (the most of any single-**hose** portable air conditioner on this list), this portable AC is designed to cool a room up to 700 square feet in size, De’Longhi says. The brand also says it will auto-adjust the temperature depending on the humidity levels in the room, and it has dehumidifying and fan features in addition to its cooling features. The De’Longhi has a 4.1-star average rating from 1,700 reviews on Amazon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In general, most air conditioners will come with a window adapter kit, since one of the most common pl**ac**es to vent an AC unit is through a window. It’s usually as simple as securing your portable air conditioner’s **hose**(s) through a window or a door and plugging in your unit. Note that you may have to purchase extra materials (such as plexiglass) if the kit that comes with your portable air conditioner doesn’t have enough materials to fill in the gap in your open window or door. Whenever possible, you should follow the installation manual that comes with your portable air conditioning unit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The single **hose** portable air conditioner pulls air from inside the room and expels the warmed air and moisture outside, which creates negative air pressure. The result is that the air must be repl**ac**ed in the room and is consequently sucked in from cr**ac**ks beneath doors or around windows. This warm air, in turn, forces the unit to work harder to keep the room cool. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dual-**hose** portable air conditioners do cost 10-20% than same-BTU single-**hose** units; but that’s just the unit price. Due to higher energy efficiency, the electricity savings make up for that difference in just a few years. After that, the long-term **ac**tually cost of dual-**hose** units is lower than single-**hose** units. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here are our top picks for portable air conditioner units, which are designed for easy installation and portability. We’ve highlighted their cooling power, the size of room they’re fit for (**ac**cording to the brand) and their **hose** type, whether single or dual. All of the portable air conditioners we recommend have wheels so you can move them around easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Two-**hose** portable AC units can **ac**hieve higher airflow and don’t have to work as hard as single-**hose** units to **ac**hieve 10,000+ BTU cooling output. Better filtration system due to double filters. Intake **hose** has a filter, and the outtake **hose** has a filter; doubling the filters improves indoor air quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are no portable air conditioner units with a window kit that will work for a casement window. Some customers have fashioned a solution using Plexiglas to cover their entire window area and then have a small hole cut into the Plexiglas for the hot air discharge **hose**. No solution is provided "out of the box" but some customers have fashioned their own What else Should I Consider when Purchasing a Portable Air Conditioner > - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most portable air conditioners will only effectively cool one room or a very small open-design apartment. Many of the larger models have wheels to make them easier to move from one pl**ac**e or room to another. Some models also have the ability to function as a room heater instead of an air conditioner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is no proper evidence proving that one type of system is better than the other. It is better to match the type of system to your preferences. If you are more interested in performance, the dual **hose** portable air conditioner is the better choice. However, if you are looking for a cooling system for your small room and your budget is limited, then the single **hose** design is a suitable option for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Learn more about Danby’s dual **hose** portable air conditioner ideal for cooling sp**ac**es up to 500 sq. ft. here and 600 sq. ft. here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First of all, the Whynter ARC-14S is a powerful 14,000 BTU air conditioner. For energy-optimum cooling, EPA would give it a 700 sq ft coverage. Whynter, having pr**ac**tical experience with 14,000 BTU dual-**hose** unit, has a recommended coverage area of up to 500 sq ft. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another feature we liked is the unit’s “swing” mode, which, when **ac**tivated, shifts the vents up and down automatically, allowing for more coverage of the airflow. Unless you’re sweltering, you wouldn’t want to sit too close to the air conditioner. We had set the air conditioner’s temperature to 72°F, and the breeze registered at 3 feet away as a very chilly 50°F. So the SereneLife is ideal for a bedroom where you would pl**ac**e it in a corner — and not in front of the bed — to cool the entire room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We’ve bought new 12,000 BTU air conditioners from LG every time they release an update, including the 2017, 2018, and 2020 models. The 2015 model was our pick for three years, but theLG – LP1218GXR finally repl**ac**ed it for best quiet cooling cap**ac**ity. The 2020 update isn’t a real improvement, but it’s not as loud as the 2017 model was. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Key point – They’re better than single-**hose**, but not as good as a window air conditioner. Even though the dual **hose** portable air conditioner is producing more net cool air than a single **hose** unit of equal size, the **ac**tual cooling effect (DOE rating) is still lower than the listed ASHRAE rating. This is because (a) the hot components of the unit are inside the room, and (b) both the intake – and especially the exhaust – **hose**s are also inside the room. This results in a lot of heat radiated inside the very sp**ac**e that the portable air conditioner is expected to cool. So while they beat their single **hose** counterparts, they still do not equal the cooling and dehumidifying efficiency of a window air conditioner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Summer is well underway, and if you live in a warm or humid climate, having an air conditioner is a great way to stay cool. There are plenty of AC configurations out there, including window air conditioning units, air coolers and portable units. If you don’t want the stress and hassle of installing a unit, you may want to consider a portable air conditioner, which is easier to set up and can be moved throughout your sp**ac**e, experts told us. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Honeywell is one of the bigger brands that make dual-**hose** portable AC units. Honeywell has engineered a 14,000 BTU unit named Honeywell MN14CEDWW. It has an Energy Star rating, high airflow, and is one of the quietest dual-**hose** portable air conditioners. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although some units only come with a window kit that **ac**comodate traditional (vertically opening) windows, most units will work with sliding glass doors and sliding glass windows depending on the length of provided Window Kit. To check whether or not your unit will work with your sliding glass window, view the Window Kit Max length specifications and cross reference that with the length of your horizonal window. If your window length exceeds the max window kit length, additional window kit sliders can be purchased to extend provided kit. Can I lengthen the exhaust / hot air discharge **hose**? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Consider one If you live in a very dry climate. One of these coolers may help by adding some humidity to the room, making it more comfortable. But wherever summer humidity levels regularly re**ac**h 60% or higher, you will probably not appreciate the effects produced by these units. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. The last reason why the unit’s **ac**tual cooling cap**ac**ity is much less than 14,000 BTU has to do with the conditions under which it is tested. Portable AC units tend to perform much better – have a better cooling cap**ac**ity – when outdoor temperatures are lower. Conversely, they perform worse when outdoor temperatures are high. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A dual-**hose** portable AC is best if you need to cool a large sp**ac**e. Overall, a unit with two **hose**s is more efficient at removing warm air and repl**ac**ing it with cool air. One **hose** is used to bring air in from outside to be cooled and then released into your room. The second **hose** pulls warm air from your sp**ac**e and dispels it outside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Comes with a few extras that no other 14,000 BTU unit comes with - a. caps for the holes in its window br**ac**ket (allows you to keep the br**ac**ket installed even when the unit’s **hose**s are not connected) and b. a cover for storage Cons Dual **hose**s – two times as many **hose**s to deal with as a single **hose** unit during installation; because there are two holes in the window br**ac**ket instead of one there’s less room for adjustment of the length of the window br**ac**ket using extensions (see window kit in slideshow below) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cooling Cap**ac**ity: 14,000 BTU Recommended Coverage Area: 550-700 sq ft EER Rating: N/A (Energy-Star) Max. Airflow: 229 CFM Noise Levels: 51/53 dB Power: 1250 W Dimensions (HxWxD): 16″ x 19″ x 35.5″ Weight: 80 lbs Price: $ $$$ Rating: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remember, though, that wherever you pl**ac**e the SereneLife, it needs to be close to a window for the venting **hose**. This model comes with an easy-install window kit that works best with windows that open/close up and down. Our test site had windows that open left to right, and the window kit was tricky to install. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   a negative air pressure is created. This is attributed to the f**ac**t that the As a result, following the principle of heat transfer, warm air from outside flows into the room through openings and cr**ac**ks found in the walls and doors. Dual **hose** systems: This system is able to bypass the issue of negative pressure through its **hose**s. That is, when one **hose** exhausts the hot air outside, the secondary **hose** simultaneously draws in cool air from the outside, preventing the creation of negative pressure within the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whenever you use your portable air conditioning unit, you’ll probably notice that your unit needs to be drained of water occasionally, through emptying a water tray or through a drain **hose**. This is because air conditioners remove warm, moist air from the room they’re cooling. While they’re cooling this air, moisture is also removed from the air and it condenses into liquid water. Self-evaporating portable air conditioners will empty any collected water out through the vent **hose**, saving you the hassle from having to empty the water out yourself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dual-Hose Pick: Whynter - ARC-122DS Whynter is at the top of the dual-**hose** game, and when the mercury rises above 95°F, you'll forgive the clunky styling. Noise performance is good, too. See Price at Amazon.com See Price at Home Depot - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Koldfront is one of the most affordable portable air conditioners on the market, selling for considerably less than big-name models. The corner-cutting shows through when you use it on a daily basis, though: the compressor is quite loud when starting and stopping. It’s not as loud as the giant Whynter – 14000 BTU we tested, but it also can’t offer nearly as much cooling cap**ac**ity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the same way, when a single **hose** portable air conditioner takes air from your room and blows some of it out of your room into the outside air, it creates a negative (lower pressure) atmosphere in the room which causes other warm air to come in. This might come through cr**ac**ks under the door, around the windows, through the wall outlets or wherever it can. And about that **hose** – it gets hot and it radiates heat. And since it’s inside your room, it only adds to the problem of trying to cool the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to the price of your portable air conditioner, it can run the gamut. Portable units are becoming more and more popular, leaving you with endless buying options. Single **hose** air conditioners are often more pocket-friendly than the dual **hose** models. In general, a single **hose** air conditioner will cost a few hundred dollars cheaper than dual **hose** air conditioners. But there’s more to consider than just the cost of the unit upfront. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Air leaving the house must be repl**ac**ed: To understand this better, think of what happens when you drink a beverage out of a full container (cup, carton, bottle, whatever) through a straw. In this analogy, the container is your room, the liquid is the air in your room, the straw is the exhaust **hose** on the portable AC unit, and your mouth is the air outside your home. When you draw the liquid out of the container through the straw into your mouth, what happens? Air from outside the container is drawn in to take the pl**ac**e of the liquid that has been removed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While the most single-**hose** unit can **ac**hieve a 10 EER rating, the best dual-**hose** portable air conditioner can re**ac**h an 11+ EER rating, and spend less electricity. Increased cap**ac**ity without overheating the unit. Two-**hose** portable AC units can **ac**hieve higher airflow and don’t have to work as hard as single-**hose** units to **ac**hieve 10,000+ BTU cooling output. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A portable AC unit needs to blow air through your window, and the included **hose**-and-baffle window kits are all equivalent in **ac**complishing that. They’re not pretty, but they do let you seal the window with the included foam tape. The LG uses gray plastic, while the other kits came in white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whynter’s conditioner, the ARC-14S, has three operational modes — air conditioning unit, dehumidifier and fan — and a 24-hour timer. It’s also the only dual-**hose** model on this list. We c**hose** it for its 4.2-star average rating from more than 10,500 Amazon reviews, more than any other dual-**hose** portable air conditioning unit we could find. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Clean the filter of a portable AC unit by removing the b**ac**k cover. Note that your unit may have one or two filters. Gently remove the filter and clean with a v**ac**uum or by soaking in warm water and mild detergent. Allow the filters to dry completely before reinstalling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Don’t believe the ASHRAE Rating: To state it simply, the ASHRAE rating does not figure in the negative effects that are inherent in the design of portable air conditioners when operating inside your room. The DOE rating does. What this means is that the **ac**tual, or “effective” amount of cooling is truly seen in the DOE number. It’s usually anywhere from 25-50% less than the ASHRAE rating. This is the number you should look at if you are considering any portable air conditioner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For our updated tests we tried three different methods for comparing these designs. First, in early summer when outside temperatures were only hitting 82°F, we heated our upstairs testing room from the inside to see what the **ac**tual peak performance of our m**ac**hines was. Starting from a controlled 85°F and with 2,000 watts of ongoing heat (about 6,800 BTU) from a pair of sp**ac**e heaters, we ran the 12,000-BTU-rated portables for an hour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Double-**hose** vs. single-**hose**: This choice comes down to how hot your region gets. As temperatures rise above 90°F, the single-**hose** models stop being effective. Check out the details of our testing below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When we initially ran tests in 80–90°F heat, we didn’t see much benefit from bulkier dual-**hose** setups. But if you’re buying a portable air conditioner because you expect temperatures to climb above 95°F, a dual-**hose** system can still do its job, while a single-**hose** model will heat up your room. We’ve confirmed the engineering principles behind this with our own test in a real heatwave, and we think the bulk of a second **hose** is a worthwhile compromise in most cases. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Key Point – Portable air conditioners with one **hose** are about half as efficient: The net effect of all this is that it also makes the single **hose** portable AC unit much less efficient than a window air conditioner. This will be noted on the rating sticker that will be found on the box that the unit is p**ac**kaged in. By law, there will be a BTU rating by ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) and another BTU rating by the DOE (Department of Energy). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   According to Prouty, dual-**hose** units are louder and more expensive. They also require more work: Prouty told us that pulling air from the outside produces condensation, which is stored in a bucket within the unit that you’ll have to empty. (In some cases, he said, you can have a **hose** run to a floor drain so you don’t need to empty the bucket.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To produce the 14,000 BTU cooling output, the Whynter ARC-14S is powered by 1250 watts. This skyrockets its energy-efficiency above 10 EER. In f**ac**t, the Whynter ARC-14S has one of the highest – 11.2 – EER ratings among all portable and even window AC units. This can save you over $1,000 in electricity bills over the next 10-to-15 years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Portable air conditioners are often times used for supplemental cooling for computer server rooms / sun rooms or as primary cooling during the weekends when building air conditioning may be shutoff. However most Portable AC's are not designed to **ac**comodate server rooms (prescence of high heat emitting sources) or sun rooms (that l**ac**k both building insulation and have a high sunload) with the listed BTU cap**ac**ity. Please cont**ac**t us before purchasing an HVAC appliance if you plan on using it in one of these rooms. Will a portable air conditioner work for multiple rooms? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Maintain temperature set quietly: An inverter-driven compressor rarely shuts off, so it is always ready to speed up or down to match the heating or cooling demand. It adjusts in increments of 1% or less to ex**ac**tly match the cooling requirement. Cycles are slow, vary slightly as needed, and are continuous which makes them very efficient, hence temperatures are very balanced with quieter operations. Smart Control – Control the temperature in your sp**ac**e anytime, from anywhere with voice control - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Single **hose** portable AC units pull air from within the room (usually from the b**ac**k) and blow cooled air out the front. They then expel some hot air produced by the air conditioning process and some moisture from the room air through a single **hose** that is connected to a special “window kit” that is usually provided. These units have a water tank to collect much of the moisture removed from the air. The tank must be emptied on a regular basis, or connected to a floor drain through a tube or **hose**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   According to Prouty, if you plan on putting your portable AC unit in a sunny sp**ac**e, you should add about 10% to the ideal number of BTUs based on the room’s size. If the room gets little to no sun, you’ll need about 10% less, he added. If there are more than two people typically occupying the room, you’ll need to add 600 BTUs for e**ac**h additional person, and if it’s going in a kitchen, you’ll need to add 4,000 BTUs to “counter**ac**t the additional heat [that] kitchen appliances produce,” Prouty noted. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally, Yes as long as the sp**ac**e being cooled is within the square footage cap**ac**ity of the unit. However, the cold air will not sufficiently travel down lengthy halls & through narrow doorways. If a sp**ac**e has very large openings from one room to another, then adj**ac**ent sp**ac**es will reap more of the benefits. Similar to Window units, Portable AC’s are most effective at cooling their immediate area…Fans can be used to help circulate air. I have a casement / crank out window, will this work? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   EnergyStar has its own sizing chart to help you choose the right model for your sp**ac**e. The chart is organized by room size and paired with the recommended energy cap**ac**ity for your AC unit. Energy cap**ac**ity is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs. As BTU cap**ac**ity increases, the weight and size of the model typically will, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The answer to this question may vary based upon your particular window and screen. However, most of our customers find that they can leave the screen in the window and that the exhaust **hose** of the AC does not extend out from the window. What should I use for a server/sun room? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Noise: Unlike window air conditioners, the entire unit of the portable air conditioner is set within the hall. This means, we are quite aware of every whiz and hum of the unit (when turning on and off, and ongoing sound) The average sound level of portable units are around 53 decibels. However, this level depends on the fan speed. Dual **hose** cooling systems are therefore noisier than single **hose** systems of same cap**ac**ity, as it has two internal fans. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . Dual-**hose** portable AC units have balanced air intake and outtake; they don’t cause a drop in indoor air pressure that might suck in hot air as is the case with single-**hose** units. Increased energy-efficiency. While the most single-**hose** unit can **ac**hieve a 10 EER rating, the best dual-**hose** portable air conditioner can re**ac**h an 11+ EER rating, and spend less electricity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most common cause of these issues is the mechanics of the single **hose** model. A single-**hose** system functions by constantly pushing exhaust out of the room, while also pulling in and cooling more air from your living sp**ac**e. This means that your AC will **ac**tually be drawing hot air into your room from any cr**ac**ks or gaps in windows or doors, and working twice as hard to cool it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In general, you cannot lengthen the exhaust **hose** of units. Depending on the manuf**ac**turer, this may void your warranty and potentially cause your air conditioner to overheat. All Portable AC’s come with an extendable 5 ft. exhaust **hose** length. What type of Refrigerant is used? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An air conditioner’s cooling ability is typically measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs. The higher the BTUs, the more powerful the air conditioner is. On average, an air conditioning unit needs about 20 BTUs per square foot of sp**ac**e to keep things cool, said McKeon. It’s important to find a model that’s efficient for your sp**ac**e, but keep in mind that more BTUs isn’t always better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dual **hose** portable air conditioners, as the name suggests, feature two exhaust **hose**s. One that functions as an air exhaust **hose** and the other that will draw air in from the outside. The air that is taken in from the room is cooled inside the unit and then expelled b**ac**k into the room. Since the process of cooling air generates heat inside the unit, the second **hose** intakes air from the outside which is used to cool the unit’s condenser coils and compressor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The answer varies slightly, depending on if you have a single **hose** portable air conditioner or a dual **hose** air conditioner. A single-**hose** portable air conditioner will pull still air from inside a room, cool the air and distribute it through the room. In addition to this, single-**hose** portable air conditioners take excess warm air and moisture and funnel it outside through a window via the **hose**. Dual-**hose** portable air conditioners essentially function the same, except one **hose** pulls in air from outside to cool and distribute in the room while the other **hose** is used to funnel excess warm air and moisture outside through a window. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The window kit included with the Whynter ARC-14S (1/12). Scroll to the right to see more. The window kit extension fits into the main br**ac**ket (2/12) Two **hose**s connect to the b**ac**k of the AC unit and run to the window kit (3/12) A wider angle of the two **hose**s (4/12) One of the **hose**s connected to the window br**ac**ket (5/12) You can pl**ac**e these covers over the **hose** outlets in the window kit when the portable AC unit is not in use (6/12) The grille over the evaporator (7/12) A look at all of the components that fit into the grille (8/12) The drain on the bottom and b**ac**k of the unit (9/12) The front control panel (10/12) The included remote control (11/12) A cover was included with our purchase of this unit (12/12) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   LG only makes single-**hose** designs, though. When a single-**hose** air conditioner blows air out your window to shed all the heat it collects in its condenser coil, it’s using air it just cooled, and it has to suck in air from the outside to repl**ac**e it. If the weather is hotter than about 95°F outside, the incoming heat will overwhelm the air conditioner and your room will start to get hotter. (See our test results below.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Relatively comp**ac**t, this portable air conditioner weighs just under 53 pounds. It has an adjustable fan that can cool the air down to 65 degrees Fahrenheit as well as ventilation and dehumidifying features. It’s easy to install, **ac**cording to the brand, and it has a 4.4-star average rating from more than 36,000 Amazon reviewers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Portable air conditioners are relatively comp**ac**t air cooling systems that are free-standing and are completely inside your living sp**ac**e while operating. Because of this, they are usually quite stylish and are available in several colors and finishes to blend in with the interior of your home. They cannot sit against a wall, and should have at least 20 inches of clear sp**ac**e on all sides. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Value Pick: Bl**ac**k + Decker - 8,000 BTU An option for t**hose** who can't spend more than $350, but don't expect it to keep your room cold. See Price at Amazon.com See Price at Walmart - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Portable ACs will either have one or two exhaust **hose**s in the b**ac**k. Think of a single **hose** unit as a small room air conditioner. The larger the room, the less effective a single-**hose** unit will be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Apartments usually have limited sp**ac**e, so we’re inclined to say portable conditioning units that don’t take up much sp**ac**e. However, it really depends on what you’re looking for – for example, you might care more about cooling power than the sp**ac**e taken up by a portable air conditioner. With what you want in mind, this guide should be able to give you suggestions on what portable air conditioner is right for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This means that you’ll most likely find yourself shaken awake when the unit **ac**tivates or de**ac**tivates throughout the night. Not an ideal situation. Most of them aren’t so loud that they would always wake you, but if they jar you in the wrong sleep stage, there’s a good chance you’ll be woken up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Working mechanism: Like with all other air conditioning units, both these designs are equipped with a compressor to extr**ac**t the heat from the room. The heat generated by the system is released through the exhaust **hose** or pipe. Now, for a closer look at how e**ac**h design works: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   About three-quarters of the unit will be outside the window and one-quarter of it will be inside the room. Larger window air conditioners require some sort of shelf or special br**ac**es to support the part that is outside. These Top 15,000 BTU Window Air Conditioners are examples. Most window AC units operate on 115 volts and are plugged into a standard wall outlet. Some of the larger units can also function as heaters, and these usually require 230 volts and special wiring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Portable air conditioners either come with a single **hose** or double **hose**. Single **hose** models, which are more common, pull stagnant air from inside your room, cooling and recirculating it throughout. Dual-**hose** units, on the other hand, have one air exhaust **hose** and another that pulls fresh air from outside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you live in a region that sees scorching heat waves on a regular basis, the dual-**hose** Whynter – ARC-122DS is definitely going to be the best choice. We’ll say it again, though: even great portable air conditioners aren’t very good at keeping up with extreme heat. The best window air conditioners keep the heat outside far better, and they’re also much quieter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On a day when it climbed above 90°F outside, though, things changed. The dual-**hose** would still cool the room, while a single-**hose** unit couldn’t keep up. The single-**hose** model starts off with a fast-cooling drop since it’s drawing moderately cool air into the room from the rest of the house. That’s not ideal for efficiency, but if you only need one room to stay cool for half an hour it’s worth noting. After all the air in your house is repl**ac**ed with outside air, a single-**hose** system can only add heat on a hot day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Minimum Heat Leakage, Maximum Cooling. Easy to Install and save sp**ac**e Inverter compressor – Maintain temperature set quietly: An inverter-driven compressor rarely shuts off, so it is always ready to speed up or down to match the heating or cooling demand. It adjusts in increments of 1% or less to ex**ac**tly match the cooling requirement. Cycles are slow, vary slightly as needed, and are continuous which makes them very efficient, hence temperatures are very balanced with quieter operations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A ventless air conditioner (or a portable air conditioner without **hose**) isn’t **ac**tually an air conditioner– it’s an evaporative cooler. However, it serves the function of making a room cooler, though by a different method. Evaporative coolers essentially pass air over a wet pad and the water from the pad evaporates into the air, which cools it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Manuf**ac**turers insist on keeping exaggerated room-size recommendations, which we feel is downright disingenuous. In portables, calculating a BTU rating fit for your room size isn’t as simple as it is for window air conditioners. On the hottest days of the year, even a giant 14,000 BTU dual-**hose** portable (down-rated to 8,500 BTU) will struggle to keep up with the heat in a room where a more affordable 8,000 BTU window unit works very well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All in all, the Whynter Elite ARC-122DS is the most energy-efficient and the quietest two-**hose** portable air conditioner. It has a little lower airflow but that’s why it’s also available at a very reasonable cost for a 12.0 EER unit: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cooling Cap**ac**ity: 14,000 BTU Recommended Coverage Area: Up to 500 sq ft EER Rating: 11.2 Max. Airflow: 253 CFM Noise Levels: Up to 56 dB Power, Voltage, Amps: 1250 W Dimensions (HxWxD): 16″ x 19″ x 35.5″ Weight: 80 lbs Price: $ $$$ Rating: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best for Heat Waves: Whynter - 12,000 BTU Whynter pr**ac**tically owns the market for dual-**hose** AC, so if you're anticipating scorching hot temperatures, this is the way to go. This is a quiet air conditioner that will be able to handle heat waves better than any single-**hose** design. If you're not expecting to see temperatures above 95°F, though, there are better options See Price at Amazon See Price at Home Depot - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The dual **hose** design has two separate **hose**s that are connected to a window kit to the outside of the building. One **hose** (intake) will draw air in from the outside, and a second one (exhaust) will blow air b**ac**k outside. The room air is drawn into the AC unit where it is cooled inside the unit and then blown b**ac**k into the room. The process of cooling this air generates heat inside the unit, just as it does in all air conditioners. So the outside air comes through the intake **hose** to cool the unit’s compressor and condenser coils – which are very hot – then is blown out the exhaust **hose**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “If it’s really warm outside, this gets expensive. If someone is using this device as a permanent solution, the [dual-**hose** air conditioner] will be an energy saver over the life of the unit.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Window air conditioners are self-contained units that are designed to sit on the sill of an open window. Any remaining sp**ac**e around the AC unit is sealed to keep out hot air, insects and dust. The vast majority of window AC’s will only fit in a single-hung or double-hung window that opens from the bottom up, though a few models designed to fit in a casement window can be found. Check out our Guide to Casement/Sliding Vertical Windows here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Single **hose** air conditioners are less expensive for a reason. Compared to the dual **hose** system, the single **hose** is significantly less efficient. This can lead to unexpected costs from higher utility bills, to repl**ac**ement filters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Generally speaking,” Richard says, “it depends on the temperature outside. A single-**hose** unit uses air that you have paid to condition and sends it outside. Warm air from the outdoors is then drawn into the sp**ac**e to repl**ac**e the exhausted air. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re dead-set on a single-**hose** design and you want something bigger, check out the 14,000-BTU LG – LP1419IVSM. The variable-speed inverter motor doesn’t need to stop and start every time the air re**ac**hes a high or low thermostat limit, so it’s quieter and more efficient at keeping a set temperature. This design makes the most sense if you’re using your air conditioner constantly on mildly hot days. The biggest problem is that it’s double the price of a 12,000 BTU option, and it will still struggle in 100-degree weather because of the single-**hose** design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Window kits are usually included with most portable air conditioners. In most cases, you’ll be putting your air conditioner’s **hose**(s) outside through a window. A window kit will include everything you need to secure the **hose**s in your window and fill in the open sp**ac**e in your open window so that warm air or insects don’t come in from the gap. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One unique feature this particular Whynter model has is a “heat pump” heating mode that works fairly well above 45°F. This feature of the Whynter may be a good fit for your home or office. That said, the options in our sp**ac**e heater review will still work if you ever need to deal with freezing temperatures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re between a rock and a hard pl**ac**e with a big sun-f**ac**ing room and can’t install a window unit, Whynter’s dual-**hose** 14,000 BTU portable has more cap**ac**ity and cools more efficiently than other portables. It’s gigantic and significantly louder than our top pick, but this is your best bet for rooms bigger than 200 square feet. It’s also a great choice if you need a bit of heat on chilly mornings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you hear the word “air conditioning unit,” you probably think of a window AC, which is typically situated in your window for a few months every summer. A portable air conditioning unit, by comparison, sits on the floor with a vent that you can snake through a window or the wall. “Portable air conditioners draw in ambient air from either the room in which they’re located (single **hose**) or from outside (dual **hose**),” explained Carl Prouty, a technologist at appliance retailer Abt. “They cool that air down, then send the cooled air b**ac**k into the room, while the hot air produced is vented outside through an exhaust **hose**.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cooling Cap**ac**ity: 12,000 BTU Recommended Coverage Area: Up to 400 sq ft EER Rating: 12.0 Max. Airflow: 155 CFM Noise Levels: Under 52 dB Power, Voltage, Amps: 1000 W Dimensions (HxWxD): 17″ x 29.5″ x 16″ Weight: 60 lbs Price: $ $$$ Rating: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your room is being heated from inside rather than by hot weather, a single-**hose** portable works very well. In our case, the single-**hose** models dumped heated room air out the window exhaust and drew air from a lower floor that stays cooler, even on a moderately hot day. There was still a difference in the amount of cooling these units were doing relative to e**ac**h other; in the last phase of the test, LG’s models continued to lead the p**ac**k even after the heat was turned off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When planning where to pl**ac**e your unit, make sure there is **ac**cess to an electrical outlet and a window. The AC will need to expel hot air, and the best way to do that is through a window. Don’t worry, most portable ACs come with a window kit for easy setup. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The popular, affordable Bl**ac**k+Decker BPACT14WT delivers where it counts—in cooling performance—better than anything else in its price range. But it’s a little rough around the edges compared with our other picks: Its operation is louder, its controls are clunkier, and it l**ac**ks the nice details we like about some other models. But even so, it gets the job done, and it’s a fine choice if you need a portable AC at something closer to a window-AC price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The SereneLife – SLACHT128 is sleek, lightweight, and easily portable. For this 2021 update, we’ve selected it as the best single-**hose** portable air conditioner. Although it’s not as effective as a dual-**hose** unit, it performed very well on an extreme-heat summer day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both window air conditioners and portable air conditioners are available in a variety of different sizes with the ability to provide cooling for a wide range of living sp**ac**es. Prices will vary depending on type, brand, size, additional features and where you purchase the product. Here is a chart giving some sample information on units that are available. Some of these units can be found in big box stores or appliance stores, but others can only be found online. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All compressor driven units (including portable air conditioners) exhaust hot air as part of the cooling process and therefore require an exhaust **hose** setup to discharge this hot air. This air **hose** is often vented out through provided window or through a wall if preferred. All Portable Air Conditioners come with the necessary **ac**cessories for either installation: window kit & through wall installation kit. Setup is very easy and generally takes between 20-30 minutes to complete. Will I need to empty water? Will water collect in the unit? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That said, for short periods of time or in milder conditions, a single-**hose** system can still remove enough heat to provide relief. The department of energy now rates portable air conditioner cap**ac**ity with a “seasonal adjustment,” assuming 80% of the time you run an air conditioner it’s 83°F outside. With that adjustment to performance calculations, the LG single-**hose** design and Whynter dual-**hose** design are equally capable of removing 7,500 BTUs of heat. That’s down from a cap**ac**ity of 12,000 BTUs possible in ideal laboratory conditions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On top of that, it is the quietest dual-**hose** portable AC unit. With noise-dampening technology, the Whynter was able to keep the unit’s maximum noise level below 55 dB. In f**ac**t, its highest noise levels are only 52 dB. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since their main job is pumping heat energy out of your room, air conditioners are rated by their cap**ac**ity for British thermal units (BTUs) of heat moved in an hour. (One BTU is the heat it takes to increase the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
