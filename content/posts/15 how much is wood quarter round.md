## 15 Things About How Much Is Wood Quarter Round | Quarter Round Moulding
-   Before you begin measuring and cutting, you must check the correct angle of every corner. Most wall corners are not a perfect 90-degree angle. They can be off by a degree or more, causing an unsightly gap where the **quarter** **round** ends meet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you do not want to rent or own a miter saw, you can buy a useful tool called **quarter** **round** scissors. It safely and cleanly cuts the **quarter** **round** and costs from $15 to $50, about the same price as a miter box and handsaw set. Plus, you can store them inside a toolbox if space is an issue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Either way, there will be a slight expansion gap. Installing **quarter** **round** molding or shoe molding makes a gracefully smooth flooring transition from the vertical baseboard to the horizontal floor covering any gaps. They add a **round**ed shape and dimension to the transition. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pro Tip #1 - Make sure the blade rests on the outside edge of the pencil mark to prevent short cuts. You want to see the mark after you cut. Pro-Tip #2 - Always cut the end of a piece of **quarter**-**round** yourself before placing it. Don’t rely on the lumberyard to make a straight cut. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 2 - Apply a thin bead of liquid floor adhesive to the sanded side of the **quarter**-**round** molding. Line up the molding against the baseboard and press it against the wood. You can use another board to apply even pressure if you don’t have an extra set of hands. Press the **quarter** **round** in place for at least a minute to create a tight bond. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes, the **quarter** **round** ends without making a turn. Use a return or end cap. It’s a small piece of molding that superbly finishes the end. Adding a return piece is not mandatory, but it makes a professional-looking finishing touch that hides the molding’s exposed end grain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another type of molding is shoe molding. It’s typically flatter and taller than a **quarter** **round**. The main differences between the two are: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To hand-nail molding, drive each nail almost flush with the **quarter** **round**, then use the nail set to sink the head beneath the surface. Use putty to cover the nail holes. Be sure to use a paintable putty if you plan to paint later. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Place the trim piece on the miter box or saw base, so the blade just touches the pencil mark. Make your first cut, then reverse the saw to cut 45-degrees for the other end of the trim. For a miter box, turn the molding a**round** to cut an opposite 45-degree angle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Quarter-**round** molding, as the name implies, is one-**quarter** of a long section of a **round** wood doweling or rod. The cross-section is a 90-degree arc. Sometimes the baseboard is too thin to cover the expansion gap between the floor and the wall, which can be as wide as 5/8-inches (15mm). Other times, the baseboard may leave gaps. Installing **quarter** **round** trim on baseboards covers gaps for a smooth, **round**ed finish to the baseboard and floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Installing **quarter** **round** on baseboards with caulk is not a good idea because it can be difficult to remove should you need to repair the floor in the future. It is not the right choice because it won’t create a strong enough bond like glue will. Use caulk only for what it was designed for: to fill gaps if necessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Easiklip offers 3/4-inch **quarter** **round** molding made from solid oak. It comes in five colors, complimenting their solid oak flooring. These moldings come in 96-inch lengths and will match almost any existing wood or laminate flooring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Like a bow tie on a tux, it provides a stylish, finished look to any room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
