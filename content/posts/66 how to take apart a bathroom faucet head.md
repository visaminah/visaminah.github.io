If the retainer clip (#3) cannot be installed for any reason or appears to be damaged or broken, the water cannot be turned back on to the **faucet** until the retainer clip (#3) is replaced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After you remove the cap, you should see an invisible set screw beneath its location. Take your screwdriver and remove the set screw. It's helpful to put a rag or paper towel in the sink before performing the step to prevent the screw from falling down the drain, which happens frequently. If you lose the screw, you won't be able to re-attach the **faucet** handle. For this step, you can use an Allen wrench or a spanner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before removing any other components, turn off the water supply line that is connected to the **faucet**. You can do this by locating the valve beneath the sink and turning the lever to the right-be sure to turn it until you cannot turn it anymore.

-   Also keep in mind that there are different types of internal valves for single-handle bathroom **faucet**s, including cartridge, rotary ball and ceramic disc. According to Fine Homebuilding, ceramic disc valves are less likely to leak and will generally last longer than other types of **faucet** valves. While different **faucet** brands have different internal valves, most single-handle bathroom **faucet**s can be taken apart and repaired using the same basic steps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Swapping out an old, damaged **faucet** handle is an excellent way to restore the look of the bathroom. Not only that, but in many cases, the replacement process is straightforward. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take your drill and drill through the center of the screw **head** until your drill bit is slightly below it. Next, remove the drill bit and replace it with one that is the same diameter as the screw. Now position the drill over the hole you just made and drill it into the screw again. The drill should cover the **head** of the screw completely. Next, take the drill bit out of the drill. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Took your **faucet**’s aerator apart to clean it? Trying to figure out how to put it back together again? Internet absolutely no help because it tells you that you should have noted how it came out in the first place? Yeah, I’m with you, pal, and you’ve come to the right place. This is how.

-   If you are not used to working with plumbing or taking a **faucet** apart, it can be easy to forget what part goes where, even if you just took it apart five minutes ago. To avoid this problem and the need to call a plumber to put your single-handle **faucet** back together, take a video of yourself disassembling the **faucet** (or just take pictures along the way) to help keep track of each part. It's a simple way to save yourself a lot of **head**aches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tip Unless these supply tubes are relatively new, it will be best to replace them with new tubes when you install a new **faucet**. The Spruce / Kevin Norris Loosen Mounting Nuts Using a basin wrench, reach up behind the sink basin from inside the vanity cabinet and grip the mounting nut that holds one of the **faucet** valve tailpieces to the sink or countertop. Turn the nut counterclockwise (viewed as you look upward at the nut from below) to loosen it, and unscrew it down the threaded tailpiece. Repeat with the mounting nut on the other tailpiece. If access space is tight, you may need to remove the water supply tubes from the ends of the **faucet** tailpieces to provide more space to reach up with the basin wrench. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To unfasten the **faucet** handle, grab a wrench, and grab the bottom of the **faucet** handle using that. Twist counter-clockwise. Use pliers to remove the **faucet** handle trim. You can use **faucet** handle pullers as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Removing a Moen bathtub **faucet** handle is not the easiest task ever. However, if you follow the steps below properly, you will be able to get the job done in minutes. Here is how you remove a Moen **faucet** handle: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the decorative cap has been located, popping the cap off is simple. In most cases, a decorative cap will feature a small slot along the edge of the **faucet** cap. Using a flat**head** screwdriver, simply apply a small amount of pressure to the cap and pop the cap off of the handle body. Be sure to apply pressure carefully and slowly to prevent cracking the cap. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Spruce / Kevin Norris Unscrew Mounting Nuts With the handles and escutcheon out of the way, you should see the mounting nuts that hold the **faucet** body in place. There may be nuts at both handle locations, as well as at the spout. Use channel-type pliers to remove the mounting nuts. Do the same for the spout mounting nut, if there is one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The type of water control valve your **faucet** uses is not always readily apparent just by looking at the **faucet**. For example, a single-handle kitchen **faucet** could use a ball, a disc, or a cartridge **faucet** valve. Usually, though, a single-handle cartridge **faucet** will give you the distinct sensation of the inner cartridge lifting upward when you turn the water on. With ball-type or disc-type **faucet**s, the sensation is inner parts sliding or rotating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your two-handle **faucet** is leaking, feel the water to determine whether the cold or the hot side is leaking. You need to replace the cartridge on only the side that's leaking. However, it's possible that both sides are leaking and you'll have to replace both cartridges. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hopefully, you’ve made it in once piece. If so, next you want to disconnect the large nut that surrounds the base of the **faucet** – this can be done with a wrench. Once this is loose, you can lift the **faucet** from the **faucet** housing/counter (we’re nearly there!). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This type of leak could also be caused by a faulty cartridge, which is also the cause of a dripping **faucet**. The solution is the same for either problem: replace the cartridge. If there is water coming from under the single-handle **faucet** beneath the sink or counter, it could be caused by a variety of problems, including a leaky or faulty supply line or supply line nut. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you locate the cap, take a flat **head** screwdriver and carefully insert it into the gap in the middle of the cap, and gently work it around the edge until the cap pops out. Take the cap and set it aside so that it doesn't fall down the sink's drain. Use caution when removing the cap, as they are known to crack rather easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before replacing a **faucet** handle, be sure to turn off the water supply to the bathroom. Once the water has been turned off, test the water flow by turning the hot and cold water on and off. If no water is flowing, it is safe to begin an inspection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 1: Check the aerator that’s at the end of the spout. Use the tool that came with the **faucet** to unscrew the aerator counterclockwise by hand. Simply unscrew the aerator at the end of the spout and check it for any debris. You can scrub it with a toothbrush and a solution of white vinegar and water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can end up hurting yourself, ruining the **faucet** forever, and also ruin your sink along with it. This is why you should be very careful when you are doing it on your own. Professional help is always recommended on how to fix moen bathroom **faucet** handle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is where you have to be very careful. After the spout removal, move on to the next setscrew and unfasten that using the hex key again. With all the key screws unfastened and loose, the **faucet** cartridge will be very shaky and wobbly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes a **faucet** handle can become stripped when attempts to remove it have caused the set screw to lose its grip. However, this doesn't mean that it can't be removed; it just means that you'll have to use a different method to do so. Here's a method that you can use to remove a stripped **faucet** handle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In many cases, a **faucet** handle is attached via a simple Phillips **head** screw. These screws are often hidden out of sight to add to the decorative appeal of the piece. Common locations to find these screws are beneath decorative caps. These caps might read “hot” and “cold,” or they may even be designed in the same metal finish as the rest of the handle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For the most part, you can remove screwless **faucet** handles similarly. If you are unsure how to unscrew the handle, it's best to check the user's manual of the **faucet** if you still have it available. You can also find the manual online if you can't locate it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A handle puller is a special tool designed specifically to pull out hard-to-remove **faucet** handle stems. You can purchase one for $10-20 at any hardware store. However, most **faucet** stems can be removed with a pair of pliers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The drill bit you'll need for this application will depend on the **faucet** you have. However, you'll likely need a cobalt, Phillips, or Allen-**head** bit for this task. Make sure that the bit is just large enough to fit securely inside the stripped **faucet** **head**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the screw is removed, your **faucet** handle is free. Pulling the handle with bare hands should remove it, but if it doesn’t, use pliers. If it still does not come out, use a **faucet** handle puller. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some bathroom **faucet**s may come screwless to offer aesthetic appeal. At first glance, figuring out how to remove the **faucet** handle may seem a bit daunting. Continue reading to learn the basic steps to remove a screwless **faucet** handle quickly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To remove the Moen bathroom **faucet** handle, start by using a strap wrench counter-clockwise on the bottom of the **faucet** handle to unfasten the **faucet** handle. Then remove the **faucet** spout using a hex key. Disassemble the **faucet** system using the hex key and take out the C-clips. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is not uncommon for shutoff valves to grow old and stop functioning correctly. If you find that water continues to dribble even after closing the shutoff valves, then you'll need to shut off the main water supply valve to continue this repair. It also means you will need to replace the fixture shutoff valves as part of your **faucet** replacement project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A bottom-mount **faucet** uses a design in which the bulk of the **faucet** body is found below the sink. Here, you'll need to remove the handles and spout, then loosen and remove the mounting nuts holding the **faucet** from above. When these mounting nuts are removed, the **faucet** body can be dropped down and removed from below the sink. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you notice that it is very weak, or it is cracked, you will need to replace it in order to make sure that your **faucet** is working properly. The only time you can repair a cartridge is if it is build-up. All other issues should get a replacement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No matter what type of **faucet** you have, you'll need to start by shutting off the water to the **faucet**. Do this by turning off the two shutoff valves located beneath the sink, or by shutting off the main water supply valve to the house. The shutoff valves are closed when you turn the handles clockwise as far as they will go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first thing to do when you realize that you have a leaky **faucet** is investigate the source of the leak. If the water is dripping from the spout, that's a pretty clear sign that the internal valve isn't shutting off the water completely, and the **faucet** cartridge needs to be replaced. If you have a leak around the **faucet** base or underneath the **faucet**, it could either be water running from the **faucet** body or from a different source. Because different leaks require different repairs, it's important to determine where it's leaking before taking the **faucet** apart. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Spruce / Kevin Norris Remove Faucet Body Remove the **faucet** body from under the sink. Sometimes the **faucet** will fall on its own once the mounting nuts are removed; other times, you will need to tug on it gently to free it. It's a good idea to place a thick towel beneath the **faucet** so that it doesn't damage your cabinet or floor if the **faucet** assembly drops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Removing a bathroom **faucet** handle is a pretty easy task. Although I have mentioned it in the beginning, some of the older models from Moen are not exactly the ideal **faucet**s to take apart by yourself. These need to be disassembled entirely just to remove the **faucet** handles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Look under the sink to locate the shutoff valves on the water supply lines for the **faucet**. Most shutoff valves have a small, football-shaped handle or a lever that rotates. Close the valve for the **faucet** tap you will be working on by turning the handle clockwise until it stops. If your shutoff valves have levers instead of knobs, rotate the levers until they are perpendicular to the water pipes or tubing (the direction of the water flow). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One economical way to update the look of your bathroom is to replace the **faucet** handles. When replacing bathroom sink **faucet** handles, you must purchase replacements that are the same type as what you currently have on the **faucet**. Rotary handles rotate farther than lever handles. All **faucet** manufacturers use a single screw to secure the handle to the **faucet**. Replacement handles are available at plumbing supply stores and home improvement centers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hey, I told you it would be easy. You should probably be able to handle this job (see what I did there?) in less than 30 minutes with ease. If you can use a screwdriver and pliers, then you can remove a Moen bathroom **faucet** handle and stem. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dual-handle **faucet**s are a little more tricky. However, to begin ensure the water is turned off using the two shut-off valves located below the sink. Next, just like with when dissembling a single-handle **faucet**, remove the screw from the middle the **faucet** allowing you to lift the handle offt, if this doesn’t work some handles must be removed by unthreading the shroud below the handle, achieved by slowly lifting the handle and shroud trim off together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remove the screw from the middle of each **faucet** handle with a screwdriver. Lift the handles off the **faucet**s. Remove a corroded handle with a handle puller. Compress the two jaws at the bottom of the puller around the base of the handle. Turn the handle at the top of the puller in a clockwise direction to draw the handle off the **faucet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After you untwist the set screw, Grab a rag or towel wrap it around the bottom of the handle to avoid scratching it before its removal. Next, gently grab and remove the **faucet** handle from its position. It's best to do this with a **faucet** handle puller or a pair of pliers, as you'll need a firm grip to get it to wiggle it out of its position. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When this happens, it is time to change out the old bathroom **faucet** handles for new ones. The good news is that for most bathroom **faucet** designs, swapping out these handles is simple. The following guide will outline how to change out a bathroom **faucet** handle, what important considerations to make when searching for replacements, and how to determine whether or not a bathroom **faucet** handle is interchangeable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ans: Tightening a loose bathroom **faucet** is super easy. Once you remove the **faucet** handle, you will be able to find the screw that keeps the **faucet** stem in place. Tighten that with a screwdriver or a hex key and you will be good to go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the cartridge is out, rotate it 180 degrees so that the two tabs are aligned with the slot on the body of the valve. Next, place the cartridge back inside the valve and secure it in place. If there is a retaining ring there, be sure to thread it on securely and then place the **faucet** handle back on top of the cartridge stem. Lastly, secure the handle in place with the set screw and then place the decorative cap back on top of the screw. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take a rag or clean cloth and place it around the edge of the **faucet**. Next, grab your needle nose pliers and place a firm grip on the **faucet** and slowly pull it away from its position. You may need to jiggle the **faucet** from side to side to break it out if its set screw connection, so be sure to use caution when performing this step. Take the pliers and grab the end of the remaining set screw to twist it up slowly and out of the **faucet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have water at the base of your **faucet**, check to see if it is running down the spout and puddling at the base. This can be caused by a loose or faulty aerator or even by a small pinhole in the spout. If all looks good and the problem is not a leaky **faucet** spout, then the problem could be a loose retaining nut under the dome cap. Remove the **faucet** handle and the dome cap and check to make sure the nut is tight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use your flat **head** screwdriver to remove the decorative button or cap on top of the **faucet**. Next, loosen the set screw inside the handle with a small screwdriver. Hold the handle to the cartridge stem with a pair of needle-nose pliers and slowly wiggle it out of its position. Use caution when removing the handle so that you do not scratch the surface with your pliers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the cap has been removed, this should expose a screw. Start by unscrewing this piece and pulling the handle off of the rest of the **faucet** body. This will often expose an escutcheon (or small metal cover) at the base of the handle. On this plate, look for a small hole where another screw is located. These screws usually need to be removed with the use of a small Allen key. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 2: Shut off the supply valves under the sink. Turn the **faucet** handle on to completely drain the lines. With the aerator removed and the **faucet** handle in the on position, turn the water supply back on. The sudden burst of water may remove the debris that’s gotten stuck inside. If you still hear the noise, the debris may be trapped inside the **faucet** itself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ans: Hex keys are usually used to unfasten all the set screws in a **faucet** handle. These come in sets where each key has a different diameter. To remove a stuck hex key, just use a couple of drops of lubricant, or any sort of oil that will help it to penetrate through the rod. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the leak is minor, you can definitely try a DIY approach. If it is severe, you will always want to call in a professional! Did you know that the most common cause of a leaking **faucet** is a worn or missing O-ring? This is definitely DIY-friendly repair if you are feeling ready for it. Steps include: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you can identify the **faucet**’s brand name, parts will be easier to find. Often no brand name is visible, so you’ll have to take out the stem and show it to your store sales rep. Another solution is to purchase a universal replacement kit. While not as long-lasting or reliable as brand-name parts, it will do the trick in a pinch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Spruce / Kevin Norris Remove Handles and Spout Working from above, remove the valve handles and spout from the **faucet**. Look for a hidden set screw that holds the handle or handles in place. The set screw for the spout is sometimes found under an escutcheon ring that can be lifted to expose the screw. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is the last step of **faucet** removal. Once you have unfastened all the screws and look at the handles and locate the c-clip. Slowly take these out. Use a flat-**head**ed screwdriver to pull it out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It can also be that the rubber or plastic gasket under the **faucet** is cracked or faulty, allowing water that puddles on the counter or sink rim to leak through. To fix this problem, you will need to remove the **faucet** and replace the gasket or seal it with plumbers' putty before reinstalling. For a homeowner who is uncomfortable working with plumbing, this will probably require calling in a plumber to fix the leak. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes a **faucet** handle may be installed backward by an inexperienced plumber or DIYer. However, the **faucet** can be reversed in a matter of minutes. Here's how to perform this quick fix. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Repairing a leaky single-handle bathroom sink **faucet** is often a lot simpler than you think. With the right tools and parts, a **faucet** repair can be completed in just a few minutes by most homeowners, even those with little or no plumbing experience. By doing the work yourself, you will save money on the cost of a plumber and stop that annoying drip in less than an hour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes you may need to remove a **faucet** handle to change the filter or troubleshoot a leakage issue. Other times you may simply want to replace the **faucet** completely. But how do you do this if the handle has no screws? We've looked into the best method to remove screwless **faucet** handles, and in this post, we will share it with you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most bathroom **faucet**s that have two handles are cartridge-style **faucet**s. Each **faucet** handle (hot and cold) has its own cartridge, a valve that turns with the handle to control the flow of water into the **faucet** spout. If you have a very old two-handle **faucet**, it may be a compression-type rather than a cartridge. You'll know when you remove the **faucet** handle, as cartridges are usually plastic and held in place with a metal retaining nut, while compression **faucet**s usually have a metal valve with a flat rubber washer on the bottom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cartridge **faucet**s come in both single-lever and two-handle versions, and various models use different types of plastic or brass-body cartridges. In a single-handle **faucet**, the handle raises or lowers the cartridge within the **faucet** body to start and stop the flow of water. Both hot and cold water flow into the same cartridge, and a turn of the handle controls the mixture and temperature. Two-handle cartridge **faucet**s operate similarly, but in this design, there are two cartridges, each controlling the flow of either hot or cold water. In these, the motion of the handle twists the cartridge rather than lifting it up and down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With all the previous parts removed, there should be only a **faucet** stem left. Here, a new escutcheon plate can be installed, followed by the replacement handles. Before screwing the handles into place, make sure that they will be facing the right direction when the water is off and on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
