## 5 Tips to Best Hobby Knife For Miniatures | Miniature Hobby Accessories
-   The Hobby Knife is essentially a surgical scalpel made for **miniatures**. Ideal for cutting in plastic or tiny metal bits. Razor sharp and very precise, it is a fundamental tool for all wargamers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re an avid craft hobbyist, you’re no stranger to the convenience of a hobby **knife**. For those new to crafts, you may not know why straight razor blades are inferior to specialty scrapbooking tools. Also, a pair of scissors doesn’t always (forgive the pun) cut it for many applications. Here are several pointers on why using a hobby **knife** is better for all kinds of hobbies and crafting creations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A craft blade or a paper craft **knife** has many features that set it apart from a standard retractable blade. First, a textured handle allows for a more comfortable grip. It should fit in your hand like a pen, allowing you to hold it safely and comfortably for optimal control. Curved and straight-edge hobby knives provide the opportunity for detailing that you want for all types of projects. Where a razor blade is solely practical for making straight cuts, a hobby blade helps you cut out everything from perfect circles to delicate, intricate patterns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is also important to point out that traditional blades do not stay sharp as long as ceramic hobby **knife** blades, making them less cost-effective and precise over time. Also, the design of a traditional box cutter performs well only under the conditions it was designed for: it cuts dense, thick cardboard. A precision **knife**, on the other hand, works with thinner materials like craft paper and card stock. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Need to make a really precise cut? Faced with a mould line in a tight crevice? Looking to slice apart bits for the perfect kitbash? You need a sharp hobby **knife**. The new Citadel modelling Knife comes with six blades, and is safer and easier to use than ever before. Each blade fits into a single-slot screw barrel, with a securing thread in the middle of the handle to make sure it won’t come loose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
