## 52 Things You Should Know About Design Ideas For Brown Leather Furniture | Living Rooms With Leather Furniture Decorating Ideas
-   Just because it’s **leather** **furniture** doesn’t mean you can’t have some fabric, and throw pillows are a wonderful way to bring in color and softness. One word of advice: avoid super slick pillow covers (like a sateen finish) as it will drive you bananas trying to keep them in place on the smooth **leather**. Thicker, highly textured fabrics make the best throw pillows for **leather** couches. In our new ranch living room, I decorated the **leather** sectional and accent chairs with velvet pillows, linen pillows, and a patterned one from Pottery Barn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll also find that a light rather than a dark brown **leather** sofa tends to work better with modern styles as it seems to blend easier with the surroundings. Overall, this style involves making **furniture** less bulky and a lot less detailed. It’s all about sleek lines and subtle geometric shapes that avoids a brown **leather** couch taking over a room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark brown **leather** sofas pair wonderfully with an oriental rug, while the lighter tan **leather** couches look fantastic above a cream or off-white rug. Depending on your space, you can opt for a distressed **leather** material, or go for the smooth and solid modern version. Both are equally stunning additions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These pillows match the sofa in terms of color, but they have a different pattern. This subtle difference is just enough to add some decorative character to the sofa. One pillow even has a strip of suede that's lighter than the surrounding **furniture**; the effect is a well-balanced, warm look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you have a light or dark brown **leather** sofa, it’s important to avoid cold colors. People often think that going for contrasting colors is a great way to create interest. But if you add bright white or fresh blue, you’re going to risk creating something that just looks awfully confusing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A dark brown **leather** sofa will quickly become the focal point of a living room. And in many cases, that’s exactly what you want to achieve. But you should still aim to balance the view and experience of sitting in your newly decorated area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Far from being boring, brown can be warming, comforting and cosy, which is pretty much everything you want from a family sofa. The joy of a classic brown **leather** sofa like this one is that you can dress it up or dress it down, depending on the look you want... super smart or relaxed and casual. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But you also want to look at breaking up patterns. So, if you have a tufted classic **leather** sofa, then try adding a light shade and smooth surface blanket. Or, if you have a very smooth monotone **leather** sofa, then try adding a textured or pleated blanket. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown couches and chairs are popular for a reason: they never go out of style and they can be dressed up or down to match your ideal aesthetic. With the right accessorizing and a fresh coat of paint, suddenly the addition of a new loveseat or armchair brings with it a whole new vibe. Turn up the modern in your space or create a cozy cabin feel — with brown **leather**, you really can’t go wrong. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That cinnamon-brown sectional is begging for company. Brighten up your brown **leather** couch with a generous number of throw pillows. Mix up your style by blending solid colors and patterns. Place a warm gray pillow behind a yellow and white striped pillow, or a deep navy pillow next to a red and turquoise floral number. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You saw it, you loved it, you just had to buy it. But, what exactly do you put with that lovely brown sofa to make your living room decor work for you? Your sofa is almost certainly going to be the largest piece of **furniture** in the room (unless you have a huge bookcase to contend with) so there’s no sneaking it into an existing room design by just crossing your fingers and hoping for the best. No. Your beautiful brown sofa should be given a warm welcome with a complementary colour scheme, and we’re here to show you how with the help of some brown sofa centric visualisations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here’s the deal, when decorating a space that has a brown couch as a focal point, you have to balance the heaviness of the brown **furniture**. You can balance the **furniture** with different shades of paint, window treatments, accessories, rugs, and even pillows. Consider this, if you have a dark chocolate brown sofa, dark moody walls, and then layer on darker accents like a rug – your space will feel dark. That is not always a bad thing. If you are looking for a moody and warm space, then that may work for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Speaking of throw pillows, soft textiles are a wonderful way to provide the cozy comfort that some people miss with **leather** **furniture**. I love using velvet, linens, and heftier cotton blends for throw pillows; they provide great textural contrast while still staying put on the sofa or chair fairly well. I also bring lots of throw blankets and a texture-rich rug into the space, all adding to the cozy factor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the most classic and timeless ways to complement a dark **leather** sofa is with a pair of table lamps. A pair of lamps flank this sofa, which adds valuable lighting along with elegant visual appeal. The symmetrical styling adds a sense of order to the space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **leather** sofa stands out as the visual focal point against the surrounding decor due to its dark coloring. The elegant window scarves behind the sofa serve as the perfect backdrop, creating a deep sense of luxury in the space. The layout of the **furniture** invites free-flowing conversation in this room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, if you are looking to lighten up your room without swapping your sofa, there are things you can do to make your space feel brighter. You can add elements to counterbalance the darkness of a brown sofa. Accents such as throw pillows, coffee tables, side tables, and drapes can all help bring a feeling of lightness to your space. This will bring the focus to the textures and the warmth of your space so that your dark brown sofa doesn’t feel so heavy in the room. In this post, we’ll answer the following questions: What colors go best with a brown sofa? How do you brighten up brown **furniture**? What colors look good on a brown couch? How do I style a room with a brown **leather** couch? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Practical Considerations: Your sofa should be easy to clean and pleasant to use. Look for a piece of **furniture** that will be comfortable and that fits your lifestyle. If you have pets, you’ll want a material that you can wipe easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tan **leather** sofas are having a comeback as an integral part of the vintage, rustic interior look many people want for their living room. Since the color is neutral, it’s relatively easy to incorporate a brown **leather** sofa into your existing living or office space. What’s great about these sofas is how they can be dressed up or down according to your style and aesthetic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This dark brown **leather** sofa is accompanied by two accent chairs that help fill the space. In the middle of the space is a circular coffee table whose shape adds visual interest. The soft warm light in the corner coupled with all of the brown **furniture** makes this space look warm and inviting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is not your average dark **leather** sofa. What makes this sofa unique is the cushions. The cushions' lighter color and interesting pattern are the perfect complements for the sofa's darker base. If you love the look of **leather**, but don't adore its texture, this style of couch is perfect for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike regular upholstery, I usually recommend pillows with a lot of texture for a **leather** couch. You can really go with any color combination you wish but I really have a love for neutrals or warm earth tones on **leather**. Colors like tan, sand, beige, and even copper look great as calming, warm accents to soften brown **leather** couches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In a family room, the mood is all about laid-back living, so a scheme that feels cheery and warm is perfect. Putting a rich earthy colour on the walls will instantly make a den feel cocooning and cosy. Spicy reds and saffron yellow cushions will set off the rich **leather**, just switch up the cushions now and again to keep it current. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paint the living room walls a rich pure milky white, add a **leather** couch in any shade of brown, and create a space of simplistic beauty. Keep the palette brown and white but change the intensity of the colors and mix them. Pair a medium or light-colored brown couch with plain chocolate brown colored curtains. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For as long as I can remember, I’ve lived with **leather** sofas. As a kid, we had a navy **leather** couch which survived me and all three of my brothers – plus the four dogs – for almost two decades. In fact, other than the time my youngest brother carved my middle brother’s name into it (he was smarter than to sign his handiwork with his own name… but the backwards J gave him away), that sofa held up beautifully. And now, with four kids of my own, I’m still choosing brown **leather** couches for their longevity (and psst… you can read about how I care for and clean my **leather** **furniture** here). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This space is made cozy and homey due to the abundance of rich, deep brown hues against the lush green natural vista. The dark green wall eases the visual transition. The lamps, vase, and other small decor items give the space more dimension and perfectly complement the dark brown **leather** sofa. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The backdrop isn’t just about the walls. Hang crisp, light-colored curtains and choose light-toned wall art to offset the rich neutral tones of a brown couch. You can also create contrast with materials, by draping cozy tan throw blankets across your **leather** **furniture** or choosing a lusciously soft area rug. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best way to deal with this is to add an area rug to the living room. Ideally, place the rug under a coffee table and close to the **leather** sofa. This works better than standing the brown couch directly on the area rug, as you would end up hiding most of the effect you’re trying to achieve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Look to the colours of nature for a failsafe pairing. Deep forest green on walls will make a living room feel cosy and enveloping in winter, but cool and shady in summer. Team with a brown chestnut **leather** sofa and wooden **furniture** with orangey undertones to bring bold green alive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Secondly, aim for a pattern contrast. Typical classic brown sofas might have tufted **leather**, intricate stitching, and nailhead trim. This style will stand out a lot more on a painted wall rather than some intricate wallpaper or paneling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pale lemon is beautifully matched with a tan **leather** couch. Paint the walls in a rustic dark brown as a backdrop to the tan sofa and lay a chocolate-colored jute rug on the floor to blend in with the tan sofa and brown walls. Layer the couch with pillows in shades of solid pastel lemon and floral prints. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘Paired nicely with rich greens or rose pinks for those looking for a colour, we like to style our lighter brown fabrics and brown **leather** sofas with neutral beiges, creams and accents of patterning and texture to create a rustic, bohemian-inspired look,’ says Patricia Gibbons on the Design team at Sofa.com (opens in new tab). ‘Think deep **leather** Moroccan pouffes, geometric shaggy Berber rugs, rattan accessories, macrame wall hangings and houseplants galore. An effortlessly pulled together aesthetic which remains timeless and stylish.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This homeowner has chosen black as the accent color of choice, and it goes perfectly in this space. The pillows, throw blanket, and coffee table all have black parts that accentuate the elegant brown **leather** of the couch. The stacked firewood in the corner of the room is the perfect amount of natural flare that completes the look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A classic tan **leather** sofa can make the ultimate foundation piece for any living room seating idea. Leather adds instant character to a room and as the finish weathers and ages over time, it will gain character and look more and more appealing. Opt for a style that will have longevity. Whether the classic shape and formal buttoned upholstery of a Chesterfield or the more clean, tailored lines of a mid-century modern design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink is commonly associated with femininity and emotions of love, affection, and joy. But what better feeling than this to evoke for a living room! Adding pink to your brown **leather** couch enhances a welcoming feel. There are different tones of pink that will match perfectly with browns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This dark brown **leather** sofa is accompanied by other brown **leather** **furniture**. The striped throw pillows on the sofa help break up the brown with a splash of a lighter color. And since the whole space is rather large, the area rug in front of the sofa helps tie it all together for a seamless aesthetic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your instinct may be to match your deep brunette sofa with a dark **leather** armchair or matching loveseat, but the similar color tones may overwhelm your style. Instead, consider pairing your brown couch with a gray armchair or white loveseat. The two colors together can balance each other out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown **furniture** adds warmth to your space, whether you go with a simple tan sectional or a dramatic deep chocolate loveseat. And **leather** is a common material for luxury **furniture**, as it’s comfortable, long-lasting and easy to clean. But once you select the brown **leather** **furniture** you love, how do you accessorize around it? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Until the fabric sectional we got in our family room last year, I’ve had only dark **leather** sofas for as long as I can remember (and I actually still have one in our formal living room at our house). And as I confessed recently, I kind of miss the low-maintenance of **leather** in our family room. But although I find fabric easier to decorate than **leather**, I’ve gathered a few brown **leather** couch decorating suggestions along the way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I actually adore the look of our newest **leather** sofa (read all about it here if you’re interested), but most of my years of brown **leather** sofas have been spent trying to minimize their presence in the room. I think **leather** is having a come back (especially streamlined beauties like our new **leather** sectional at the ranch), but big brown beasts can be tricky to decorate either way. So I thought I’d share some simple tips for decorating **leather** couches in case you’re in the same boat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paint the wall behind the sofa a rich navy color with white ceilings and trim. Navy is a rich color and will bring an appealing look to a chunky light brown or tan **leather** couch. Place a thick abstract printed rug in tan, brown, and white shades on the floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To best emphasize the beauty of your dark brown **leather** sofa, consider the **furniture** and decor around it. The consistency of the rattan and bamboo accent chairs, the side table, and even the pull-down blinds fosters a harmonious look. The colors of some of the throw pillows even share the light hue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A dark brown **leather** sofa is the focal point of a room, and for good reason. It's elegant, and the dark tones draw the eye with ease. But what exactly should you put on and around a dark brown **leather** sofa for a seamless aesthetic presentation? Since these sofas are so elegant and regal, only certain decor pieces will function on and around them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many readers might ask, ‘why choose a brown **leather** sofa.’ My answer would be that it’s simply an excellent choice! A brown **leather** couch has timeless versatility and will look great in any home. Brown evokes the earth’s natural color, which brings a sense of warmth and makes a sofa look comfy and inviting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When decorating a brown **leather** sofa, don't feel like you have to incorporate vastly different colors to make the aesthetic work. This room features lots of brown—the rug, pillows, coffee table, lamp, and picture frame—and the room looks cozy and inviting. The trio of houseplants in the corner offers organic color and texture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You don’t want to end up with one large area of connected brown **leather**. That becomes overwhelming in a living room. Instead, try to keep the **furniture** further apart and add a side table in between different items. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘Brown is one of the most popular colours chosen for living room **furniture** thanks to its unparalleled versatility,’ says Patricia Gibbons on the Design team at Sofa.com. ‘It doesn’t demand a lot of attention but still feels charming. While beautifully complementary with other finishes or as the perfect colour foundation for a variety of other tonal palettes - ideal for those who often switch up their home accessories.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If chosen well, a single decorative throw pillow can be enough to complement the rich aesthetic of a dark brown **leather** sofa. Whether it's uniquely patterned or has a complementary color, it's sure to add more life to the couch. What's more, the design of this pillow is relatively simple, but it adds just enough visual interest. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mint green is a tranquil color and will have a calming effect when paired with a warm chocolate brown **leather** sofa. Paint the walls a rich coffee color for a warm ambiance, and lay a plush shaggy coffee or beige-colored carpet on the floor. Place throw pillows in mint green on the couch to brighten the look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark **leather** is luxurious, warm, and cozy. What better way to ramp up such a space than with a fireplace? And from a decor standpoint, the red and gold pillows add just a splash of color to break up the dark brown. This scene beckons visitors to sit back, relax, and chat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown **leather** couches are really such a classic piece of **furniture**. It’s not just their aesthetic that keeps them in style, I think it’s also the comfort. Leather is a sophisticated-looking fabric and I think that can turn off some people but I really love it. I think brown **leather** sofas are great for family homes and can be used in a variety of spaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yellow, the color of the sun, complements the earthy brown beautifully. This bright color is a fun and lively way to add a splash of energy to the soft brown in the room. Being a deep and muted color, brown is rich, so tone down the yellow when pairing it with a dark brown **leather** sofa. The best yellow hues to use with browns are mustard and pale lemon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue complements rich brown perfectly. The deep blues in the wall art are the perfect decorative accent behind the **leather** sofa. The light blue vase on the opposite side of the couch adds just a bit more blue to the space, creating a perfect color balance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
