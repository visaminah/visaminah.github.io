## 18 Tips for How Many Years Does It Take To Become An Architect In South Africa | Where Can I Study Architecture In South Africa
-   At university, you will most likely have to deal with existing sites, project briefs and some constraints, but there is often the freedom to explore new ideas and push boundaries. In reality, you have clients, councils, legislation, budgets and strict timelines. In other words, constraints. Unfortunately, like most things in society **architect**ure is a business and most of our clients are running a business, or have economic budgets and constraints around their projects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When I returned to my fourth year of study, the experiences of my peers were completely different. I worked for a small firm and was exposed to everything and expected to know a lot I did not. Others worked in large firms doing support work, like documenting bathrooms and car parks, or putting together presentations of other people’s design work. At worst, the student **architect** ended up doing work that no one wanted to do like filing, making coffee and keeping the samples room clean. That’s bad, and if you end up not doing any **architect**ural work, I’d try to speak to your boss and change things, or consider moving on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Right now, knowing what I know, where the world has moved to and having the opportunity to go back twenty years, I would say I probably would not study **architect**ure. I would have studied fine art and combined it with online marketing. Hindsight is a great thing. And I’m kind of doing that here with you, anyway. Who knows where I’ll be in another twenty years, and what opportunities the industry and the world present. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So what else goes on and who is doing that work? Much of what **architect**s do includes design and presentation as well as documentation, construction and contract administration, project management and dealing with clients, fees, budgets, programs and deadlines. For the most part, senior **architect**s will be doing the design, face-to-face work and on-site administration. Documentation is about 40-50% of what we do and what most graduates will spend a lot of time on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Learning takes place through interaction, discussion and debate between students, studio assistants and lecturers. A strong theoretical underpinning supports the necessary knowledge and skills required for studio-based design challenges. The department employs innovative teaching and learning methods including interactive digital and online tools and social media. Students are also exposed to real-life community design-build work where learning happens through doing. The second semester of Third Year in the Diploma course is devoted to experiential learning in **architect**ural practice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Again, this is just my perspective, from my own experiences and from talking to other **architect**s over the years. Continue to talk to people at various points in their study as well as in practice to help understand the options you have. Most importantly, make sure you find the part of **architect**ure you love, and for now, follow that. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Architecture is the art and science of shaping the built environment, in order to support a sustainable quality of life for its inhabitants. Our course takes pride in nurturing both the knowledge and the social skills required for entering the world of **architect**ure. Our Diploma and Advanced Diploma programmes focus on gaining strong creative, technical and practical problem-solving skills in construction methodology, materials and innovative detail design. Students get exposure to a spectrum of **architect**ural issues, ranging from a macro urban scale to human-scaled qualitative design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It takes time, years, even decades for **architect**s to master their craft and become good. An accountant may complete a tax return in a matter of days or weeks, and they have completed that process. After a few times, they become really good and within a year or two of completing dozens of tax returns, they have mastered that process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This two-year part-time programme is offered through block-release, in a blended format that involves online learning, on-campus blocks and work-based mentoring. In person block sessions will take place at our Media City Campus in Cape Town. Employment in an **architect**ural office is compulsory. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you have completed your two year Masters, you would have done five years of study, longer if you took a break or needed to go part-time. At this stage, you may have graduated but you’re not an **architect**, and you cannot call yourself an **architect**. In Australia, you need to become registered, which can take at least another two years of practical experience working in an office. For me, and for many other people I have spoken to, the process of graduating is just not enough. There is often a personal drive to become registered so you can call yourself an **architect** and feel like all that study was worthwhile. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Five years of study is a long time when other people are out in the workforce earning full-time wages either straight out of school or after a three-year degree – so there is a financial sacrifice as a student. You lose the opportunity to work and you have five years of tuition to pay. To be honest, in my experience, **architect**ure does not pay as well as many other professions, especially for graduates and especially for the amount of blood, sweat and tears you put into it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like all creative industries, in **architect**ure, you will rarely just work the hours you are expected. While the industry is getting better, I hear recent graduates telling me how they have worked back late to finish a set of drawings, because it takes them longer as they are still learning and, well, deadlines. Or they’ve worked multiple weekends in a row for free on competitions or presentations because that’s the fun design stuff that graduates don’t often work on. And as a graduate who loves **architect**ure, why would you want to do anything else? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Architectural Technologist will be fit for employment in **architect**ural practice, in both the public and private sectors. She/he may assist senior staff with drawing, detailing, and presentations and by doing site supervision, as well as monitoring and liaising with clients, engineers, municipalities, quantity surveyors and contractors. Once the necessary experience has been gained, and the SACAP Registration is completed, the Architectural Technologist is recognised as competent and also allowed to handle small to medium size work independently. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most universities have a big focus on design studios, which is great. It’s an important part of **architect**ure. We need great designs to enhance our cities and societies. There should be more great design than there is!!! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Becoming an **architect** can be creative and fun. You get to draw and play around on software, making models, images, renders, and build amazing buildings. But the reality of being an **architect** is more than the glamour of pretty drawings and software. There are some things that no one tells you about. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is what I mean when I say the learning curve is long. Most **architect**s will need to complete 4, 5 or more whole projects to understand the process and how things work. This can take years or even decades and is why many practising **architect**s do not reach their peak or produce their best work until their forties or fifties. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is possible to create great homes for the few who really value this and many **architect**s successfully do this. However, most **architect**s in Australia will end up working on large scale developments or public buildings rather than private residential houses. This is where you are most likely to make the most difference and impact society. Regardless of the projects you work on, you always have to deal with clients, budgets and deadlines… - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I want to share with you the top 5 things I wish I knew before becoming an **architect**, that may or may not have influenced my career choice, and may help you if you’re not sure. To be clear, most of my work has occurred in Australia where we design and build a lot of new buildings, so I can only draw from that experience and perspective. I imagine working in places like the USA, Canada and even modern parts of Asia may be similar, but places like Europe could be very different, due to the historical nature of buildings and cities and the type of **architect**ural work you might do. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
