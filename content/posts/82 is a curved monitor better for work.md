## 82 Interesting Facts Is A Curved Monitor Better For Work | Are Curved Monitors Good for Gaming? Consider THIS before Buying! (2022)
-   This is one of the best bang-for-your-buck **curved** **monitor**s out there. It's a 34-inch **monitor** with a beautiful picture, a high refresh rate and an ultra-wide aspect ratio (21:9), making it a great option for people who want a **monitor** for work and gaming. The only real downside is that it has a fairly bland look (similar to a lot of Dell's **monitor**s, admittedly) and it doesn't have any USB-C ports, meaning it's not the best fit for a Mac. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A small screen with subtle curvature will not do much for your feeling of immersion. But, you can benefit from a larger display area with a wider aspect ratio than a flat screen. Ultrawide’s wide aspect ratios work well with **curved** designs and help bring the entire image into your field of view. If your computer **monitor** has a wide aspect ratio, the curvature of the screen in games, such as video games, will be more useful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many benefits to using a **curved** **monitor**. The most obvious benefit is the immersive experience it provides. When you’re gaming or watching a movie, a **curved** **monitor** gives you a wider field of view that feels more natural and makes it easier to take in the whole scene. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Of course, you may still experience this, as you would with a flat **monitor** if you cannot set it up in the ideal spot. But it’s a simple fix: don’t place the **curved** **monitor** not facing a window or mirror. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

The **monitor**'s flicker-free technology eliminates flickering at all brightness levels for a comfortable viewing experience. Its Low Blue Light Technology is designed to filter out harmful blue light, effectively diminishing eye fatigue and irritation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This issue even spills over to first-person viewpoint games. Since most **monitor**s are flat, game developers take this into account. By introducing distortion in their programming, they make flat-screen **monitor**s feel immersive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, the first thing you notice about a **curved** **monitor** is the elegant design. You also have the feeling that the screen takes up more space on the desk, but the curvature does have its advantages. Especially in the visual field, you directly notice that the **curved** design simulates a panoramic view, which is directed at the eye’s natural field of vision. This is because **curved** **monitor**s exploit all three dimensions (length, width and height) and peripheral vision to produce this panoramic view. As a result, the user practically forgets that he is looking at a screen, which does not work as easily with a flat **monitor**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, not all professionals need such a full field of view. However, if you’re working in a field where you need to look at large areas at one time - video editing, finance, programming, etc. - a **curved** screen means you won’t be switching from tab to tab or looking at different displays. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Dell Alienware AW3418DW is one of the best ultra-wide IPS display **monitor**s that are available on the market. Sporting a 34-inch **curved** three-side bezel-less display, out-of-the-box calibration, and of course, includes NVIDIA G-sync. The **monitor** features a 1900R curvature display with wide viewing angles and incredible resolution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **curved** **monitor**'s focus is directly in front of it. If you view it from the side, its image quality suffers greatly. A flat-screen display offers greater flexibility when it comes to viewing positions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In general, professional gamers do not use **curved** **monitor**s. Some advantages of a **curved** **monitor** turn into disadvantages in competitions and also in gaming in general. On the other hand, a **curved** **monitor** provides an excellent gaming experience for casual gamers in single-player mode. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Curved computer **monitor**s are becoming more and more popular, and for good reason. They offer a more immersive experience when watching movies or gaming, and they can also be great for working from home. If you’re looking for a **curved** **monitor** to use for work, then we’ve got you covered. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The pictures show the optimal viewing angle of Curved Monitor (left side) vs. Flat Screen (right side). But, of course, if you play in a coop, both players will not have the optimal viewing angle with a **curved** one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, **curved** **monitor**s already have a natural distortion. This built-in curve compounds the effect that developers added to their game. This makes the effect overpowering, so much so that some report nausea during extended gaming sessions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Size: Curved **monitor**s generally come in larger sizes than their flat-screen counterparts. The average size of a **curved** **monitor** is around 34-inches, but it's fairly common to see smaller (around 24-inches) and much larger (around 49-inches) sizes. The most important is to get the size that works for you and your space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Curved **monitor**s also tend to have less glare and reflections. This means that one potential benefit of a **curved** **monitor** is that it can help reduce eye strain. If you spend a lot of time in front of your **monitor** display, the extra $$$ you spend on one is insignificant relative to the enhanced viewing experience you will enjoy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Curved **monitor**s, much like flat **monitor**s, come in at different price points. The key drivers for price will be size and screen quality (resolution). Secondary drivers of price will include refresh rate (processing power contained by the **monitor**) and the quality of the materials the product is made of (glass, plastic, metal). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **monitor** wraps the display panel with 1800R curvature for a comfortable viewing experience. It combines Asus Aura RGB lighting on the backside of the **monitor**, by offering several lighting modes.

-   I bet you’ve stood in front of a Curved Monitor at the electronics store and thought about whether it helps you become a better player in gaming. The sign on the **curved** **monitor** states: You can see a lot more, and supposedly a **monitor** like this is more comfortable for the eyes and <insert some marketing phrases here>. But then why do pro gamers play on flat-screen **monitor**s and not on **curved** **monitor**s? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All competitive games are optimized for 16:9. But almost all **curved** **monitor**s are widescreen, so 21:9. Now you might think, great; then I can see more. But, in reality, you have to live with black borders, or your field of view (FOV) is artificially limited. So the game tries to scale the picture to 16:9. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another benefit that you may have picked up on already is that you'll gain a broader view with a **curved** display than with a flat **monitor**. But, again, the magic comes from the **curved** edges. The **curved** corners direct light from various angles toward your eyes, so it allows your eyes to see more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have an LG Curved **monitor** on my desk and enjoy it. I love how it creates the affect of an expanded field of vision. I also enjoy how I can move my eyes – but not my head – to see the content on the screen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The price of the **curved** **monitor** primarily depends on the screen size. They cost a bit more than regular flat **monitor**s of similar screen size. You can easily find a good **curved** **monitor** for around 25000 when you are shopping online. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Curved screens help negate this by ensuring that you get a constant viewing angle. You're guaranteed to get the best image quality at all times because the screen wraps around you. This is true as long as you're seated near the curvature radius of the **monitor**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Standard computer **monitor**s can be a little boring and don’t offer the best viewing experience. If you’re like most people, you spend a lot of time in front of your computer **monitor**. Why not make that experience more enjoyable with a **curved** **monitor**? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But going from a flat **monitor** to a **curved** one isn’t about making a simple switch. It’s about making a transformational upgrade!

-   Glares and reflections: We did cover this already, but to be fair, we also wanted to mention the possibility of glares and reflections if you cannot place the display in the right spot.

-   Unlike flat panel displays, **curved** **monitor**s utilize the viewing area right to the edge. As a result, the human eye actively fades out the edge of a **curved** screen as much as possible.

-   Ports and Connectivity: Most **monitor**s require either a USB-C or an HDMI connection to hook up to your computer. This is important because a lot of new-age laptops, like a lot of recent MacBooks, only have USB-C ports and therefore would require you to use an extra dongle which isn't ideal. Additionally, most **monitor**s also have additional ports so you can connect (and charge) your other devices, like speakers or a microphone, without taking up the few ports on your computer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
