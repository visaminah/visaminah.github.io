## 4 Interesting Facts How To Check Car Battery Health Uk | Free Car Battery Check
-   When your car doesn’t start, often a low or dead **battery** is the culprit. Unfortunately, most vehicle owners do not check their **battery** until it fails. As preventative maintenance, the suggested best practice is to conduct a car **battery** voltage test regularly – at least twice per year – using a multimeter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Prepare the Battery The first step is to locate the vehicle **battery** (consult the owner’s manual) and determine if there is any dirt or corrosion at the positive and negative terminals. The positive terminal usually wears a red cover and a “plus” sign, while the negative terminal has a black cover and a “minus” sign. Since corrosive buildup can keep the multimeter from taking accurate voltage readings, it should be scrubbed off using fine-grit sandpaper. Gloves should be worn to prevent skin exposure to harmful chemicals and **battery** acid. Once the terminals are clean, they will serve as the connection points for the multimeter’s probes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A multimeter is an electronic measuring instrument that is used to gauge volts, amps, and resistance from an electrical source. The most common automotive application for a multimeter is to test the strength of a car **battery**. When used properly, it will provide voltage information to a high degree of accuracy on a digital readout. Understanding the data provided is vital in determining whether the **battery** is strong and **health**y or should be replaced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Multimeter Setting The multimeter may look complicated due to its various measurement settings, but the general operation is fairly simple. For testing the electrical output from a vehicle **battery**, the multimeter dial should be turned to the “20 volts” setting. But before the multimeter can be used, all surface charge from the **battery** must be removed to allow for an accurate reading. To do this, the headlights should be turned on for about two minutes, then turned off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
