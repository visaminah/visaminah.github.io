## 7 Fun Facts How To Store Grass Seed In Winter | What To Do With Old Grass Seed
-   When stored properly, bagged **grass** **seed** can remain fully viable for one year after the test date stated on its label. The date is when the **seed**s' germination rate was tested. That rate should be 80 to 95 percent, depending on the type of **grass**. The rate should remain valid through at least the first year of storage after the test date, unless the **seed** is kept improperly. Each additional year of storage after the first year reduces the germination rate by 10 to 20 percent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grass **seed** should be kept in a cool, dry place where air can circulate around it and the temperature will stay between 40 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit. The **seed** should not be stored in an unheated shed, garage or any other place where the temperature will drop below 32 F. Keep bags of **grass** **seed** off the floor and someplace where mice can't get to them. A basement or cellar is a suitable storage place as long as it is dry. The **seed** also can be stored in a working refrigerator if an open box of baking soda or a commercial desiccant is placed in the appliance to remove moisture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even if you’ve taken great care over your bag of **seed** over 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, with each passing year fewer **seed**s will germinate. This means that your coverage rate will go down significantly compared with a fresh mix. So, you’ll need more **seed**s to cover less area. That being said, over**seed**ing with old **seed** will not have any damaging affect on your lawn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grass **seed**, like any other plant **seed**, has a finite shelf life. Grass **seed** stored for more than one year gradually has fewer **seed**s that would sprout, or germinate, if planted. The shelf life of lawn **grass** **seed** depends mainly on the strength and health of the **grass** plants (Poaceae plant family) that produced the **seed** and how the **seed** was stored after it was harvested. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At Manderley, we test our **seed** yearly to ensure we are providing our customers with the best possible coverage, year after year. Did you know that Canada No. 1 Grade Seed only requires a 70% germination rate? Manderley PRO Grade and Less Water lines use only the highest quality **seed** which leave Canada No. 1 grade in their dust! That means you get the best **seed**, without any filler, bringing you fuller and longer lasting results than the competition. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Storage conditions do have a major influence of the long-term viability of stored **seed**. Storing your **seed** outside in a shed, or garage is not ideal due to the exposure to heat and humidity. Instead, try storing your **seed** indoors in a cool, dry area, to extend your purchase’s shelf life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s not quite as simple as stamping an expiry date on a bag of **seed**. You can still get results from a bag of **grass** **seed** for many years, but the actual “expiry date” depends on how well you store your **seed**. It’s impossible to provide an exact estimation of how much less viable a **seed** mix can become over time, but **seed** stored in a typical residential garage could lose as much as 10% germination each year. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
