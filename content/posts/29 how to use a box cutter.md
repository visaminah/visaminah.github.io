-   Most safety **cutter**s feature a concealed blade, which can be pushed into a working position with the slider on the side. Once in a working position, the safety knife can effectively cut through cardboard, plastic, and other types of packaging.

-   The **box** **cutter**, or utility knife, is an excellent tool found in almost every warehouse. Designed with a small blade, these knives have the ability to quickly cut cardboard **box**es open, remove packing tape and other wrappings used in freight transit. Due to the abuse **box** **cutter**s take, they are often made from very hard plastic or metal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Safety Class 2 is the AutoSlide safety **cutter**. This range/product ensures that the safety knife blades are retracted automatically after the cutting process.

This type of safety knife provides increased protection for both the user and the material. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **cutter** should always be retracted when not in use. Cutters should be stored in a safe place away from easily accessible areas. An alternative solution would be using safety **cutter**s with self-retracting blades that automatically retract once you let go of the trigger or whenever the **cutter** blade is no longer in contact with the material. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   #7. Puncture the material, then pull towards you with the **box** **cutter**. Don’t use any extra blade than necessary or too much force. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Box **cutter**s are best pulled towards you while you cut. It is generally safer to pull it towards you regardless of the type. You can also bend your arm and wrist and cut sideways and down. Cutting upwards or away from you is not recommended as it can lead to losing control and possible injury. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   #9. When finished, make sure the blade is retracted, and be wary about putting the **box** **cutter** into your pocket. You could grab the **box** **cutter** and end up grabbing the blade or dropping it. Store the **box** **cutter** out of the reach of children. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   #1. Check the **box** **cutter** to make sure its screws, slider, or blade are not loose. Repair or replace the **box** **cutter** if it is malfunctioning in any way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the **box** **cutter**s break or otherwise stop working, dispose of them in a sharps container, homemade plastic container, or in the garbage or recycling bin?. Make sure to retract the blade so no one can get cut by reaching for them. Do not keep broken **box** **cutter**s because you or the next person could attempt to use them and this could result in an injury. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hold **box** **cutter**s with one hand. Use the other hand to stabilize the material. Use your thumb to adjust the blade extension slider. Have a firm grip on the handle and do not let it slip from your grasp. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We are using a standard metal **box** **cutter** in our example but many blades work in the same or a very similar fashion. Utilizing these blades will end up saving your company a fortune in the long run. Make sure you educate employees on the extra blades (if available) or have an employee who can change them readily available to change blades out for the other employees. The type of **box** **cutter** we used, after spending about five minutes on it the first time, we were able to change a blade in about two minutes. Making it significantly cheaper to have someone change the blades than to just buy more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Though it seems simple and not nearly as dangerous as many other tools you may encounter, improper use of **box** **cutter**s can still result in injury. We often overlook this risk. A little education can go a long way to stopping these preventable injuries at home and in the workplace. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At this point, we will want to start reassembling the **box** **cutter**. Place the blade and housing back into the handle, ensure that the extra blades are seated properly and then place the top of the handle back onto the bottom. Then fasten the screw back into place and your utility knife is as good as new. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another feature a good **cutter** should have is the ability to lock its blade in place. Blades like Easy-Cut and many other Safety Cutters can all lock their blades. The Easy-Cut series incorporates the flexibility and length of your blade to the thickness of the cardboard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Often employees injure themselves when they try to quickly open the **box** by cutting in a straight line with force towards themselves. To prevent such accidents, employees should make a mental note of the cutting line. The user should keep their body and hands away from the cutting line. Another way to prevent this is to use an automatic retractable blade **cutter**. Such **cutter**s are safer for the user as once the user lets go of the mechanism, it will retract the blade, thus preventing any significant injuries to the user. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wearing cut-resistant gloves when using a **cutter** will significantly minimise the chances of getting injured. High-quality cut-resistant gloves can prevent harm to your hands. With safety gloves, the user will feel more at ease when using their safety **cutter**s as well! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This seems really stupid, but I see people open **box**es wrong all the time. If you are not careful you will either cut yourself or cut the items in the **box**. It is easy to do correctly, but for some reason everyone does it ass backwards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
