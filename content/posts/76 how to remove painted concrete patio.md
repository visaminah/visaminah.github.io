-   If you’re wondering how to get paint off **concrete**, and be environmentally friendly, there are a few options. Try renting a floor grinder for large areas or even use a heat gun.

However, it is possible with some patience and elbow grease, and your **concrete** can look as fresh as the day it was laid. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paint strippers are powerful chemicals that can quickly remove paint from **concrete** surfaces. However, they can also be dangerous if used improperly.

In addition, paint strippers can damage the environment if not used properly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

It’s movement removes any loose paint, whilst the actual sandpaper or attachment itself removes the paint on the surface of the **concrete**. Make sure you’re wearing the proper safety equipment such as goggles, a breathing mask and gloves! If left in the same spot for too long, be aware that this could leave a circular pattern on the surface – keep the sander moving and be careful with how much pressure you use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before applying any chemicals to the **concrete**, you’ll want to make sure that the surface is clean. You should remove any large debris that will inhibit the paint stripper’s ability to adhere to the paint. You’ll also want to mix a warm water and soap combo and give the floor a thorough scrubbing. Make sure to use a rough-bristled brush for this process, most likely the same one you’ll use after applying the paint stripper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gas-powered pressure washers, on the other hand, are more powerful and can clean faster. As such, they are more suitable for big cleaning jobs. In fact, a gas-powered pressure washer is perfect for cleaning paint off a **concrete** surface. It can be too strong for other cleaning applications, though. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   So, as a rule, you will need a pressure washer that can generate 3,000 PSI and a flow of at least 2.5 GPM (gallons per minute) to clean dirty **concrete** effectively in order to wash off the old layer of paint. You can also find pressure washers that come with a maximum water pressure of 4000 PSI, and they can effectively strip off paint from a **concrete** surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For removing stubborn spots of paint from **concrete**, especially **concrete** that hasn’t been sealed prior to the paint spill, we recommend mixing your own absorbent paint stripper.

-   Spray paint stains can be stubborn. You may be able to clean spray paint using a soapy solution, plus some elbow grease. However, chemicals are more likely to be the most effective at it. More specifically, you can use a mixture of water and trisodium phosphate, which is a chemical compound that is used to remove grease and stains from **concrete**. This is a common ingredient found in household cleaners. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can apply a generous amount of trisodium phosphate to the spray-painted surface. Leave it for a few minutes to allow the chemical to set in and permeate the porous surface of the **concrete**. After that, you can use a pressure washer or a scrub brush to scratch the loose paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After you have let the paint stripper sit for the necessary amount of time it is time to get busy with a heavy-duty scraper. The scraper will only work if your **concrete** **patio** is smooth. If it has a rough texture you will need to scrub the paint off with a wire brush with pole attachment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The remaining paint can now be cleaned with a power washer. Use hot water and soap to loosen the existing paint and run your pressure washer over the affected area. Ensure that you cover all the paint and the entire **concrete** surface evenly to avoid any discolouration of your **concrete** or paving. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Concrete has porosity due to which it absorbs the liquid which is applied on the surface of Concrete. Due to the absorbing nature of **concrete**, it ships the layer of paint in it. That’s why it is very difficult to remove paint from **concrete**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Once the floor is clean and dry, it’s time to add the paint stripper. One of the best types of paint stripper or thinner is mineral spirits.

-   The first method we’ll look at is the paint stripper and scrub method. You’ll have to use this method if the paint on your **concrete** has already dried.

-   Once you feel comfortable using your machine, it’s time to get to work. Go over every part of your **concrete** that’s covered in paint until there’s nothing left but dust.

You’ll also want a wand that has a 15- to 25-degree-angle and shoots water out like a bullet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, there are also thermal paint removers.

Thermal paint removers are quick and effective, but they can be expensive to rent or purchase. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   from the surface of the **concrete**. Care should be taken while using this method because the washer Jet can cause damage.
