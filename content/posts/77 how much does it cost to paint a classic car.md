-   Some shops offer a **paint** job for about $300-$900 . In this price range, a shop typically uses an inexpensive synthetic enamel **paint** with a minimum number of coats; they might not **paint** areas like the door jams or inside the hood; and, in some cases, they may simply mask off rather than take off removable trim and parts (which can result in harsh masking edges or **paint** in unwanted areas). CostHelper readers report paying $400-$875 for a basic auto **paint** job at an average price of $566 ; about a third of these readers say they are unhappy with the results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can cut that **cost** down by doing some of the work yourself, either by handling individual tasks or assisting a professional mechanic. Professional services for bodywork, **paint**, interior restoration, engine repair and other items typically **cost** up to $75 to $100 an hour, Junkyard Mob noted. Cars in need of a massive overhaul will **cost** a lot more to restore than those in decent condition. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   question usually leads to either dissatisfied clients or **paint** shops that only last 3years (thats why there so few of us too choose from). The truth is that any car can be **paint**ed from £3000 upwards. It just depends on how good the body is, how thorough you want us to be, and the required level of finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Jaider did an awesome job **paint**ing new side skirts for my BMW and at a very reasonable price! Black sapphire metallic is a very difficult color to get right but he was able to get the color right and **paint** blank side skirts and get them installed on my car. He was extremely flexible and made sure that it was done right. Highly highly recommended!!” -Mike Y., North Las Vegas, NV, 3/21/2017 - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Two-pack **paint**s provide the ultimate finish for any classic car project. From the depth of colour and level of shine to its strength and chip resistance, nothing beats two-pack. That’s why it’s the preferred choice of Catocraft Automotive’s classic car restorers. The stunning finish achieved through two-pack **paint**s does require special skills and safety measures because applying two-pack **paint**s is a recognised and genuine health hazard, which is why it’s a job best left to the professionals. Catocraft works with some of the best spray **paint**ers in the business and whether it’s sparkling metallics, lustrous pearls or straight solid colours, our muscle, classic and historic car restorations always look their best with a two-pack finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The **cost** of a high-end automotive **paint** job depends heavily on the type of vehicle, how many colors you want, and what kind of finish you choose. The average price for a high-end professional **paint** job is $1,200-$5,500. Increased labor and material **cost**s cause a big disparity between mid-grade and custom high-end jobs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like we mentioned earlier, depending on the initial condition of the car, this could wind up being the largest project expense or the smallest. Try to avoid rust at all **cost**s as body fabrication work can add tons of $$ in labour expense. A decent restoration starting point for a car would be $2,500 – $6,000. The lower end would refer to the car not being driveable, but still having good bones. The higher end would be a running car, but possibly in need of tuning, interior/exterior work or some missing detail pieces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some **paint**ers try to sell you things like custom wheels and body kits. These items are not necessary for a good **paint** job. If you feel pressured by the shop tech, walk away and find another company. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Posted: February 23rd, 2015 06:02AM Painter: joe I hope if someone is putting 20 coats on they are using unavailable lacquer. Today's **paint** would fail right away with 20 coats - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When choosing a company to do your car **paint** job, choose one that has been around for at least five years. This is a sign that they know what they're doing and how to keep your vehicle looking new. Check online reviews from past customers to see if they were satisfied with their service. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Those guys can point you to a good **paint** garage. Was this post helpful to you? yes no Report prohibited or spam - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rather than paying attention to the name of the service offered, pay attention to what you are getting. If you have an older car and need to save time or money, you probably don’t need to invest in a **paint** job that requires any sanding down. Make sure to specify what you are looking for, and be prepared to say no if and when the auto shop tries to entice you with a more expensive offering. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you plan to enter shows or competitions, experts advise that you keep the car's original color and style. While you could redo a faded **paint** job or restore damaged parts, you’ll probably want to remain as true as possible to the original look, options and color of the car. However, if you have no aspirations for competitions and simply own a classic car for pleasure, restoring a classic car is entirely up to you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Warranties can vary from six months to a year on low-**cost** **paint** jobs with basic **paint**, to five years or a lifetime warranty for custom **paint** jobs with high-end materials. The warranty terms will vary depending on the shop and the materials used; always ask what is covered. Discounts: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

What do you think that the price would be for a quality job? Was this post helpful to you? yes no Report prohibited or spam - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to do it yourself, you’ll need a well-ventilated area where dust and dirt won’t fly onto the wet car and ruin the new **paint** job while it’s drying. You’ll also need sandpaper to remove any grime or rust, masking tape to precisely outline the area you’re **paint**ing and to cover anything you don’t want to be **paint**ed. You’ll also need a spray gun, primer, and glossy car **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The red car **paint** is so expensive because the pigments which get used on the red is **cost**ly. The Paint is essential shades suspended in the fluid, and those red colors charge the most to produce. That is nothing to do with accessibility or metallic; it's straightforward the way the world around us works. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, before embarking on the project, ask yourself the reason you’re restoring the car. If it’s a labor of love and you plan on keeping the car for personal use, you might have more wiggle room on **cost**s. But if you are planning to sell the car for a profit, make sure to stay on budget so you don’t end up spending more on the restoration than the car is worth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Scratches and dings in your car are a pain. Professional **paint** jobs can be expensive, so if you find yourself in a situation where you need to fix something on your vehicle, you might be considering doing it yourself. But should you? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A basic job will likely **cost** you less than $1,000. The process will involve a few coats of synthetic enamel **paint** and less attention to detail than higher levels of **paint** jobs. A standard **paint** job: For a bit more, you can get a standard **paint** job that includes sanding down the body to ensure a smooth surface, removing impurities, and leaving you with a prettier finished product. This type of **paint** job **cost**s $1,000 to $3,000, but it will last longer and look better than a basic **paint** job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paint job and body work for a 1951 chevy pickup Amount: $0.00 Posted by: Diego Rodriguez in Grand prairie, TX. Posted: July 29th, 2017 04:07PM How much would be an estimated price to spend having someone **paint** and do body work on my 1951 chevy pickup, its got about 40 dents ranging in sizes from ant size to golf ball size mostly smaller then a golf ball.and who would anyone recommend to make it look beautiful for the money spent Was this post helpful to you? yes no Report prohibited or spam - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This can also be a major expense – are you doing the work yourself? Shops, like us at BMC Motorworks, specialize in repair, restoration, replacement of parts on classic cars if you’re not doing the labour work yourself. Try to find a shop that has experience with your Make and Model of car. You do not want a mechanic that hasn’t dealt with classic cars as this can end up **cost**ing more in labour and extending the project time. In some cases this can lead to an inferior job that requires it being redone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Maaco is the masters of deception. STAY AWAY **paint** it in your garage...it'll turn out 2346426798755% better than maaco. Was this post helpful to you? yes no Report prohibited or spam - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before **paint**ing, the surface of the vehicle should be cleaned, sanded and primed. Professional auto **paint**ing is typically done in a well-lit (and sometimes climate-controlled) **paint** booth, to minimize dust and debris that might mar the **paint** finish. Precision Restorations in Saint Louis, MO, provides a video demonstration of auto **paint**ing techniques[2] in a **paint** booth inside an auto body repair shop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The supplies to **paint** a car yourself can run from $100 to $1,500, depending on the materials needed. The biggest **cost** of **paint**ing a car yourself will likely be the headache that comes along with it. The pros often add several coats of primer, **paint** in your preferred color, and a topcoat to ensure a quality finish. Does that sound like something you have the time and energy to commit to? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ask if the company provides a warranty on its work. It's important to get this information in writing so you can hold the **paint** shop accountable if anything goes wrong. This can save you thousands down the road. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ah, the age old question. When is it time to **paint** your car? Well, as with many life decisions, there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to deciding when you should get your car **paint**ed--it really depends on how much you value a clean-looking ride. Some people decide to only **paint** their cars every 5 years in order to save money and others that feel like they need a fresh coat of **paint** after any noticeable scuffs or scratches happen. Generally if you have any kind of body work done such as a major dent removal usually indicates some kind of collateral damage on the surrounding area which will require re**paint**ing at bare minimum. Now this isn't law but typically speaking it's cheaper, faster and easier to have a **paint** shop fix up your bodywork than it is to pay for a small accident use and re**paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **cost** will deviate drastically from a hobbyist project if your goal is showroom car quality. The **cost**, labour, and attention to detail when stripping down the car to its bare frame can really add up. Replacing rusted out sections, correcting warped metal, cleaning and replacing smaller components etc. can exceed $20,000. If the bones [structure/frame/body] are good and you’re not going the showroom car route, prep **cost**s can be as low a $800 (transport, cleaning, documentation). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The car **paint** is expensive because individuals are eager to pay that. And receiving that Paint to apply equally on withstand and metal the components, for some, numerous years isn't as simple as you may suspect. The explanation it is so expensive is that individuals are happy to follow through on that **cost**. Like most vehicle parts, the vehicle producers press at an ideal price from the **paint** creators. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Single-stage car **paint** jobs are the most popular and easiest to do. They require only one coat of **paint**, which is applied with a spray gun or roller. The best part about this type of project is that it's fast and inexpensive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **cost** of **paint**ing varies by city, state, and country. You may find that some cities charge more than others for their services. If this happens, ask around about the **cost**s in other areas before making a decision. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are often different motives for restoring a vehicle. Are you looking to flip the vehicle, has this been a dream car of yours since you were a teen, or is this a sentimental family project? This will often determine what car you’re looking to restore. If the car is more common, like a Triumph or MGB, often your acquisition **cost** will be much lower ($1,000 – $8,000). More common also typically means wider availability of parts and mechanics who know what they’re doing. Higher sought-after and often more rare vehicles, like a Jaguar E-Type (or XKE for North Americans), will come with a matching price tag, $19,000 – $90,000. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A basic car **paint** job is the most affordable way to change your vehicle's appearance. It can be done in less than an hour, and it will **cost** you around $300-$500. However, this type of **paint** job is not recommended, as the results are often so bad that it creates meme-worthy content. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How many coats? Amount: $3,500.00 Posted by: Mad Tiki in MESA, AZ. Posted: October 2nd, 2015 07:10AM Painter: Mad Tiki I think the writer is refering to the old laquer days of **paint**ing with his 20+ coats of **paint** comments. And his pricing seems to be from the same 60's era. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pick your color and finish. Choosing the right color is crucial for a custom **paint** job because it will be the color your car will be “married” to, so make sure you are completely in love with it. Once you have an idea of what the color you want, our skilled **paint** technician (sometimes) will make a sample of it so you can feel comfortable with your choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have yet to be able to collect on 100% of my time spent on doing a full **paint** job to a customer's car. I just can't justify charging a customer 1500 hours at 35 to $50 an hour. You can say that I do a lot of Charity work for the jobs I sometimes do. To the **paint**ers out there "Charge what your worth but be worth what you charge." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What grit sandpaper should you use when **paint**ing a car? You should use a variety of sandpaper types throughout the **paint**ing process. Coarser grits (40 to 180) can be used to fix major scratches before you start the **paint** job. Grits up to 800 can be used to sand down primer coats. Grits above 1,000 can help tackle imperfections during the final steps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The best way to choose who to trust with a professional **paint** job is to ask people you know for recommendations. Friends, family, or your regular mechanic may be able to steer you in the right direction. You may also want to check review sites like Yelp. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All the tools required for the restoration can amount to a considerable **cost**. You will also need the use of a garage to give shelter from the changing weather conditions. The garage will need to be fitted with lifting equipment such as ramps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whole-body **paint** jobs are the **cost**liest, as they require the most amount of prep and **paint**. In many cases, body panels must be removed if you expect a high-quality **paint** job. These jobs can take many hours to prep and complete. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A guide to car restoration **cost**s wouldn’t be complete without mentioning a rotisserie restoration or a “Frame-off” restoration. A rotisserie restoration involves a complete strip down of all components (suspension, brakes, drivetrain, engine, steering assembly, and accessories). The car is then put literally on a vehicle rotisserie and spun around to inspect, repair, clean, and eventually **paint** everything required. This is completed for any showroom quality restoration. A rotisserie restoration probably won’t be on your list as a hobbyist, but it will help to explain the large price discrepancy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paint suitable for classic, muscle and historic car restorations comes in a variety of options but at Catocraft Automotive we focus on recognised and proven products and techniques, without the exorbitant prices that can accompany **paint** jobs by some classic vehicle restoration companies.

Catocraft’s quest is to put classic cars within the reach of all car lovers, and to deliver on our commitment we need to provide classic car **paint** restorations that are high quality but don’t push **cost**s over budget. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Car **paint** varies in price to a dramatic degree. The cheapest car **paint**s **cost** between $30-$100 per quart, but you'll need more than a gallon for an average-sized vehicle. Sometimes several gallons. That price might seem high, but that's actually the cheaper end of the spectrum. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Factory accurate **paint** jobs are a nice feature for any restoration project adding to your project’s story. This isn’t always possible because some colours have changed due to **paint** ingredients being altered for environmental reasons. The right colour is always the one that best represents that model in either your eyes or the target customer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Professionals generally use **paint** spray guns to evenly apply automotive **paint**. It is important that the colors are properly mixed and applied smoothly, and in layers; an auto **paint** job can include 12-24 coats of **paint**, or more. Typical **cost**s: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just like the infamous lawyer response goes, it depends. Different factors will determine your final **cost** of restoration. What level of restoration finish are you aiming for? Concours, a showroom level finish, or something more modest? The final **cost** depends on where you take the car to get the work done, whether you’re replacing or rebuilding certain major components, and who’s doing the labour. If you’re fortunate enough to find a gem that’s been in storage or an existing project where someone lost interest or can’t finish, this could **cost** tens of thousands of dollars less than a rust-infested build-from-scratch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . In this price range, a shop typically uses an inexpensive synthetic enamel **paint** with a minimum number of coats; they might not **paint** areas like the door jams or inside the hood; and, in some cases, they may simply mask off rather than take off removable trim and parts (which can result in harsh masking edges or **paint** in unwanted areas). CostHelper readers report paying for a basic auto **paint** job at an average price of ; about a third of these readers say they are unhappy with the results. Expect to pay $1,000-$3,500 for a more thorough **paint** job using higher-quality, brand-name **paint**, with **cost**s varying depending on the make, model and condition of the vehicle (the amount of rust and number of dents or scratches), and whether any interior or engine-area **paint**ing is included. In this price range, the process typically includes additional prep work (sanding, removing rust spots and dents) and ends with three to five applications of clear coat car **paint**[1] to protect the base **paint** color and to create a smooth, glossy final look. CostHelper readers report paying $1,000-$1,800 for a mid-quality **paint** job, at an average **cost** of $1,316 ; most are happy with the results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   I'm a experience **paint**er of 20 years and shop owner. I wouldn't touch a full **paint** job nothing less than starting at 5,000 and that's a generic/Comercial **paint** job, although we are 100times better than a Maaco. Our professional workmanship don't deserve to be disrespected anymore than it is and for our skilled craftsmanship to be devalued anymore. Like any other skilled trade you get what you pay for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
