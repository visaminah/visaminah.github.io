## 156 Unexpected Facts About How To Use Peat Moss In Garden | Sphagnum Peat Moss
-   For the last 12 years, Canadian **peat** producers have employed a new practice to facilitate bog restoration. This entails letting the wetlands re-flood and planting **moss** grafts. As the sphagnum grows, its top layer is replenished within five years. Restoring ecological balance can take 15 to 25 years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to the uses of **peat** **moss**, seed-starting is one of the places where it shines. Mix **peat** with perlite and vermiculite and you have a great seed starting mix that is also soil-less. This mixture provides seeds with the right amount of drainage and aeration that will help plant roots grow strong and healthy. Add a little compost to feed plant roots some nutrients too! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** has a pH of 4.9 to 6.5, slightly acidic. This makes it better for soil mix because the acidity helps break down other compounds in the soil. This also makes it a good corrector, especially with plants that cannot stand alkaline soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are several ways to prepare a seed starting mix from **peat** **moss** and the mix you use will vary depending on your preferences. Soilless seed mixes use **peat** **moss** as the base with equal parts of perlite or vermiculite and add small amounts of lime and fertilizer to lower the pH level and give your seeds some plant food.​ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sterile medium – Peat **moss** provides a sterile medium, which is ideal for planting and growing your vegetable plants . It doesn’t have any harmful chemicals, weed seeds and other bad things you don’t want for your plants. This is why **peat** **moss** is an ideal starting medium, mainly for tender, vulnerable plants that require a lot of care. It is a good practice to add a bit of **peat** **moss** to any starting mix. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To start plants from seed, consider buying **peat** pots. Once the seedlings have sturdy stems and leaves, put the containers directly in your garden. Be sure to cover the rims completely with soil. Otherwise, the **peat** will draw moisture from the seedling roots and surrounding earth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat is dead material that has been submerged in bogs for thousands of years. Most **peat** **moss** used in the United States comes from **peat** bogs in Canada. Because **peat** forms so slowly (often taking 20 years to form 1 inch of **peat**), it is not considered a renewable resource. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** alone does not make an excellent potting medium. It should be mixed with other ingredients to make up between one-third to two-thirds of the total volume of the mix. Peat **moss** is sometimes known as sphagnum **peat** **moss** because much of the dead material in a **peat** bog comes from sphagnum **moss** that grew on top of the bog. Florists use sphagnum **peat** **moss** to line wire baskets or add a decorative touch to potted plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Coconut fiber comes in several forms — granules, pots, sheets, bricks, and bales. Whatever the type, you must soak the fibers before use.Additional names for coconut fiber are coco-**peat**, coir-**peat**, coir dust, coir fiber pith, and coco coir. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To save bog ecosystems from extinction, government agencies regulate **peat** mining. For example, Canada limits extraction to .016 percent of its bog reserves. Canadian harvesters can only access one in 6,000 acres at any given time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most commonly used type of **peat** **moss** is sphagnum **peat** **moss**. Sphagnum **peat** **moss** has a high ability to absorb moisture and holds ten times its dry weight in water. After it's harvested and dried, sphagnum **peat** **moss** is light in color, making it retain 10-12 times its weight in water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Can you mix **peat** **moss** with soil? Absolutely. Just like compost, it’s a great addition to garden soil, as well as most kinds of soil. Soil amendments with these materials provide water retention and aeration that can help house plants grow more easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use **peat** **moss** in vegetable gardens, especially when growing plants with tender skin and bear juicy fruits such as tomatoes, strawberries, and blueberries. This dead fibrous material holds water well giving more supply to the roots of juice-bearing plants. Besides, these acidic soil loving plants can benefit from the low pH of **peat** **moss**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   NOTE: Since **peat** **moss** is a non-renewable resource the horticultural community is beginning to look at a renewable resource to supplement the demand of **peat**. This renewable resource is coco coir or coconut fiber. Currently, it looks to hold all the same qualities and nutrients as **peat**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When I say I use Soil³ for EVERYTHING, I mean it. From seed starting to container gardens to in ground growing, Soil³ is the ONLY product that I grow in. After 5 years I have yet to experience any problems and have found the management to be significantly less compared to the days of using **peat** **moss**. Because Soil³ is compost it holds more water and nutrients, lowering my maintenance considerably. Both food and flowers thrive in it making it the logical answer to grow every plant that you love. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** is sometimes maligned among eco-conscious gardeners. While they’re not wrong to question the origin of **peat** **moss** sold in stores, the truth is more complicated than one might think. Therefore, the topic deserves examination and discussion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Carefully, you can apply **peat** **moss** in a 2:1 ratio as a soil amendment, with two parts soil to one part **peat** **moss**. Mix the **peat** **moss** into the top 12 inches of the soil along with other amendments until the mixture is evenly distributed and plant into the freshly prepared ground.​ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** helps retain moisture and nutrients for plant roots for sandy soil. If you intend to use it as a soil amendment, you should know that it changes soil pH levels. Ensure you measure and watch out if the pH level drifts too much by testing the soil pH. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The top portion of the sphagnum **peat** **moss** has its uses, too. While it’s stringier than the deeper decayed **moss**, it is often used in reptile cages or terrarium use. It is not as decayed, and still resembles the plant it used to be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** comes from **peat** bogs, many of which are found in the wetland areas of Canada. Peat bogs are formed, over the course of very long periods of time, as organic materials partially decompose. Because of the water in these bogs, anaerobic conditions are maintained. Anareobic conditions slow down full decomposition. The result is that the **peat** **moss** is preserved almost indefinitely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sphagnum **peat** **moss** works well as a seed starting medium. It has numerous benefits that make for a fantastic starting mix and **peat** **moss** is sterile, homogenous and absorbent. These characteristics can make a fantastic seed starting medium. The material stays uniformly moist, which helps in the germination of your vegetable seeds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As a soil conditioner with many nutrients involved, it improves the texture and consistency of the soil. Gardening centers sell Sphagnum **moss** in tightly packed cubic foot bales primarily for use as a component in potting soil and as soil amendment. The Canadian **peat** **moss** that came from remote bogs appears as the most popular. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat doesn’t have any nutrient content, unlike compost, animal manures, and other soil mixes. Therefore, it’s only good for consistency and water retention. Peat **moss** soil is never just **peat** **moss**. Mixing **peat** **moss** with soil is what creates these blends. If you’re growing plants in **peat**, you’ll always need some source of nutrients in addition to the **moss**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Avoid using it on non-acidic plants due to its acidic properties. Using the **peat** bog product as mulch around non-acidic loving plants puts them under overwhelming stress. Also, it carries the tendency to form surface cracks when it dries out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although known as a good fertilizer for many plants, gardeners need to exercise caution. Too much of this product may impact the growth of plants. Moreover, some plants react badly to some properties of **peat** **moss**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** sits well below live sphagnum. To reach the decayed material, harvesters must remove the sphagnum covering it. Then, they drain the bog and suction the **peat** with vacuum-type equipment. After harvesting, **peat** **moss** is dried, shredded, and chopped for consumer use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another one of the environmental concerns is that removing plants in bogs to access sphagnum **moss** contributes to global warming. The vast majority of plants in **peat** bogs sequester carbon dioxide. When all the plants are removed, the decomposition process **peat** goes through releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Top that off with the fossil fuels used to power the harvesters, and you may be able to see where the concerns lie. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** also works great as a soil amendment. It can greatly improve any dry and sandy soil. Peat **moss** will help the soil retain moisture and improve drainage. All of this will prevent compaction, which is a common problem with many soil types. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In planning your food garden, if your soil is alkaline, consider adding **peat** **moss**. If the pH is fine, but the ground is too powdery or compact, amend it with **peat** alternatives. Organic possibilities are compost, coconut fiber, PittMoss, and earthworm castings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These qualities make **peat** **moss** mainly useful in vegetable gardens, where extremes of dry and wet can negatively impact the growth and production of vegetables. Just remember that too much **peat** **moss** can change the pH level of the soil, so garden accordingly.​ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many gardeners often discover that the quality of the dirt in their gardens is less than optimal while preparing the soil for gardening. Dirt that is hard or dry (or both) makes growing grass, flowers, trees, fruits, and vegetables especially difficult. Plants need loose, moist soil to properly form the roots that provide nutrients and water to the plants. So, how do you improve the quality of soil that is dry, hard, or clayous? Learn how to use gardening **peat** **moss** in your garden with these tips and instructions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can use **peat** for seed starting, making potting mixes and improving your raised garden bed soil. For larger projects, use compost as a cheaper option. The **peat** products mainly comes from Canada making it expensive when used in large quantity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat is the broader term for the material harvested from the bogs. Peat **moss** is the combination of **peat** and various species of sphagnum **moss**, a living plant such as Sphagnum cymbifolium. There actually 120 species of sphagnum **moss** that grow around the globe, and it is prevalent in the Northern Hemisphere. Both **peat** and sphagnum are harvested for the horticultural trade and ultimately are sold as a major component of potting soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even though **peat** **moss** absorbs water well, it doesn't compact, unlike soil. Compaction makes it hard to create space for the water and air to pass through. But if you add **peat** **moss** to any compact material, you'll have solved the compaction problem and made the growing mix drain better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cleanliness: When you spill **peat** **moss**, you don't make much of a mess. Just sweep up the dry material. No dirty streaks are left behind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When should I use **peat** **moss** on my lawn? Peat **moss** uses can include lawn as well as garden. The timing is key, though. It’s best to use this material when you are planting sod, rather than using it while your lawn is growing. That’s because of the acidity spike it can create in the existing soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But **peat** **moss** has other uses, as well. Outdoors, it can be tilled into a planting bed where the soil is not sufficiently friable. Peat **moss** will lighten up the soil in your garden, which may have become compacted over the years, resulting in inadequate drainage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another thing organic gardeners appreciate is all-natural sources. Not only is **peat** **moss** organic, but it’s also only one step removed from the plants in the **peat**lands it comes from. Bog **moss** is essentially organic matter used in soil mixes, and bulk **peat** **moss** is sold on its own too. Peat **moss** doesn’t have any chemicals in it either. It’s free of fungus, bacteria, harmful chemicals, and weed seeds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sand has very coarse particles that do not release nutrients to plants easily. It does not change the pH of your soil, but it also doesn't hold nutrients well, so adding sand on top of a **peat** **moss**/vermiculite mix is not ideal. Sand may be preferable if you are planting trees or other plants that don't need consistent nutrients. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is organic material degraded by the action of moisture, oxygen, bacteria, and heat. Like **peat** **moss**, compost helps the soil retain water. It’s a rich source of plant nutrients. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When mixed with other growing media such as perlite or vermiculite, it creates a nice balance of moisture and aeration for hydroponic growing. Growing Acid-loving Plants Peat **moss** is acidic, and is excellent for use with acid-loving plants, like blueberries, azaleas and tomatoes. Because it can make your soil more acidic, you may need to add lime to the soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Acidic pH features – Peat **moss** is slightly acidic and which means it is great for acid-loving plants . There are many plants you may wish to grow that need slightly acidic soil, such as camellias and blueberries. If your garden soil is not acidic, add a bit of **peat** **moss** to make acid-loving plants thrive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Soil Amendment While **peat** **moss**, unlike compost, doesn't have lots of nutrients, it can improve the soil structure. For example, when mixed into clay soil, it improves aeration and drainage. For fast-draining soils, it can be used to improve water retention. Because it is sterile, **peat** **moss** does not introduce pathogens into the soil. When used as a soil amendment, use two parts soil to one part **peat** **moss**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, these is one slight disadvantage of **peat** **moss**: it is somewhat expensive. Keep this in mind before ordering large quantities of it. Also, there are certain environmental concerns associated with **peat** **moss**. Remember all of this before you choose to use **peat** **moss** in your garden. Most of the time, however, the advantages of using **peat** **moss** are bigger than the downsides. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat bogs are formed over a long period of time, like millennia, and are found predominately in the Northern Hemisphere. Most of the **peat** used in the US is harvested from Canadian bogs. The simple explanation is that **peat** bogs are formed as organic matter decomposes. Because of the environmental conditions—aka water—the material doesn’t fully decompose, resulting in **peat** that is preserved indefinitely. Technically, **peat** is not living, in fact, it has been dead for a longtime. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is an important type of **peat** because it has high nutrient content, making it useful in growing Cattleya Orchids because orchids like organic material in their soil. It's also used for potted flowering plants and nurseries that produce bedding plants. It's a little more acidic than sphagnum **peat** **moss** and holds more water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It provides nooks and crannies where new, tender roots can grow. Peat **moss** also keeps humidity high, essential when plants have a new home. It also corrects the acidity of the soil and breaks down the consistency and texture of the soil, especially if it's clay soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cornell University recommends amending of garden soil with one-third **peat** **moss**. In the vegetable garden, evenly distribute the **peat** into the soil around 12 inches deep. You might turn garden compost into the soil alongside the **peat** **moss**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black **peat** is harvested differently than sphagnum **peat** **moss** in a way that preserves the living plant. It's cut from Sphagnum bogs in Canada and is probably black because of its high carbon content. It requires more processing before it's sold but has less dust and fewer contaminants than brown **peat** **moss**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** is a soil amendment that is a dark-brown fibrous material used as a planting medium for growing plants. Peat **moss** is naturally made or formed after 1,000 years and harvested from **peat** bogs. There's much debate about its environmental safety since it's not sustainable and gives off carbon dioxide when harvested. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mulch can and should be applied as a top dressing. Peat **moss** should be mixed into soil. Top dressing with **peat** is a bad idea because wind will blow it around and rain will harden it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In order for **peat** **moss** to work, it is important to know how to apply it properly in your garden. The exact application will depend on the use and the desired effect. Regardless of the use, however, remember that you need to wet your **peat** **moss** before you add it to the soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are looking for an organic material to improve the content of your soil, using **peat** **moss** is a good option. It comes from bogs and is fully natural. The best part is that it's now harvested at its optimal stage, further adding that this is an organic ingredient. Also, quarrying and transportation do burn a lot of fossil fuels, so if it's produced organically, it's not harvested and delivered organically. قوانين لعبة الروليت - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So we’ve dedicated this piece to this interesting **moss**, what it is, and how to use it in the garden. We’ll also touch on why it has been looked down upon by gardeners who appreciate an ecologically sound practice. All this will help you as a gardener make the best possible decision about using it or an alternative. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your soil is high in sand or clay, adding **peat** will make it suitable for your crops. To do this, spread **peat** **moss** over your plot in a 3-inch layer. Then, mix it to a 12-inch depth until evenly distributed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Simplify matters with container gardening and a soil-less medium. One option is using PittMoss exclusively. Or, create a mix of **peat** **moss**, coco coir, and earthworm castings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** is also used to grow plants that prefer soil with low pHs, such as rhododendrons, gardenias, heathers, tomatoes, Pieris, azaleas, and camellias. These plants need a **peat** **moss** mixture for their acidic soil. When combined with the correct potting mix, these plants enjoy having an environment where they can take up essential nutrients from the soil and conserve water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the best things to happen in the **peat** world in recent years is efforts toward making **peat** a renewable resource. Through organizations like the International Peat Society, ethical and ecologically sensitive harvesting has been put into practice. Living plant material is relocated to make extraction more ecological. They have developed initiatives to mitigate the conflicting interests of land protectors, conservationists, and **peat** producers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The basic idea here is simple: synthetic fertilizers present in **peat** **moss** potting soil are a short-term fix for a long-term need. You are much better off gardening with organic products as they provide what the plants need for the long haul. This includes using Soil³ compost in place of potting soil. Because every bag of Soil³ is derived from organic matter and is inoculated with microbes you can start with a growing media that is LIVING! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The term **peat** **moss** most often refers to the lower levels of **peat** found in a **peat** bog. Sphagnum **peat** **moss** is the plant from which the **peat** **moss** we use for gardens is derived, but most of the **peat** we like to use is the long-decayed form that collects deeper in the bog layers. Over time, it becomes packed down, compressed, and decays into a lovely spongy mass. The lower levels may also contain other decomposed organic material, like other rotted plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The base-level **peat** **moss** pH is 5.5 (sometimes even more acidic at 4.0) at least at the start of its use. While this may not seem like a problem for people who love to grow acid-loving plants, the low pH of acidic soil may be an issue for plants that need alkaline or neutral soil. Using **peat** may initially make your soil pH low, but studies have shown it will neutralize within a day or so. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can use **peat** **moss** as a soil amendment. Dry, sandy soils advantage from adding **peat** **moss** to retain moisture and **peat** **moss** improves drainage and prevents compaction in dry and wet soils alike.​ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note that you cannot use **peat** **moss** dry, as it will repel water. Therefore, wet it well beforehand. To do this, pour the amount you need in a wheelbarrow or large bucket. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since **peat** **moss** is very dry, it's not 100% suitable for soil. It can be combined with other organic materials to improve the water retention capacity of your growing medium. When starting seeds with **peat** **moss** alone, ensure they get enough moisture. It's also good to mix it with soils and some other soilless media. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sphagnum **peat** **moss** is used in soilless potting mixes. So if you have started plants indoors from seed, you have likely already dealt with **peat** **moss**. A soilless potting mix is much better to use for starting seeds than regular soil for the following reasons: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** and sphagnum **moss** differ in texture. Whereas **peat** **moss** is chopped, sphagnum fibers are fuzzy and long. Florists dress up potted plants by covering their topsoil with sphagnum. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Furthermore, coir supplies plants with minerals. Coir also differs from **peat** by being denser, costlier, and less acidic. Its pH ranges between 6.0 and 6.7, close to neutral. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** is often used as a base layer to germinate and grow plants like vegetables and flowers. It provides aeration to the root zone, and it's very easy to use for newcomers in hydroponics. When using **peat** **moss** for seed starting, you also need special trays with drain holes on the bottom because if you don't, the **peat** **moss** will expand and block the water flow out of your seedling flat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Don't confuse sphagnum **peat** **moss** with sphagnum **moss**, even if their names are similar. Sphagnum **moss** refers to the plant material harvested when still alive and growing above water. The end product is the light, fibrous material often used to decorate line wire baskets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dig a network of ditches along the **peat**land to drain the water. Second, remove the native vegetation to get the **peat** exposed. Third, level the harvest to prevent drainage of the surface runoff. Fourth, harrow the top layer to speed up the drying process of **peat**s. Fifth, suck up the dry **peat** layer using a large vacuum harvester. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peatlands absorb carbon dioxide from the Earth’s atmosphere, markedly reducing air pollution. The live sphagnum presses against the **peat** below it, preventing carbon dioxide from escaping the bog. However, **peat** mining exposes the stored carbon dioxide, releasing it back into the atmosphere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you use **peat** **moss** for container gardening , make sure to mix it with a lot of soil, compost, and fertilizer. Peat **moss** works great for containers because it provides container plants with a lot of organic material. Peat **moss** is good because it preserves moisture, which is important for container plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll easily find organic **peat**. You may come across coco-**peat**, but this is another name for coconut fiber. Don’t make the mistake of buying sphagnum **moss** or spag **moss**, which are too coarse for gardening. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some growers consider **peat** **moss** to be nutrient-poor. It doesn't contain much nitrogen, potassium, or phosphorus, but it does have calcium and magnesium, which are essential nutrients for the growth of cannabis plants. Unlike other organic materials such as manure compost, **peat** **moss** is very poor in nutrients. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** is not only organic, and has excellent water holding capacity, but it is also completely sterile. As we mentioned in the last section, there are no chemicals used in processing **peat** **moss**. Because there are no fungi, bacteria, and weed seeds, this media is clean as a whistle. Peat **moss** also has antiseptic qualities that originate in polysaccharides which suck harmful bacteria into cell walls. There’s a long and very interesting history of the use of this **moss** in medicine and as bandages. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What can I use instead of **peat** **moss**? There are several choices! One of the most commonly used alternatives is coconut coir, a material made of coconut fiber that is extracted from broken-down coconut shells. Coconut coir can have a high salinity content, though, making it necessary to water more. Other materials like worm castings serve a similar function, adding water retentive properties to the soil which helps gardeners grow plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the most effective and controversial materials to garden with is **peat** **moss**. Effective because it works well in tons of situations, and controversial because of how it is sourced. Many gardeners buy it on the regular without even knowing what it is or what it’s doing in their practice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   PittMoss has many of the properties of **peat** but without its ecological impact. For example, PittMoss enhances soil aeration, water retention, and nutrient availability. Regarding texture, it’s fluffy, lightweight, and drains well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some are bagged separately, and some are combined with decayed organic materials to be incorporated into potting soils sold worldwide. Some are made into **peat** pellets, and some are sold as simply **peat** **moss**. Then it hits the shelves, where you’ve likely seen and bought it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of the growing materials are not clean. However, that's not the case with **peat** **moss**. If you drop some wet **moss**, pick it up, get it dried or sweep it up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pretty much every store you go to will have some form of **peat** **moss** available, whether it be a potting mix, **peat** **moss**, or specifically sphagnum **peat** **moss**, you’ll have no trouble locating a source. So many growers rely on this plant for soilless mixes, starting seeds, and soil amendment and **peat** **moss** has been on the market for a long time. Therefore, it’s reliable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** is a wonderful natural organic way to condition the soil and provide its nutrients, but knowing how to mix it well with other ingredients to get the proper growth from specific vegetables and plants is very important. Use equal parts **peat** **moss**, perlite, vermiculite and compost to make small little mounds for your seeds. A bit of wood ash must be thrown into the mix to counteract the acidity. Peat **moss** provides organic matter for fine-textured soils. It improves the moisture-holding capacity of coarse soils and it is an excellent growing medium for plants in flats because of its physical nature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While **peat** is very moisture retentive, the fibrous material is also hydrophobic when it dries out. Therefore, it takes a significant amount of water to re-activate the retention it provides when slightly moist. Peat soil that has dried out may require some kind of surfactant, or wetting agent to break the tension and allow it to absorb water again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is a great seed starting medium. It is sterile, absorbent, and the homogeneous material is simple to work with. This keeps the seedbed uniformly moist, aiding in seed germination. Most seed starting mixes have **peat** **moss**, and you can make your seed starting mix by mixing **peat** **moss** with other soils or by making a **peat** **moss** based potting soil and by adding fertilizer and vermiculite.​ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The dark brown, compact matter that recognizes as **peat** **moss** is a far cry from the organic material’s origins. Peat **moss** is the decomposed remains of sphagnum **moss** and other living things that form a dead and fibrous material over the course millennia in **peat** bogs around the world.​ Peat **moss** doesn’t compact, so it can last for years in soils, providing excellent aeration and water holding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An ideal soil will retain enough moisture to keep your plants irrigated. But you do not want all of the water to pass quickly through your soil. It is a delicate balance, and **peat** **moss**, with its ability to retain water, will help you achieve that balance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although sometimes referred to as **peat**, **peat** **moss** and **peat** are not the same things. Peat **moss** is one of the products harvested from **peat** bogs. Other types of **peat** **moss** come from the partial decomposition of other organic materials. If you know how to make compost then you must know this type of **peat** **moss**. The **moss** in **peat** **moss** refers to sphagnum **moss**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This guide covers everything from the types of **peat** **moss** available to how much water each type holds. We'll cover everything from planting trees and shrubs with **peat** **moss** as a potting medium or using it as alternative mulch material in vegetable gardens. You'll also find out which kinds of plants grow best when grown directly in **peat** **moss** without any additional soil mixed into the mix. Let’s get started! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The fibers help the soil retain and release water. For this reason, **peat** **moss** balances sandy soil nicely. Sand quickly drains water from plant roots before they get a chance to drink. However, plants can easily draw water from **peat**, along with soil nutrients. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To gauge appropriate wetness, take a handful of **peat** **moss** and squeeze it. If this yields a drop or two of water, that’s perfect. If squeezing produces a water stream, add more **peat** **moss** until it passes the moisture test. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** offers additional benefits. Since it is a material rich in carbon, it can be used as a source of carbon for your compost pile. Also, the fact **peat** **moss** retains moisture becomes very helpful because it allows you to water your plants less frequently. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most significant disadvantages of **peat** **moss** are it's too acidic for non-acid-loving plants, it's not renewable, and it doesn't have any nutrients. The upside to **peat** **moss** is it's sterile and free of weed seeds; however, weeds can still grow in **peat** **moss** once you start using it and it's exposed to the elements. Also, once you start using it, **peat** **moss** can attract bugs like fungus gnats since it's also decaying. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For this purpose, use the **peat** **moss** alone or in a mixture with some soils. You can also remove the hassle by getting the **peat** pellets sold on the market. Many people also prefer a soilless mix of **peat** **moss**, perlite, coconut coir, and others in different amounts. This prevents diseases, fungi, bacteria, weed seeds, and other bad things commonly found in the soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** has a low pH level, so if you use much, lime should be added as well. Plants that do well in acidic soils, termed “ericaceous” such as blueberries and rhododendrons, advantage from **peat** **moss**. Compost generally has a neutral (pH 7) or slightly alkaline soil reaction. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **peat** definition is in order! How did this material gardeners spring for at the local nursery go from its natural source to a plastic bag? Peat **moss** comes from sphagnum **moss**, harvested from **peat** bogs in the Northern Hemisphere. The **moss** is then decayed and dried in the **peat**land, meaning it is allowed to lie exposed to the sun. What results is a dark brown fibrous material that is excellent for gardening. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There you have it. Peat **moss** is harvested from bogs or mires and is used in planting or potting soil mixes for acid-loving plants. Peat **moss** is not a natural garden soil ingredient, but it will help your garden grow lovely flowers and delicious foods. موقع 888 - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some **peat** producers use chemicals to make it water absorbing. This post a threat to your plants. Check the materials used in the label when purchasing or search for an organic **peat** **moss**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In fact, most of the quality seed starting mixes already contain **peat** **moss**. However, you may also make your own starting mix to add **peat** **moss** to it. Simply mix soil with some **peat** **moss** to create a good seed starting medium. You may also use potting soil with added fertilizer, vermiculite and **peat** **moss** to it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** holds water more than compost. Due to this, it benefits gardeners in a dry dirt or rocky soil which dries out quickly. Growers who plant in this type of soil can use **peat** **moss** to maximize output from their land. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Depending on how big your batch is, you only need a few tablespoons of the wood ash. I would say two tablespoons for a big batch and for a barrel full use a quarter of a cup. I use old egg cartons to store each individual mound, but you can even use ice trays as well. When using **peat** **moss** in the garden, it would help if you tested your soil first, because depending on what area you live in, your soil may be more acidic and using **peat** **moss** would be disastrous. If you live in an area where your soil is more alkaline, then **peat** **moss** could balance the PH and enhance your garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Castings are the waste products of farmed earthworms. Castings contain enzymes and minerals, providing crops with easily absorbed nutrients. Like **peat** **moss**, they enhance water retention, aerate the soil, and inhibit fungus. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Compost is cheaper than **peat** **moss** and fully sustainable in that you can easily make your own. On the other hand, compost won't last long like **peat** **moss**, and you'll have to add compost regularly. And lastly, compost will compact faster and easier than **peat** **moss**, but to have a comparable effect, you can add sand, shells, and eggshells to the soil to improve its texture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** is not a natural substance. It is the partially decayed remains of plants that have been harvested from **peat** bogs and mires, an ecosystem formed by the incomplete decomposition of organic matter in wetlands. Peat bogs are fragile habitats that take thousands of years to form. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Look in gardening sheds across the country, and you'll likely find **peat** **moss**. For decades, gardeners have used this soil amendment for seed starting, improving the soil and for creating potting mixes. In recent years, there's been some environmental concerns about using **peat** **moss** because it's not a sustainable resource. This blog explores what **peat** **moss** is and the best uses for it in the garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because **peat** **moss** is lightweight, moisture retentive, doesn't compact, is readily available and is acidic, it has many uses in the garden. It's often used with acid-loving plants, like blueberries While **peat** **moss**, unlike compost, and **peat** **moss** is good for growing tomatoes (both seed starting and mixing into the soil to moderate moisture). Because of its composition, **peat** **moss** is often mixed with clay soils to improve their drainage and reduce compaction. Its sterile, moisture retentive qualities make it a favorite for seed-starting too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Container Gardening: If you wish to use **peat** **moss** for container gardening, make sure to mix it with a lot of soil, compost and fertilizer. Peat **moss** works great for containers because it provides your container plants with a lot of organic material. Peat **moss** is also good because it preserves moisture, which is important for container plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Until I first dipped my hands into a bag of Soil³ I would never have considered using “compost” for containers and seed starting. Most compost is just not well drained enough and will cause water to pool resulting in anaerobic conditions, much like those **peat** bogs. But not all compost is created equal which is why Soil³ is such a special product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The annual rate of sphagnum growth is barely measurable — less than one millimeter or about 1/16 inch per year. For a bog to naturally generate one meter of **peat** **moss**, it can take 100 years. However, **peat** harvesters have discovered ways to expedite **moss** regeneration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The natural acidic property of **peat** **moss** appears useful in the inter mountain areas of the western United States. The same goes in regions where soils show as alkaline in nature. In an alkaline soil, adding **peat** **moss** results to a great advantage for your garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both have similar applications, but in general, the decayed form of **peat** **moss** is much more acidic than the one that still looks plant-like. Typically, the only **peat** you’ll find at the garden center is the lower, more decomposed material. It takes genuine work to find the dried sphagnum **moss**; typically, it’s only through pet stores or specialty reptile shops that you’ll find good quantities of it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A: It doesn’t have any nutrition, and doesn’t compact as much as compost does. If you need a soil amendment that has macronutrients and micronutrients, go for compost. For aeration and lightening, go for **peat**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moisture retention: Peat **moss** retains moisture. This makes it useful for seed starting. When mixed into garden soil, it helps the soil retain moisture. For plants like tomatoes, a regulated water supply produces better fruits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let’s start with the environmental concerns. On the whole, **peat** is a non-renewable resource. The fact that it outperforms other materials in the garden is why it was overharvested for a long time with little thought about how using **moss** for plants was contributing to ecological decline. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** is a very important component of most potting soils and seed starting mediums. It holds several times its weight in moisture and releases the moisture to the plant roots as required. It holds onto nutrients so that they aren’t rinsed out of the soil when you water the plant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Q: Can you please tell me what is the difference between **peat** **moss** and mulch? Both are advertised on the packaging to do the same thing: hold moisture, add nutrients to the soil and it’s good for the plants’ well-being. Mulch is not easy to put down, as it is very wet, whereas I can just grab a handful of **peat** **moss** at a time and easily place it around the plant. Can you please let me know your comments on when to use these treatments and which is better? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A: Untreated **moss** may contain fungi that can cause illness. Most of those you find in stores are well-treated. This is not a concern for most gardeners. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** has a natural ability to kill weed seeds and insects. When **peat** **moss** is added to the soil, it leaves no chance for mosquitoes and larvae to grow in your garden. This attribute can be very important if you want to avoid diseases such as malaria. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat mining is controversial. Environmental watchdog organizations say that **peat** **moss** isn’t sustainable. However, harvesters maintain that it is renewable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **peat** bog is a type of wetland, a low-lying, flooded landmass, containing saturated soils and aquatic plants. Originally, **peat** bogs evolved from lakes. Over thousands of years, sphagnum **moss** overgrew the lakes. As the surface vegetation thickened, the lower layers gradually died and decomposed, leaving brown, spongy **peat**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   People who wish to work with **peat** **moss** wonder how to use it in the garden. The main thing you need to keep in mind is that all depends on the reason you wish to use **peat** **moss** in the first place. Remember, there are many different reasons why someone might want to use **peat** **moss** in their garden. The most common uses are soil amendment, creating potting mixes and improving your vegetable garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Organic Gardening: You may wish to use **peat** **moss** for organic gardening. In this case, make sure to use only organic **peat** **moss**. It is always important to check the labels before you buy any product. Once you have organic **peat** **moss** you can mix it with soil and use it in many different ways in your organic garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sphagnum **peat** **moss** works great as a seed starting medium. It has numerous advantages that make for a fantastic starting mix. Peat **moss** is sterile, homogenous and absorbent. These characteristics make a fantastic seed starting medium. The material stays uniformly moist, which helps in germination of your seeds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Alternatively, mix your own seed medium. One way is combining **peat** and equal parts vermiculite and perlite, volcanic materials that aerate and drain soil. For this purpose, buy fine-textured **peat**, encouraging the growth of roots and tender shoots. Here’s detailed information on using **peat** to start seedlings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat was dried and used as a source of fuel in some countries for centuries. This is because it's rich in carbon dioxide, just like other fossil fuels. It was until the 1940s that **peat** had a place in horticulture. Today, it's used as a soil amendment, soilless mix, seed starting, and mushroom casting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In a wheelbarrow, measure out two parts of soil and one part **peat** **moss**. Thoroughly combine and spread over the raised bed. Then, mix to a 12-inch depth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We’ve talked generally about how **peat** **moss** is created. Now let’s take a closer look. Sphagnum **moss** grows freely in **peat** bogs or wetland areas of cool-climate tundras and conifer forests. A look at the video posted in this article will give you an idea of just how lush this plant is. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Its sterile and lightweight qualities make it a favorite for seed starting too. Seeds started in a **peat** **moss** mix are less likely to rot--and when they germinate, they have an easier time pushing through the lightweight **peat** **moss**. It's also free of weeds. Usually **peat** **moss** is mixed with other growing media like perlite, vermiculite or . Hydroponic Growing When mixed with other growing media such as perlite or vermiculite, it creates a nice balance of moisture and aeration for hydroponic growing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, "sphagnum **moss**" refers to a living plant. There are 120 species of this type of **moss** plant. Sphagnum **moss** is native to many countries across the globe, but it is especially prevalent in the Northern Hemisphere. "Peat **moss**" is not alive; it's long dead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the vegetable garden, **peat** **moss** can moderate extremes in soil dryness and soil wetness. This is very important when growing juicy-fruited plants with tender skins, such as tomatoes, strawberries, and blueberries. These acid-loving plants and many other fruits and vegetables benefit from **peat** **moss**’s lower pH level. The product’s sterility means it won’t begin weeds, diseases or pathogens that can quickly ruin a vegetable garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** prevents soil compaction. In dense soils, the particles are jammed together, making it hard for plant roots to breathe, drink, and grow. However, since **peat** **moss** is spongy, it loosens tight soils, such as those high in clay. As a result, air and water can circulate better, making roots less prone to rot and stunting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A recent article in the New York Times written by Margaret Roach piqued my interest. In it, my friend Dr. Brian Jackson, a soil scientist at NC State University, explains the **peat** **moss** dilemma: from environmental impact to shipping considerations to ease of use. The discussion around **peat** **moss** is complicated and multi-faceted, but for me, it brings up a long-standing dissatisfaction with commercial potting soil. So let’s dive in and find out more about **peat** **moss** and how it compares to other growing materials like Soil³ compost. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dried **peat** **moss** also appears in the production of some surgical dressings and lamp wicks. It also improves water drainage in clay soil. Also, the dried **peat** helps the clean sandy soil hold more water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because of the cellular structure of sphagnum **moss**, **peat** **moss** is an excellent resource for water retentive properties. Sphagnum **moss** has two kinds of cells: those that assist in photosynthesis and those barrel-shaped cells that retain water. Both of these are necessary for thriving **peat**land, as much of the main source of nutrition for sphagnum is in the water and decayed **moss** below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **moss** will release the water to maintain the wetland as well. This is why **peat** **moss** is such an essential addition to gardeners’ soil. Much of what we do is figure out the best possible ways to carry out good water retention in the garden. Peat **moss** bogs and in turn **peat**y soil are the main sources of moisture retention for many. That’s why it’s commonly used in potting soil, and to line wire baskets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** comes from your flower pot or garden from wetlands or bogs. It's not decomposed material because the surface of the blogs doesn't allow oxygen and air to filter underground. لعبة قمار بوكر This makes the fibers of the sphagnum **moss** remain intact. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although compost is nutrient-rich, it doesn’t compare to **peat** **moss** when it comes to anti-compaction capabilities. Much of this is related to the moisture-retentive properties of **peat**, which keeps the soil it’s in aerated and light. It’s an excellent amendment for topsoil, which can compact quickly and easily. I know **peat** in soil would have been a welcome addition to my first raised bed, which I readily filled with the cheapest topsoil I could find, only to plant my crops in what was essentially cement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of the quality seed starting mixes already have **peat** **moss**. However, you can also make your starting mix to add **peat** **moss** to it. Simply mix soil with some **peat** **moss** to make a good seed starting medium. You may use potting soil with added fertilizer, vermiculite and **peat** **moss** to it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **moss** is an excellent amendment, particularly in sandy soils or in potted plants that have difficulty retaining moisture. We’ll talk more about how to use **peat** **moss** later. First up, a few distinctions! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, in two ways. One is using small quantities of **peat**. For example, mix it with potting soil for seed starting or container gardening. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** is a carbon-rich material, which makes it an excellent source of carbon in compost piles. The moisture-retaining quality of **peat** **moss** reduces the need for frequent watering, which makes it doubly valuable. The downsides of using **peat** **moss** in compost are the expense and the environmental concerns associated with sphagnum **peat** **moss**.​ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Properly applying **peat** **moss** to soil mixes and as an amendment is very important for the success of your vegetable garden. You will apply it differently depending on how you plan to use it, but for all applications, it is very important to wet the **peat** **moss** before adding it into the soil.​ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Then the top layer of the vast sphagnum patch is removed and relocated to other areas of the bog which have not been disturbed, where it can thrive. The decayed, dried sphagnum **moss** is allowed to lay in the sun for 2 to 3 days where it dries. It’s then scraped up with the harvester and sucked into a receptacle. Then it’s moved to a factory for processing and packaging. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** is often sold in plastic-wrapped bales in garden stores. The material is very dry, lightweight and dusty. Because it is sterilized and doesn't have any bacteria, fungus or weed seeds, it's a favorite for using for seed starting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mixed in with the highly water-absorbing **peat** **moss** material is “the white stuff” also known as perlite. This is a lightweight granular material made from expanded volcanic glass. It is totally sterile, long lasting, and offers nothing but drainage to the potting mix, which is exactly why it is incorporated. Traditional potting soil is noted for its water absorption, which can be excessive, hence the need to incorporate an amendment to make water drain out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** isn't better or worse than soil; it's different. It's soilless but is often added to soil to lighten, aerate, and help retain moisture. Although it's great for keeping moisture and aerating the soil, **peat** **moss** is not often used for lawns since its acidity hinders grass growth and can kill earthworms. However, adding **peat** **moss** to your soil is excellent if you have acid-loving plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although sometimes referred to as "**peat**" for short, **peat** **moss** and **peat** are not, technically, the same. "Peat" is the broader term: Peat **moss** is just one of the products harvested from **peat** bogs. Other kinds of **peat** come from the partial decomposition of other organic materials. The "**moss**" in "**peat** **moss**" refers specifically to sphagnum **moss** (for example, Sphagnum cymbifolium). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** is available in several grades, with different particle sizes. The larger the particles are, the more expensive it is. Use **peat** **moss** as a soil amendment to lighten heavy soils and increase water retention. For clay and heavy soils that get compact easily, it softens the soil structure and improves the drainage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** tends to be expensive and this is particularly true if you need large quantities of it. You can cut the price a bit if you don’t use **peat** **moss** only, mix it with your garden soil to add benefits but avoid using large quantities of **peat** **moss**. Alternatively, you can prepare own mix than buying a commercial mix for a large amount. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another one of the best **peat** **moss** uses is in soilless potting mixes. These are great for plants that don’t need a lot of nutrition to grow but do require air circulation and drainage. Most soils (even **peat** soils) host bugs, fungus, or bacteria. That’s why a soil-less mix is one of the best uses for **peat** **moss**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like **peat** **moss**, sphagnum **moss** is harvested for the horticultural trade. For example, it is commonly used to line wire baskets for hanging plants to retain the soil. But the sphagnum **moss** used for this purpose was a plant growing in nature not long ago. You can also tell from its appearance that it is a type of **moss**, whereas **peat** **moss** bears more resemblance to soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To this day, the cycle of **moss** growth and decay continues. Live sphagnum floats above the dead **peat**, ranging up to 10 feet in depth. Peat bogs are also called **peat**lands. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of the US’s sphagnum **moss** resources come from Canada or the northern parts of the United States. Sphagnum **moss** grows specifically in wetlands in tundra areas. There are sphagnum **peat** bogs in South America as well, but our commercial **peat** **moss** comes from the north. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** is useful for container gardening , as it preserves moisture and gives containers a good organic material to grow in. For containers, make sure to mix **peat** **moss** with adequate amounts of soil, compost, and fertilizers to keep your container gardens happy.​ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Despite being organic, **peat** **moss** is not fertile and it doesn’t contain nutrients plants need to grow. Peat **moss** does have a bit of nutrient, minerals and beneficial microorganisms. In this sense, **peat** **moss** will not ruin the fertility of the soil. However, you will probably want to use more than just **peat** **moss** to make your plants grow strong and healthy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** is a soil amendment that is harvested from **peat** bogs. Many of these **peat** bogs are found in wet areas of Canada. Peat bogs are formed over a long period as organic materials partially decompose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also use **peat** **moss** for organic gardening. In this case, make sure to use organic **peat** **moss**. It is important to check the labels before you buy any product. Once you have organic **peat** **moss** you can mix it with soil and use it in many different ways in your organic vegetable garden . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
