-   Asteraceae is a family of **flowers** containing nearly 2,000 plant genera and more than 32,000 species of **flowers** commonly called daisies, asters, and sun**flowers**. Most flowering plants in this family are herbaceous annual, biennial, and perennial flowering plants. However, the family does contain a handful of flowering vines, shrubs, and trees, too! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Snapdragons are popular garden plants and cutting **flowers** that fare well in rock gardens, cottage gardens, beds, and borders. They produce columns of pinnate leaves atop which spires of blossoms shoot upward. The dragon-shaped **flowers** bloom in shades of yellow, white, **pink**, red, and various combinations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It has glossy, green, heart-shaped leaves that have a fleshy texture. They almost look like clusters of lily pads sprouting from the stem. The plant’s lemon-colored **flowers** are distinctive in shape, with 7 to 12 glossy tepals surrounding a fuzzy, yellow center. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fiesta Time Hollyhock is a party for the senses, putting forth fringed **flowers** that dip and curve along the edges for scrumptious vegetative texture. They grow all along the stem, starting at the bottom in mid-summer and finishing their growing season a mere two months later. Be cautious, as these will self-seed and take over in colonies if not thoughtfully pruned. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Mollie Rilstone has fleshy petals in the picotee tradition, an old-fashioned variety of sweet pea. The fanned ripples are an ombre of cream to true **pink**, and they are generous in fragrance. You can look forward to towering plants of up to 8-feet tall when grown in humusy, well-drained soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The beauty of yellow **flowers** is that there are so many different shades, ranging from the more mellow to the downright vibrant. While the color is often a bit softer and more inviting than, say. orange or red, it still manages to pack a bold punch. Read on for our top picks for the prettiest plants (perennial or annual!) with yellow **flowers** to add to your garden this season. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it's time to plan out the garden, you have a lot of decisions to make. Do you need full-sun perennials or is your yard demanding more shade-friendly **flowers** and plants? Are you more interested in planting some of the best annual **flowers**? What kind of pollinators do you want to attract—do you want **flowers** that attract hummingbirds, **flowers** that attract bees, **flowers** that attract butterflies, or all of the above? Of course, no matter what you decide, in order to make the boldest statement possible, your garden should be filled with variety. We're talking loads of different kinds of textures and foliage, a range of plants and **flowers** in different widths and heights, and lots of blooms in different colors.

-   If you enjoy decorating your garden using the complementary colors technique, use the second color sparingly.

-   Not all varieties of colourful **flowers** came to be on their own. Man’s hand has guided a few of the **flowers** towards their specific colours.

-   Many colourful plants and **flowers** have become the attractive species we know and love today thanks to evolution. While a lot of plants spread their pollen with the help of the wind some prefer a more direct approach. Many colourful **flowers** gradually developed bright colours as a way to encourage insects to spread their pollen for them. This has helped plants to pass on their genes and reproduce much more effectively. This is why some flower seeds are advertised specifically for their ability to attract bees and butterflies into your garden, as their job is to spread themselves with the help of these flying friends. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
