## 32 Reference List: What Is Rockwool Made Out Of | Cellulose Insulation
-   The individual fibers of **rockwool** insulation are good conductors of heat on their own, but rolls and sheets of this insulation are highly efficient at blocking heat transfer. They are often used to prevent the spread of fire in buildings, in light of their extremely high melting point. As with other types of insulation, **rockwool** can play a large role in reducing energy consumption in homes and businesses. Made of natural materials, **rockwool** insulation is safe to manufacture and use, when proper guidelines are followed. Decades of research have shown that it poses little to no health risk to humans, including that of respiratory and other cancers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Currently stone wool, to use a synonym, is also used in acoustic control coatings for noise control, marine applications, fire-resistant coatings or insulations, and in vibration control systems. In addition, a number of researchers have studied the horticultural use of "**rockwool**" citing its advantages in the control of certain pathogens that affect crop growth. This research is cited in detail - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rockwool insulation refers to a type of insulation that is **made** from actual rocks and minerals. It also goes by the names of stone wool insulation, mineral wool insulation, or slag wool insulation. A wide range of products can be **made** from **rockwool**, due to its excellent ability to block sound and heat. This type of insulation is commonly used in building construction, industrial plants, and in automotive applications. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are insulating the walls of your home there are a few different materials you can use. One material that is growing in popularity is Rockwool – which like the name suggests is wool **made** from molten rock. A mixture of basalt, anorthosite, and cemented briquettes are heated up in excess of 15000c at which the rock mixture becomes molten and this is then spun into fibres. A binder and mineral oil are then added which stabilises the spun rock wool fibres and also makes them water repellant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rock wool is a member of mineral insulation family which is **made** from the natural ingredients Basalt rock and Chalk. However, Rockwool insulation refers to a type of insulation that is **made** from actual rocks and minerals. It also goes by the names of stone wool insulation, mineral wool insulation, or slag wool insulation. A wide range of products can be **made** from **rockwool**, due to its excellent ability to block sound and heat. Rockwool insulation is commonly used in building construction, industrial plants, and in automotive applications. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is best to use distilled water because of its purity but tap water can work in a pinch if it is the only thing available. Adjust the pH slowly until it reaches the desired 5.5; it is critical the pH doesn’t drop below 5.0 since it will start todamage the **rockwool** fibers when it is too acidic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tip: place seeds on a new clean wetted paper towel and give the seeds a sealed cover of some source to aid in germination. When the root emerges from the seed casing, immediately gently move with a tweezer the germinated seed into a rock wool cube at a depth the width of the seed casing. Flood the germinated seed placed in wetted **rockwool** with light at this point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When comparing **rockwool** and fiberglass batt wall insulation, they have a roughly similar R-value of around 3.30-3.40 per inch of thickness. Because they have the same thermal conductivity – for instance, 0.044 W/mK for both Knauf Loft Roll Earthwool Insulation and ROCKWOOL Twin Roll Insulation – they will provide equal performance in this department. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Modern mineral wool, widely referred to as "rock wool", is a manufactured product comprised of a mix of limestone, slag waste from steel blast furnaces, and basalt or diabase. Typically but varying by manufacturer, mineral wool insulation is about 3/4 steel slag and 25% basalt rock. Some **rockwool** producers use nearly pure recycled steel slag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Similar in texture to steel wool, **rockwool** is a dense mat consisting of long strands of natural fibers. Basalt rock and chalk are combined and then melted at a very high temperature (approximately 3000°F) to form lava. Then people throw the lava into a spinning chamber to create the fibers in a process much like making cotton candy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rockwool is a mainstay growing media for commercial hydroponics growers, primarily those who implement drip irrigation systems. Originally used as insulation and also known as mineral wool or stone wool, **rockwool** was developed in Denmark back in the 1970’s for gardening. It retains moisture well, it retains oxygen well, it never impedes root growth, it is chemically inert, and it comes in a variety of sizes and shapes. These benefits contribute to its popularity amongst growers, accommodating almost any plant they are growing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mineral wool or rock wool are **made** from natural or synthetic minerals.To make **rockwool** insulation, minerals and other raw materials are heated to about 2910°F (about 1600°C) in a furnace, through which a current of air or steam is blown. More advanced production techniques are based on rotating the molten rock at high speeds in a spinning wheel, in some ways resembling the way that cotton candy is **made**. The finished product is a mass of very fine intertwined fibers, bound together with starch. Oil is also added during production to decrease the formation of dust. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In its natural state, **rockwool** has a relatively high pH, which is unsupportive of plant growth. In order for it to be suitable as a medium for growing plants, it must be treated to lower the pH to a more stable and neutral value that will allow the plant to thrive. This treatment involves soaking the **rockwool** in pH-adjusted water for at least 24 hours before use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After Then submerge the **rockwool** cubes in the water and allow them to soak for up to 24 hours. When they have finished soaking, remove them from the water and carefully add them to the hydroponics system and allow the system to run without any plants until the pH of the system stays between 5.5 and 6.0 — this means the cubes are stable and can be used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Their inert nature also means growers can quickly adjust the conditions within the root zone to meet the needs of plants. A non-existent cation exchange capacity (CEC) prevents nutrients from being changed by the growing medium or tied up and **made** unavailable for plant uptake. The cubes can also be quickly rinsed with fresh water, leaching fertilizer salts out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To manufacture **rockwool**, minerals and other raw materials are heated to about 2910°F (about 1600°C) in a furnace, through which a current of air or steam is blown. More advanced production techniques are based on rotating the molten rock at high speeds in a spinning wheel, in some ways resembling the way cotton candy is **made**. The finished product is a mass of very fine intertwined fibers, bound together with starch. Oil is also added during production to decrease the formation of dust. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before using your **rockwool** in a hydroponics system it’s important to prepare it for use. Unlike other pH-neutral hydroponic growing media like Hydroton, and Coco Coir, Rockwool has a naturally high pH, typically around 8.0, because of the way it’s manufactured. During the process there is an abundance of lime that is deposited on the fibers; lime naturally neutralizes acidity, raising the pH. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are two types of mineral wool products: Glass wool and stone wool insulation. Stone wool insulation is engineered to be fabricated in OEM applications and comes in a variety of formats, densities and dimensions, making it easy to cut, bend, split, wrap and compress. It is **made** from volcanic rock, typically basalt and recycled materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While it is not attractive to rodents, **rockwool** can pose problems in other ways, especially if allowed to become wet. Rockwool insulation is able to retain a large amount of water, although gravity will make it slowly drain out, as long as it has a way to escape. This ability to hold water, coupled with the fact that it retains a certain amount of air at all times, has **made** **rockwool** a popular growing medium in horticulture and hydroponics. These properties of **rockwool** allow for good root growth and nutrient uptake. It also provides a good mechanical structure for the plant, keeping it strong and stable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mineral wool, also known as rock wool or stone wool, is **made** from a selection of raw materials, such as stone and glass. These raw materials are treated in a similar way to glass, in that they are melted at high temperatures until they melt, and then they are spun to form fibres, similar to wool. This wool is then packaged up into batts, rolls or slabs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To make **rockwool** insulation, minerals and other raw materials are heated to about 2910°F (about 1600°C) in a furnace, through which a current of air or steam is blown.

-   Insualting Products ‎ > ‎ Rockwool/Mineral Wool Rockwool insulation refers to a type of insulation that is **made** from actual rocks and minerals. It also goes by the names of stone wool insulation, mineral wool insulation, or slag wool insulation. A wide range of products can be **made** from **rockwool**, due to its excellent ability to block sound and heat.Rockwool insulation is commonly used in building construction, industrial plants, and in automotive applications. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   squeeze the cubes when they are wet. If you need to remove some of the water from them after preparing them in a pH controlled solution it’s best to shake them gently. Rockwool cubes are known for their internal structure that gives them such great water holding capacity and oxygen movement; squeezing them compacts the structure and hinders the benefits they are so well known for. DON’T forget **rockwool** is completely inert and can not provide any nutritional value to the plants growing in the cubes. Everything the plant needs has to come from the nutrient solution supplied to them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A pH of 8.0 isn’t optimum for growing plants so it needs to be adjusted to a level that is better suited for growth. A higher pH will make many plant essential nutrients unavailable for plant uptake, causing deficiency symptoms. Most plants prefer to grow in slightly acidic conditions, and will benefit if the pH of **rockwool** cubes is brought down to a more acidic level. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The individual fibers of **rockwool** insulation are good conductors of heat on their own, but rolls and sheets of this insulation are highly efficient at blocking the transfer of heat. They are often used to prevent the spread of fire in buildings, due to their extreme high melting point. Rockwool used in insulation plays a significant in reducing the energy comsumed in both domestic and commercial sectors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grower Tip: Like most growing media, **rockwool** is shipped dry. There is 0% water in it when you buy it. Before planting, **rockwool** cubes should be immersed in water (or a rooting solution) until they are saturated and all the rising bubbles are gone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Glass wool insulation, also known as fibreglass, is **made** from glass fibres. Glass is heated to very high temperatures until it melts, and is then spun quickly to create fibres. These fibres are then bound together to be used as insulation. The glass fibres create pockets of air which act as barriers to prevent heat loss because air is a poor conductor of heat. Glass wool can be found in batts and rolls, loose-fill insulation and also within insulation boards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The second is **made** from spinning slag. Slag is a byproduct resulting from the production of steel. Manufacturers can also make it from natural rock or a combination of molten slag, natural rock and even glass. Both types of stone wool are typically sold in batts and as loose-fill. Typically, mineral or stone insulation contains up to 90% recycled content. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Growers primarily use **rockwool** cubes as growing media for two main purposes in their hydroponics systems: germinating seeds and propagating new cuttings. Typically the 1.5” cubes are used for starting seeds or propagating cuttings. Some of the larger cubes (up to 4”) are used as a growing medium for compact plants as well, but on a much smaller scale. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Quick note to Tower Garden Growers at this point: Vermiculite is often provided along with your Tower Garden purchase as part of the seed package. It comes in a little clear envelope. Some people say you don’t have to use it, but they don’t understand that some seeds need darkness and some need light, so be sure to refer to the handy chart I’ve provided for knowing when to cover your seeds with vermiculite and when to skip covering it at all. In case you’re wondering, Vermiculite is **made** from compressed dry flakes of a silicate material which is absorptive and spongy making it a great option for covering seeds keeping balance of moisture and oxygen that a seed needs. BTW, thank you Tower Garden for providing this in each order!!! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This mineral wool or "rock wool" insulation article series illustrates and describes mineral wool or "rock wool" and slag wool insulation materials. Rock wool or "**rockwool**" insulation is also called mineral wool and slag wool though there can be differences among the components of these insulations. We describe old-house or "antique" mineral wool insulation as well as modern mineral wool insulating products still used in buildings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another benefit to **rockwool** cubes is they are considered to be a natural product even though they are man **made**. This is because they originate from basaltic rock and chalk which are natural ingredients. Being considered a natural product makes them acceptable in organic growing systems, increasing their popularity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
