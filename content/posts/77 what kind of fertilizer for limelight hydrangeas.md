## 77 Shocking Facts About What Kind Of Fertilizer For Limelight Hydrangeas | Annabelle Hydrangea Problems
-   It depends on the type of **fertilizer**. It’s a good idea to give **hydrangeas** a first feeding in mid-to-late spring. After that, apply additional **fertilizer** at intervals recommended by the manufacturer. Time-released **fertilizer**s might need to be applied only once every 3 months, while other types should be applied every 1 to 2 weeks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Learning how to fertilize hydrangea shrubs is equally as important as the type of **fertilizer** chosen. Apply a slow-release chemical for shrubs and trees once a year. Depending on the variety, a balanced time-release **fertilizer** can be applied a few times a year, in spring and early fall. Take care not to apply too much **fertilizer** as it could burn the leaves. Too much nitrogen could encourage more leaf growth, longer stems, and less flower growth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hydrangeas are relatively hardy plants, and they will grow in most soil without **fertilizer**. However, to get the maximum amount of blooms from your Hydrangea and encourage its growth, you should fertilize your Hydrangea. This is especially true if your Hydrangea is planted in poor-quality soil or soil that is not regularly amended. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hydrangeas do well with all-purpose mixes like 10-10-10 or 20-20-20. The upside of choosing this type of mix is that you can use it on most plants in your garden without keeping many different types of **fertilizer** on hand. Another good mix for Hydrangeas is 15-30-15. The higher ratio of Phosphorus helps to encourage the growth of new buds and blooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In cool-summer climates with abundant summer moisture, bigleaf **hydrangeas** can be grown in full sun. Where summers are hotter or dry, though, these **hydrangeas** appreciate morning sun and afternoon shade. Growing these in too much shade will result in fewer blooms or none at all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In most places, this will be around May, but the exact month can change depending on your climate and the type of Hydrangeas that you have. Watch for signs of growth. Don’t apply **fertilizer** until your Hydrangeas are no longer dormant; otherwise a heavy rain may wash away **fertilizer** before Hydrangeas get a chance to benefit from it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Smooth **hydrangeas** are named so because of the texture of their large leaf. Smooth **hydrangeas** also have large, globe-shaped white flower heads. Annabelle **hydrangeas**, also called snowball bush, are a popular type of smooth hydrangea. Smooth **hydrangeas** start blooming in late June and continue to bloom intermittently throughout the summer, so the second **fertilizer** application should be no later than mid-June. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hydrangeas are deciduous shrubs, so they naturally lose their foliage and go dormant in the wintertime. Hydrangeas begin preparing for dormancy in the fall season. Stop fertilizing **hydrangeas** at least two months before the expected time of receiving the first frost in your area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Third, make sure to apply your **fertilizer** within each Hydrangea’s drip line. The drip line is the area that the outermost branches and foliage cover. Keeping the **fertilizer** within these parameters makes it more likely that your plant will get a chance to absorb the **fertilizer** before it runs off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Granular **fertilizer** can be either quick-release or slow-release and tends to be cheaper than liquid **fertilizer**. But there are two significant downsides to granular **fertilizer**. One, it is easy to damage your Hydrangeas by applying too much, and two, heavy rains can wash away slow-release granular **fertilizer** before Hydrangeas can absorb all the nutrients. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some shrubs bloom on new wood, which means that the flowers bloom on buds formed in the current season. Since the buds formed after the winter, **hydrangeas** such as Smooth and Panicle **hydrangeas** need to be pruned in late winter or early spring just before the new growth starts. Pruning at this time will help the **hydrangeas** reach their full growth potential and the number of flowers that it produces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With their eye-catching blooms and luscious green foliage, Hydrangeas can easily be the star of any landscape. But despite their appearance, Hydrangeas aren’t divas. Although they have certain requirements, they are not as finicky as some other plants. Sometimes though, they may need a little help to reach their full potential. So what **fertilizer** is best for Hydrangeas? And how should you apply it? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Granular **fertilizer** is the most common form of **fertilizer** available. It comes in pellet or powder form and is used as a top dressing on the soil around Hydrangeas. Usually, you will have to water plants after applying granular **fertilizer** for the **fertilizer** to be absorbed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fertilizing **hydrangeas** can be a tricky task. Most **hydrangeas** don't need much, but woody plant guru Michael Dirr, a retired University of Georgia horticulture professor, says the best **fertilizer** for **hydrangeas** is an all purpose plant food applied in late winter or early spring. Be careful when applying hydrangea **fertilizer**: If you give your plants too much, you might get more leaves than blooms. Too much nitrogen also produces long stems that might not set flower buds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Available as either a concentrate for diluting with water or a ready-to-use product, liquid **fertilizer**s are quickly absorbed by the plant’s roots and leaves for a fast boost of nutrients. Depending on the product, liquid **fertilizer**s are either sprayed on the plant’s foliage or poured around the plant’s base. Granules: One of the most common forms of **fertilizer**s, granule **fertilizer**s can either be dissolved in water and poured on the soil or sprinkled around the plant’s base. Time-release granules, which have a polymer coating, should be worked into the soil around the **hydrangeas**’ base with gardening tools. They dissolve slowly and offer the plant a long-term supply of nutrients. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Miracid by Miracle-Gro: This water-soluble **fertilizer** is excellent for acid-loving plants like Hydrangeas. The **fertilizer** is water-soluble, so you can easily dilute the mixture to err on the side of caution. You should apply this quick-release **fertilizer** to your Hydrangeas once a month. Miracid is an easy-to-use, fast-acting choice for fertilizing Hydrangeas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best time to prune **hydrangeas** will also depend on the type of **hydrangeas**. Hydrangeas are woody shrubs. Some varieties of **hydrangeas** grow on old wood, and others bloom on new wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Full blooming colorful **hydrangeas** are a sight to behold! Large blooms are rewarding, but gardeners often struggle to get **hydrangeas** to bloom every year. Although **hydrangeas** aren’t considered high maintenance plants and can thrive in many different climates, they do require some TLC. More importantly, gardeners must understand how to fertilize **hydrangeas** properly to achieve big blooms every year. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   White hydrangea species produce only white flower heads, but an interesting thing happens to colored **hydrangeas** when the gardener alters the soil’s pH level. The more acidic the soil’s pH, the more likely it is that the hydrangea flowers will be blue. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 considered neutral. Levels higher than 7 are considered alkaline, while levels lower than 7 are considered acidic. The greater the pH variation, the more pronounced the hydrangea color change. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is all by way of saying that insofar as gardening with **hydrangeas** is concerned, various approaches to their cultivation can produce healthy and beautiful plants. They are so versatile in the landscape, as this pair of pots planted with Limelights can attest. Most and best of all, they are forgiving of neglect, and respond strongly to attention and care. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When shopping for **fertilizer**, examine the labels for the amounts of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Typically **hydrangeas** thrive when fed an all-purpose, balanced **fertilizer** like a 10-10-10 N-P-K or 12-4-8 N-P-K. To increase the size and quantity of hydrangea blooms, consider a **fertilizer** with more phosphorus. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Consider growing one of the many new **hydrangeas** that bloom on old and new wood. They're often called rebloomers, but they're technically remontant, meaning they flower more than once in a season. Or enjoy bigleaf **hydrangeas** only for their leaf colors; some varieties sport green-and-white variegated leaves or lemon-lime hues. These plants' coarse leaves add texture and fantastic fall color to the garden. Common varieties with variegated foliage include Guilded Gold, 'Lemon Wave', and Light-O-Day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The general advice is to fertilize once a year in a cooler climate and twice in a warmer climate with slow-release **fertilizer**s. For quick-release **fertilizer**, fertilize once each month during the growing season and stop two months before your first frost date. Follow the directions on your **fertilizer** package, and be on the side of fertilizing less over more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, water your Hydrangeas before applying **fertilizer**. This will protect the roots and ensures you do not accidentally burn your Hydrangeas. Some **fertilizer**s will also instruct you to water your Hydrangeas after applying the product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you can see, there are many different **fertilizer** options for your Hydrangeas. The best way to apply **fertilizer** to your Hydrangeas differs depending on what type of **fertilizer** you choose. Always read the packaging for the **fertilizer** that you choose and follow those instructions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Apply this quick-release liquid **fertilizer** to your Hydrangeas once each month. Dilute the mixture in water. To begin with, use less than the package calls for so you make sure your Hydrangea can handle the added nutrients. Super Bloom is an excellent choice if you want one product that you can use on many of the flowering plants in your garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to fertilizing, I always recommend erring on the side of caution. Too much **fertilizer** can harm root systems and even have your Hydrangeas producing more leaves than flowers. Remember, you can always add more **fertilizer**, but taking it away after the fact can be difficult. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like all plants, **hydrangeas** draw nutrients from water, sunlight, air, and soil, but not all soil contains the nutrients necessary for robust growth and flower development. That’s where hydrangea **fertilizer** can help. The best **fertilizer** for any individual hydrangea plant will depend on the gardener’s preferred method of delivering the **fertilizer** to the soil, and the condition of the existing soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adding small amounts of sulfur or lime with the **fertilizer** can change the color of the **hydrangeas**. Hydrangeas treated with sulfur will stay or turn blue or purple. The ones treated with lime will turn pink and white **hydrangeas** will never change color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best **fertilizer** for **hydrangeas** should contain a blend of nutrients to encourage healthy root and branch development while boosting the color, size, and quantity of flower heads. Don’t just grab a package of garden **fertilizer** off the shelf, though. Instead, read on to learn what to look for when choosing a **fertilizer** for **hydrangeas**, and find out why the following products can help this impressive plant become a focal point in the landscape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To qualify as a top pick, a **fertilizer** should provide the nutrients **hydrangeas** need for developing strong branches, healthy foliage, and beautiful blooms. The best **fertilizer** for **hydrangeas** will vary depending on the gardener’s goals for this spectacular shrub. Any one of the following **fertilizer**s is well suited for use on **hydrangeas**, but keep in mind that more is not necessarily better when it comes to fertilizing plants. Follow application instructions carefully. Do not overfeed **hydrangeas**; rather, err on the side of too little rather than too much and use **fertilizer** in combination with other soil amendments and an optimal growing location. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bone meal is a good **fertilizer** for Hydrangeas due to its high phosphorus content. Many organic **fertilizer**s for Hydrangeas contain bone meal. As long as you don’t add way too much bone meal to your Hydrangeas, you should get good results. Bone meal takes up to four months to break down completely, so it does not have to be added often to be effective. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hydrangeas can benefit from **fertilizer** if your soil is low in nutrients or if you have the proper sunlight and water but still don’t see much new growth. Begin fertilizing in early spring. Which **fertilizer** to use and how often to apply depending on your gardening style and your climate. Start off using small amounts of **fertilizer** because too much can harm your shrubs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many **fertilizer**s meant for feeding **hydrangeas** contain chemicals. Still, a few of them have natural ingredients. Both boost the health of the plant and encourage blooms that are exceptionally huge and beautiful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may also see **fertilizer** spikes for sale in stores or online. Fertilizer spikes are similar to slow-release granular **fertilizer** except that you insert the entire spike into the ground near your Hydrangeas rather than applying it to the top of the soil. Although it may seem tempting as an easy method to apply **fertilizer** without having to measure, it should be avoided for outdoor Hydrangeas precisely because you have less control over how much **fertilizer** you are applying. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choose a **fertilizer** with a balanced NPK ratio or one with higher levels of Phosphorus (the middle number in the NPK ratio). Start by adding about half of the recommended amount when fertilizing or diluting your mixture to half strength. You can always add more later if you need it, but most Hydrangeas don’t require large amounts of **fertilizer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, take into account the quality of the soil surrounding your Hydrangeas. If you regularly amend the soil each year with compost or other organic matter, then you are already supplying your Hydrangeas with many of the nutrients that they need. You may not need to add chemical **fertilizer** at all, or at the least, you may not need to add as much. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Plant smooth **hydrangeas** in full sun if the soil stays moist. (Partial shade is better in spots that dry out from time to time.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hydrangea shrubs blooming on old wood have flower buds that form shortly after blooms fade in the summer. So the buds and the stems of the plants have to survive the winter to get blooms for the following spring or summer season. Hydrangeas such as the Bigleaf, Oakleaf, and Climbing **hydrangeas** variety, should be pruned once the flowers have died. The pruning must be done before the new buds form. Otherwise, it will be too late because of the risk of pruning off next year’s flowers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   They are known for their cone-shaped flower heads. They generally have white-colored blooms but turn pinkish as they age. Popular varieties include Limelight, Bobo, and Phantom **hydrangeas**. Blooms start appearing in July and last until the fall. Panicle **hydrangeas** require two **fertilizer** applications in April and June right before they bloom in July. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Prevent these diseases from harming your Annabelles by planting them in areas where air freely circulates. Watering plants via drip irrigation works better to keep plants disease-free than using overhead sprinklers. Fungicides are available to treat **hydrangeas** suffering plant diseases such as mildew and leaf spot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The other option, and the one I prefer, is liquid **fertilizer**. Liquid **fertilizer** is easier to control and can be diluted easily before application. It is fast-acting (there’s no option for slow-release liquid **fertilizer**), so it reaches the roots faster and is absorbed more quickly than granular **fertilizer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also known as French Hydrangeas, they are the most common type of **hydrangeas** found in the United States. Endless Summer **hydrangeas** are a popular variety of Bigleaf (PDF). They generally bloom from late spring to midsummer. The second **fertilizer** treatment should be just before they begin to flower. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The leaves are shaped like those of a red oak tree, hence the name. These are the only types of **hydrangeas** that naturally change color in the fall. The Oakleaf variety blooms from early summer in southern regions and midsummer to early fall in the Midwest and northern states. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How to fertilize **hydrangeas** is just as important as what you’re fertilizing **hydrangeas** with. Fertilizer burn can occur when too much is applied. Scorched looking leaves are the first sign of too much fertilizing. Hydrangeas should be lightly dressed with fast-release **fertilizer** in March, May, and July. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In March, May, and July, lightly apply a fast-release **fertilizer**, spreading it around the drip line of the branches—not the base. Water well. When using a slow-release **fertilizer**, lightly cover it with soil to activate it. Sometimes **fertilizer** might not be necessary in the summer, since most **hydrangeas** bloom better when they are a little hungry for nutrients. If leaves begin to yellow and appear unhealthy, add a light dose of liquid iron twice a year or another fast-acting **fertilizer** to remedy the issue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A perennial favorite in the landscape, hydrangea is hardy in a wide range of growing zones and is a relatively easy keeper. While **hydrangeas** vary in form, color, and bloom time, they are known for the large flower heads that cover the plants—so large, in fact, the blooms often weigh down the stems. Once established, the hydrangea is one of the summer season’s most impressive shrubs, but it needs **fertilizer** to reach its full potential. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **fertilizer**s designed for feeding **hydrangeas** contain chemicals, but a few feature natural ingredients. Both are suitable for boosting the plant’s health and producing large, beautiful blooms. The choice of one type over the other is a matter of personal preference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bigleaf **hydrangeas** can be especially touchy when grown in Northern states. Although some varieties are hardy in Zones 4 or 5, many are only reliable in Zones 6-9. In cold regions, flowering can be affected by early-fall frost, late-spring frost, or super-cold winter temperatures. If you wish, you can cover bigleaf **hydrangeas** with 12-18 inches of mulch after the first frost, removing the mulch as soon as the threat of frost passes in spring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not sure if your soil needs **fertilizer**? Do an NPK soil analysis. Some areas have a significantly low amount of certain macronutrients, and if your soil differs greatly from the norm, advice that works for most gardeners won’t help you care for your Hydrangeas. Take a sample of your soil to your local extension office, and they will be able to either test it for you or tell you where to go for a soil analysis. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can choose to use a general all-purpose **fertilizer** or pick a **fertilizer** explicitly designed for Roses, Hydrangeas, and other woody shrubs. If you’d rather go organic than use a chemical **fertilizer**, then there are options as well. Keep reading as we’ll discuss organic options later. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before fertilizing, it is helpful to know the type of hydrangea you're growing. The three most popular varieties are panicle, smooth, and bigleaf. This guide will stay rather general and offer a section on changing the flower color of bigleaf varieties at the end. Follow this advice to learn which **fertilizer**s are best for **hydrangeas**, and when and how to fertilize these plants to ensure that they grow to their fullest potential. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Be sure to spread it around the drip line of the branches and not the base. Water well. If the **fertilizer** you choose is a slow-release type, remember to lightly cover it with soil to activate the **fertilizer**. Include a light bi-annual dose of liquid iron to keep the leaves a healthy green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Commercial **fertilizer**s are labeled by the amounts of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) they contain by weight, which appears on the package as the N-P-K ratio. Hydrangeas will benefit from an all-purpose, balanced **fertilizer**, such as a 10-10-10 N-P-K, that contains equal amounts of each nutrient. A balanced **fertilizer** will encourage healthy foliage as well as bountiful blooms. For gardeners explicitly seeking to increase the blooms’ quantity and size, a **fertilizer** with a higher concentration of phosphorus (the middle number), such as a 10-20-10 N-P-K, may be beneficial. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Liquid: Quickly absorbed by the plant's roots and leaves, liquid **fertilizer**s are good for a quick boost of nutrients. They come either as a concentrate that can be diluted with water or ready-to-use. Follow the directions on the container, which will likely either direct the user to spray it on the plant's foliage or pour it around the base of the plant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hydrangeas benefit from applying **fertilizer** in mid-to-late spring and additional intervals recommended by the manufacturer of the **fertilizer** you choose to use. While the first set of flowers start to fade, apply the same slow-release bloom-boosting **fertilizer** used in spring. Time-release **fertilizer**s usually need to be reapplied every three months. Other types typically need to be applied every one or two weeks. Then, in late winter, just before **hydrangeas** come back from dormancy, feed them another dose of an all-purpose **fertilizer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A discussion of how to fertilize **hydrangeas** wouldn’t be complete without mentioning the addition of small amounts of sulfur or lime when fertilizing to change hydrangea color. Hydrangeas treated with sulfur will remain or turn blue. Lime results in pink and a change to either color takes time. Please note: white **hydrangeas** will not change color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Understanding how to fertilize **hydrangeas** also requires knowing what variety of hydrangea it is. Each type of hydrangea may have different needs when it comes to fertilization. Improperly fertilizing **hydrangeas** can affect the health of the bloom and the number of blooms that cover the plant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Miracle-Gro has some good formulas for Hydrangeas. Select an all-purpose formula with a balanced NPK ratio or one that has a higher concentration of Phosphorus. Also, be sure to follow the directions on the package. Misapplying any brand of **fertilizer** can damage Hydrangeas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Climbing **hydrangeas** grow like vines as they tend to grow upward around structures. They also have large blooms. These **hydrangeas** bloom from late spring until midsummer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When shopping for hydrangea **fertilizer**s, you may notice that a good number of them are called acidic **fertilizer**s. In addition to the product’s N-P-K nutrients, acidic **fertilizer**s contain pH-changing additives, such as sulfur or aluminum sulfate. For those who strive for blue flower heads, it’s worthwhile to purchase a pH soil tester to monitor the soil’s pH level. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Applying a once a year slow-release chemical formulated for shrubs and trees is the simplest solution to hydrangea care and feeding. A less expensive fast-release compound will work as well. As for what to use to naturally fertilize **hydrangeas**, a combination of sulfur, compost, and peat moss has proved to be a successful hydrangea **fertilizer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Inorganic: Containing chemical and synthetic nutrients, inorganic **fertilizer** is made in a lab with the intention of producing specific growing results. These specifications include larger blooms or an increase in their number, or an increased acidity level, which **hydrangeas** are fond of. Inorganic **fertilizer**s might also have time-released ingredients, which dissolve slowly, and depending on the brand, feed the hydrangea plant over a period of weeks or months. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Liquid **fertilizer** is less risky than granular. Because you mix the formula yourself, there is less chance of over fertilizing and burning plant roots. For these reasons, I use liquid **fertilizer** with all of my outdoor plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To keep **hydrangeas** growing and blooming bountifully, you need a **fertilizer** or soil amender that’s made specifically for these acid-loving plants. Our recommendations include a variety of options to help improve the health and beauty of these plants. We’ve selected traditional water- soluble **fertilizer**s that help stimulate root growth, granular **fertilizer**s with microbes and fish meal, and soil amenders that help increase the soil’s acidity to achieve blue flowers. As a bonus, we also included an all-in-one product that is an effective pesticide and **fertilizer** that also helps plants resist common diseases. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hydrangea care and feeding are fairly simple once you learn some basic rules. Specially formulated hydrangea **fertilizer** is available but isn’t really necessary. A good all purpose 12-4-8 or 10-10-10 composition will provide all the fertilizing **hydrangeas** need. Either a chemical source or organic matter can be used successfully. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For the second treatment, before the **hydrangeas** bloom, apply a **fertilizer** with a higher phosphorus level in the ratio. Phosphorus helps with plant growth and bigger blooms. A **fertilizer** mix of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium and a ratio of 10-30-20 will help grow big blooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Inorganic: This type of **fertilizer** contains chemical and synthetic nutrients. It has been formulated in a laboratory to produce specific growing results, such as larger or more abundant blooms or an increased acidity level, which is desirable when growing **hydrangeas**. Inorganic **fertilizer**s may also include time-released ingredients that dissolve slowly and feed the plant over a period of weeks or months. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Certain types of Hydrangeas (Bigleaf varieties) will change the color of their blooms from blue to pink depending on the acidity level in the soil. If you want to affect the color of your flowers with **fertilizer**, there are different options for each color. To make your Bigleaf Hydrangea blue, read this article. If pink is your preference, click here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hydrangeas are beloved for their large flower heads and attractive colors. Welcome them to your garden as a glorious focal point or for showy cut flowers. They are easy to love and grow across most of the United States, but need a little extra care in the realm of fertilizing. Be sure to follow these guidelines for how to fertilize **hydrangeas** a few times a year. Use these tips to welcome even more lush blooms throughout summer and fall and keep foliage healthy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The climate affects the timing of when **hydrangeas** bloom. In different areas of the country, the same type of hydrangea will bloom at different times. Hydrangeas planted in warmer climates will bloom earlier and for longer than **hydrangeas** planted in colder, more northern climates. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is essential to understand where the drip line is of the shrub to know where to place the **fertilizer**. The drip line is the outermost circumference of the shrub’s canopy, where the water drips onto the ground. A light **fertilizer** coating should be spread around the drip line and never placed at the trunk or next to the stems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Scale, aphids and mites feed on **hydrangeas** by piercing the plants' leaves and stems and sucking out the juices. This action causes the entire plant to wilt and flowers fail to bloom. You may also notice a sticky substance, known as honeydew, on the leaves and ground. Spray the plants with a steady stream of water every other day to dislodge these pests, or treat with an insecticidal soap or horticultural oil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The flowering season or time of the first bloom can be affected by pruning or lack of pruning. Pruning some **hydrangeas** in the spring can delay their blooms. The delay in the flowering would also delay the time to fertilize the shrubs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When **hydrangeas** bloom will depend on the type of **hydrangeas** planted. Each type of hydrangea has a different bloom time. There are five varieties of **hydrangeas** generally found in North America. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Well-drained soil that’s high in organic matter is optimal for growing **hydrangeas**. Heavy, clay-type soil and sandy soil will benefit from additional organic matter, such as compost or dried leaves.
