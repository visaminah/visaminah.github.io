## 2 Things You Should Know About Best Spray Primer For Miniatures Reddit | Best Primer For Miniatures Reddit
-   Hi guys, recently ordered the clone wars starter box and started yesterday painting the clone troopers. I'm not really experienced, I think I painted like 40 3d printed **miniatures**. I basically applied paint at the details and did a wash after everytime, looked mostly good enough. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sorry if this is a pleb question. I’ve used **spray** primer for minis before and have had decent results, but occasionally I find it a bit difficult to get an even **spray** or I’ve had a primer be bad and completely ruin a mini. Does anyone prefer hand priming minis before painting even though it takes more time and effort? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
