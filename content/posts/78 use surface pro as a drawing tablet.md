## 78 Things About Use Surface Pro As A Drawing Tablet | Best Microsoft Surface 2022: Find out which is the right Surface 2-in-1, laptop or all-in-one for you
-   You also need to consider the pressure sensitivity and tilt recognition. The pressure sensitivity is measured in levels, with 8,192 being the highest level. The higher the level, the more sensitive the **tablet** will be to your brush strokes. Tilt recognition is also an important feature for digital artists. This feature allows the **tablet** to recognise the angle at which you’re holding the pen, so you can vary the brush strokes of the stylus. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That said, Microsoft are not traditionally known for making drawing **tablet**s. They have only been in the game for a few years, and so they are the underdog in this match-up. That said, they have made quite a number of serious devices, and they are a force to reckon with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **tablet** also comes with a detachable keyboard, so you can use it as a laptop when you need to. Plus, the kickstand means that you can use it as a drawing **tablet** when you want to. The Surface Pen is included, so you can start drawing right away. If you’re interested in reading a review of the best laptops for artists, check out our guide. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The iPad Air is a great option for artists who are looking for a light and portable **tablet**. It features a large 10.9-inch display, making it perfect for drawing and painting. Plus, the inclusion of Apple Pencil support means that you’ll be able to get the most out of your creative apps. It’s cheaper than the iPad Pro, so you have have the functionality and experience of the iPad at around half the price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s hard to argue with the seamless overall quality that comes with an Apple iPad Pro. I own a 2020 version of the iPad Air, and I still think that my iPad running Procreate is the single best experience I’ve had with a digital drawing **tablet**. The iPad Pro with the wirelessly charging Apple Pencil 2 only expands on the Air. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Balanced touch response is big. I like a **tablet** that tracks your touch controls without accidental, jarring touch commands firing off as you go. Alternatively, programmable buttons on the side or rear can add a lot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Surface Pro 4 itself weighs 1.7 pounds, can accommodate up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, and has the thinnest glass — 0.4mm — of any **tablet** on the market today. Its 267-ppi 12.3″ screen is packed with over 5 million pixels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Wacom Pro Pen 2 is a passive stylus, which means it does not have a battery inside and does not need to be charged. It wirelessly takes its power from the **tablet** with the help of EMR. Click here to read more about EMR and how Wacom Pens Work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Surface is an excellent little **tablet**-laptop to sling into a backpack and take to the coffee shop. Running Windows like a PC, the Microsoft Surface Pro 8 is a hybrid laptop, rather than an iPad clone, and you feel this quality. I find file storage to be far more intuitive on my Surface than I do on my iPad, and because of this it’s the natural choice for me when I want to take a **tablet** with me to the coffee shop to do some writing or to work in InDesign. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And with that we come to the end of our comparison between Wacom and Microsoft Surface Pro **tablet**s. As you can see, both have a lot going for them. However, Wacom’s MobileStudio Pro seems the better choice, beating the Surface Pro 7 and the Wacom’s own Cintiq 16 in many important features. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   11th-gen processors come with Iris Xe graphics, and it's a match made in heaven. Seriously, these chips are no joke. For a **tablet** like this, I had no issue doing things like photo editing, and while I did get into gaming a bit, I found that the best experience still came from Xbox Cloud Gaming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Wacom MobileStudio Pro comes in two options: 13” and 16”. This gives you the option to decide how large you want your **tablet** to be, depending on your needs. Unfortunately, you don’t get that same level of choice with the Microsoft Surface Pro 7, as it only comes in one size: 12.3”. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While I just shouted out the things it's lacking, another part of me wonders if this could be the perfect **tablet**. Windows 11 is going to get Android app support soon, and combined with the versatility of the Windows ecosystem, it might end up being everything that I want. I can use it like it's a laptop, and then pull off the keyboard and read in the Kindle app. Of course, I'm getting ahead of myself now, as Android app support isn't even available to Insiders yet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Great pen response is the first thing I notice in a drawing **tablet**. I like a **tablet** that tracks my pen with barely any latency when I draw. When I scrub with the pen, shading like you would with the side of a graphite pencil, I like to see the mark following my pen, rather than slowly loading behind me as my hand passes. Other great pen features are programmable buttons on the pen, a flip-around rear eraser, and magnetic response that passes electricity through the screen so that you don’t have to separately charge it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main downside of this **tablet** is that it’s not as widely compatible with software and devices as Apple products. So if you’re invested in the Apple ecosystem, this might not be the best option for you. However, you can achieve a desktop experience by using it with a Samsung keyboard and monitor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're not familiar with the concept, the Surface Studio is an all-in-one desktop system, kind of like an Apple iMac. It's not portable but instead is designed to sit on your desk like a traditional home computer. Unlike the iMac, the Surface Studio can be used as a giant drawing **tablet**, thanks to its clever zero-gravity hinge design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Huion Kamvas Pro 20 is an affordable drawing **tablet** that is perfect for those who want a large screen. It features a 15.6″ display and a resolution of 1920×1080. Plus, the 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity and 60 levels of tilt recognition. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As a digital artist, I own and use three different types of drawing **tablet**s for graphic design, illustration, photo editing, and more. These **tablet**s can be used with lots of different digital art software, from raster graphics editors like Adobe Photoshop, to vector editors like Affinity Designer, or even 3D sculpting tools like Zbrush. To frame my picks for this article, I used my years of experience with digital art, my experience as a tech and hobby reviewer, and I rounded out my personal preferences with a hefty dose of research into some of the alternative **tablet**s out there. Here are the criteria I used to picks the best drawing **tablet**s: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One thing you won't find under the kickstand is microSD expansion. In fact, Microsoft has finally cut back on ports. In the old days when Apple was looking toward the future and adopting Thunderbolt 3 before anyone else, Microsoft was bragging about including USB Type-A on its **tablet**s, and refusing to put any kind of USB Type-C on its Surface devices. Times have changed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Wacom Mobile Studio Pro 16 sits at the very top of the drawing **tablet** price pyramid, but for a very good reason. Purposely targeting serious professionals, this **tablet** is a compact computer designed for creatives who require ultimate portable performance for demanding workloads. Despite the expense of what is really a powerful performing computer, the 4k display lets you view and work with full versions of your favorite applications in vivid and rich colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Graphics **tablet**s and drawing **tablet**s are the same thing. In 1979, Apple became the first company to release a drawing **tablet**, which was titled the Apple Graphics Tablet. Today’s drawing **tablet**s are graphics **tablet**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Surface Pro lineup is Microsoft's most successful line of PCs ever. When the company set out to establish this new category, this is the one that succeeded. It's the one that entered the market at a time when people were deciding between buying a new laptop or an iPad. The **tablet** PC form factor is definitely the most imitated of Microsoft's designs as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Surface Pro 7, on the other hand, has a glossy screen. The pen also has a default soft tip, so you get the distinct feeling of writing on glass when you use this **tablet**. It gives you less control over the pen and takes a while getting used to. Some artists don’t mind this, while others can’t stand it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **tablet** is a powerful device. It has one of Apple’s M1 chips, meaning that it’s capable of running demanding apps and software. With 64GB of storage, 8GB of RAM and a Liquid Retina display, you will be able to run your creative apps smoothly. The Liquid Retina display means that you’ll be able to see the smallest details and subtle colour transitions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The big selling point for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is the price. It’s a more budget-friendly option, for a screen **tablet**, that doesn’t sacrifice quality. It has up to 128GB of storage and 4GB of RAM, so the performance isn’t as good as the Samsung S8, but its advantage it that it costs less and weighs a lot less too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Coming to Mobile Studio Pro, it comes with a battery capacity of 4630mAh which is kind of low for a **tablet** of this size. There are no official numbers as to how long its battery lasts on a single charge. In real-life usage, you can expect it to last around 4+ hours on a full charge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The bezel on this **tablet** is larger when compared to other Microsoft products. That said, it’s still smaller than the one on the Wacom Mobile Studio Pro. It also has an aspect ratio of 3:2 while the MobileStudio Pro has a 16:9 aspect ratio. You can decide which one you like more. We prefer the 16:9 ratio. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're wondering whether or not you should buy the Surface Pro 8, just ask yourself if you want the **tablet** form factor with an attachable keyboard. That's what this comes down to. It's kind of like how with the Surface Book, the product made zero sense unless you knew you were going to use it with the display detached. The Surface Pro 8 costs $1,099, and that doesn't include the extra few hundred dollars you'll be spending on a keyboard and pen. When that bill adds up to over $1,500 with taxes and Microsoft Complete protection, make sure that you're buying this product for a reason. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Surface Book 3 gives the most laptop-like experience of the convertible options, but it comes with a hefty price tag. The Surface Pro and Surface Go options are more of a **tablet**-first approach but can be used as a laptop with the keyboard cover accessory. Remember that with these you'll get fewer options when it comes to screen angle, as they use a kickstand rather than a hinge for the display. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s a lot going for this **tablet**. For starters, it comes with a 10th gen Intel processor. You can also pick between the Core i3, i5, and i7, with plenty of options when it comes to storage and memory capacity (HDD/SSD and RAM, respectively). That said, make sure you pick a combination that’s future proof as the storage and memory are not upgradeable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tablet stands are important as they allow you to place your **tablet** at a more comfortable angle. Surface Pro 7 has a massive advantage in this category. It comes with a high-quality built-in stand which is integrated into the design of the **tablet** itself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The stylus is the Wacom Pro Pen 2, which is one of the best styluses you will find on any **tablet**. It has excellent pressure and tilt sensitivity, as well as next to no lag or parallax. It also has a very comfortable shape for easy ergonomics. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So which one should you buy? Each of these tools has its strengths and flaws, and it’s up to each artist to figure out what works best for their workflow. The bottom line is that digital animators have a growing — and unprecedented — range of options available to them. As long as the **tablet** market remains competitive, the creative community will benefit from more affordable and improved tools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   • The Surface Laptop Studio is Microsoft's 2-in-1 for creatives, offering versatility for those on the go. It can be used in three distinct positions: as a standard laptop, as a thick **tablet** or at a tilted angle offering just the display and trackpad. You'll need the Slim Pen 2 to make the most out of it, and perhaps some extra cash to opt for one of the higher-spec models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The objective truth is that the microsoft **surface** Pro 7 is great for drawing and will suit your needs. Some claim that it can be jittery or lag, but these were for the older models. Since then, the Surface Pro 7 has evolved, especially with the introduction of their battery rechargeable Surface Slim pen, which rivals the Apple Pencil. See more on this here: Apple Pencil 2 vs Surface Pen: Which is Better for Drawing & Note Taking? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Microsoft gained their fame in the computing and operating system worlds. They make excellent computers, laptops, and **tablet**s, and their operating system is the most popular among consumers. In fact, even Wacom products use the Windows operating system. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many drawing **tablet**s that connect to computers don’t include a screen. Usually you can get a powerful drawing **tablet** for hundreds of dollars less if you forgo the screen. However, learning to use a drawing **tablet** connected to a laptop without a screen is a bit like learning to play piano. There is a learning curve to drawing in one place and seeing it happen elsewhere. Drawing **tablet**s with screens solve this problem by doubling the screen of your computer, so that you can draw directly onto the image and watch your marks follow the tip of your pen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Compared to the Surface Pro, which is controversial by many for drawing, the **surface** Pro 7 is the best Surface Pro for drawing as it’s designed with artists and performance in mind. With an intel Core-i5 or higher and a 10.5 hour battery life, the Surface Pro 7 allows for 4096 pressure sensitivity levels when paired with its **surface** pen or **surface** slim pen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Surface Pro 9 offers Thunderbolt 4 and USB 4.0 connectivity, so there's a wealth of amazing accessories to pair it with. One of our favourites is the Surface Pen, which allows you to use the Surface Pro as a drawing **tablet**. Just keep in mind that the pen and keyboard cover aren't included in the base price, you'll need to purchase them as add-ons. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to choosing between Wacom and Huion, it really depends on your needs. If you’re looking for a professional **tablet** with a screen that offers ultra high definition **tablet** with impeccable colour accuracy, the Wacom Cintiq Pro would be the best choice. However, if you’re looking for a more affordable option, then Huion is the way to go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Wacom Cintiq 16 does not come with a pen holder or stand. Instead, it has a fabric loop on the side of the **tablet** to which you can attach the stylus. This puts it at a tie against the Surface Pro 7, since that one lets you magnetically attach the pen to the **tablet** and lacks a pen holder as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fantastical concept art sketches of alien worlds, intuitive photo retouching, manga slides, or Flash tattoo designs: they’re all at your fingertips on a great drawing **tablet**. You might be shopping for a **tablet** to pair with your brand new laptop, or looking for a standalone **tablet** with a state of the art digital pen, you might be an amateur sketching woodpeckers in the park, or a pro illustrating weekly magazine covers — whatever way you work, **tablet**s can open up your drawing practice. For a wonderful professional level **tablet** with a stunning display, check out the Wacom Cintiq Pro 16. If you want something that won’t break the bank yet still gives you the control you need, consider the very moderately priced HUION H610 Pro. The iPad Pro and iPad Air on the other hand takes the cake for the best overall drawing **tablet**, for their incredible seamless drawing control and versatility. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That being said, if you plan to use it in **tablet** mode (without a physical keyboard) it can get tricky, because you don’t have access to your shortcuts. That can be solved either with an extension, or by getting an external keyboard or keypad. I personally use a wireless numpad that I rebind keys to using Autohotkey for my shortcuts. Check this thread, you can even do it with a videogame controller! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To carry this **tablet** around, you will definitely have to purchase a laptop bag or laptop sleeve. We would advise a laptop bag you can actually wear on your back, since hauling around 4.7 lbs. of electronics for long can get pretty tiring! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether these **tablet**s are standalone devices that pair with a digital pen or drawing **tablet**s that plug into your computer and work as a more precise trackpad that’s primed for use with a stylus, drawing **tablet**s offer astonishing control. Some **tablet** platforms are better suited for some needs than others, however. Read on for a walkthrough on the best drawing **tablet**s for your needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Microsoft Surface Pro 7 is a versatile and powerful **tablet** that is perfect for both drawing, gaming and more. It features a 12.3″ display and an Intel Core i7 processor. The processor is fast and efficient, making the **tablet** perfect for demanding tasks. Plus, the 16GB of RAM means that your apps will run smoothly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, it's time to talk about Thunderbolt 4, which has finally made its way into a Surface PC. This is a big deal, and it's something that I always think is cool for a **tablet** like this. It means that you can take this sub-two-pound **tablet** around with you, and then bring it home and turn it into what essentially adds up to a desktop PC. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to design, both **tablet**s are beautiful and have a high-quality, professional look. Nevertheless, the latest Macbook Pro has a slightly more modern design, with tiny bezels around the 12.9″ screen, and it is also slimmer than Surface Pro. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is probably to preserve battery life. A small **tablet** like this just can't house as big of a battery as a bigger laptop like the Surface Laptop Studio can. Obviously, by turning the refresh rate down to 60Hz, that helps. The solution to this would be Dynamic Refresh Rate, a feature that's going to be coming in some future firmware update to the product. This would lower the refresh rate when you're doing things that don't need it, saving battery automatically while still giving you a boost when it's useful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As far as **surface** texture goes, the Wacom MobileStudio Pro comes with etched glass, which gives it a matte texture. It has very minimal reflection, which makes it significantly easier to see images. Moreover, it offers just the right amount of friction to the pen so that drawing on the MobileStudio Pro feels like writing on normal paper. This makes the drawing experience more natural. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My advice would be to try using Aseprite with a normal graphics **tablet** without a screen (a pad **tablet**) first if you have one, to see if you like it, before buying a **tablet** PC (if this is the only reason you’re buying it ofcourse). Even if you don’t have a pad **tablet**, you can easily find a second-hand one by wacom or huion for around 50$ or less, depending on where you live. It’s a useful thing to have anyway. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This one is simple enough, many, but not all, Surface devices can be converted between **tablet** and laptop-style use. If you know that you'll absolutely never use it as a **tablet**, then you'll probably want to go for one of the Surface Laptops. If you like the flexibility of being able to convert the device into a Windows Tablet, then you have a bunch of options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When choosing a drawing **tablet**, there are a few features that you need to consider. Firstly, you need to decide what size **tablet** you need. If you want a large screen for working on complex designs, then you should choose a **tablet** with a screen size of at least 12″. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you need a Windows 11 **tablet** possessing solid build quality and a great display, there aren't a huge amount of options. The Surface Go 3 has a full HD 10.5-inch display with a brightness of over 400 nits; it's built like a tank too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When deciding between the Surface Pro 7 vs the iPad Pro and which is best for Digital Art; it’s important to understand that each device has it’s clear pros and cons. For example, the iPad Pro is great for 2d Art, graphic design, drawing and digital paint. While the Surface Pro is best for those who need a laptop in addition to just a drawing **tablet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, if you have a generous budget, its highly likely that you’ve come across the three current heavyweights of the drawing and computer **tablet** world: the Microsoft Surface Pro, the Wacom MobileStudio and the Wacom Cintiq (links to amazon product pages). Whilst it would be difficult to be disappointed with either one of these, each **tablet** does of course come with its own has its own merits and disadvantages. So how do we start to narrow own our options? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All these **tablet**s are pretty expensive. An entry level Surface Pro costs $1800+, while the 13” MobileStudio Pro costs $1400. The Cintiq costs multiple thousands of dollars. That said, they both offer excellent quality and, depending on what you want to do, will do the job well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main drawback of this product is the price. It’s a significant investment and may not be feasible for all artists. Another drawback is that this **tablet** is heavier than some of the other **tablet**s on this list. It’s not ultra portable, but it’s a great option for studio or office use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It features 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity and tilt recognition. Plus, the battery-free pen means that you can use it for hours without needing to worry about charging it. This **tablet** is designed for artists who want to create professional quality artworks with precision. The pen is almost perfectly responsive and lag-free. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 **tablet** has up to 12GB of RAM, so the processing power is high for a **tablet**. This makes it an excellent choice for running Adobe apps and more. It also has a decent amount of storage, with 256GB built-in and the option to add up to 1TB with a microSD card. It has a 120Hz refresh rate, which makes for a smooth digital drawing experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing the right drawing **tablet** can be a daunting task, but we hope this article has helped you narrow down your choices. Whether you’re looking for a professional **tablet** or an affordable one, we’re sure you’ll find the perfect one for you. If you’re just getting started with digital art, check out our digital art tips! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The top pick for the best drawing **tablet** that also has as screen display to draw onto is the Wacom Cintiq Pro. It offers a ultra high definition display, with accurate colour rendering. Plus, it’s compatible with both Windows and Mac. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   • The Surface Go 3 is a 10.5-inch touchscreen **tablet** that, at first glance, looks like a smaller Surface Pro, but it's a little more portable and has less powerful processors - such as the Intel Core m3 and Pentium. Microsoft is targeting Apple iPad users and Chromebook users with this device, as it's the smallest Surface available and the cheapest. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Matte screen vs Glossy screen One more thing to notice is the Wacom **tablet** comes with an Etched glass, that gives the screen a matte texture. The matte screen minimizes reflections making it easier to see the images in direct light or when sitting opposite to a window. The etched glass also helps with providing friction to the pen making it easier to control the pen on the glass screen. The **surface** Pro 7 comes with a glossy screen. The pen of the Surface Pen comes with a soft pen-tip which makes it comfortable to write on a glass **surface**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **tablet** has some great features, such as 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity and tilt recognition. Use multi touch gestures to pan, zoom and rotate, so that you can use the **tablet** intuitively. It’s compatible with both Mac and PC, and it comes with a 3-in-1 cable that supports HDMI, USB and AC connections. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With up to 512GB of storage and up to 16GB of RAM, the **tablet** performs well with the use of multiple apps. If you want a high performance model, get the **tablet** with the larger display and more RAM. This comes in handy when doing demanding creative tasks and reduces the need for panning around an image to work on it. If you anticipate you will need the iPad to store lots of image files of designs and artworks, a the iPad with 512GB of storage could be suitable. The device is compatible with the Apple Pencil (2nd generation) and the Magic Keyboard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both **tablet**s come with support for multitouch. Basically, that means your display does not only respond to the stylus, but doubles as a touch screen as well. Touch screens can be very helpful to an artist’s workflow, as you can use the screen directly to scroll, rotate your canvas, pan, and zoom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, you need to consider the compatibility and connectivity. The **tablet** should be compatible with your computer and software. Plus, it should have a USB port so that you can easily connect it to your computer. Some drawing **tablet**s, like the iPad Pro, don’t need a computer to work, if they have their own central processing unit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use it to run the Adobe Suite, to edit videos, create animations or wonderful digital art in Photoshop. Anything is possible with the Surface Pro 7. Plus, the **tablet** comes with a pressure sensitive pen, so you can draw and paint to your heart’s content. The only downside is that the pen is not included in the price and needs to be bought separately. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **tablet** is perfect for professional work. To get started with the **tablet**, you will need to sync it to your Mac or PC, then calibrate the pen. The shortcut buttons and pressure sensitivity of the pen is completely customisable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, we all want a drawing **tablet** that’s good for drawing. But few artists stick to just one pursuit. It’s worth considering if you’ll be using your drawing **tablet** for a few different hobbies or skills. If you need a standalone drawing **tablet** that can also double as a mobile laptop for Excel spreadsheets, you might need a different product than someone who’s buying a drawing **tablet** for designing tattoos. If you think you might occasionally want to use your drawing **tablet** to help you sculpt in Blender, you’ll need a **tablet** that can link with a PC, as something like an iPad won’t run the software. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While I think my iPad running Procreate does beat out my Surface running Adobe Fresco for drawing or digital painting, I still think the Surface is very much worth a look. The Surface still presents a beautiful drawing platform, that’s smooth and intuitive. The fact that it can run word processors on Windows, play games at 120 hertz, and even run your digital audio workstation are all bonuses. While the iPad is better for pure drawing, many users that want a solid standalone drawing **tablet** that can double as a laptop will find a great friend in the Microsoft Surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As per official numbers the Surface Pro can run Up to 10.5 hours on a single charge. In real-life usage, you can expect about 7-8 hours of battery backup, which is average for a **tablet** of this size and power. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Screen quality is another important feature in **tablet**s that have them. Traditionally many drawing **tablet**s present a blank face, reminiscent of a pen-controlled touchpad that plugs into your laptop. These drawing **tablet**s without screens are still worth considering for those who are looking for a more budget-minded option. Great digital art has been made on **tablet**s without screens for years. However, where **tablet**s do have screens we noted their quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drawing **tablet**s can last for years. Wacom’s are famous for their longevity. iPads generally last for years. As with anything, some cheaper **tablet**s probably won’t last as long as more premium options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
