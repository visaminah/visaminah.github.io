## 170 Things You Should Know About How To Get Paint Off Of Plastic Table | How to Get Paint Out of Clothes and More
-   This method is effective even though it will take some effort to get the **paint** off. Use a power sander, if you can, to cut down on the amount of time and effort required. If you don’t have it at your disposal, a fine sandpaper and a sanding block will still get the job done. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vegetable oil is one of the recommended ingredients to remove the **paint**, as it is a skin-safe substance. It will help moisten or may loosen the **paint** on the **plastic** and will help to remove splashed **paint** stains on the surface. Place a small amount of oil on the rubbing towel and apply on the affected area, this will allow **paint** to come away. If this method doesn’t work effectively after several attempts, try using another stronger solvent for this. Be persistent while doing the cleaning task and it will reward you at the end of the task. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And if you have already got **paint** sprayed over **plastic**, try to clean it immediately. If you work on it within the first few minutes, you can get rid of them using just water and a cloth. This will keep the **plastic** safe and prevent any form of damages as water is not harmful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Start by scraping off the **paint** from the wood while being as gentle as possible. Next, pour in some olive oil on a cloth or cotton ball and dab it onto the layer of **paint**. Leave the stain to sit for a minimum of one hour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Household items might not possess the strength you need for some of the seriously stubborn **paint** stains. If you want to know how to remove spray **paint** from **plastic**, or maybe even how to remove enamel **paint** from **plastic** you might need some stronger chemicals which you can find in solvents or acetone. As you can imagine, nail polish is acrylic **paint** or enamel lacquer which means they need the strength of acetone to be removed, as all nail artists would confirm. This can be done by applying it straight onto the **paint** in question, or you can dip a cloth in the acetone and rub it over the area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If paper towels do not work well, you will require brushes for the job. These will help you in cleaning more intensively and will let you scrub the surface well while working. You can replace it with a **paint** scraper or a putty knife; they will help you in the same way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My preferred one is the Sunnyside Paint &Varnish Remove, said to work in less than 2 minutes. This chemical is free of methylene chloride. You can also use it to remove **paint** from vertical wood surfaces such as deck railing. If you have thick layers of acrylic **paint** on the wood, this item is perfect for the job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tip: Check your storage shed for those outdoor items you no longer use. Visit a local thrift store for outdated **plastic** items such as wall hanging, frames, and figurines. Turn that trash into treasure with a fresh coat of **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 2: Leave the oil to soften the **paint** for about 15 minutes. If possible, let it sit for a few minutes. Avoid touching the wooden surface while the **paint** bubbles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

This **paint** remover has been found effective as it can neutralize and stabilize acrylic emulsions due to its ability to raise pH levels. This technique works well because most artists prefer working safely indoors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thanks for your tips. I **paint**ed cabinets with acrylic **paint** and didn't realize I had accidentally got some **paint** on the wall, which I am thinking is latex. It's dried for a week.

-   The only way to get rid of that latex **paint** on your varnished wood is by sanding it down. If you don’t have a sander, use an electric hand drill with 400 grit paper attached. Work in circular motions for 30 seconds at a time until all remaining residue has been removed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Read on how to use vinegar as a **paint** remover. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is common to get **paint** somewhere you did not intend to when you are **paint**ing. While some **paint** can be easily washed off, acrylic **paint** is different. It dries fairly quickly, so if you accidentally get it somewhere you don't want it, you should act fast to remove it while it is still wet. It's not impossible to remove when it is dry, but it will be a bit trickier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before removing old **paint**, make sure it contains no lead. Did you hear that it causes irreversible damage to the brain, liver, and kidney?

The solution should contain 20% of **paint** thinner and 80% water, and this has to be tested first. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, follow the instructions written on the back of its pack. After application, you will need a rough cloth to scrub off the **paint**. Repeat the process until you have a clean surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Folkart and Apple acrylic **paint**s for **plastic** from Plaid Enterprises will adhere, but it will take about 24 hours to dry, depending on the humidity. These acrylic **paint**s would be especially nice to use if you are putting shapes or designs on the tablecloth, because if you do not like what you have put on, you can quickly wipe it off and start over before it begins to dry. Plaid offers more than 100 colors of acrylic **paint** to choose from in several different lines. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Soap helps remove any amount of **paint** that is semi-wet and can be scrubbed off. It will also remove any grime or dirt that might have collected over the top. This will make the surface clean and will aid the cleaning process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My friend uses a **plastic** **paint** tray, and doesnt clean the tray between colors very well. So the acrylic dries in layers and was never really cleaned except when she used a knife on it to scrape off the dried **paint**. When she put her tray in the sink i thought id clean it for her and found this page. I am so glad I did! this saved a lot of elbow grease. I won't ever forget about using alchol on the **plastic**e, I'm sure it would work wonders on glass and ceramic **paint** trays as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   @Gabriel- If we are talking about acrylic water based emulsion **paint** then rubbing alcohol should be OK. Do not use Acetone or lacquer thinner though. I am assuming the acetate glass is smooth, you might even get it off with boiling hot water with dish soap since acrylic does not adhere to **plastic** well. BTW, I do a small test with isopropyl (rubbing)alcohol with Q-tip to make sure first that it wont dull or mar the **plastic** before going for it all the way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Latex will become gooey when exposed to certain solvents.* Acetone is the best way to tell if dried **paint** is latex (most nail polish removers have acetone), but rubbing alcohol will also dissolve latex, just more slowly. Video of me doing this test is at the very bottom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another way is to use rubbing alcohol. Dip a cotton ball in the alcohol and rub it over the **paint**. The alcohol will dissolve the **paint**, making it easy to wipe away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes a **paint** scraper can be used to remove the **paint** from **plastic**, but this may not be the condition every time. For this purpose, a **plastic** putty knife or razor blade can be suitable. Make sure not to scratch the surface hard, it will cause the risk of damage to the **plastic**. When removing a thick dried **paint** coat, it is recommendable to use razor blade otherwise avoid it. Remember safety while doing any cleaning method or scrapping process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I was making some titanium white acrylic since I have a pound of 99.5% pure titanium dioxide from my soap making days that I need to get rid of.

-   Once the **paint** is dry, it will not wash off of clothing. If you get any on your clothes, you should try to remove it before it dries.

-   If water is working a little bit then you are in luck. So long as the brown **paint** is not allowed to fully cure, I would try adding a bit of dish soap( few drops) to hot water.

Start with a mix of 80% water and 20% alcohol and work from there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The water that needs to be used has to be warmed up before as warm water is way more effective than when it is at normal temperature.

-   If you want to go the natural way without using any harmful chemicals, olive oil or vegetable oil will work just as fine. You would need a blunt scraping tool such as a **plastic** scraper, **plastic** putty knife, butter knife, or a kitchen knife. Along with this, you would need a fresh cloth to dip in the olive oil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re having trouble removing all of the **paint**, you can also try using a leather cleaner or conditioner.

This will help to break down the **paint** and lift it away from the surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 3: Scrape off the **paint** once you see it form bubbles on the surface. Hold the putty knife in another hand and scrape the **paint** following the direction of the wood grain.

Luckily, you can still clean it off even after it has dried off using several cleaning processes mentioned in this article. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   if its dry then use denatured alcohol or 90%+ isopropyl rubbing alcohol. You could assist the process by softening **paint** stain with near boiling water first before trying solvents.

Good luck! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   I would first test to see if the **paint** on the fence is affected by denatured alcohol. If not, then simply use denatured alcohol to remove.

-   The best way to test whether the acrylic **paint** stain is wet or dry is to touch it and check. If the colors stick to your fingers, it isn’t dry after all. Depending on the stain’s size, a rag, some water, and a mild soapy solution will get the job done. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
