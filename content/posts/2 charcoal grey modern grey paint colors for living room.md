-   Choose Portland Stone or its derivatives for a warm **grey** scheme. These shades are formulated with a complex mix of different pigments, making them ideal when other more strident colours are used in the room. Alternately, for a less warm option, choose Flint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We live in a home that is surrounded by tons of trees, and while I love it for keeping our home and backyard shaded in the summer, it makes it difficult to choose paint **colors**. A warm gray is likely to read totally dark beige in some of the rooms in our home. Likewise, if you have a lot of natural light and youâ€™re searching for a more saturated hue, you might be upset that your paint color looks washed out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
