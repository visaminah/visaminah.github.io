## 94 Things About Navy Blue Gray And White Living Room Ideas | dark blue and white living room ideas
-   'Deep, dark **blue** tones are generally best suited to smaller **room**s that are already starved of natural light’ explains Charlie Crosby, Head of Creative at Farrow & Ball. ‘Instead of fighting the existing gloom with white, you embrace it and make a virtue of its drama in the **room**s you love to relax in.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'Display your minimalist posters in black frames to create contrast with the grey walls. To maintain balance and a cozy vibe, add a grey-scale rug, or pillows in similar shades. A living **room** with a minimalist grey decor makes **room** for unique details and the motifs on the walls.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   20 of 21 Intensely Gray Living Room Walls Laura Moss Create an intimate living **room** or sitting area with a backdrop of steely gray. In this space, the walls and ceiling are the same color, which constructs a continual visual plane. Leaving the ceiling white would have made a jarring break where the saturated gray walls end and the ceiling begins. Light, soft neutrals give the space a comfortable aura, as do richly colored accents, such as the pillows and draperies. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   16 of 21 Cool Gray Tones Brie Williams Stormy **blue**-gray living **room** walls pair with a velvet sofa for a luxurious twist on traditional style. Silver and white accents keep the space light, and beige window treatments soften the look. A sisal rug adds nubby texture and an element of warmth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This living **room** takes advantage of its long and narrow shape to keep itself feeling cozy and intimate. The rich navy **blue** walls and the whites of the built-in shelves, doors, baseboards, and ceiling go extremely well together. The long and low microsuede lounge couch as well as the playful colors of the striped central ottoman are good additions to the level loop floor carpeting and make the place feel personal and comfortable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The dark **blue** used on the accent walls of this cottage living **room** is the perfect partner to the bright white paint used on the wainscot and door and window frames. Along with the glossy white painted wooden coffee table, the white upholstery on the sectional English couch is striking and goes with the theme of the area. Similarly, the throw cushions use block patterns of the same **blue** and white tones. The rich browns of the teak floor boards and the woven floor rug give this living **room** the warmth and coziness much needed in personal living spaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Today's gray living **room** ideas are anything but gloomy. With shades that range from rich charcoal to wispy dove, gray is easy to effectively incorporate into spaces of any style. These gray living **room** ideas demonstrate how to use this contemporary neutral on walls, furniture, and decor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Look for pastel greys with pebble or clay-like tones, and avoid harsher greys such as charcoal and graphite. These darker shades won't contrast well against navy **blue**, and risk creating an overly negative or moody palette. Remember that the bed**room** should feel like a welcoming space where you feel comfortable and relaxed, and a cold colour palette won't help you achieve that feeling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Navy and grey are two versatile colours which can complement each other beautifully, and they're becoming an increasingly popular duo in bed**room** colour schemes. 'We see navy **blue** and grey colour schemes regularly in our community', says Emily Chance from painting and decorating brand Harris Brushes (opens in new tab). 'Both can work brilliantly with most other colours, and combine here to create a cosy aesthetic with a mature, adult edge – perfect for the bed**room**.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although orange and **blue** are contrasting colours, they work incredibly well together to bring a warm and vibrant lift to a **room**. One might consider pairing a navy sofa with a bold, tangerine footstool, or a scattering of orange cushions. However, it’s important to balance orange accents with other shades of **blue**, grey, black and white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pick out lampshades that give off a yellowish glow and always go for warm/soft white bulbs. Pick out different sources of light too. As with any living **room**, you'll want to think about having a few different sources that all do different jobs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We couldn't not have a crisp white right up there as one of the best colors to pair with navy. It's the oldest, most tried combination and we will never tire of it. Classic, clean, and crisp it's a mix that lends itself to any **room** and any style, but it works particularly well in kitchens for a look that's bold and yet timeless. Consider opting for a two-tone look, mixing dark navy cabinets with a true white island. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This modern living **room** design uses its **blue** accent wall to frame the picturesque views of the landscape outside, an effect that could be achieved by using such big glass windows. To contrast the brightness of the walls, it employs dark-stained hardwood floors with gloss that reflects the light coming in from the numerous windows. A white leather Lawson-style sectional sofa with playfully colored green and **blue** throw pillows, minimalist polished stone coffee and side tables, and a light tan shag carpet top off the modern, contemporary look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   04 of 21 Airy Gray Decorating Ideas David A Land Chameleon-like gray tends to adapt to its environment. In this living **room**, shades of cloudy gray appear airy thanks to high ceilings that create a sense of spaciousness and large windows that allow plenty of light into the space. Different intensities of gray on walls, furniture, and window treatments play with bright pops of pink and teal for a colorful yet sophisticated effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The high vaulted ceilings is an eye-catching element of this design; the exposed trusses and ceiling cladding for this gable-roofed space are painted a bright white to contrast the rich navy **blue**s of the walls. The carpet flooring, wainscot, and fireplace are also appropriately colored white. Wide windows of different varieties were used to provide picturesque vistas of the lake and forest in the background. The minimal use of furniture also gives the space sufficient spaciousness and flexibility. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gone are the days when baby **blue** was the only way to go. Opt for smoked **blue** shades to achieve a grown-up look that’s soothing and chilled, but not cold. Balance pale **blue** walls with warm colours like burnt orange, terracotta, vintage peach and pink. Adding texture - velvet and faux fur - alongside vintage colour prints will soften the space even further, making it feel snug. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With a whimsical play on colors this **blue** and yellow themed contemporary living **room** makes a big personality statement. It’s hard not to want to have fun and hangout in such a bright and colorful environment. The large aqua **blue** sectional couch combines with **blue** artwork on the walls mixes well with the yellow accent wall and yellow retro tub chairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The color wheel already tells us this is a combination that's meant to work. Complementary colors sit opposite each other so orange was made to pair with **blue**, the warmth balancing out the cool of the navy. And it doesn't have to be a dramatic high-contrasting scheme (although we do love how tangerines really zing against navy), a deep rusty orange looks beautiful against the moodier tones of a dark **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This gallery features **blue** living **room** ideas from a variety of design styles. In these pictures you’ll find interior designs using the color **blue** in creative ways to create an inviting and attractive living space.

-   Tip: To make the **room** pop, you can also bring in some metallic (e.g., chrome or gold) details in the form of a coffee table or decorative vases. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A glint of warm metal will highlight a rich, navy sofa, especially one with velvet upholstery. Since metals are considered neutral, they can be worked into any colour scheme and are perfect for decorating around a navy **blue** sofa. Gold, brass and copper may also feature in Art Deco side tables, an opulent chandelier, vases and cushions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   This contemporary piece of design is an eclectic example of using **blue** hues to define a space. The glossy saturated **blue** tone on the walls and wainscot keep the **room** feeling fresh and cozy. The dark oak floor boards also add warmth to the space. The centerpiece of the design, the stone and brick covered wood-burning fireplace, give the **room** a nice focal point that keeps the design grounded. Finally, the playful contemporary choices in seating – the geometrically patterned stools as well as the green leather accent chair – give the **room** some personality and life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are an assortment of **blue** living **room** ideas in this colorful **room**. This eclectic piece of design employs a color that has historically gone very well with **blue**: rose pink. The generous use of both hues can be seen all over the living **room** – in the charming camel back sofas and throw pillows, the microsuede club chair and upholstered arm chairs, and the brightly patterned **blue** and pink floor carpets. The arch-top french windows also add to the sophisticated and bright ambiance of the **room**. To top it all off, the intricate floral and leaf patterns on the **blue** wallpaper gives even more life to the space, keeping it stylish but also playful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like with most things in the world, we need balance and equilibrium in our homes too. So if you're going to go for a dark grey living **room** – keep the floors light. Now, if you have wooden floorboards, you can either strip them back to a very light wood or try painting floorboards in a lighter, softer grey. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   11 of 21 Yellow and Gray Living Room Color Scheme Lauren Rubinstein Photography LLC Warm gray and citrus yellow are a fashion-inspired combo that can be an unexpected but fabulous addition to a living **room**. Brighten a cool gray space by bringing in bright yellow accents. Start with a foundation of gray furniture and yellow accessories, then add navy **blue** accents for a dynamic decorating scheme. Limit the amount of sunny yellow you add to keep the scheme fresh and bold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   01 of 21 Monochromatic Gray Living Room James Nathan Schroder Go monochromatic to achieve a sophisticated, layered look. This gray living **room** combines a deep charcoal sofa with pewter window treatments and dove-gray walls. The various shades all work together because they have a similar undertone. Break up the neutral color scheme with creamy off-white and natural wood tones on accent furniture and accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like all dark colors, navy **blue** is the perfect backdrop for making bright bold hues really pop. A sunny mustard yellow stands out so vividly against navy **blue** walls even just a splash of it becomes the focal point in a **room**. It's also a lovely shade for warming up a navy **blue** color scheme as this steely **blue** living **room** demonstrates – the dark walls and cool grey sofa need that accent of something warmer to make this space feel more inviting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   High ceilings in living **room** spaces keep an area feeling fresh and open. The use of a **blue** accent wall on the far end of this **room** as a contrast to the usage of beige and brown on the main walls helps break visual monotony but still maintains the harmony of the design elements in the space. The use of dark wooden floor boards, a subtle flushed wood-burning fireplace, a light mauve microsuede modern couch, and interesting rug patterns gives the space life and personality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue on **blue** might sound bland, but going all over with a single color always has a surprisingly striking effect. Trying pairing navy **blue** furniture, whether that be a sofa or a headboard, with slightly lighter rich **blue** walls for a calming and cocooning look. Add some much-needed warmth with gold accents as can be seen here with the mirror and the lighting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   03 of 21 Barely There Gray Living Room Walls Edmund Barr Choose a barely-there shade of gray for living **room** walls to add dimension while preserving a light, airy look. In this neutral living **room**, a subtle gray wall color picks up the warm tones of the concrete floors. Natural materials, including wood accent furniture and a brown leather ottoman, lend this gray-and-white living **room** an organic feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use soft warm greys and mix them with pastel decorating ideas for a pretty grey living **room**. Prevent it from feeling too sweet and sugary by accenting with darker, moodier shades seen here with black and white cushions and dark wood table. The result is a calm living **room** suitable for the whole family. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A more traditional approach was used for this **blue** living **room** design. It is worth noting the overall effect of using two shades of **blue**s on the walls to really give the **room** some visual variety while still sticking to the thematic use of **blue**. The furniture pieces are simple but striking; hints of mid-century modern design can be seen in the three-seater sofa and white and brown striped accent arm chairs, while the sleek design of the glass and metal coffee table gives the **room** some much-appreciated edginess. The leaf-patterned center rug and the gray ash flooring keeps the space feeling homey and intimate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue is often used to keep a place feeling new and refreshed. In this example, the brick fireplace and teak floor boards, in addition to the wide use of wooden side tables, give a cozy warmth that is also kept refreshing by the painted **blue** walls.The varied design styles of the furnishings and decors keep up that contrast of refreshing contemporary coupled with warm traditional design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   18 of 21 Turquoise and Gray Living Room Anthony Masterson Shades of turquoise and **blue** on furniture, accents, and art take center stage in this neutral space. Light gray walls and a large expanse of windows provide a subtle backdrop. A white area rug further emphasizes the vibrant furniture, and a collection of accent pillows on the mush**room**-tone sectional gives the gray living **room** texture and interest. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Navy walls offer a stylish contrast to any grey furniture, or decor pieces you might want to hang on them. According to decor expert Andrew Martin, 'darker colours such as navy **blue** form a much better background for paintings and artworks than white or other neutral shades.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For personal-use spaces with high ceilings, it is good practice to segment the visual height by adding elements that break the height of the wall; this keeps the place feeling properly proportioned and appropriately intimate. In this example, there are two running sets of windows separated by a band of wall between them, as opposed to having one set of full-length windows. The dark **blue** of the box style ceiling also helps in keeping the ceiling from feeling too high up. The stone tile on the central wall houses the fireplace and main entertainment center. The gray carpet goes well with the modern and eclectic furniture choices seen in the Lawson-style sofa, floral-patterned club lounge chairs, and striped-patterned ottoman. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Repurpose your outdoor seating in an indoor space to get the most out of your purchase. We love this calming grey and white living **room** with shiplap walls and lots of indoor plants. Perfect for an all-year round botanical aesthetic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   06 of 21 Gray Living Room Architecture David A. Land Keep the attention on interesting architectural elements by applying a neutral gray throughout the **room**. Stacked gray stone on the fireplace and a soft gray sofa let the large windows and soaring ceiling star in the space. Patterned throw pillows and contemporary artwork balance the **room**'s use of color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **room**s accent wall, large patterned area rug, furniture pillows and curtains provide plenty of bright **blue** to lighten and energize this contemporary living **room**. The accent wall is the main focal point and is painted in a loch **blue** and surrounded by a stucco color paint. The light color flooring and large open sun-**room** help provide additional light to the space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink and grey where the color power couple for a moment back there, but we are loving this new, more grown up take on it. Mixing a pale, cooler grey with a lovely warm blush pink creates an almost neutral space, especially if paired with white walls and wooden furnishings as seen here. Add in a touch of muted light **blue** to bring out the cooler tones of the grey. Very chic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We all love on-trend colorful sofas but sometimes we want to keep it simple and uncomplicated. That’s where a grey sofa really comes into its own. It suits all styles of living **room**, from country cottage to industrial to contemporary, and anything in between. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both being jewel-like tones, navy **blue** and deep rich purples are a sumptuous combination that would be perfect if you want to create a cozy but sophisticated living **room** or bed**room**. Experiment with a deep aubergine on the walls and combine it with a statement piece of navy **blue** velvet furniture for a pairing that's moody and dramatic but also so elegant and timeless. Add in some golden accents for extra glamour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'Display your black and white posters in a collage, and mix in oak frames to elegantly add wood details to the grey decor. Oak frames paired with other accessories, such as wooden side tables, brown leather pillows, and green plants, make a living **room** more lively while contributing an elegant balance.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A fluffy navy rug would be a warm addition to the **room**, and could be matched with cushions and blankets on the bed. Or, use these elements to bring a pop of colour to contrast with the **blue** and grey, such as a muted yellow or botanical green. Anything that makes the **room** feel more snug will work a charm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tropical themes appreciate the generous use of **blue** in their designs. In this example, the striking use of azure in the bamboo-frame arm chair, the saxony carpet, and the subtle back wall behind the built-in bookshelves serve as a good complement to the overall feel of the space. The white built-in shelving uses the books and knick-knacks it stores as intelligent accent pieces that keep the **room** feeling personalized and interesting. The chaise lounge sofas used go well the distressed wood finish on the coffee table and the aforementioned exotic feel of the bamboo-framed lounge chair. Finally, the wide french windows used do well in giving us a view of the lush greenery found outside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'There are plenty of complementary color options to choose from when it comes to navy. To create a contrast, look at colors such as browns, reds and oranges. Orange sits just next to yellow on the color wheel and works particularly well with navy as the bright tones of the orange make the dark **blue** appear even deeper.' says the designer and head of creative at Swyft (opens in new tab), Kelly Collins. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to add some more grey tones to your living **room**, this is a really easy and effective way to do so. Rather than go all out painting a grey accent wall, instead learn how to paint window frames. See how in this space the two tones of grey help bring out the cooler tones of the **blue** and complements the pale wood of the floors and ceiling also. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'Display black and white photo prints in gold frames, and add pink as an accent in the grey interior. A pink pouffe, pink pillows, or a throw makes the perfect accessory and lends a softer side to your living **room**.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A selection of favorite nautical living **room** decor and interior design ideas.Nautical designer living **room**s to inspire your own nautical living **room** decor.

And while **blue** and white is the most classic and popular nautical decor style, there are some designer interiors that show examples of neutral nautical living **room** designs using pastel **blue** and sandy beige. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Due to its connotations of wealth and luxury – historically it was the most expensive colour to produce - you’ll often see classic **blue** in bold, traditional interior schemes. But, don’t forget that this shade has its origins in nature, so it holds a firm place in boho design. It is the colour of the dark night sky, after all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   13 of 21 Slate Gray Living Room Walls John Merkl These dark slate gray walls are anything but dreary, especially with the help of bright white trim and open shelves. A warm brown rug tops golden wood floors to prevent the small living **room** from feeling cold. Small hints of hot pink add modern color and foster a glam look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you can't decide between a beige **room** or a grey one, it's actually a perfect warm-toned color that combines the two hues. We love how it's been styled in this living **room** with splashes of sage green and pale mustard yellow. So what is the perfect greige shade? Well, we recommend Farrow and Ball (opens in new tab) Stony Ground. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The navy walls and hardwood floors of this living **room** design go exceedingly well with the olive green mid-century modern sofas and floral patterns seen all over the **room** – in the curtains of the french windows, in the throw cushions of the couches, and in the central floor rug used. The red leather tufted ottoman is the center piece of this living **room** design, its bold, rich velvet red contrasting with the greens and **blue**s of the rest of the space. This living **room**, with its selection of design elements and contrast, feels alive and stylish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   14 of 21 Gray Living Room Accents Ryann Ford A dark gray sofa becomes the focal point of this largely white and tan space. Gold accents pick up on the undertones of a pale beige chair, and layered rugs add cozy comfort underfoot. Jewel-tone accents liven up the gray living **room** furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This nautical themed living **room** looks great with its **blue** and white color palette. White wainscoting wraps around the **room** framing the french doors and looks harmonious with the white vaulted ceiling above. Rich hardwood flooring and wood framed furniture are elegant and helps promote the feeling of a coastal ambiance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   10 of 21 Glamorous Gray Living Room Werner Straube Gray-green walls wrap this formal living **room** in an elegant, tranquil mood. Moldings on the fireplace wall are coated in the same color to add subtle dimension without the visual interruption of a contrasting color. Warm gray and beige tones appear on upholstered furniture, window treatments, and an area rug for a serene, tone-on-tone look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   08 of 21 Gray Living Room Upholstery Julie Soefer Photography A large comfortable sofa upholstered in a medium-gray fabric anchors a mostly white living **room**. Here, the couch's gray tones are echoed in the stone fireplace surround and a small side table, while a nubby brown rug and green pillows round out the nature-inspired color palette. This neutral works well with all colors and wood tones, making it a lovely alternative to beige. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Marianne from Dulux agrees. 'It's especially important to choose 'warm' versions of grey to pair with navy, as combining two 'cool' colours could easily make a **room** feel less cosy than you might have wished.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're looking to design with this well-loved color but feeling a bit overwhelmed by the options, never fear. Navy **blue** is a versatile color that pairs with everything from classic white to deep bordeaux. We've rounded up some of our favorite hues to pair with navy, and some of them definitely aren't what you were expecting. Whether you opt for a traditional pairing or go for something unexpected and bold, navy **blue** comes through again and again. Which is probably why it's earned itself a spot in the pantheon to begin with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lilac and lavender have been gaining quite a bit of traction recently, with trend forecasters predicted it's likely to be the color of the year 2023. It's a very calming hue, that much like pink does need something darker to ground it and give it a less saccharine quality. Hence why it works so well with navy **blue**. It has the same cool undertones but adds a softness to the darker shade and you can find lilac shades that are so subtle, they almost just act like a neutral. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   12 of 21 Decorating with Shades of Gray Kim Cornelison This gray-and-white living **room** marries different shades of gray with varying undertones. The stone around the fireplace features purple undertones, while the light gray walls incorporate warm shades of beige. Gold accents and bright throw pillows warm up a charcoal sofa. A large fiddle-leaf fig plant adds a natural touch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Warm grey hues however will nicely complement navy and create a more comforting atmosphere.

-   'Colour blocking has become the new feature wall over the last couple of years, because it adds interest in a really simple way and all you need is some paint and some masking tape', says Aaron Markwell, Colour Expert at COAT (opens in new tab).

-   This traditional living **room** was tastefully and carefully designed to achieve a classic and sophisticated feel.

The rich dark stain on the oak flooring and the subtle use of solid wood furniture also add to the warmth of the area. Lastly, the use of a glass coffee table and the contemporary glass chandelier further adds style to the **room**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to add a touch of luxury to a grey living **room**, velvet is the way to do it. The obvious choice is to go for a gorgeous grey velvet sofa, that will be the focus of your space. Opt for a deep charcoal – practical and pretty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We actually did had a recent debate over is grey still in style? And the overwhelming majority said yes.

-   Navy **blue** and blush pink are the classic hues to choose for the most sophisticated, grown-up look. The shades just work so well to balance each other out.

-   02 of 21 Gray Living Room Furniture Dana Gallagher Although gray has a distinct presence in living **room** color schemes, it's still considered neutral. Consider applying gray living **room** ideas to big-ticket items, such as furniture and flooring, that aren't as easily or affordably changed. Versatile and timeless, gray works particularly well for investment pieces. In this space, the largest block of color comes from a graphite gray sofa, which is set off by deep **blue** accent chairs and patterned throw pillows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘When bringing navy into the home I suggest mixing it with soft natural shades, such as Farrow & Ball’s Skimming Stone, with its clay-like hue, this is the perfect natural color to make navy pop. With dusty **blue**s set to be big in 2022, bring in on-trend touches of pale **blue** to harmonize the **room**, creating a serene and tranquil living space where navy stands proud.’ explains interior designer Juliette Thomas (opens in new tab). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   07 of 21 Natural Palettes with Gray Anthony Masterson Use nature as inspiration when working with grays.
