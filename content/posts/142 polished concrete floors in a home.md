-   The cost of a poured floor is highly dependent on the work involved and the size of the room, so it is usually calculated on a case-by-case basis.

Existing **floors** have usually had a high level of wear on them and so at least a medium grind will be needed to clean things up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are a fan of the minimalist movement, you have probably already thought of getting **concrete** flooring. Concrete is durable, very easy to maintain and can give an elegant contemporary appearance to any space. Concrete in its plain form has been used for many years as a suitable flooring, mostly for basements, garages, and utility spaces. However, as it is offered today, polished **concrete** flooring is growing in popularity as decorative flooring in Australia. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Polished or honed **concrete** looks great on other surfaces too – create a custom benchtop that matches with your kitchen design scheme.

There are also some drawbacks to using it in certain areas, but many of them are easy to overcome, and in the end, the positives of polished **concrete** flooring far outweigh the negatives. It is important to understand the demands of the environment where the flooring will be located as well as the pros and the cons before making a final flooring decision. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also paint your **concrete** **floors** in addition to sealing them, which costs from $1.50 to $3 per square foot, or around $2 per square foot on average. Keep in mind that paint needs texture in order to stick to **concrete**, and it won’t last if applied to a smooth flooring surface that gets lots of foot traffic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also choose the level of sheen on your polished **concrete** floor. If a super high gloss doesn’t match with the décor, go for a low or mid-sheen.

Below are some rough estimates of what different budgets will accomplish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The other concern raised about polished **concrete** **floors** in particular is that they'll be very slippery. The fact is, polished **concrete** is no more or less slippery than stone or tile, but – it does get very slippery when wet. For that reason, polished **concrete** shouldn't be used in bathrooms, and if it's used as kitchen flooring, then adequate measures to prevent it from getting slippery should be taken (e.g. mop up spills straight away), - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The latest micro **concrete** and micro cement systems are ideal for home installation. This method is usually trowel-applied by hand, so there is minimal upheaval during installation, and no heavy machinery or on-site mixing is required. Applied as a thin coating (2-3mm), these **floors** are cheaper, quick drying and without the weight of real **concrete**. Added ingredients, such as polymers, also make them less brittle. With a polished **concrete** floor, the finish depends on the mineral content, but with a micro **concrete** system, you can choose the exact shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
