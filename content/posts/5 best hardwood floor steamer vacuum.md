## 5 Interesting Facts Best Hardwood Floor Steamer Vacuum | Best Steam Mop For Parquet Flooring
-   To find the best steam mop for your home, consider your budget, the variety of surfaces in your home, and how exactly you plan to use the mop. If you like to give your floor the once-over multiple times a week, a lightweight option is probably best. If some rooms in your house are tiled, others are **hardwood**, and still others are stone, then you need a versatile mop that can adapt. And if you happen to be a bit of a klutz—or you live with one—invest in a cheap mop so you won’t feel bad if it gets knocked around! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re fed up of waiting for 30 minutes for your floor to dry after a bout of **vacuum**ing and mopping, this nifty little hard floor cleaner from Vax might just transform your deep cleaning ritual. The ONEPWR glide does all three things at the same time, saving you time and seriously minimising effort. It’s suitable for all hard flooring including wood floors, laminate, lino, vinyl, stone and tiles, as long as they’re sealed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A variety of specialty solutions made specifically for this **vacuum** and steam mop combo allow you to customize your cleansing. Options like Hard Floor Tough Mess & Odor Eliminator, Area Rug formula, Multi-Surface pet formula, and more give you extra control over your clean-up. Just remember: Any time you add anything to your water, you’re potentially adding irritants, so always read ingredients. For the safest option, stick to plain water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most traditional hard floor cleaners are fairly hefty both in weight and size, making them difficult to store in small spaces. Dyson tackles this problem with the Omni-Glide, a compact, and lightweight hard floor cleaner specifically designed for small apartments. Dyson might be best known for its carpet **vacuum**s but this cordless cleaner, which measures 206 x 91 x 1,077mm (WDH) and weighs just 1.9kg, glides effortlessly around hard floors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The coolest thing about this steam mop for **hardwood** floors is that you can actually use it on your rugs and carpets. It’s got a 21-foot cord, so it’s easy to move around, and an easy-press foot release makes it effortless to switch between the scrub and steam functions. An illuminated dashboard makes for effortless operation in even low-light conditions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
