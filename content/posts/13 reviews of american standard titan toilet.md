## 13 Tips to Reviews Of American Standard Titan Toilet | The Best American Standard Toilets of 2020Reviews & Buying Guides
-   For more than 140 years, American Standard has been involved in the plumbing and fixtures industry. American Standard **toilet**s, with their reliable flushing systems and durable designs, are installed in homes all over the country. These **toilet**s are available in a range of colors, styles, sizes, and shapes, including round and elongated **toilet** bowls, and with a variety of flushing systems as well, American Standard likely has a product to fit your needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Toilets with specialized coatings or flush systems stood out from the average product because these **toilet**s prioritized the health and sanitization of the bathroom. Similarly, American Standard **toilet**s that reduced water usage were included to provide a range of options to suit a variety of lifestyles. Additionally, some **toilet**s made this list of the best American Standard **toilet**s because they stood out from alternative models due to extra features like slow-close **toilet** seats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally, two-piece **toilet**s are considered the easiest to install, even if they may take longer to put together. This is because it’s easier to work with the two separate pieces instead of trying to manage a heavy one-piece model. However, some people prefer one-piece **toilet**s because once it’s in position, they don’t have to worry about attaching a second piece. Which of the two is truly easier really comes down to how you work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Toilets are typically made with a single-flush or a dual-flush system. Single-flush **toilet**s empty the entire water tank with every flush, while a dual-flush system has two flushing options. A dual-flush **toilet** will have two buttons for flushing: the first button releases less water to flush liquids down the **toilet**, while the second button empties the entire tank to flush solid waste. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Toilets may seem like an odd product to have additional features, but if you browse through American Standard **toilet**s reviews or check the product descriptions, you can find a variety of extras. For instance, some American Standard **toilet**s come with an EverClean coating **toilet** glaze that is intended to help keep the **toilet** clean by resisting stains. There is also a variety of classic American Standard **toilet** colors to help you coordinate with the rest of your bathroom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Cadet 3 flushing system increases the siphonic trapway to 2.13 inches and also increases the size of the flush valve to 3 inches to further improve flushing power. However, if your home is prone to clogs, consider investing in an American Standard mainstream **toilet** with a Champion 4 flushing system. This design features a 2.38-inch siphonic trapway and a 4-inch flushing valve for clog-free use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gravity-flow **toilet**s are the most common type of **toilet**s. These models can use up to 5 gallons of water per flush to force the contents of the **toilet** bowl into the drain. New models only use about 1.6 gallons per flush (GPF) in order to help conserve water, though this reduced GPF can result in limited flushing power. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The right height for a **toilet** depends on the user. Shorter individuals may benefit from a 15-inch-tall seat, while a user that is average height would likely prefer a **toilet** with a 17-inch seat. However, taller users typically feel more comfortable with a 19-inch **toilet** seat, so when you are deciding on a model for the home, it’s necessary to take the size of the users into consideration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Installing a **toilet** isn’t overly complex, but it can be an intimidating job if you haven’t worked on plumbing systems before. Before purchasing a new **toilet**, measure the rough-in to determine whether you need a 10-inch, 12-inch, or 14-inch rough-in **toilet**. Double-check the measurement, making sure that you are measuring from the middle of the water outlet pipe to the wall, not the baseboards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Toilets come in a number of different shapes and sizes. Depending on your preference, you can opt for an American Standard **toilet** with a rounded or elongated seat. Elongated **toilet** seats are better for bigger users because they provide more room from the back to the front of the bowl. The width of each type is about the same, with some differences between brands and models, but round **toilet** seats tend to be shorter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are several top **toilet** manufacturers, including Kohler, Toto, and American Standard. Toto is typically seen as the most innovative of the three, while Kohler makes a range of basic, affordable **toilet**s. Quality can differ between brands and even between different models, but on average, American Standard makes the most reliable **toilet**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most American Standard wall-hung **toilet** options are one-piece **toilet**s, so if a wall-hung **toilet** is an attractive addition to your bathroom, then a one-piece **toilet** may be the best choice. These **toilet**s are easier to clean because there are no seams or gaps for dirt and grime to get caught in. However, one-piece **toilet**s do tend to be more difficult to install because the entire unit needs to be maneuvered into position at once. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **toilet**s are made for a 12-inch rough-in, though some homes may have 10-inch or even 14-inch rough-ins. To figure out if your **toilet** is a 10- or 12-inch rough-in, measure from the center of the capped bolts located on the sides of the **toilet** to the wall behind the **toilet**. If you have already removed your old **toilet**, simply use a tape measure to measure the distance from the middle of the pipe in the floor to the wall behind where the **toilet** sat. Keep in mind that you should measure to the wall and not to the baseboard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
