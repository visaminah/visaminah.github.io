-   Never underestimate the power of a fresh coat of paint on your **home**’s exterior to give the entire property a new lease on life. Even paint that hasn’t begun to peel can begin to look dingy or dull over time, so updating the color of your **home** to something a little lighter, brighter, or more contemporary could help enhance its style. Make sure you pair the color of your **home** with its architectural style to get the best results. For example, use a slightly darkened paint color on Victorians, while using a saturated color palette on an Arts and Crafts **home** and a natural color palette on a Tudor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another popular exterior remodeling idea right now involves adding some texture to your **home**’s exterior. That could mean adding a brick or stone veneer skirt or accent wall, or it could mean adding some cedar or cedar-look shingles to a section of your **home**. Modern **home**s can make great use of architectural wall panels, corrugated metal panels, or even stucco to add the texture with a clean and **update**d look at the same time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is important to preserve the elements of a **home** that have value, but it is also important to protect the elements of a **home** that bring **home**owners personal joy. Homeowners should take inventory of the aspects of their older **home** they most appreciate, which might not be features that **home**buyers will be able to identify or care much about on the first pass. As long as these elements aren’t inherently unsafe or remarkably unappealing to other people, **home**owners should strive to retain these features during their renovations. This will help **home**owners maintain the character that first attracted them to the property, even if other elements change drastically. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Make the area leading up to your front door just as welcoming and attractive as the rest of your **home**. Widen the walkway itself, and invest in some new material such as stamped concrete pavers to create a more intricate and detailed path.

Make sure you include some additional lighting in this area, possibly by including lights low to the ground that can unobtrusively light the path without taking away from its style at night. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, that doesn’t mean that **home**owners should be resigned to living in any outdated space they purchase. As long as a property isn’t protected as historic, **home**owners are and should be allowed to make whatever changes they feel necessary to make their **home**s feel comfortable, functional and valuable. But — how can **home**owners balance the drive to make their **home**s look and feel up-to-date with the charm and character that inherently comes from an older property? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   When it comes to remodeling an old house, the stakes are high. Unfortunately, the majority of the **home**owners do not have any experience in undertaking a project of such a size. An architect can help you navigate the issues that crop up at every turn without impacting the result. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While decks and porches will cost you a decent amount of money, you can enhance your **home**'s exterior with some selective landscaping modifications.

-   Make sure your façade can be seen no matter what time of day or night by adding some exterior lighting. Sconces, over the door lights, and accent lights can all help illuminate your exterior, making it visible at night, as well as easier to navigate for guests approaching after dark. If your **home** has large soffits or overhangs beneath your roof, you can also install some discreet lights in this area as well, which can help to define your roofline after dark. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Should you paint the dark woodwork or exposed brick? Can you pull out a dated built-in?

-   To many **home**owners, older properties are just more fun than new construction. While some buyers focus on the flaws of a 50-year-old **home** — the inefficient windows and doors, the outdated appliances and light fixtures, etc. — others revel in the property’s unique quirks, believing them to be beloved relics of the past.

-   Historic **home**s often feature durable, high-quality building materials like cypress, heart pine and oak—natural resources that were much more abundant at the time—and can withstand a lot of wear and tear.

-   Plumbing and electrical system in old houses have standards that are not applicable anymore. Besides, with the passage of years, the systems may not be reliable anymore. Start with the main panel, out-of-date wiring, and electrical fixtures. This not only increases efficiency but also makes the **home** safer for you and your family. The improved efficiency will also increase the resale value of the house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Create a great first impression by renovating your front entry. Do something as simple as painting the front door, or buy a new door if you can afford it. The value of your **home** will dramatically improve, and your new door will invite your guests to come inside and make memories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, perhaps the most critical note for **home**owners hoping to retain the charm and character of their older properties is the importance of matching renovations to the existing style of the **home**. Most everyone has seen additions or renovations that don’t exactly suit their surrounding structure; mismatching styles are jarring to the eye and the atmosphere of a **home**, making it feel like a patchwork of old and new as opposed to a charming historic space. Homeowners should do their best to identify the era and style of their **home** and make design choices that are appropriate for the property and their modern sensibilities. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The kitchen is the heart of the **home** - the room most used and where loved ones come together. Where you can be inspired to cook healthy meals. And where functional design can make a big difference in your quality of day-day life - and the value of your **home**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I purchased two super pretty vases once because they were on sale. When I got them **home**, I really couldn’t find a spot for them but thought, I’ll play around with it when I change out the season. They ended up in the back of a closet for I don’t even know how long. When I pulled them out one day, I thought, these would look really pretty in Amy’s house. And they did! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This might have been the easiest **home** improvement project of them all. It only took an hour, including cleanup. Easy, peasy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   More and more **home**s are available as fixer-uppers in the market currently. Remodeling a property is a huge undertaking that requires a lot of planning and hard work. The challenge is to look past the neglect and dilapidation of the potential of the house. Generally, the buyers are turned off by the interiors and the fixures of an era gone by. However, if you are not afraid of hard work and a fixer-upper, you’ve got a bargain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since most dated **home**s have been built on unusual lots, it is common to find similarly quirky room layouts. You can turn any space into a modern one by embracing the open layout. Note, however, that this may mean you have to break rooms into zones. Open layouts affords better functionality. Adding area rugs and strategically placing furniture can help define the zones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Replication is also an option. “When an old **home** has incredible plaster moldings, it's nice to retain them—but it’s not always worth [the effort] to save them,” says Josh Wiener, the founder of the luxury New York building firm SilverLinings. For a recent client, replacing the moldings allowed him to create a carbon copy of the original look, but hide the modern air conditioning system within the decorative element. Another client went a step further, asking for the new elements to be distressed in order to match the originals. “They had me beat the mahogany woodwork with chains so that it looked like it had been there forever,” he says. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The bathroom is another selling point for potential **home**buyers. Your house guests love to feel like they are at a spa. A modern bathroom will give your guests the peaceful feeling that they crave and will be more calming for you and your family. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many **home**owners wonder: What does a **home** warranty cover? Warranties are a different type of coverage to insurance, which protect different systems around a **home** from lifetime wear and tear. Warranties are essential for **home**s older than 15 years because they help **home**owners manage costs associated with repairing and replacing appliances, electrical and plumbing elements and more. Homeowners who have recently experienced issues with covered systems can seek quick, easy and inexpensive aid through their **home** warranties. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Building a new **home** is always the more expensive option when compared to renovating an old one. However, if it’s a particularly old **home** or a historic building that has seen better days, the cost can be high and through the roof. Still, they are long-lasting value and durable. Above all, an old house has a personality and character that is absent in new constructions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now it’s time to deep dive into the nuances, plaster the walls, and install a new floor. They can bring about a significant impact on how your **home** looks. In the case of flooring, you have your choice between tiles, carpet, and hardwood floors. With these complete, your new house will start taking shape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s easy to fall in love with old houses. They are rich with charm and character. From crown molding and beadboard to hardwood floors and clawfoot tubs, there is something amazing about living in a **home** with such rich history. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Part of creating a **home** that speaks to you is displaying the things that you love and have special meaning. The bowl your grandmother handed down to you or your mother’s jewelry box, even souvenirs from trips you’ve taken may be used in your decor. Think how you will smile every day you walk by it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When buying a **home** to live in (or as an investment), you want to consider a few variables before renovating. It is completely normal to think about all the cosmetic changes you would like to make as soon as you move in, but make sure you are not over-improving the **home**. You want to make sure that if you ever go to sell the **home** that you will get back all of the money you put into the **home** - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For many styles of **home**s, such as ranches, which have small, undefined entry areas, a new trend is to create a larger, more welcoming front door area. This may include building a “tower” such as those seen on Colonial style **home**s, or merely widening the front steps and adding some glass inserts on either side of the door. Calling more attention to this section of your **home**’s façade is a great way to welcome guests and increase curb appeal at the same time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our **home** improvement store has a section where they sell slightly damaged goods at a discount. One day, we found a mirrored medicine cabinet that was oversized enough to cover the hole from the old cabinet. Win! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many **home**s have generic-style shutters that are not only fixed and non-functional, but unattractive as well. This doesn’t have to be the case, however; there are several stylish exterior shutters available today including country and mid-century modern styles that can enhance your **home**’s curb appeal. Look for shutter styles that compliment your **home**’s exterior architecture, and consider a bold color to really make them stand out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paint makes the walls in your **home** look brand new. Painting your walls is easy, affordable and massively valuable. All you need is a few gallons of paint and a handful of rollers, tapes, brushes and drop cloths. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For many, stained glass may seem outdated. However, to the discerning eye, it can be a focal point in your modern **home**. Showcase your stained glass window by painting the walls with a simple white paint to make it an artwork that comes to life when hit by the sunlight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Old **home**s can contain toxins. The paints and the roof especially may contain asbestos and lead. They need a professional touch, and that increases the cost of renovation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Beyond these first steps to modernizing an old **home**, the rest is up to you. We’ve explained why beginning with the exterior might be the right move for you. There are instances, however, when it’s not. Maybe you’re happy with the exterior. Maybe something indoors is taking priority. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
