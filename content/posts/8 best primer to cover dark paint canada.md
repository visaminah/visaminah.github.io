## 8 Facts Best Primer To Cover Dark Paint Canada | 7 Good Reasons to Use Primer Before You Paint
-   YES. Because **paint** absorbs into new drywall and drywall mud/filler, you can get a super blotchy look if you don’t set up a solid, consistent foundation. I don’t get carried away with priming if I have wee small patches, but if they are bigger than a twoonie…oh, this is awkward, I’m Canadian. Okay, so if they are bigger than two inches I would probably slap a bit of primer on. And not the WHOLE wall, just on the patch, feathering out the edges. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you **paint** over oil with latex your **paint** WILL peel off, I pinky-promise. Latex **paint** will not stick to oil **paint**, therefore you need to set up a new foundation for the latex **paint** to stick to. Sanding is NOT enough. Using a 2 in 1 product is not enough (or better cross your fingers it works, because if it doesn’t you are hooped.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   YES! Primary colours are absolutely horrible to **paint** and **paint** over. Why? They have TONS of pigment in them, meaning that they don’t have the little googley-balls that bind together to give **cover**age (super technical, I know). This means that the darker and brighter your colour is, the less ‘hide’ you will get from it – resulting in a somewhat ‘translucent’ look. To get hide (the thing that **cover**s your previous **paint** colour and creates a solid, consistent new colour) you have to do many…many coats of **paint** to build up the surface so that it **cover**s your old finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And you don’t just want to use any old primer, you’ll want to get a quality primer and have it tinted to some version of gray. The lighter your ‘new’ **paint** colour is, the lighter your gray tint can be. The darker and brighter your ‘new’ **paint** colour is, the more shaded, darker your gray should be. Trust me. This will set you up for success so that you don’t have to do a freakin’ bajillion (give or take 6-8) coats of **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And I’m a HUGE sceptic of **paint**s that say they can ‘**paint** and prime’ in one, you know, those **paint**s that apparently have ‘built-in primer‘. Primer is primer, **paint** is **paint**. Are some of these **paint**s higher adhesion and better than ‘regular **paint**s’? Maybe. But for my money, I’m going to bust out the bucks and buy them separately so I don’t have to second guess myself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A good example is Maggie’s room. When we moved in it was a rather bright green. Not bright enough to be day-glo, but bright enough that it would be a small pain to **cover**… - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   YES. Drywall and drywall mud absorb **paint** more than previously **paint**ed surfaces (which often don’t absorb any **paint**). This means that your first coat of **paint** is absorbed INTO the drywall, making it act more like a primer and less like a coat of **paint**. This means that once you do your second coat of **paint**, it will act more like a FIRST coat. And no matter what they say, one coat of **paint** is NEVER cool. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   YES! The higher sheen a surface has, the less it will absorb and the fewer things will stick to it. This means that if you apply new **paint** to a wall that has any sheen (satin/pearl/semi-gloss/high-gloss) the **paint** won’t stick. It will dry and just ‘sit’ on the surface, ready to be peeled off. The same goes if you have grease or greasy fingerprints on your wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
