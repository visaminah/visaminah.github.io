## 198 Things About What Is The Best Cordless String Trimmer | Battery Powered Grass Trimmer
-   This EGO ST1511E Cordless Line Trimmer has market leading 56V Lithium-Ion battery technology and combined with the 2.5Ah battery and the brushles motor, delivered some incredible power as you can see from my video below. I have tested many other **cordless** **trimmer**s, and many of them are simply not up to the job of dealing with anything but the grass edging in your garden that has been missed by your mower. This Line Trimmer from EGO is in a different class and is designed to deal with much tougher conditions, I can honestly say that it didn’t disappoint. At no point did I feel that the line **trimmer** was under-powered or was struggling, even in the most challenging conditions as you can see from my video below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s hard to find a negative about the RYOBI RY40204A and we think it’s the best **cordless** electric weed eater on the market. It’s powerful, without the limitations of being corded, the battery has enough power to keep you trimming for over an hour and it’s quick to recharge too. It’s also quite light, so it’s not going to put extra strain on your back or muscles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The DEWALT 60V MAX* String Trimmer is powerful enough to eat through tough overgrowth and withstand heavy-duty usage every day. Grass and weeds are no match for this bad boy. The high-efficiency brushless motor maximizes runtime and motor life. At 12 pounds, this **trimmer** is solid as a rock. But its ergonomic design maximizes control and minimizes stress on your arms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best Weed Eater Money Can Buy Makita 36V Cordless Weed Eater 15″ Built to last this powerful string **trimmer** offers 80 min battery run-time. Bump feed head, with variable speeds. Check Price - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cost Effective: A great battery-powered weed eater can cost less upfront than gas string **trimmer**s and still provide plenty of power to cut thick grass. Depending on the model, it might come with a 2, 3, 5 or lifetime warranty – so these aren’t disposable battery-operated tools. When you add the savings in fuel and materials, **cordless** string **trimmer**s are a great choice for most yards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’m Jean Levasseur, a former conveyor mechanic, current property manager, and hobbyist woodworker, in addition to being a writing instructor at a local university. I come from a family of tool-users—my grandfather was a carpenter, my father owned an excavation company, and my mother was a mechanic. Between growing up working for my family’s businesses and then moving onto my own projects, I’ve used most tools you’ve heard of and quite a few that you haven’t. I've also got a huge yard filled with plants, grass, weeds, and other tricky growth, which was perfect for testing string **trimmer**s and weed wackers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Buying the right garden tools is all about matching your budget with your needs. If you only have a small lawn to tidy, trim and edge, then there’s no need to spend more than £50 on a lightweight **trimmer**, and no point in using something heavy that will be more work to move around. If you’ve got a larger plot or areas of thick, fast-growing grass in hard-to-mow spots, then it’s really helpful to have a **trimmer** with a bit more welly – or spend the extra on a **cordless** **trimmer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Electric **trimmer**s are still a good investment. They’re often cheap and easy to handle, and usually more powerful than all but the biggest **cordless** models. The only problem is the cord, which makes a lengthy extension cable a must-have in medium-sized and larger gardens, and adds the risk that you might accidentally cut the cord. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The battery takes just under an hour to charge and lasts for 30 to 40 minutes. It switches between trimming and edging modes when you push a catch and twist the shaft, while a pull-out guard protects tender stems and tree trunks from unintentional attack. You’ll have to reload the spool with cable yourself and Screwfix doesn’t sell a spare spool if you break your first one, but that’s no disaster if you’re not too heavy handed. If you’re looking for a cheap **trimmer** to manage a small garden, look no further. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While slightly more expensive than other 18V **cordless** grass **trimmer**s, the Makita DUR181Z 18V **cordless** **trimmer** has a few unique features that make it a good investment. It allows for a wide range of batteries that will give you multiple run time options. They are interchangeable with other compatible Makita power, home and garden tools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, you’ll have to extend your patience with charging – like really. If our best **trimmer** choice will only take 45 minutes to charge, this DeWALT **trimmer** can take 240 minutes or 4 hours. Yes, that long. So, in case your weed situation is minimal or you prefer something lightweight, this DeWalt model is the right **trimmer** for you. Check Price on Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The DUR1818 is heavier than some **trimmer**s, and has a more modest 26cm cutting width than the Worx WG184E or the Bosch AdvancedGrassCut 36. Yet the design does a good job of reducing the workload on your shoulders, and Makita includes a strap for additional support. The shaft adjusts to give you a range of cutting heights and angles, and the only minor niggle is that the bump to activate the line feed can be tricky to activate; we’d really like it to work first time, every time. Still, if you’ve got a lot of grass to keep tidy, this versatile **trimmer** will comfortably do the job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **trimmer** uses a nylon blade so there is no string. The blade is super-easy to change and they click on and off in seconds. The blade works well but some have questioned their durability. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The plastic shaft protector is another practical feature. It guards the string to prevent debris from hitting you as you work. It also keeps the line at a decent length and gives the **trimmer** a good balance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing the Best Replacement Trimmer Line Improve your **trimmer**'s cutting performance with an advanced design replacement line. If you want to strim thick tough material like weeds then buy a star shaped or twisted line. If you just trim the grass at the edges of your lawn and want a nice finish then get the thinnest, normal round profile line as this will cut cleaner and neater. Oregon Nylium Starline Trimmer Line for Over Grown Grass and Weeds with Five Cutting Edges Oregon Red Line Round Trimmer Line for Low Grass and Edges If you found this page useful and decide to buy this grass **trimmer** at a later date please come back and use my links as this helps keep my site going, thanks, Fred Return to top of page Return to Homepage - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **cordless** s**trimmer**s use an 18V-20V battery with a 2Ah to 2.5Ah capacity, which will generally last for around 20 to 30 minutes of use. However, some will also work with other batteries in the same battery ecosystem, giving you the option of a 4Ah or 5Ah battery and a longer running time, albeit with a bit more weight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The weight of the Gtech GT3.0 is a mere 1.85 kg making it light and easy to move. This will reduce fatigue and make the job easier to do. It is ideal for those not quite up to lugging a large heavy **trimmer** around. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s no coincidence that the more powerful the **trimmer**, the wider the cutting width or swathe tends to be. The bigger the figure, the more grass you trim away with each sweeping move and – theoretically – the less time you’ll spend on the job. Trimmers generally go from 20cm up to 35cm, although the professional petrol models used by landscape gardeners can go up to 42cm and beyond. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Designed to take a 0.095 **trimmer** line, this tool feels and performs at the top end of the competition. Built to be water-resistant and carrying a 5-year domestic use warranty (3-year professional use). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the other key features: Not just a **trimmer**, this multipurpose garden tool can also serve as an edger. It takes under 30 seconds to transform your string **trimmer** into an edger – it’s not a wheeled edger but still can get the job done in a pinch. You now can edge along your patio or walkway. I don’t use this feature that much, but it is handy to have for those times I need it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As stated earlier, this **cordless** electric weed eater can also be used as an edger. The string **trimmer** head rotates 90 degrees which allow you to use it to edge your lawn and garden. I personally would rather get the best edger for the job rather than use this feature, but in a pinch, it will work fine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The battery takes a couple of hours to charge, and we only had around 25 minutes of use from it, although you could stretch that out further by avoiding Turbo mode. However, indicators on the membrane button control panel give you some idea when you’re running low. It’s a little heavier and harder on the shoulders than some models, but it’s also more solidly built than most **trimmer**s at this price. All in all, it’s a good choice for mid-sized gardens and, with the battery and charger included, excellent value. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’ve found that I can get around 50 mins of usage on average from my **cordless** string **trimmer** on one charge of the lithium-ion batteries. It depends on what setting I have my variable speed trigger at, but I usually keep it at a three out of five. That run time compares to 15- 20 mins of mower time when I used the **cordless** lawn mower. If I didn’t have two batteries already, I’d probably order another one when I bought the **trimmer** just for convenience’s sake. It’s nice to have an additional battery charging while one is being used in your **cordless** weed wacker. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Can A Cordless Trimmer Cut Long Grass? Where your lawn mower may struggle with very long grass, a **cordless** grass **trimmer** will make light work of the job. These tools are much more adept at working with longer grass; many people use them around the edges of the lawn or in hard to reach spots. You can also use them to trim longer areas before using your mower to finish off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cordless s**trimmer**s have rapidly evolved and improved since I first wrote this review in the UK. After testing the Ryobi, Makita, Bosch and the Terratek. I have to say I am a keen advocate of the Makita. It performed superbly on thistle, nettles, good old grass trimming, and I even gave it a whack on bramble – though that was pushing it a bit, simply because you need a s**trimmer** with a blade for that, better known as a **cordless** brush cutter – or a professional petrol s**trimmer** with blade attachment for any volume of heavy duty work. Here’s a little look at us testing the Makita **cordless** s**trimmer** on some pretty thick nettles: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At a mere 1.7 Kg, this is one of the lighter grass **trimmer**s. This makes the Bosch EasyGrassCut 18 **cordless** **trimmer** easy to manoeuvre and effective for quick and precise edging. It is light enough for most elderly or younger users. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Craftsman has been known to make quality power tools for many years and the V60 string **trimmer** is no exception to that rule. The **trimmer** has a powerful brushless motor , variable speed control, and an ergonomic handle for easier control. This **trimmer** is also light weight helping you get through those longer trimming sessions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So, could a corded electric s**trimmer** be an option then? But what about trying to find a power socket down the far end of a large garden? Even if it is possible, it’s not ideal to have the window open with the wire hanging out when making all that noise. Corded s**trimmer**s are also not the most ideal tool when working on large areas. Being governed by the length of the wire and being tangled up by connecting extension cords, can simply be avoided by taking advantage of **cordless** rechargeable s**trimmer**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After great success with the ST20, Gtech has recently updated this popular grass **trimmer**. The Gtech GT3.0 **cordless** grass **trimmer** is the result. Building on the original success, they have made a few improvements to make it even more effective and versatile. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you go for the DUR181Z **trimmer** or the DUR181RT kit with battery and charger, you’re getting a solidly-built **trimmer** that’s built to trim a massive lawn. In fact, go with the kit with the 5A battery and you’ll run out of puff before the tool does. Our review sample kept going for nearly fifty minutes before the battery lost its charge, and that was with extensive patches of long, thick grass and some fairly chunky weeds to get through. What’s more, you don’t face a long wait while it recharges; Makita’s fan-assisted fast charger can do it in just 45 minutes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a lot of reasons why you’d choose a **cordless** battery-powered weed eater. It’s why so many people are shopping for the best battery-powered weedeater. Here are the main benefits of the class: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So now you have the **trimmer** started, but it sounds like a go cart running at top speed. No trimming for you early in the morning when the temps are nice an cool. The neighbors won’t like that. Also, don’t forget about that exhaust smell. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The head power unit is powered by a 5.0 Ah Arc 56V Lithium battery which is charged in just under 50 minutes, This drives a 15” string **trimmer** head, featuring Rapid Reload to make reloading the nylon line quick and easy. Simply press the reload button on the handle and it pushes out a new length of **trimmer** line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hyundai is a reputable company and this is a well-made **trimmer** with good power. It has a generous cutting width and is a quality option for small to medium lawns. The Hyundai HYTR60LI **cordless** **trimmer** has 60V of power, is low maintenance and has a highly effective brushless motor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Versatility and convenience are the leading features of this Ryobi OLT1832 ONE+ **cordless** **trimmer**. The adjustable cutting width will allow you to cut 25 to 30cm for greater accuracy or more speed according to your needs. The EasyEdge technology makes edging fast, efficient and accurate for neat and well-maintained edges. The telescopic shaft and adjustable handles combined make it comfortable to use even for extended periods. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What’s more, Bosch has designed this **trimmer** to be incredibly user friendly and the ergonomic design means that there won’t be any pressure or strain on your back. The handle can be adjusted between 120cm and 140cm allowing you to stand upright when working. What’s more, the v-shaped handle allows for a more natural position when cutting so you won’t feel sore or achy when the job is done. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A good-looking lawn is a national obsession, but it takes more than a mower to do the job right. The best grass **trimmer**s are an essential backup tool, giving you a way of hacking away at long grass to get the lawn in shape for mowing and trimming those awkward areas around garden furniture, decking, raised beds and walls. Most can also be used for edging around the borders, while more heavy-duty models can be conscripted for weed-whacking duties on overgrown plots. In other words, a good grass **trimmer** is one of the most versatile garden tools around. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The two things to look out for here are the cutting width and the battery power. Most **cordless** s**trimmer**s use a single 18V or 20V battery, but some of the larger, heavy-duty options double up to use two 18V or 20V cells for 36V or 40V in total, or use a specific higher-voltage battery. Similarly, some of the cheaper models have a 21cm to 25cm cutting width, while the bigger models take that up to 30 to 38cm. That makes a huge difference when you have large areas of tough grass in need of trimming down to size, though the drawback will be a heavier **trimmer** that’s going to put your arms, back and shoulders under more strain. If you’re buying one of these beauties, good ergonomics can make all the difference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   They do, however, have their benefits, such as a constant flow of power, they don’t run out of juice. Once you are set up and ready to go, you won’t be interrupted. They also tend to be much lighter and cheaper than **cordless** s**trimmer**s, so if good value and a lightweight tool are high on your list of priorities then consider a corded model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s the perfect fit for your home if you don’t encounter weeds thicker than 3/4″ wide. If you have weeds that big – the **trimmer** line diameter that comes on the spool is too small to handle those heavy weeds. I just use my lawn mower on the big weeds when they pop up, so it’s not a huge deal for me. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally speaking, the more power you have and the bigger the swathe, the heavier and more expensive the **trimmer** is going to be. However, the extra cost and weight might be worth it; you’ll be able to tackle a larger plot in much less time. Don’t go overboard, though. Trimming is a tiring business, and the larger s**trimmer**s with heavier motors can be a strain to use for longer periods, even with a shoulder strap. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The E-drive technology is a high-torque gear system. This gives the BLACK+DECKER 36 V **cordless** **trimmer** the power and torque for long or wet grass. This is often a challenge with the smaller **trimmer**s. It also reduces clogging and allows for faster and more effective cutting with a 30cm cut diameter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The BLACK+DECKER 36 V **cordless** **trimmer** features an automatic single line feed system. This is convenient and practical and will feed additional line as necessary. This is more effective and less effort than most bump type feeders. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Used indiscriminately over wide swathes of grass, lawn mowers are the brute force of the lawn care world. But when it comes to more detailed work, you need a weed wacker—or line **trimmer**, weed eater, string **trimmer**, or whatever else you want to call it. These slim, handheld power tools are designed to make short work of garden and lawn maintenance. They're adept at nitty gritty details, like the weeds around edges and ledges of patios, walkways, bushes, and flower beds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your **trimmer** doesn’t have this feature then no problem, you can make do. Tilt your **trimmer** 90 degrees so that you are effectively cutting downwards. Then, slowly move the **trimmer** head along the edge of your lawn to trim off the overhanging strands of grass and create a beautifully clean-cut lawn edge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A new **cordless** electric string **trimmer** won’t emit smelly gas fumes. Rechargeable electric power tools are clean running and very quiet. And perhaps best of all, they start easily with the push of a button. No more pulling on a cord to get a finicky gas engine to start. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Motor performance is excellent. The **trimmer** is lightweight (less than six pounds) and offers just a 12-inch cutting diameter so this is a particularly good option for people who may be smaller or have challenges using a professional machine. Feeding line into the spool head is easy enough that pretty much anyone can do it without effort. If your line is getting short, use the “Command Feed” push button near the throttle trigger to get more without bumping the **trimmer** head. The string that comes with the **trimmer** is not of the greatest quality; consider upgrading to a better product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The specs of this **trimmer** are identical. The only difference is that this option comes with 2 batteries. This will keep you going for longer if you have more area to cover. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No, a battery powered weed eater shouldn’t get wet. Remember, this wireless yard tool is not waterproof or water resistant. So, avoid using string **trimmer**s when it’s raining – regardless if it’s a light drizzle or heavy pour. Moisture and water can affect its mechanical parts, including the battery. Whenever you are planning to do yard work, always do it when the sun is out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best Pro Quality Weed Eater Under $350 DeWALT FlexVolt 60V Max 15-Inch Superb grip and comfort from this 60V **trimmer**. Two-speed function and 50mins of battery run-time. Check Price - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Can You Use A Cordless Trimmer On Wet Grass? It is never recommended to use any type of electrical equipment, whether **cordless** or corded, on wet grass. This could cause accidents and may also result in damage to the motor. It’s always best to wait until the grass has dried out before trimming it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It changes from a standard **trimmer** to an effective edger with ease. One simply has to rotate the head by 180-degrees. This is really easy and needs no tools. It literally takes a few seconds. The edge trimming is effective and the light weight of the **trimmer** helps maintain accuracy and precision without strain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We test our gas-engine and battery-powered string **trimmer**s in identical fashion. We use the machines on ordinary suburban lawn grasses such as blue grass, perennial ryegrass, and fescues in a variety of suburban and rural locations. However, our most severe testing occurred along the sloping bank of a sand floor drainage basin in southern New Jersey, where we used the **trimmer**s to cut down knee-deep weeds and wild flowers. We also did considerable edging where sidewalks meet lawns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The height of the handle of this **cordless** string **trimmer** can be customized depending on the length that’s best for you. This means that whether you are short or of average height, you can expect that the straight shaft will be right for your needs. An easy-to-open and close clasp require means you need no tools to adjust to the perfect height. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Apart from the handy wheels mentioned above, the head also has the ability to angle from 0 to 90 degrees. This makes the WORX WG163E.1 **cordless** **trimmer** highly versatile and is ideal for tricky and hard to reach areas. It is great for getting under obstacles and works well on sloped areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Please note that the 5.0Ah battery and 7.5Ah battery will increase the weight of the line **trimmer** significantly, and therefore you may want to consider purchasing EGO’s battery back pack. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re reading this story, we assume you are considering a **cordless** electric string **trimmer**, or “weed wacker.” Now you want to know which one is the best. We believe battery powered outdoor equipment is the way to go. You never have to buy gasoline. Instead, you simply recharge the battery pack. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note that we haven’t yet tested the Craftsman WS2400, due in part to supply-chain issues and shipping delays. But we did test its predecessor model and evaluated it based on our previous use, knowledge of string **trimmer**s and their important features, and the promising list of specs. We’re confident recommending it for its value and use on large, rural properties. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We love the Greenworks brand of **cordless** electric outdoor power tools. So, it’s no big surprise that we like the Greenworks 40-volt **cordless** string **trimmer**. The fully charged 40-volt battery gives up to 60 minutes of runtime. The 12-inch-wide cutting path is perfect for home and gardens up to 1/3 acres. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even now, in 2022, 3 of the 4 batteries are still going strong. One of the rechargeable batteries isn’t keeping my string **trimmer** running as long as it used to – but I’ve learned a way to revitalize these batteries to keep your battery-powered yard tools running for years to come. Stay tuned! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We assembled each **trimmer**, taking note of how clear the manual instructions were, how much set-up was required, and how easy it was to install a new string. We looked at safety features, such as locking power switches and **trimmer** guards. We also assessed how comfortable each unit was; if the weight was evenly distributed from top to bottom, if the controls were accessible, where the handles were situated, and if the shafts could be adjusted for better reach. Then we put the **trimmer**s to work on both short and tall grass, as well as tougher roots and weeds, seeing how quickly, efficiently and consistently they tackled each job, and maneuvered around edges and obstacles without running out of battery or breaking a string. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The WORX WG163E.1 **cordless** **trimmer** weighs 3.4 Kg but, thanks to the wheels, you will barely notice the additional weight. It will give you more stability and accuracy especially in trickier parts of the garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How Long Should You Use A Cordless Trimmer For? The vibrations from your **cordless** **trimmer** could cause problems with your joints, nerves and hands over time. This is why it is important to only use your **trimmer** for short periods. It is recommended to use your **trimmer** for no more than 30 minutes at a time. Look for a grass **trimmer** with padded handles as this will absorb some of the vibration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   If you want to take some of the hassle out of your everyday garden maintenance jobs, you can’t do much better than investing in a **cordless** s**trimmer**. You can reach every corner of the garden without having to worry about extension cables, and there’s no risk of slicing through the cord. You’re free to work around all those awkward areas where there are walls, shrubs, raised beds or decking, and if you need to fight your way to the outer reaches of the garden on a weed whacking mission? Well, there’s no cable here to hold you back. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A few grass **trimmer**s use a plastic blade instead. These are easy to fit and easy to work with, but they also tend to snap when they meet anything thick or tough. With some **trimmer**s, you can go through two or three in a single session. Other **trimmer**s will feature an optional blade or heavy-duty line designed specifically to handle rough or weedy patches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Whether you opt for corded or **cordless**, select a cutting swath (10 to 16 inches) that makes sense for what range you need. A curved shaft is best for light trimming, while a straight shaft is better for heavy-duty work. Credit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar Select a cutting swath (10 to 16 inches) that makes sense for what range you need. A curved shaft is best for light trimming, while a straight shaft is better for heavy-duty work. Quiet motors or engines are obviously preferred, as are lightweight, balanced, and low vibration models as far as comfort goes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Battery powered weed string **trimmer**s have the same maintenance and care needs similar to other kinds of string **trimmer**s. The most important is removing gunk and build-up in the cutting head. To do this: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What Is The Difference Between A Grass Trimmer And A Grass S**trimmer**? These two terms are both used to refer to the same tool; a powered **trimmer** that uses a spinning wire to trim grass, weeds and other light foliage. The term s**trimmer** is often used in the UK as a colloquial term. Over in the USA, they more often call these tools weed whackers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The support handle adjusts for varying heights and your own particular comfort level. A spacer guard acts as a visual for the user and protects plants and obstacles against errant damage. If you’re feeling crazy, shove it back in the **trimmer** head and go wild. The head also pivots 90 degrees to get under that playset or to attack those hills that need trimming STAT. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The replacement for the highly regarded Bosch ART 30-36Li is slightly lighter but no less powerful. If you have a larger, rougher garden but don’t want the hassle of a petrol **trimmer**, this model is a good bet. With a 36V battery, it has more power than your average **cordless** **trimmer**, and Bosch’s Syneon Chip technology intelligently delivers that power to suit the job at hand. With a 30cm cutting width, it can tackle a good-sized plot, and you’ll eke 40 minutes of cutting out of a charge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Available from Screwfix and B&Q, the TTI821GGT is a bargain, coming complete with battery and charger for a lower price than most **cordless** **trimmer**s sold solo. It’s not just cheap, however, but light and very easy to use. It’s well-balanced, with the battery acting as a counterweight on the handle, and very effective at cutting through thick grass and lighter weeds, although it doesn’t have the power or the thick cutting line to get through anything too fibrous or woody. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dependable power even on the go – this is one thing that you can expect from this product. Since it is battery-powered, you can work anywhere.

The features do not end there and we will look at them in more detail. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It was great to get my hands on this EGO **trimmer**, new to the market in 2019. I was particularly interested in the performance of this **trimmer** and whether or not it is a real contender as a replacement for petrol line **trimmer**s. I was also interested how well EGO’s line feed technology (Powerload™ feature) works, as you know loading a line **trimmer** can be very frustrating and time consuming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How Long Should a Battery-powered String Trimmer Last? Since these **trimmer**s haven’t been around that long, we don’t really know how they stand the test of time. A good guess would be about three years, but it may be longer or shorter depending on the quality of the model you choose. Always check the warranty length for an idea of how long the brand will cover any repairs or maintenance necessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Petrol **trimmer**s are powerful but they are heavy and difficult to move. It will be challenging to get a perfect finish, especially in tight areas. Corded grass **trimmer**s are lighter but then you are restricted and confined by the cable. It can also prove frustrating to fight with cables. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **trimmer**s use a nylon string while some have a nylon blade. The blades are convenient and easy to replace but they are not highly durable. Fortunately, blades are generally inexpensive. The nylon string is more commonly used and can be either a single or double fed system. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a feature-rich grass **trimmer**. The plant guard and safety guard are both handy. The wheels are a great feature for ease of use and precision work. The variable head angles make the WORX WG163E.1 **cordless** **trimmer** highly versatile and the command feed function is a great convenience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mowing the grass is only one aspect of good lawn maintenance. Getting into tight corners, around obstacles and keeping edges neat is essential to a good looking lawn. The only effective way to do this is with the a **cordless** grass **trimmer** and is **trimmer** is often the easiest way to do this. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   EGO makes some great battery powered tools and the 15in 56-volt string **trimmer** is no exception. The **trimmer** has massive power with its 56 volt battery and impressive runtime that easily matches the power of gas powered weed eaters. The **trimmer** also has a larger diameter **trimmer** line that makes it more durable and can handle larger weeds and grass. It also has a cool line reloading feature where you press a button at the bottom of the head and it automatically spools the **trimmer** line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The WG157E 18V grass **trimmer** is light at only 1.9 kg and has convenient handles to make movement easier and more precise. It offers good value for money and is a good option for small to medium gardens. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Worx is a popular and well-liked brand of power garden tools. The WORX WG157E is good value for money and has a lot going for it in terms of features. It converts easily to an edge **trimmer** and has a lightweight design and build. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **trimmer** hasn’t got what it takes to battle heavy weeds or brambles, but it’s ideal for tackling lighter stuff and grass. It works quietly and reliably, while a pedal makes it easy to tilt the head for edging or cutting at an angle. Overall, it’s a fantastic little s**trimmer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best Pro Weed Eater Under $350 DeWALT FlexVolt 60V Max 15-Inch Superb grip and comfort from this 60V **trimmer**. Two-speed function and 50mins of battery run-time. Check Price - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s a lightweight power tool at just under 8 pounds – even when compared to most other battery-powered string **trimmer**s. That’s great; it won’t tire you out as quickly as some of the heavier **cordless** string **trimmer** models. I’m not looking for a workout when I use my battery-powered string **trimmer** – I just want to destroy some weeds and be on my way. The 13-inch cutting width is great for my needs. I personally think cutting width is overrated – you aren’t using your **cordless** string **trimmer** to make successive passes like a lawn mower. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What’s The Difference Between An Edger And A Trimmer? If you’ve been looking to buy a **cordless** grass **trimmer**, don’t confuse this with a lawn edger which is a totally different tool. While a grass **trimmer** trims grass, a lawn edger is designed to create boundary lines at the edges of the lawn. Some **trimmer**s allow for the head to be rotated to trim the grass along the edge, so even come with a wheel to make this even easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to keep a small to medium garden neat and tidy, a **cordless** **trimmer** is the way to go. They will make the work quick and easy. Look at your needs and budget as well as the size of your garden to find the one that is right for you. Soon you will have a neat garden with minimal effort. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Environment: A battery powered weed eater emits no pollutants. The power is provided by a lithium-ion battery pack which you simply plug into the wall to recharge. Using the same battery repeatedly helps make the best battery-powered weed **trimmer**s a very eco-friendly tool. Energy consumption tends to be lower as well because you can easily turn the **trimmer** off when moving. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **trimmer** has two settings, low and high. I kept mine on the low setting for most of the time and only really had to squeeze the throttle slightly for it to have enough power. The two-speed function offers you 5500-6600 rpm of cutting speed but I ran it on low and used the variable speed throttle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   5-year warranty Coming in second place of the best **cordless** weed whacker is the Milwaukee 2825-21ST – it’s a pretty close second! Let’s talk about its shortcomings first – power. This Milwaukee string **trimmer** model doesn’t quite have the awesome power of the Makita, or charge quite so quickly but it’s still a top-of-the-line piece of lawn equipment in every other way. The 60-minute charge time and 60-minute run time also mean that if you splurge and grab yourself a second battery, you can use them on rotation, switching them out every hour, like our best choice – the Makita **cordless** **trimmer**. However, if you are willing to splurge that little bit extra for the second battery pack, you’re really better off just getting the Makita battery-powered **trimmer**, because the price of a second battery more than makes up the difference between our number 1 and 2 picks.

-   My electric **trimmer**, on the other hand, is not heavy. I do have a motor and battery to contend with, but compared to my old gas **trimmer**, this thing is light. The great thing is I didn’t experience a loss of power when switching to a battery powered **trimmer**, you can’t beat lightweight and powerful. I can easily cut the same amount of weeds, tall grass, and over grown grass on a single charge. Having an extra battery on hand just extends the runtime. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This lightweight Bosch **trimmer** makes trimming and edging a doddle. It comes in a surprisingly tiny box, with even the shaft requiring some assembly, but once you’ve fitted it together and charged the battery, you’re good to go. Bosch’s ultra-efficient motor does an impressive job of balancing motor power and battery life, giving you enough strength to slice through anything bar thicker brambles, chunky thistles and the like. There’s a wire guard on the front to protect your prized plants from inadvertent destruction, and you can switch from trimming to edging by clicking in the orange button on the shaft and pivoting the head. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bosch is another well-established brand with a good reputation. Their products are known for strength and durability as well as affordable prices. Many Bosch users become lifelong fans. This Bosch EasyGrassCut 18 is an 18V grass **trimmer** that is lightweight and has a 26 cm cutting diameter. It is light and great for trimming and edging small to medium gardens. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For battery-powered **trimmer**s, our primary goal was to assess power and run time. For gas-engine **trimmer**s, we wanted to judge whether the power they provided was offset by their noise and weight. For all **trimmer**s, we wanted to see if each machine was comfortable and well balanced, and whether its line feed was finicky or robust. We found that especially when we were using the machines to cut down weeds, the growth was so tough, it took an immediate toll on the **trimmer**’s line, causing us to use the bump feed line mechanism at twice or three times the rate that we would in normal grass trimming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A good **cordless** **trimmer**, often called a s**trimmer**, is light, efficient and super easy to use. They can do a great job of neatening the areas the lawn mower cannot reach and ensure your edges are neat and attractive. Batteries have improved dramatically over recent years making **cordless** grass **trimmer**s a great alternative for all but the largest gardens. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you just need a **trimmer** for some lightweight trimming and edging on one or two small-ish lawns, the Flymo Contour XT has you covered. With a 300W motor and a 25cm cutting width, it’s cheap and light – in fact, it feels lighter than the 2.8kg weight would suggest. It also has some nice practical features, such as the chunky wheel for edging, the quick swivel mechanism that takes you from trimming to edging in a few seconds, plus the plastic plant guard and the handy hooks built into the handle to wrap the 10m cable around for easy storage. It’s not the most powerful grass **trimmer** and certainly not built to take on larger gardens or tougher weeds, but it does a fine job of the basics and doesn’t cost the earth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This guide will help you determine if a battery-powered weed eater is right for you. We lay out all the pros and cons and describe what features you need to look for when buying a weed wacker. We also have a list of the best battery-powered **trimmer**s on the market to make your buying decision even easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although this line **trimmer** is incredibly powerful and is robust and effective even in the toughest conditions, it may not be for everyone. If you are simply looking for a line **trimmer** that you can use in your garden to tidy up a few edges after mowing, then there are lighter, less powerful and more cost effective **cordless** options. If however, you are looking for a line **trimmer** to replace a petrol **trimmer** and need something to deal with challenging conditions then this line **trimmer** from EGO has all the practicalities you would need. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's not all plain sailing; the semi-auto line feed adds more line every time you release the trigger, so if you stop and start a lot you can run through a spool fairly quickly. However, we found the EasyGrassCut especially light and well-balanced, making it less tiring during long stretches of trimming, and while the bundled 2Ah battery only lasts 25 to 30 minutes, it only takes an hour to charge. What’s more, it’s the standard Power For All Alliance battery, so it’s easy to share batteries across multiple Bosch, Gardena and Flymo tools. It’s a little more expensive than the budget **trimmer**s, but the extra is definitely worth it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As this is effectively an upgrade, Gtech listened to what users had to say to make an already good **cordless** **trimmer** even better. One of the main complaints of the earlier versions was wrist and back strain and Gtech added the handle to prevent or at the very least reduce this. The handle is adjustable so you can find the ideal position for your needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Where this tool stands out above the DeWalt is with the ‘Quik-Lok Platform’…the Milwaukee Powerhead and battery have a bunch of tools you can use with it, hence the name Quik-Lok. Simply split the shaft and add on any number of tool heads; hedge **trimmer**, pole saw, edger, and a whole bunch more. If I was to buy again and wanted a combi tool then I would go for this one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's the smaller touches that make this such an effective tool. The semi-auto line feed does a great job of ensuring that you never have to think about the cutting line during use, while the head rotates for easy edging. There’s also a pull-out plant protector to keep shrubs and tree trunks safe while you’re trimming close around them. It is heavy – a shoulder strap would be appreciated – but if you believe a **cordless** **trimmer** can’t match your existing electric or petrol model, the AdvancedGrassCut 36 could surprise you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All three types have their pros and cons, but if you’re going to go **cordless** with just one of your garden tools, make it the s**trimmer**. When you’ve got a good-sized garden it’s a real plus not to have to worry about the cable. Charge up the battery, pull out the **trimmer**, and you can get to work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Comfort is the main feature of this **trimmer**. It is light, has a telescopic handle and comfortable rubber handles. This makes it easy for anyone to use without getting tired. The nylon blade adds to the convenience as they are really fast and easy to replace. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This unique **cordless** electric string **trimmer** easily converts a wheel edger in just seconds. (the rubberized wheels support and guide the edger, giving cleaner cuts with straighter edges. The head tilts 90 degrees for trimming edges on sloped terrain and hard-to-reach places. The push button “command feed” spool system gives instant line feeding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is the second Worx product to make our top ten which is indicative of their popularity. The WORX WG163E.1 **cordless** **trimmer** is an 18V **trimmer** (20V max) with a 30 cm cutting swathe to make quick work of trimming and edging. Worx market this as a 3-in-1 tool as you can quickly convert from a mini-mower to a **trimmer** or edger in seconds. This can be done without the need for any tools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The additional features and sturdy design make this **trimmer** marginally heavier at 2.5 Kg. This is still relatively light and the adjustable height, pivoting head and adjustable spool handles make it comfortable to operate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This kind of power comes with some drawbacks. It’s a heavy **trimmer**, but well balanced, with the weight of the batteries at the opposite end to the cutting head. The two batteries, meanwhile, last roughly 25 minutes before conking out, and you’ll really want the kit with the dual-battery charger rather than rely on an existing single-slot charger (the **trimmer** will work with any two batteries from Worx’s PowerShare 20V MAX range). However, with a tilting head and extending, rotating shaft it’s a more versatile **trimmer** than you might think, and we love the automatic line feed controls and chunky on/off trigger. It’s a fantastic option for any large, messy gardens in need of a little tough love. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To answer this question, it boils down to your lawn maintenance needs. Let’s say you have a large and overgrown yard, gas powered string **trimmer**s may be a better choice due to their cutting power. However, it’s more high maintenance than a **trimmer** running on a battery-powered system. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With a gas **trimmer**, you’re probably going to be doing some maintenance at the beginning and end of the season. It’s just what you have to do with an engine. With a **cordless** **trimmer**, though, you don’t have that maintenance. Kenneth Deemer, Local Roots Landscaping - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another great option to keep your yard clear is the Ryobi Electric Weed Eater. It’s a highly versatile piece of kit that can be used alongside Ryobi’s expand-it attachments. This means when buying add-ons you’ll be able to use them as things like a pole saw and hedge **trimmer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Cobra **cordless** s**trimmer** falls somewhere between the smaller, lighter grass **trimmer**s and the larger heavy-duty models. With a 24V motor and a 30cm cutting width, it’s got the power and the range to tackle a larger plot. Combine its faster Turbo mode with the 1.65mm twisted line and it can slice through thicker clumps of grass and weeds, although anything really tough or woody can still stop it in its tracks. And if you’re edging the lawn, the 90° rotating head and its built-in wheel make it easy to get a consistent line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bosch is often associated with high-quality and well-made tools and the Bosch UniversalGrassCut 18-26 is no exception. If you’re in the market for a reliable and easy to use **trimmer** then look no further; this one has some seriously impressive features and is designed for ultimate user comfort. If trimming the garden has felt like a task in the past, it won’t feel like that anymore. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The replaceable nylon wire can be used to cut entire gardens but I wouldn’t recommend it, and this is a job better suited to a lawnmower. S**trimmer**s are best used for trimming the edges of a lawn, or keeping pathways and brickwork free from weeds ( you can also use weed killer products for this task). Some S**trimmer**s come as a single-line cutter or a duel line cutter. We found that both styles are equally sufficient, and will certainly save you time and labour when compared to using just a pair of garden shears. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The DUR1818 is heavier than some **trimmer**s, and has a more modest 26cm cutting width than the Worx WG184E or the Bosch AdvancedGrassCut 36. Yet the design does a good job of reducing the workload on your shoulders, and Makita includes a strap for additional support. The shaft adjusts to give you a range of cutting heights and angles, and the only minor niggle is that the bump to activate the line feed doesn’t work the first time, every time. Still, if you’ve got a lot of grass to keep tidy, this versatile **trimmer** will comfortably do the job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Bosch ISIO can be converted from a grass shear to a small shrub **trimmer** in seconds and is surprisingly efficient. Running time is very good thanks to the Li-ion batteries and I get 20 minutes use which includes some woody shrub material. The battery will last between re-charges when cutting softer material. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We are talking here about a garden power tool, so let’s look at the three ways you can power this device; battery (**cordless**), electric (corded), and gas-powered. Each comes with its own set of pros and cons and will suit different types of jobs. So how about we run down the options… - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While the Bosch EasyGrassCut 18 **cordless** **trimmer** is a relatively basic grass **trimmer** it has most features you will need to keep a small to medium garden neat and tidy. Best of all, it is really lightweight and has adjustable handles. This makes it comfortable and easy to operate. The line feed is trigger operated for uninterrupted trimming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Well, actually you can’t go wrong with any of these models. They can all handle your day to day trimming tasks with ease. I actually own the RYOBI 40 Volt Lithium-Ion Cordless Attachment Capable String Trimmer and I love it. I wouldn’t go back to using my gas powered **trimmer**. I am able to trim up around my house on a single battery and have never run out of battery power to finish the job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The weight of the Ryobi OLT1832 ONE+ **cordless** **trimmer** is 2.3 kg so light enough for most users. This is made even easier by the adjustable height and handles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Terratek Cordless S**trimmer** is lightweight, comfortable and effective. It converts easily into an edge **trimmer** in a simple twist of the head. It also uses quick to replace nylon blades for added convenience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **trimmer** is all about being practical. It is only 2kg and has comfortable soft-grip handles. The shaft can be adjusted for a comfortable height. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We’ve reviewed the available models of the best **cordless** string **trimmer**s of 2022 to find the models we like. All the models reviewed in this story will easily cut through grass and weeds. They help keep your lawn and yard looking nicely manicured. And they do it with very little work on your part. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   7. BLACK+DECKER 36 V S**trimmer** Review – Lithium-Ion S**trimmer** with 2.0 Ah Battery (GLC3630L20) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Add an adjustable handle and an extra 200W of power to the Flymo Contour XT and you get something like this step-up model. It’s slightly larger and more unwieldy than its smaller sibling, but you get more cutting power to handle rougher grass and weedy areas, making this a better option if you have a larger garden. It doesn’t have the grunt of the Black + Decker GL7033 or the go-anywhere convenience of the **cordless** models, but if you want a great grass **trimmer** on a £50 budget, this is your best bet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   PRO TIP FROM TESTING: Cordless s**trimmer**s are now not far off as powerful as electric grass **trimmer**s with a power lead. They don’t have the same revs, but what they lose in revs, results in less stress on the s**trimmer** wire, and therefore end up being able to cut equally as powerfully. This in my opinion from extensive professional use, is one of the first tools alongside the **cordless** brush cutter that I prefer over petrol! You can see a test of what a **cordless** s**trimmer** will do and just how quick it gets the job done at the link provided. Simply amazing!! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our last three **trimmer**s are in the lighter-use category. They’re all under 6.5lbs, smaller capacity, smaller cutting width, not really designed for heavy brush or all-day use, but they also all come in at under a hundred bucks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cordless weed eaters are light and have no cords. Without the cord, you are free to move about your yard while working with a **cordless** string **trimmer**. Lithium-ion batteries provide power to your **trimmer** head. Easy to Use: It’s almost unanimous: The best battery powered string **trimmer**s are way easier to use and maintain than a gas string **trimmer**. There’s also no annoying extension cord to worry about as you get with corded electric string **trimmer**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Gtech GT3.0 features a fixed plastic grass **trimmer** blade. These are easy to clip on and off and so replacement is quick and painless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Weight Battery powered string **trimmer**s range from about six pounds to 15 pounds, as per our research. The lighter it is, the more maneuverable it will be. Always make sure you choose something that will be comfortable for you to use and transport around your yard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The power and brushless motor make this a tough and effective **trimmer**. It is well designed for durability and comfort. The automatic line feed adds to the convenience and the generous cutting area allows for fast and low effort trimming or edging. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bosch’s powerhouse **trimmer** has what it takes to handle larger, rougher gardens. Running on a 36V battery, it has more cutting power than your average **cordless** **trimmer**, and Bosch’s Syneon chip continually optimises it to get you the right performance for the job in hand. The 30cm cutting width is ideal for medium-sized and larger plots, and you can easily get 40 minutes of trimming and edging from a single charge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another advantage of **cordless** **trimmer**s is that they are generally great value for money. One thing to look out for is if they include a battery and charger. The models we featured are all able to share batteries and chargers with other related equipment from the same brand. This is convenient and can save you money provided you have a few other **cordless** garden tools from the same manufacturer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Though with that all said, it’s not a one tool fits all necessarily. What if you just want something lightweight for trimming and fine tuning? If you want a lawn to be jealous of, the two main tools that you are going to need are a great lawnmower and a top s**trimmer** ( I would highly recommend looking at a **cordless** lawn mower as the batteries will be compatible with your **cordless** s**trimmer** and save you a fortune!). The most popular type of s**trimmer** these days are **cordless** models, due in no small part to their sensible cost when compared with petrol s**trimmer**s, and manoeuvrability that outshines corded models all day long, you only have to look at my corded electric s**trimmer** tests to see these are chalk and cheese for practicality. Because of their popularity, all of the most well-known names in the garden tool manufacturing world have thrown their hat into the ring, and so, there are a ton of good products out there available at very competitive prices. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cutting Swath The cutting swath determines how wide the string **trimmer**’s head is. The wider this is, the more it will cut in one sweep. But some people prefer narrow ones if working in tight spaces. The average cutting swath varies from about 10-18 inches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The package consisting of **trimmer**, string, batteries, and charger costs less than $100. For anyone considering getting into a **cordless** electric string **trimmer**, you could do a lot worse than giving this a shot. Given the multiple positive reviews from users online, Worx has created a solid machine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a really well-made and sturdy **trimmer**, make no mistake about that. The only drawback is that it is slightly heavier than some others that made the shortlist. If you’re looking purely for a portable weed eater you can get around quickly with, there are lighter models out there. If, however, the extra weight doesn’t phase you too much, this is a real beast and the build quality is incredible…that’s why I have one…flex, GRRRR! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Terratek makes a range of popular and reliable garden tools including **cordless** lawnmowers, leaf blowers, and hedge **trimmer**s. They are known for reliability and good value for money. One of the advantages is that the batteries are interchangeable between tools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The battery takes just under an hour to charge and lasts for 30 to 40 minutes. It switches between trimming and edging modes when you push a catch and twist the shaft, while a pull-out guard protects tender stems and tree trunks from unintentional attacks. You’ll have to reload the spool with cable yourself and Screwfix doesn’t sell a spare spool if you break your first one, but that’s no disaster if you’re not too heavy handed and you don’t push your s**trimmer**s too hard. If you’re looking for a cheap **trimmer** for lawn work and the odd bit of light clearing, look no further. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   More importantly, though, choosing a **cordless** s**trimmer** will have less of an environmental impact. Plus, with today’s lithium technology, they can now match the run time of their petrol-driven competitors. Of course, another bonus of not using a petrol s**trimmer** is not having to take extra jerry cans of fuel to work sites, or even storing fuel at home. This means no spillages and no trips to refill either. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Depending on the battery power, you may need to recharge them several times before the job is done or maintain several battery packs. They can sometimes lack the ultra-high power you can get from gas-fueled machines. However, rest assured the products on this list have been selected to get around the normal issues associated with **cordless** products. These are long-lasting and very powerful battery-powered Weed Eaters trusted and used by professionals. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gas **trimmer**s can be extremely hard to start. If your fuel has been sitting too long, or you forgot to add an Ethanol additive to your fuel, then starting the **trimmer** can be a real pain. Anyone ever broke a recoil starter? I have. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you’re ready to convert from trimming to edging, simply unlock the buckle on the shaft, turn the cutting head, and lock it back. You can do it in under five seconds, seriously. I’m not a huge fan of using string **trimmer**s to edge however for small areas, the Worx GT 3.0 would do a decent job of cleaning up that grass to sidewalk division. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What’s more, **cordless** grass **trimmer**s and s**trimmer**s have become much more affordable over the past few years: you can have a **trimmer** or s**trimmer** with a battery and charger for under £100, with prices rising to around £350 for the more powerful, heavy-duty models. They’re also much more convenient than rival petrol models, not to mention quieter and more eco-friendly. Trust us – once you’ve tried a good one, you won’t ever want to go back. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The battery takes a couple of hours to charge and provides around 25 to 30 minutes of active service, although you could stretch that out a little further by avoiding Turbo mode. However, indicators on the membrane button control panel give you some idea when you’re running low. It’s a little heavier and harder on the shoulders than some models, but it’s also more solidly built than most **trimmer**s at this price. All in all, it’s a good choice for mid-sized gardens and, with the battery and charger included, excellent value. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   60 Volt lithium-ion battery works in all other DeWalt 60v max tools. There are literally a ton of DeWalt tools that use this same battery. Extra built-in value if you buy this **trimmer** - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The head can be tilted at a range of angles to cover different jobs, or swivelled around for edging purposes. There’s even a pull-out wire plant protector. Battery life isn’t exceptional, with around 25 minutes of cutting from a charge, but the WG163E works with any battery from Worx’s PowerShare 20V MAX range, and you can buy the **trimmer** with two 2.0Ah batteries for just £30 extra. If this isn’t the champ in any one area, it’s an excellent all-rounder. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The real selling point is the bundling of the leaf blower in this purchase. Neither tool will break power records, and using 20V batteries isn’t future-proofing yourself in this day and age. But it’s cheap, and both products will get the job done. Considering you get both a blower and a weed eater for almost half the price of some other **trimmer**s alone, it’s definitely a good value. It’s so inexpensive that if I bought this package, I’d probably spend some of the savings on the extended warranty just for peace of mind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mobility: Cordless weed eaters are light and have no cords. Without the cord, you are free to move about your yard while working with a **cordless** string **trimmer**. Lithium-ion batteries provide power to your **trimmer** head. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It accepts larger line diameter sizes than any of the other string **trimmer**s we spoke about earlier. So if you do live deep in the weeds, this **cordless** electric string **trimmer** is a great choice. With enough battery packs, you can tackle almost any sized yard. It is heavier (some people have pleaded for a shoulder strap to help with the load), but that’s the be expected with the bigger brushless motor and battery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While slightly heavier than the above models the Ryobi OLT1832 ONE+ **cordless** **trimmer** is built for comfort and convenience. The ONE+ range consists of 70 tools and they can all use the same Ryobi lithium battery. This is convenient, practical and cost-effective. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Score a £16 saving on the Black + Decker GL7033 in advance of Black Friday A powerful electric s**trimmer**, the Black + Decker GL7033 can take on fairly large workloads and tough jobs, with its attachable heavy-duty line raising the ceiling on its capabilities. On average, the **trimmer** costs £70 on Amazon, but a Black Friday deal sees its price slashed by £16, with it now available for £54. Amazon was £70 now £54 Buy Now - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Battery powered **trimmer**s, in my opinion, are really the best choice when you need to get a new string **trimmer**, you get a powerful, quiet, nearly maintenance-free tool, at an affordable price, that starts every time. Any of the **trimmer**s listed above would be a great choice for the best battery powered string **trimmer** of 2021. Get out there and clean up those edges. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Makita is a long-time favorite of professional builders and contractors. This shows the quality of the 40v straight shaft **trimmer**. This **trimmer** comes with a powerful brushless motor, which has three separate speeds to get the job done fast. The **trimmer** has a reverse rotation function which will help you get untangled if your **trimmer** string gets caught up in some extra tough weeds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Electric **trimmer**s will be rated somewhere between 250W and 600W, and while manufacturers will claim they use clever gearing systems or integrated processors to do more with less, the more power at your disposal, the heavier the work the **trimmer** can do. It’s a similar issue with petrol **trimmer**s – look for the capacity in cubic centimetres of the engine – or **cordless** **trimmer**s, where you need to look at the voltage. There, 24V will get you more cutting power than 18V or 12V, and professional models might reach 60V or more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Personally, I have three or four and tend to use a few of the same brands across my various batter power tools. So, I have a s**trimmer**, chainsaw and pole saw from DeWalt, so I use my set of batteries across all three machines. For most brands, the batteries and machines need to be the same voltage e.g. 40V. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   DeWalt is long time manufacturer of quality power tools used in the construction industry. The 60 Volt Max has a large 15 – 17 in cutting width and has a variable high/low speed which will help you power through trimming jobs in your yard. One great plus is that the batteries for the **trimmer** will work in all 60V battery Max tools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black & Decker’s 700W s**trimmer** is built to handle heavier workloads, with a 33cm cutting width that’s ideal for tackling medium-sized and larger gardens and 2mm line that can hack through longer grass. B&D’s E-Drive tech is designed to make sure you get extra power if you need it, and when it’s time to break out the big guns, you can take out the main spool, slot in the one with the extra heavy-duty line, and teach thick weeds and nettles some respect. The weight gets tiring on the arms after a while, but the mid-mounted motor and curved shaft improve the s**trimmer**’s balance and keep the business end away from your feet. What’s more, the wheel edging guide helps it do a decent job of edging, too. Overkill for smaller gardens, the GL7033 is brilliant for bigger, more unruly plots. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That said, picking one is not actually that easy. Can you get by with an inexpensive, lightweight **trimmer**, or do you need something with a bit more beef? Should you go mains-powered, **cordless** or petrol, line or blade? Well, we’ve picked through the best available models to find the best grass **trimmer**s for every kind of garden and every kind of gardener. Whether you’re after a monster that can slice through meaty nettles or a more manageable tool to quickly spruce up your garden, there’s a **trimmer** out there that can keep your lawn in shape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cordless grass **trimmer**s start at around £50 for a model without a battery or charger and go up to around £350 for the more heavy-duty, pro-level s**trimmer**s. As always with garden tools, a lot of your choice comes down to the size of your garden. If you’ve got a small plot with one or two compact lawns, most **cordless** **trimmer**s will do the job, but if you’ve got a lot of grass to keep under control, particularly long or rough grass, then you’ll need something with more power. That goes double if you need to tackle weeds and brambles on the edges of your garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Versatility Some string **trimmer**s aren’t attachment friendly but may still be convertible. For instance, you may find a few string **trimmer** edger combos, which are very handy! Other **trimmer**s have additional wheels making it easy to transport around. Some others come with additional tools such as blowers, saving you money and providing you with more handy tools to use around the yard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, this **cordless** weed **trimmer** is more expensive. But at least you’re getting quality for the money. DeWALT is a well-known brand with a quality manufacturer’s reputation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Bosch UniversalGrassCut 18-26 features a 26cm **trimmer** head which is more than sufficient for most domestic garden chores. But what really caught my attention was how versatile the **trimmer** head is. It features a tilt mechanism which is operated with a foot pedal so that you can adjust the angle of the head to get underneath and around obstacles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many of the **cordless** **trimmer**s are 18V. This will work well for the average small to medium garden. If you need to tackle tough areas, longer or wet grass, you might need a **trimmer** with more power. We have included a range of options with something to suit all requirements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bosch has an excellent reputation for producing reliable and well-performing garden tools, so it came as no surprise that the Bosch UniversalGrassCut 18-26 was worthy of a detailed review. It has some handy features that make garden work so much simpler than it usually is and is durable and well made. No matter what you’re looking for in a garden **trimmer**, you’ll find it in the Bosch UniversalGrassCut 18-26. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is one of the lightest battery powered string **trimmer**s on the market. Even if you need to hold it for a long time, there should be no problem. This string **trimmer** weighs under 6 pounds. You’ll be able to cut weeds and maneuver in tight situations all day without getting too tired. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But not all weed wackers are created equal. Over the course of a hot, wet (i.e., verdant overgrowth choked) summer, we put string **trimmer**s from leading brands to the test. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This model, the Worx GT 3.0 Cordless String Trimmer & Edger, is part of the “PowerShare” line of Worx tools that share the same series of batteries and offer a less expensive option to other yard machines out there. Worx has carved themselves a niche between the bargain basement appeal of Sun Joe and the more professional Ryobis and Milwaukees of the world. This **trimmer** is economical and is one of the few that comes packaged with two batteries (they’re weaker at only 2Ah, but you could still keep one in the charger ready to go). If you decided to pick up a third, they’re inexpensive enough that your budget is kept intact. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Think a **cordless** **trimmer** can’t handle the really rough stuff? Prepare for a shock with the Worx WG184E. With 40V of cutting power, a 33cm cutting width and a chunky 2mm line, this one can take on big lawns, weedy patches and just about anything else. We’ve been using it to tackle the kind of tasks we used to leave to a big electric **trimmer** with a special heavy-duty line. Even the heaviest patches of brambles, weeds and nettles couldn’t slow it down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One thing that makes this a versatile choice is the adjustable height of the telescopic shaft. Simply release the lever, and in an instant, you can increase or decrease the length of the straight shaft. This will allow you to have the height of the battery-powered string **trimmer** fit your body – and not the other way around. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The head of the Gtech GT3.0 **cordless** **trimmer** can rotate by 180-degrees making it quick and easy to switch to accurate edging. The light weight makes this task even easier and more effective. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This kind of power comes with some drawbacks. It’s a heavy **trimmer**, but well balanced, with the weight of the batteries at the opposite end to the cutting head. The two batteries, meanwhile, last roughly 25 minutes before conking out, and you’ll really want the kit with the dual-battery charger rather than relying on an existing single-slot charger (the **trimmer** will work with any two batteries from Worx’s PowerShare 20V MAX range). However, with a tilting head and extending, rotating shaft it’s a more versatile **trimmer** than you might think, and we love the automatic line feed controls and chunky on/off trigger. It’s a fantastic option for any large, messy gardens in need of a little tough love. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While electric **trimmer**s don’t require nearly as much maintenance as their gas counterparts, there are things you can do on a regular basis to keep them running well for an extended period. Kristi Howard, of Black & Decker Outdoor Products, says that a common problem with electric string **trimmer**s involves people using the wrong gauge of extension cord to power them. Howard says you should be sure to use an extension cord that is heavy enough to carry the current your product will draw. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some **cordless** options also have lengthy battery charge times so watch out for that. Plus if you forget to recharge the battery before using your outdoor power tool, this can be a pain. Due to the fact you are running on battery – rather than mains power – you also have a limit to your cutting time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This WORX WG157E **trimmer** uses a 3m threaded wire spool. The auto-release will give you the right length when you start the **trimmer** up. This saves time and hassle and delivers an optimal cut. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is an innovative powertrain feature that is found in most of the battery-powered string **trimmer**s from Black & Decker. The manufacturer claims it provides the **trimmer** head with more force than their previous transmission models. I didn’t own a previous model, so I don’t know if that’s true, but it seems plenty powerful for my needs. The extra power doesn’t come at the expense of mobility or longevity. With this battery-powered **trimmer**, you’ll be able to move about the yard controlling weeds for 45 minutes+ per battery charge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most grass **trimmer**s use a plastic line to cut with. This emerges from a covered spool and breaks off against an edge on the guard or shield (the bit that protects your legs and feet) when it reaches the right length. This works with an automatic or manual feed mechanism that’s designed to keep the line coming when it’s been worn down or has snapped off. In general, the thicker and heavier the line, the tougher the grass and weeds it will get through, but thicker lines can also be prone to jamming and harder to manage, especially if you’re planning to save some cash and wind replacement line onto the reel yourself. While ready-wound replacement spools are usually available, they tend to be expensive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This line of straight shaft **trimmer**s also has a 16-inch cutting width. This simply means that you will be able to do more within a single pass with this weed eater. It’s not sooo big that you’ll have trouble controlling it in tight spots either. It’s easy to guide while trimming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **trimmer** hasn’t got what it takes to battle heavy weeds or brambles, but it’s ideal for tackling lighter stuff and grass. It works quietly and reliably, while a pedal makes it easy to tilt the head for edging or cutting at an angle. Overall, a fantastic little s**trimmer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Which Is Better Battery or Gas Trimmer? Gas **trimmer**s are much more powerful and better suited to large yards. If you have thick growth, then you may want to opt for gas. However, gas **trimmer**s emit hazardous fumes into the environment. So if you do not need to choose a powerful gas option, a battery-powered option will be just fine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To properly maintain an electric **trimmer**, Howard suggests checking for damaged parts and cleaning off the air intake slots before each use to avoid overheating. She says you should never immerse an electric string **trimmer** in water or clean it with a pressure washer, and you should store it indoors, out of reach of children. “Keeping your **trimmer** regularly maintained should minimize your need for larger repairs,” Howard adds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Really Thick Weed Growth: If you have many weeds that are t hicker than a grown man’s thumb , you’ll need a thicker **trimmer** line than most battery-powered string **trimmer**s can handle. A gas **trimmer** will probably be your best choice. Thick weeds like this are usually only a problem if you live next to open fields of weeds or way out in the country. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you go for the DUR181Z **trimmer** or the DUR181RT kit with battery and charger, you’re getting a solidly-built **trimmer** that’s designed to trim a massive lawn. In fact, go with the kit with the 5A battery and you’ll run out of puff before it does; it ran for nearly fifty minutes before the battery lost its charge. What’s more, that’s with it chomping through patches of long, thick grass and some fairly chunky weeds in an overgrown corner of the garden. Nor will you have to wait an age while it recharges; Makita’s fan-assisted fast charger will do it in just 45 minutes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So what are the major differences between gas and electric **trimmer**s then? I would say the major difference is convenience. Electric string **trimmer**s are much easier to deal with. I am sure if you have used a gas powered string **trimmer** in the last decade, you have had to deal with mixing fuel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cordless electric weed eaters give you more mobility. You can travel far and wide to rid your weeds with this type of battery-powered gadget because you aren’t limited by a cable. However **cordless** electric weed eaters can often be a bit heavier than their corded counterparts. That’s because they have the added weight of the rechargeable battery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remember, a gas powered string **trimmer** uses a complex internal combustion system to run. If one of its parts fails, you’ll have no choice but to repair the entire machine. With **cordless** and battery powered string **trimmer**s, you’ll just have to worry about the battery. Another downside of a gas string **trimmer** is its weight – it is more difficult to carry and maneuver across the yard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Attachment Friendly Some string **trimmer**s are compatible with various attachments. This allows the machine to be more versatile. For instance, you may find it can be converted into an edger or blower, depending on the brand. This can save you money and storage space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's not all plain sailing; the semi-auto line feed adds more line every time you release the trigger, so if you stop and start a lot you can run through a spool fairly quickly. However, we found the EasyGrassCut especially light and well-balanced, making it less tiring during long stretches of trimming, and while the bundled 2Ah battery only lasts 25 to 30 minutes, it only takes an hour to charge. What’s more, it’s the standard Power For All Alliance battery, so it’s easy to share batteries across multiple Bosch, Gardena and Flymo tools. The EasyGrassCut is more expensive than the budget **trimmer**s, but it’s definitely worth the extra. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 15-inch cutting path is top of the line, and the high/low speed control lets to maximize run time and switch on full power only when you need it. This best **cordless** string **trimmer** includes a FLEXVOLT 20V/60V MAX battery that powers all DEWALT 60V MAX tools. Or it’s backwards compatible to work with 20V MAX tools. The bump feed head comes with a quick-load spool of 0.08-inch dual line installed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether it be a saw, a leaf blower, or grass shears, any **cordless** tool uses a battery. Even your smartphone and laptop run on battery. There are 4 main types of batteries that you should be aware of. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Look, you get another tool for the shed when you buy this combo. Plus, the **trimmer** can also be an edger, just like most B+D products. You won’t set any world land speed records using these yard products, but they will get the job done. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “An undersized cord will cause a drop in line voltage resulting in loss of power and overheating,” Howard explains. “When in doubt, use the next heavier gauge.” She says the letters WA on the cord jacket indicate a cord that is suitable for outdoor use. Regarding corded versus **cordless** **trimmer**s, Howard feels they are comparable in terms of power. Corded **trimmer**s are generally less expensive than battery-operated **trimmer**s and are easy to maintain, but they have less mobility. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Believe it or not, you can actually use a battery powered weed **trimmer** to cut a small lawn. However, it will only work if you have an overgrown lawn. And remember, a string **trimmer** doesn’t have a height adjustment, so there’s a huge chance that your lawn will be uneven. Another risk is whacking the grass out of the soil because of how a string **trimmer** operates – this machine uses centrifugal force to spin the line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’re trimming away at your landscaped beds or sidewalks, and you start to feel your arms getting tired, and you’re only halfway through trimming. My old gas **trimmer** weighed a ton, not literally, but it was heavy. I had to eventually give in and use a shoulder strap to offset the engine weight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **trimmer** head is fitted with an attachment point to add on a two-wheel axel to convert the **trimmer** into a simple rolling lawn edging tool. Inside the 13” cutting path sits a **trimmer** spool loaded with 20 feet of 0.08” nylon **trimmer** line that feeds a small amount of line each time you press the throttle. So this is a slight downside and potentially wasteful if you tend to stop-start your machine too frequently. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Why Does My Trimmer Wire Keep Snapping? The wire on your **cordless** **trimmer** is designed to break off when it needs to be replaced. Many tools have a bump head which allows you to ‘bump’ the tool and more wire will be dispensed. However, if you find that the wire is prematurely snapping, this could be because it is hitting something hard while trimming. Check the grass before cutting to make sure there are no foreign objects that could affect the performance of the **trimmer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
