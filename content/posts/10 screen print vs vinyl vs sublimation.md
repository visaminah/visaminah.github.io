-   If you want to create special effects in your design, then screen **print**s are the way to go.

-   Meanwhile, screen **print**ing utilizes ink and screen stencils. You create a dedicated stencil for each color, applying layers one at a time to the shirt.

Preparing these stencils takes time, and they are usable only for one T-shirt style, unless of course you adapt past stencils for future designs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sublimation **print**ing can also create bold colors and **print**s that last for a long time.

But your customers can definitely wait for a custom **print** t-shirt that sets them apart from the crowd! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Screen **print**ing will come in real handy if you want to create designs on flat surfaces like t-shirts. The textured **print**s created in screen **print**ing can turn any plain garment into a piece of art. However, it can be used on just about any surface, like coffee mugs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
