## 8 Things About Best Bug Spray For The Money | Odorless Bug Spray For House
-   Spray: Sprays are still the most common type of repellent. They can be **spray**ed on your skin and some can also safely be **spray**ed on your clothing. With **spray**s it’s important to cover your skin evenly and avoid your eyes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Picaridin: Newer to the market than DEET, picaridin became available in the US in 2005. Some of the best mosquito **spray**s actually have picaridin as their primary ingredient, not DEET. It’s a synthetic repellent that’s proven to be just as effective as DEET without the greasy feel and it won’t damage plastics or synthetic materials like DEET does. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bracelet / Wristband: Some people like bands because they’re convenient and you don’t have to put anything directly on your skin. You can wear them for hours without having to worry about reapplying a **spray**. Unfortunately, they’re typically less effective than more common options like **spray**s and lotions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’re likely to see one of three main active ingredients in **bug** **spray**s – DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus. Some others have a blend of essential oils. It is important to be clear about each type. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lotion: Lotions can be more effective than **spray**s since they’re absorbed more into your skin and so you can get longer protection from them. Just make sure you don’t choose an option that’ll leave your skin feeling heavy and greasy. Some also moisturize your skin and protect you from the sun, which is convenient if you accidentally leave your sunscreen at home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Candles: Sometimes candles work very well, other times they don’t. If the wind is blowing, then these candles aren’t likely to be very effective. However, if you’re able to light several candles in an area and there’s limited air movement, then candles may be your new favorite type of **bug** repellent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When most people think of **bug** repellents, they automatically think of **spray**s. While **spray**s are still very popular, there are several other repellent options that may make a better choice depending on what type of outdoor activities you’ll be doing. Ultimately, the main ingredients will have the most impact on the effectiveness, but the type of repellent is a high priority for some. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For sweaty, outdoor activities, there's Cutter Backwoods Insect Repellent. This product features unscented 25% DEET and a 10-hour, sweat-resistant formula. It's rated highly in other tests by consumer product experts, and it's a good value for the money. Although all the products smelled like **bug** **spray** — even those labeled "unscented" — Cutter Backwoods was pretty inoffensive, fading within 20 minutes of application. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
