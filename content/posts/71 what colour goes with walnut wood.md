## 71 Facts What Colour Goes With Walnut Wood | what paint color goes with walnut wood
-   A common misconception about hard**wood** vs. soft**wood** is that it somehow indicates the heartiness of the **wood** or its resistance to damage, such as scuffing or denting. In fact, the term “hard**wood**” simply means the **wood** came from a dicot tree, such as a broad-leaf variety, whereas “soft**wood**” refers to **wood** which comes from gymnosperm trees, like conifers. Ergo, common soft**wood**s are pine, fir, and cedar, while hard**wood**s include **walnut**, cherry, maple, and oak. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just like paint colours, **wood**s have undertones. For example, lighter **wood**s like oak, pine, and birch all have gentle yellow undertones that create a subtle warming effect, whilst ash has grey undertones and a cooling effect. You can balance a **wood** with warm undertones by using a cool paint colour or match your colour choices to the undertones for a cohesive look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Part of doing it right means choosing a paint color that strikes an exquisite contrast and amplifies the **wood**’s earthy charm. If you’ve decided to mix and mingle **wood** types in your living room, kitchen or bedroom, you might be struggling with a wall color to complete your vision. Are there certain shades that accentuate darker hard**wood**s like **walnut** or cherry? What if you have lighter **wood** furniture? Why not just play it safe with white? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While **wood**s like pine, beech and ply**wood** can vary in tone, they're generally quite versatile – which makes them a great candidate for pairing with bold color. 'Olive greens or navys are easy to mix in with light **wood**s,' says Amy Leferink, interior designer at Interior Impressions (opens in new tab). 'We also love using black or charcoal paint colors in elements such as an island or beverage bar while keeping the rest of the paint choices more neutral.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our home was built in 1927 and the dark **wood** trim is original to the home. The home owner, who was a builder, sourced all the **wood** from Maine. This is one of the charming details of our home – beautiful **wood** doors, a heavy mantel, columns that lead into the dining room, extra wide skirting board, picture rail (we added this feature back into many of the rooms), beautiful built-ins, and lovely old **wood** doors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, **wood**'s natural grains mean it can vary from piece to piece – so while the designers all have their favorite pairings, they also stress the important of understanding exactly how to match **wood** with a paint shade. 'It’s important to look for colors that complement natural **wood**,' says Ruth Mottershead. 'Use a color card or fan deck to identify these. For example, strong yellows or oranges combine beautifully with warmer **wood**s; for cooler more ash-toned **wood**s, consider cooler neutrals for a harmonious finish.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I love contrast. Dark hard**wood** floors and lighter walls offer a beautiful contrast. I’m not saying your walls need to be white, but you don’t want them to be as dark as your floors (unless it’s an accent wall). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your mixed **wood** tones are begging for a color that will make them pop even more. Rather than washing them out, choose a color that magnifies their natural grandeur. Don’t shy away from bold or trendy hues. The right one will simultaneously play up the **wood** tones and create a chic contrast to give the room its signature vibe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Aaron Markwell, color lead at COAT Paints (opens in new tab), agrees that neutrals are the way to go. 'Pair light **wood**s like beech, some oaks and ash with pale, warm neutrals – especially with pine,' he says. 'I would avoid anything very grey as a pairing for pine, as it can be quite yellow or orange and creates high contrast with greys.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Leila Touwen is co-founder of Pluck (opens in new tab) – a kitchen company celebrated for its vibrant designs, which often pair **wood**grain with brightly colored laminate. 'Due to their organic patterns and natural hues, **wood**s bring softness and warmth to a kitchen’s scheme,' Leila says. 'However, this does not mean all **wood**s work well with contrasting cool colors as the underlying shades – the subtle greens, pinks, reds or browns – need to be considered.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I hope this post was helpful in finding new wall colors to go with your dark **wood** trim. Whether you choose neutral or bold I think your rooms will come out great.

Also, if you need design help I offer eDesign and in home design services. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Balance, don’t bunch. Once you have your dominant **wood** tone and supporting pieces selected, spread them out to create balance. Woodiness works best when it’s carried throughout a space, not clustered. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Stained oak and wicker furnishings pair well with a soothing Green 01 or Green 09 and neutral Beige 02 or Beige 03. If you're working with **walnut**, let the **wood**'s natural grain shine through and pair with barely-there White 01 or Beige 01. Or what about creating contrast in the kitchen by pairing light oak floors with Black 02 cabinets? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   'Darker **wood**s bring the warmth and richness to schemes, but you can use a lighter, softer tone to create more of a monochromatic feel, depending on your furniture and soft furnishings selection,' says Mathew Freeman. 'Or opt for a darker neutral tone to create a moodier, more sophisticated feel.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   From reddish brown to light **walnut** **wood** color, you are free to play around with it. Is it compatible with the contemporary design home interior? Yes, sure thing. It is able to transform your dwelling into something smart beyond anyone’s expectation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What paint colors work best with stained **wood** trim? I generally select neutral colors when I am painting a room with natural **wood** details, whether cabinets or stain-grade trim. Greens, grays, whites and beiges are no-brainers. Warmer colors, like orange, brown, rust and red, work too, but the deeper tones of these colors work best. Here are 11 great spaces that I think got the choice of paint colors right. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'New oak tends to be cleaner and more blond, so look to colors that can respond to this,' says Farrow & Ball (opens in new tab) brand ambassador Patrick O'Donnell. 'A soft yellow like Hay (opens in new tab) will work in a subtle, restful fashion and has an underlying green note, which will flatter the **wood** while delivering warmth – a great choice for a sunny living room idea or even a home office.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wood furniture, flooring and trim throughout your home play an important role in your interior design. While solid **wood** furniture has always been a popular choice, Americans are increasingly moving away from matching sets and toward a cheekily curated mix of **wood** types and tones. It’s not the easiest look to pull off, but when done right, your home will exude a beautifully blended feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, don't forget to plan with the other elements of your scheme. 'Think about all the elements of the room that you are incorporating: fabrics, artwork, rugs and flooring should all be considered,' says Amy Leferink. 'Always have the **wood** finish sample on hand – photos do not work well, as they aren’t accurate enough representations of the colors and tones. Once you have these elements together, your paint color should create a cohesiveness between everything.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is used as weatherboards, fascias and decorative detailing. In the colonial past it was used as window frames with the harder Red**wood** for window sills and sashes. Though it has a lovely warm red-brown colour when new it greys off rapidly when exposed to sunlight and weathering. It likes rich warm neutrals like Resene Spanish White, Resene Double Biscotti and Resene Nougat, dense greens like Resene Forest Green and earthy stain colours like Resene Iroko, Resene Bark and Resene Treehouse. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ruth Mottershead recommends considering the atmosphere you're looking to create. 'Is it cool and contemporary or warm and inviting?' she says. 'A strong yellow or a bold orange will bring out the warm tones in these **wood** finishes, whilst a cooler grey will create a cool, sophisticated feel.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Want to go a bit left-field? Take the advice of Sam Baldry, head of design at Swoon (opens in new tab), and try neon. 'Neon has come around on the trend rotation a few times in the last decade, but this time we are talking specifically about lighting and small pops of accessories, not entire bedspreads, or feature walls,' he says. 'Pairing neon pops of color with the opulence and mystery of dark **wood** is a super chic combination that will make your home feel cool and current.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light **wood** floors may either have a cool or warm undertone. Cool toned **wood** are those that have taupe or grayish undertones, whereas warm toned **wood** are those that have red, orange or yellow undertones. Read more about colors for gray floors here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Those who are worried about durability of **wood** may also use the term “hardness,” though this refers to the Janka hardness test. During this test, a steel ball is placed on a block of **wood** and force is applied until the ball is embedded halfway. The force is measured in pounds-force (lbf) or represented as a number followed by the word “Janka.” Wood types may receive a rating based on their “side hardness” which involves a test run perpendicular to the grain, or may be tested on their “end hardness.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yellow-toned **wood**s are pretty obviously yellow. Sometimes they can lean a bit into orange, and in the right light, they may pick up flashes of green or pink. You’ll see this color **wood** a lot in homes that were built in the 1990s when “honey oak” was all the rage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since moving in 7 and a half years ago, we’ve made design decisions to highlight the warm **wood** detailing – updating the fireplace, using white slipcovered furniture, and painting the walls. Focusing on just the right paint colors really helped. When we moved in the wall colors were warm but dark colors – the hall was green, the living room and dining room a dingy beige, the kids rooms – yellow and pink. The colors didn’t really highlight the **wood**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you select a cool paint colors it might conflict with your warm **wood**work. I had this issue with Revere Pewter. I never really loved it in our home with the **wood** trim despite loving it in homes online with white **wood** trim. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This creamy white is versatile. We’ve used it in our living room and dining room, which opens into each other through ornate **wood** columns. Our living room is north facing and doesn’t receive much sunlight while our dining room is south facing and very sunny. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These undertones may either be classified as warm or cool. Wood with warm undertones have inherent reddish tones, a yellowish base or an orange tinge. Whereas, **wood** with cool undertones have varying shades of gray and brown that show over its surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Eastern black **walnut** trees reach maturity at about 150-years-old. At this age, some are as tall as 150 feet, with diameters reaching 8 feet. Their root systems are also quite immense and give off a chemical which can prevent the growth of vegetation around them for as much as 50 feet from the trunk. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wood trim is a classic feature of many older homes. While some homeowners love the warmth and character it adds, others find it outdated and dark. If you’re struggling to love your **wood** trim, it could be that the wall color is creating a visual distraction for you. Choosing the right neutral paint color to go with your **wood** trim can not only save you the cost and labor of painting all that **wood**work but add a special kind of beauty and warmth to your home that’s hard to replicate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a bolder scheme, consider rich shades that dial up the drama. 'Pair dark, warm **wood**s with deep and warm colors such as Baked Cherry (opens in new tab),' advises Ruth Mottershead. 'Or create a dynamic and dramatic interior with contrasting blues or teal colors such as Canton (opens in new tab) or Air Force Blue (opens in new tab).' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is used for everything from fences, weatherboards, house framing, furniture and extensively in Lock**wood** Homes as wall cladding. It is pale yellow/white but it takes stains really well – so it can be almost any colour – and goes golden yellow as polyurethane ages. It likes all colours but it seems to prefer clear crisp creams like Resene Rice Cake, Resene Wheatfield, dense yellow based greys like Resene Taupe Grey and bolder colours like Resene Pohutukawa, Resene Kaitoke Green and Resene Regatta. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For those who want to purchase authentic **walnut** **wood** furniture made by expert craftsmen and topped off with a lifetime quality guarantee, Vermont Woods Studios is the place to shop. Pieces are typically made to order and can be customized to suit. With a wealth of positive reviews and testimonials, ethical practices such as sustainable local harvesting, creating earth-friendly products, and American craftsmanship, it’s easy to order with confidence. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Looking for paint colors that go with blonde **wood**? Try a warmer, trendier pick like rosy peach to give your lighter **wood** furniture a halo effect. Don’t white-wash your minimalist digs. Find comfort through color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like everything in interior design, the color you choose all depends on the vibe you're going for, says Noel Gatts, interior designer and founder of beam&bloom (opens in new tab). 'Darker, moodier spaces could utilize a dark cool color like Benjamin Moore's Gentlemen's Gray (opens in new tab) to create subtle contrast with **walnut** and other dark **wood** tones,' she says. For an airier feel, on the other hand, 'a light, cool grey like Sterling (opens in new tab) does a beautiful job freshening up spaces with neutral **wood** tone trim and accents like white oak or pine.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pure white wall paint works with light **wood** floors, however some homeowners find it a bit stark. In some cases, pure white walls can also give some sort of a “hospital” vibe. If you are not a fan of ultra bright white walls, you can tone it down to an off white shade to give it a softer look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   White Oak, on the other hand, has a more “bleached out” appearance. Depending on the finish used, its color may range from light tan to medium brown. This particular type of **wood** floors are best paired with pastels and dark colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This beautiful living room is a great example of a wall paint color that beautifully accents and contrasts with the **wood** trim. (Orange and blue are opposites on the color wheel, so it’s achieving the desired effect). Perfect for a homeowner who loves bright colors! If you’re planning to sell your home, however, this much contrast and drama are typically too overwhelming for buyers. Homeowners prepping for a home sale should opt for a more neutral, blended palette in order to appeal to the greatest number of potential buyers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Deep, dark **wood**s like **walnut** and mahogany make for the perfect pairing with one of today's most popular colors – green. In this project by Studio AHEAD (opens in new tab), **walnut** furniture sits comfortably in a room painted in an on-trend pistachio – but it's just as suited to brighter shades. 'Dark **wood**s such as **walnut** or mahogany work fantastically well with green, from fresher hues such as Boxington (opens in new tab) for a contrasting feel, to sumptuous rich greens such as Puck (opens in new tab) for an elegant interior,' says Ruth Mottershead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We love **wood**. Many people have panic attacks if others suggest painting over it. Sacrilege! When considering the merits of a possible house purchase way up the Yes scale is the delicious thought that ripping up the carpet may lead to the discovery of timber floors or the outside recreational area can be extended with acres of **wood**en decking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moreover, stains tend to wash out the grain, removing bits of character. For this reason, a natural **walnut** **wood** product is rarely stained. Instead, **walnut** furniture tends to get a clear coat finish; either of some type of varnish, wax, oil, or lacquer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Have you just moved into an older home with original dark **wood**work? Are you thinking of painting it white? Once you paint the **wood** trim, it’s really hard to go back. Before you paint your trim, I’d love you to read this post. The right paint colors for your walls can make all the difference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The biggest mistake people make when buying **walnut** furniture online is purchasing a piece of furniture that isn’t actually made of **walnut** **wood**. Many retailers label their products as “**walnut**” simply because the color mimics that of natural **walnut** **wood**. If you’re looking for real **walnut** **wood** furniture, here are some things to look out for: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Warm **wood**s like acacia, teak and cherry have a reddish tone that makes them perfectly suited to warmer shades – though it also means they can clash with cooler tones, so be careful. 'Warmer tone **wood**s can be on the red side, so you can pair this with more neutral tones, allowing the warmth from the **wood** to contrast with the cooler tones,' says Mathew Freeman. 'An alternative option is to enhance the warmer tones by choosing a warm neutral tone, to create a warm cossetting feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most people are familiar with **walnut** **wood** in its darkest state, which can be a deep chocolate or coffee color. In fact, it’s the only dark **wood** native to North America. However, it’s actually only the center of the tree which bears the deep hues. This is called the heart**wood**, and it may also have lighter browns, purples, grays, or reddish tints. The outermost portion of the tree– known as the sap**wood** because it carries the tree’s nutrients– is typically a pale blonde color, though it can also be yellow-gray as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To just touch on exotic **wood**s – Teak, Mahogany, Wenge, Kwila, Fijian Kauri, Maple and Elm – these have mainly been used as furniture, decking and high end cabinetry. I won’t suggest any colours in regard these **wood**s or any of the multitude of kitchen laminates that are available as they open up so much rich possibilities it would turn this article into a epistle of great length. If you have any other timber you are trying to choose complementary colours for, bring it into your local Resene ColorShop and view with A4 swatches from the in store colour library. It must be noted that there has been never been as much **wood** to choose from – a bit like paint colours in fact - isn’t that wonderful? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wood is natural - but it does come in many different colours. The thing that all **wood** has in common is that it really likes neutral colours. Not one particular neutral and certainly not ruling out all other colours. The following colour suggestions might resonate with you in regard the 'love relationship/harmonies' of different types of **wood**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   White and beige are two of the most popular wall colors used with dark **wood** floors. These two colors are not only a classic choice but can instantly help brighten up a room, while making it look “clean”, crisp and airy. In addition, they also work wonders in making a room feel a lot more spacious. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are about to generate a brilliant and comprehensive room, you had better have a go with a darker shade of **walnut**. Remember to create a setting that looks brighter than the furniture. Pure white walls perfected by windows overlooking lush sight could be striking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Neutrals are another type of color that goes well with **wood** floors. Colors like shades of brown and grays work as wall colors not only for light **wood** floors but even for mid to dark **wood**. Other examples of neutrals that work great with light **wood** floors are greige and taupe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wood can really ratchet up a room’s richness, but you can’t expect a single **wood** type or furniture set to do all the work. Mix it up, friend. You’ll be glad you did. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're looking to move away from a mid-century feel – though still a popular interior design trend – then Amy Leferink suggests balancing out the warmth. 'Painting the walls a creamy or greyish white can help balance the eye,' she says. 'One of our favorite colors to pair with warmer **wood**s is grey blue; it makes the warm **wood** really stand out against the walls.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This color is magical. I used it in a client’s home in their game room. It looked stunning with their dark **wood** trim and pool table. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This post might feel a bit long because I want to pack EVERYTHING I’ve learned over nearly an 8 year period. I will also be showing you what most of the colors look like in rooms with **wood** trim. All the paint colors mentioned are by Benjamin Moore but this isn’t a sponsored post. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pick a dominant **wood** tone. The first step is choosing the main type of **wood** for your space. Hard**wood** floors or **wood** trim are good candidates. So are focal points made of solid **wood** like a kitchen island, dining room table or armoire. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Little Greene (opens in new tab)'s creative director Ruth Mottershead advises thinking of light **wood** tones as neutrals within your scheme. 'Consider their undertones carefully,' she says. 'Are they warm or cool? Which hidden ones can you see within the **wood**grain?' Once you've done this, pair with colors accordingly. And if in doubt, she says, 'opt for an easy-to-scheme versatile hue that is neither too warm nor too cool, such as French Grey (opens in new tab) or Slaked Lime (opens in new tab).' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Play to the undertones. Look closely at the patterns and grains in your flooring, trim or furniture to identify undertones. If they’re warm, complement them with warmer **wood** tones. If they’re cooler, avoid darker, more sumptuous **wood** types like cherry or **walnut** as accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That said, if you’ve got a ton of **wood** and it’s making your home too dark, consider painting out the ceiling and floor trim but leaving the rest. Wood trim at the top on ceiling moulding can feel too heavy and bring the height of the room down. Just be consistent - if you paint baseboard floor trim, do it all, not just some (see this blog post on consistency). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While some will use stain on **walnut** **wood**, which will make it maintain the darker hue indefinitely, it is typically clear-coated or oiled. A clear coat doesn’t stop the color change altogether, but it can minimize it if maintenance is performed regularly. On the other hand, an oil-finished piece needs to be oiled regularly, which will give it richer hues over time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Relying on one **wood** type or color may seem like a good move for continuity, but there’s a downside to playing it too safe. Good design feeds on diversity, not monotony. As long as they’re not too divergent, different **wood** shades and grain patterns will give your room that shot of stylishness it’s been missing. Here are a few tips to remember when mixing **wood** tones in your home: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The care of your furniture depends largely upon what type of **wood** finish is used to seal the **wood**. While all pieces benefit from regular dusting, it’s generally best to avoid commercial cleaners as they can sometimes leave residue on pieces with a lacquer finish or damage wax and oil finishes. Pieces with an oil finish generally do best if a natural Danish linseed oil is applied at least once per year, though those in warmer climates may need to do this more often. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To keep it simple, **wood**s with warm undertones like **walnut**, cherry and mahogany mesh well with cooler paint colors. Conversely, lighter **wood**s like poplar, pine and birch contrast well with warmer shades. The rest is up to you, so experiment, have fun and test those colors out before you cover your walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pairing shades of equal values or intensity can help render a low contrast in a space. Medium toned browns like Tan and Sand are two of your best bets as wall color for medium **wood** floors. These lovely shades help enhance the natural warmth of **wood** and brings a cozy feel to the space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Muted shades of green are those which are toned down with a bit of gray , such as sage, moss or olive. These colors help enhance the richness of dark **wood** floors without making the space feels too overwhelming. This pairing is ideal for traditional and contemporary spaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the past Oak was used a lot as furniture often stained a deep colour or just varnished and referred to as 'blond oak’. It has strong open graining and when stripped back to bare **wood**, bleached or whitewashed it takes on a Scandinavian, coastal and shabby chic look. When left as a dark strong colour it likes associating with traditional and earthy colours – Resene Clotted Cream, Resene Red Berry, Resene Evolution and Resene Half Pearl Lusta. When stripped it works well as Limewash, or with muted greys, blues and greens – Resene Triple Black White, Resene Duck Egg Blue, Resene Half Robin Egg Blue and Resene Periglacial Blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For instance, if your wall has a reddish color, use green for the walls. A good muted shade of green like olive will contrast beautifully with cherry hard**wood** floors. Another example would be lilac walls to match yellow toned **wood** floors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In terms of eco-friendliness, it is a great option. By choosing a sustainably-sourced domestic variety, materials spend less time in transit, reducing the carbon footprint. Moreover, harvests are overseen by tight US regulations, meaning tropical deforestation is not a concern. It’s also worth taking into consideration that **walnut**’s durability ensures a piece will last 50 or more years when designed by a quality craftsman, whereas a person could easily toss 10 cheap particle board pieces in the trash in the same amount of time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Floors and walls are two of the largest surfaces in a room and because of this they must complement each other. Choosing the perfect wall color to match with **wood** floors can be quite confusing because of the wide variety of paint choices available in the market. In fact, a single paint brand can offer hundreds of versions of a single color family. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'Warm **wood**s like acacia, teak and cherry all have red undertones, so I try to pair with paint colors that also have some redness to them,' says Aaron Markwell. 'Mid-century and biscuit beiges like Humble, Well Grounded or taupes like Good Intentions work particularly well for these. Pair with red walls like Old Street if you want your warm **wood**s to feel a little more relaxed.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
