## 11 Reference List: What Is The Strongest Drill Bit Material | Carbide Drill Bits For Hardened Steel
-   These **drill** bits feature a cylindrical shaft and helical flute. As a result, they are similar to corkscrews and can **drill** quickly and accurately. The helical flute is a feature that allows them to control dust from the hole as they work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These are expensive **drill** bits made from carbide or ceramic and are more prominent in CNC **drill**ing. They are wear-resistant and has multiple coolant channel for a prolonged lifespan. They are suitable for cutting holes about five times their diameter and are preferred due to their speeding **drill**ing process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The center **drill**ing bit has a tapered and threaded bit tip. It is an important **drill**ing bit for working with wood and involves turning it to bore a hole in the wood. They are made mainly using soft steel and are ideal as a hand tool. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The ejector **drill** bit has a unique design. It is similar to a tube in a tube and has a carbide **drill** bit tip. They are suitable for making deep holes 19-102 mm in diameter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many types of **drill** bits are categorized based on the materials they can make holes in. Under this category, we have four common subcategories: universal, metal, wood, and others. Below are the different **drill** bit types under each subcategory and their applications. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black oxide is an inexpensive coating applied on high-speed steel. They make the **drill** bits heat resistant, rust and corrosion resistant, and frictionless. Due to the lowered friction, **drill**ing becomes easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drill bits coated in diamonds have the highest hardiness in this category. Consequently, they are suitable for **drill**ing into hard materials such as metals. Also, they are highly accurate and suitable for materials such as glass, sea glass, etc. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **drill** bit has a design suitable to work only as a combination router and **drill** bit. It has a steel shell with a diamond embedded in a metal segment. They are suitable for cutting several materials but at relatively low speeds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drill bits coated with titanium nitride are hard, fast, have a longer lifespan, and are suitable for **drill**ing hard and soft metal. Due to their properties, they have wide industrial applications. However, the only disadvantage is that it is not restorable when they lose its cutting edge unless the coating is reapplied. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **drill** bits are similar to the titanium nitride **drill** bits. Consequently, they are slippery with a characteristic blue or purple color. However, they have enhanced hardness. As a result, they are majorly applicable in **drill**ing through hard materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brad-point **drill**ing bits have rubber cork which aids their accuracy to a certain depth. As a result, they are suitable for **drill**ing materials that need a highly accurate hole and are available in 3-16mm diameters. They are suitable for wood and soft plastics. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
