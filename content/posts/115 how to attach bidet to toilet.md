## 115 Things You Should Know About How To Attach Bidet To Toilet | Italian Bidet
-   People have strong opinions about washing their butts, but one thing is for sure: The Toto Washlet C5 is better than any other **bidet** seat at dialing in your exact preferences—pulsating or oscillating stream, warm or cool water, high or low pressure. Thanks to the C5’s unique, intuitive controls, you’ll find that it’s just as easy to disable the bells and whistles if you’re in it only for the heated seat. And if you’re new to **bidet**s, don’t assume you need to dive in with a feature-rich model like the Toto. We’ve found that many people are perfectly happy with a simpler, less expensive cold-water model, and we have recommendations for those, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your **toilet** has a shutoff valve at the bottom, usually where the **toilet** connects to your larger plumbing system in the floor or wall. The first step is to turn this valve fully off to shut off water access to your **toilet**. This installation is best done with no water in your **toilet**, so after the valve is shut, flush the **toilet** a couple of times until it’s entirely empty. Now, you’re ready to begin. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **toilet** **bidet** spray is a very useful option for people with flexibility issues. It helps you direct the water flow as you please and gives you more control over the pressure. Not to mention, sprayers are cheaper than most other **bidet** options. Many sprayers also come with double pins. It lets you select the water temperature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you look behind your **toilet**, you’ll notice a hose running from your floorboard to the bottom of your water tank. This is the supply line that re-fills your **toilet** every time you flush. The valve extending from the floorboard is called an “angle-stop.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a few things that impact the cost of the **bidet**. For example, if you buy a **toilet** along with the **bidet**, you have to consider the **toilet** price as well. The average cost to install a **bidet** depends on whether you want a handheld **bidet**, a standalone ceramic model or a **bidet** **toilet** seat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you compare **toilet** paper hygiene to **bidet**s, **bidet**s are more hygienic. On the one hand, you use paper to wipe your undercarriage while you wash it when using a **bidet**. Washing is always more hygienic than wiping. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you’ve installed your **bidet**, it’s time to give it a try! Follow the instructions that came with your product on how to use it. Most **bidet**s have a sprayer that you can use to clean yourself after using the **toilet**. Some also offer a heated seat and air dryer. Enjoy your new bathroom upgrade! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are basically three steps in installing a **bidet** **toilet** seat (1) removing your existing **toilet** seat, (2) mounting your new **bidet** seat and, (3) connecting to the water supply. We’ll go over each of these steps one by one. All parts needed for installation will be included with your shipment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bidets have a lot of stories surrounding them. While some people mistake it for drinking fountains, awkward sinks, or even showers, you know exactly what you are looking for. In the modern days, **bidet**s have gained massive popularity in America and some other portions of the world. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your **bidet** doesn’t replace your **toilet** seat entirely, it’s time to put your **toilet** seat back on. Position the **toilet** seat above your **bidet** over the same bolt holes, and screw it back in. Some **bidet**s may offer new bolts and washers to help with this, while some may have you use your original bolts. In rarer cases, the original bolts won’t be long enough to deal with both the seat and **bidet**: That means it’s time to head to the hardware store and look for longer **toilet** seat bolts that can handle the new situation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We won’t walk you through **bidet** installation step by step, as it is surprisingly simple — not much more difficult than installing any replacement **toilet** seat, plus a little plumbing — and most instruction manuals are quite clear, but it is good to note that for all **bidet**s, you’ll have to remove your existing **toilet** seat. With attachments you’ll put the seat right back on, but with electric **bidet** seats you’ll mount the **bidet** onto your **toilet** and get rid of your old seat and lid. It’s good to check out how your current seat mounts beforehand, as some lids have a quick-release function, while others screw off, so be sure you know how yours works, as it could affect your installation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wall-mounted **bidet**s require a special frame to be installed in the wall prior to drywall and tile. Mounting bolts attached to this frame protrude from the wall, and all the plumbing connections are made at the wall. A special drain connection is used that seals when the drain from the **bidet** is pushed in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Electric **bidet** combo is the **toilet** set that comes prefixed with a **bidet**. Hence, you won't have to install one separately. It will be a better alternative if you are remodelling your bathroom or planning to change the **toilet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you don't want to complicate things, handheld **bidet**s are good middle ground. People often mistake them for bar showers (although both look similar). Bidet sprays and handheld **bidet**s are hoses with one end connected to the **toilet** plumbing and the other with a sprayer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Mounting your new **bidet** seat – To mount the **bidet**, you first need to install the mounting bracket on to your **toilet**. After the mounting bracket is installed, the **bidet** slides right on to the mounting bracket – securely fastening it to the **toilet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Installing a **bidet** seat on your **toilet** is simple and you will find that it is just about as easy as changing out a regular **toilet** seat. The big difference is that you have to turn off the water, drain the **toilet**, and attach the hoses for the **bidet**. For most people installing a **bidet** on a regular **toilet** takes less than a half an hour. And when you order from **bidet**-**toilet**-seat.com you get a number where you can reach customer service if you have a question during install. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. Connecting to the water supply – Now that your **bidet** is secured to the **toilet**, we just need to connect the water supply. Included with your shipment is a T-Connection, or “splitter”, which splits your water supply two different ways. One way will be to your **toilet**’s water tank, and the other way will be to the **bidet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Besides infinite hot water, the Alpha JX features a heated seat, a dryer and a fully customizable stream, all adjustable from a remote control. With clear buttons that are all labeled, it’s super easy to go through a wash and dry cycle, even if you’ve never used a **bidet** before. You can adjust the position, strength and temperature of the spray and see what level your settings are at with the small screen. Plus, the Alpha JX has a “Wash & Dry” button that runs through a complete wash and dry cycle with just one press. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can find this **bidet** seat and many other **bidet**s at my site http://www.**bidet**-**toilet**-seat.com. Please visit us there for an extensive selection of **bidet**s and expert descriptions and advice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Today, many master baths in the U.S. also have this additional fixture, and manufacturers have a number of different models to choose from. Installing a **bidet** requires basic plumbing tools and some skill in carpentry and plumbing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On top of an extremely comfortable and effective wash, the Toto also has some extra features that aren’t must-haves but definitely make your bathroom experience all the more luxurious. One of these functions is a pre-mist feature, which is only available on Toto **bidet**s. It turns on automatically when it senses someone sitting on the seat and sprays a mist onto your **toilet** bowl to lubricate the surface, which helps keep it clean. The deodorizer is also automatic, activating once you stand up to help your bathroom stay fresh. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you know what sort of **bidet** you want, you now have to ensure that it fits on your **toilet**. In general, the first thing you’ll want to check is if you have a one-piece **toilet** or a two-piece **toilet**. A one-piece **toilet** has no separation between the bowl and the tank behind it, whereas a two-piece has a gap between those two elements. Basically all **bidet**s will fit a two-piece **toilet** (you’ll just have to check bowl shape, but more on that in a second), but some one-piece designs don’t leave enough room to fit an attachment. So if you have a one-piece **toilet** you’ll want to make sure you don’t have one with a French curve (where the frame of the **toilet** between the bowl and the tank curves up), and you should always measure the space between the bowl and the tank to make sure it matches your desired **bidet**’s requirements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vacuum breakers prevent water from being siphoned back into the supply system and causing contamination. Most **bidet**s have an integral vacuum breaker, but it’s smart to confirm this before you buy your **bidet**. If one is lacking, instead of standard shut-offs at the wall, you can buy ones that have a vacuum breaker. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Test for Leaks Turn the water on either at the isolation valve on the **toilet** water supply line or, if you had problems turning the water off with the isolation valve, using the main water shut-off. Check all connections for any sign of a leak. If your **bidet** has functions that require electricity, like heated water or a drying mode, then you need to make sure that it's plugged into a grounded GFCI outlet. You should have an outlet within reach inside the bathroom; if you don't, do not use an extension cord. It may be better to opt for a non-electric **bidet** or have a new outlet installed by a professional electrician. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are plenty of pros and cons between the Alpha JX and the Toto Washlet C2. Both are fantastic **bidet**s that you’ll love having on your **toilet**. The Alpha JX has endless warm water, but the stream and dryer performance of the Toto C2 is slightly better. If you want that comfortable experience and don’t mind a tank heating system, read on for our full thoughts on the Toto Washlet C2. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Alpha JX **bidet** seat was the best overall **bidet** seat we tested, featuring the most desirable technologies at the lowest price. However, while the Alpha JX ended up on top, the race between it and our runner-up, the Toto Washlet C2, was incredibly close. Both have plenty of features you expect in a **bidet** at this price range, including a heated seat, dryer, full control of the stream’s pressure and direction, plus warm water. However, the Alpha JX has an unlimited warm water supply compared to the Toto’s limited one, which is what ended up pushing the Alpha into our winning spot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After you turn on the water, check for leaks and that everything is working correctly. If installing a **bidet** **toilet** seems like a bit too much work, you can always hire a professional plumber to install the **bidet** for you. This is definitely the easiest way to get your new bathroom fixture up and running. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are two types of standalone **bidet**s: wall-mounted and floor-mounted. For wall-mounted **bidet**s, you’ll need to cut into the wall of the bathroom, install a bracket, and run all of the plumbing (water supply hose and drain) through that bracket. The **bidet** mounting holes will then fit onto the mounting bolts protruding from the mounting plate (bracket). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Learning how to install a **bidet** is actually quite easy, requiring no special skills at all. These seats are designed for “Do It Yourself” (DIY) installation. Each owner’s manual comes with clear and simple instructions for you to follow. In addition, we’ve prepared a How to Install a Bidet video below to facilitate your learning. See for yourself how easy **bidet** installation is – you’ll be up and running sooner than you think. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. And finally, measure the distance from the centre of the bolt holes to the **toilet** cistern/wall to ensure there is sufficient clearance. The **toilet** **bidet** will need at least 38mm of clearance behind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want predictable, adjustable heating and more control over the stream, you’ll have to upgrade to an electric **bidet** seat. Electric **bidet** seats definitely cost more, but for the investment you get a big upgrade in experience. The streams are gentler and more effective, the water actually gets warm and you get other technologies like a heated seat and — our favorite feature — the dryer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Every **bidet** **toilet** seat should come with instructions on how to correctly attach that model to your **toilet**, but most are similar. First, you will line up the mounting plate with the bolts that were there before, and then attach the plate with the bolts. Then you will slide the seat onto the mounting plate, making sure it is in place. You will know it is connected properly when you hear a click. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re one of the many adopting a **bidet** for the first time, it can be a confusing and intimidating process to find the right one. That’s why we spent more than three months meticulously testing 19 of the most popular **bidet**s on the market to find the very best. Here are four we love. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Portable **bidet**s give you the flexibility to carry them anywhere. You can simply pack them in your backpack and leave for a tour. They are also one of the cheapest options available in the market. But, of course, you need to give up the technical facilities that you would get with other types. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Installing a standalone **bidet** is a lot more involved than the attachment **bidet**s that can be used with an existing fixture. The first thing you have to realize is that **bidet**s are intended to be separate from traditional **toilet**s. There are some **bidet**s that handle all of your bathroom business, so make sure you know what model you’re buying and its capabilities. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you connect to the water line and line up the drain, you should be able to put it in place. Floor-mounted models are a little bit easier to install because you won’t need to worry about the bracket (although the bolt holes on the **bidet** will still need to match the bolts from the floor). You’ll still need to rough in plumbing and then repair any drywall or tile that was disturbed during installation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, turn your water shutoff valve back on, and make sure there are no leaks anywhere in the system. If everything looks good, start testing the **bidet** to make sure it’s working properly. Yes, it will shoot out water, so you may want a bucket handy to catch it. Finding just the right way to use your new **bidet** may take a little practice and some minor adjustments along the way, but now you’re ready. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Begin by shutting off the water supply to your **toilet**. The shut-off valve is usually located behind the **toilet** or in the basement. Flush the **toilet** to empty the tank and remove any water that may be left inside. Unscrew the hose from the back of the **toilet** tank and disconnect it from the water supply line. Follow the instructions that came with your **bidet** attachment to attach it to the **toilet**, including how to connect the water supply. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Getting the superior spray of the Toto **bidet**s paired with endless warm water results in a truly luxurious wash. Plus, the K300 has all the extra fancy features of the C2 and C5, including an automatic pre-mist and deodorizer, along with the same remote as the C5. In addition to more convenient control, this remote gives you the ability to set user presets. So when you find your perfect seat temperature, water temperature and dry temperature, on top of your preferred pressure and position, you can save it to one of two presets so you can quickly access the perfect wash at the press of a button. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Handheld **bidet** sprays are a cheaper and more flexible alternative to traditional **bidet** seats. People with flexibility issues can get widely benefited from these **bidet**s. More than that, installing a handheld spray is more accessible and follows almost similar steps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With the floor and wall finishes completed and the stop valves installed on the rough plumbing supplies, you can begin to actually install the **bidet** now. The location of a wall-mounted unit is determined by the previously installed bolts. Floor-mounted units are affixed using hanger bolts, which have a lag thread on one end and a machine thread on the other. Locate and predrill the holes for these bolts using a template (if one is supplied) or by positioning the **bidet** so its drain hole aligns with the trap and waste pipe in the floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **bidet**s fit well with two-piece **toilet**s. The main reason is that two-piece **toilet**s have separate tanks and basins. They are put together in such a way that the basin sits in the front, whereas the tank sits on the back. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you’re done with your wash, the dryer on the Toto C2 — just like its spray — is best in class. It felt the most comfortable, with a wide, even dry that really helped us cut back on **toilet** paper use. Plus, you can adjust the dryer over three heat settings to find what’s most comfortable for you. It was superior to the drying experience of the Alpha JX (which did the job but took longer). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Bidetmega 150’s spray wasn’t nearly as comfortable as the Toto’s or the Alpha JX’s, and the dryer wasn’t as effective as either of our picks either. Plus, installing the Coway **bidet**s was by far the hardest out of all the options we tested. The T-valve you use to connect your **bidet** to your bathroom’s water line is divided into parts, meaning you have to find the properly sized adapters to attach the **bidet**. It adds an extra, confusing step and also gives the connection more points where it could leak. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for a low-cost **bidet** that’s simple to set up, effective and not overly complicated, the Tushy Classic 3.0 is definitely the **bidet** for you. While working on this story, we actually tested the Tushy Spa, not the Classic. (We’ve used the Tushy Classic in the past, but we didn’t officially test it again for this story.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Home **bidet** attachments are smarter than ever, and a great way to save on **toilet** paper while reaching whole new levels of clean. But one thing that keeps people from upgrading to a **bidet** is that they aren’t sure if they can install it or not. Yes, at first glance it may look like a big project, but fear not. These **bidet** attachments are designed to be installed by homeowners with just a few simple steps, and we’ll go over everything you may need to get the project done fast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your sink is right next to your **toilet**, this is a relatively easy task. You will need to drill a small hole in the corner of your sink cabinet to route the hot water line through. Then follow the same procedures for turning off water and attaching the necessary valves for adding hot water (a flashlight for under-sink work is helpful here). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Coway Bidetmega 400 had a similarly frustrating installation process as the cheaper Coway **bidet**s. The Bidetmega 400 has more features than the 150 and 200, however, its spray wasn’t as comfortable or effective as other top contenders, even though it automatically goes through a four-stage washing cycle unique to Coway **bidet**s. It’s a nice luxury **bidet**, but if you’re willing to spend a little more we think you’ll be better served by a Toto or the Bio Bidet Bliss BB-2000. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Brondell Swash 300 is the lowest-priced electric **bidet** seat we recommend. It’s a barebones model compared with the C5, but with its six options for water pressure, water temperature, and seat temperature, you should be able to adjust the Swash 300 to your preferences. This model can’t adjust its spray position like the C5, and it takes a few seconds longer to warm the water. It also lacks an air dryer and other frills. But the Swash 300 does have a remote, an unusually nice feature for a **bidet** at this price, and we think it’s a good deal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is also because two-piece **toilet**s have a very predictable design. There are high chances that most of your bathrooms also have a two-piece **toilet**. Thanks to their popularity, one can easily understand the structure and predict the spot to install the **bidet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bidet **toilet** seats are designed for DIY (“Do it Yourself”) installation, and any able-bodied person can do it. More than 90% of our customers install their **bidet** seats themselves. It’s really easy to do, and we’ll walk you through how to install a **bidet** **toilet** seat it in this article. Installation time should take about 20 minutes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You will find two types of electric **bidet**s - Electric **bidet** **toilet** seat and electric **bidet** combo. Electric **bidet** **toilet** seats are for the **toilet**s that do not come with a **bidet** option. So, you manually set the **toilet** seat over the **toilet**. Electric seats are helpful for people with mobility issues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The spray on the Brondell Swash DS275 wasn’t as good as that on the Toto Washlets. And similar to the other Brondell **bidet**s, we didn’t think the dryer was as effective as the Toto’s. It does come with a massage function and a deodorizer, but we think the oscillation of the Toto C2 and Alpha JX do the job better, and if you want a deodorizer, go with a Toto. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your **bidet** is designed to fit against the **toilet** bowl, underneath your seat. Set up the **bidet** where your **toilet** bolts were, over the holes in the bowl. Many **bidet**s will have adjustments you can make to help it line up correctly with your **toilet** bowl so you can access both holes. Make sure the **bidet** is well centered in the **toilet** bowl and pushed back as far as it can go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hence, it is pretty clear how the world is accepting **bidet**s wholeheartedly. Even though **bidet**s are not as popular in America and Australia as in Europe or Asia, people are becoming more health-conscious. We hope that this article was helpful and provided you with sufficient information. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A T-valve should be included in your **bidet** kit whether you are installing a seat or a handheld sprayer. To attach the T-valve, detach the water supply hose and replace it with the T-valve. There still might be some water left in the hose, so if you don’t want a mess you might want to lay down a towel or bucket before completing this step. After attaching the T-valve, screw the water supply hose onto the bottom of the T-valve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What makes our **bidet** seats so easy to install is that no additional plumbing is required. The **bidet** taps into the existing cold water supply behind your **toilet** and since there’s a water heater inside the **bidet** seat, a separate hot water line is unnecessary. Separate drainage isn’t needed either because everything just drains in to the **toilet**, and flush – it all goes down your existing drain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many types of **bidet**s available in the market. You usually choose one according to the **toilet** type that you have in your bathroom. For example, if you travel often and you want to be "super hygienic," you should get a portable or travel **bidet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are two main options for **bidet**s that attach to an existing **toilet**: a **bidet** **toilet** seat and a handheld **bidet** sprayer. When polled, over 82% of **bidet** users said they prefer a **bidet** seat to a handheld **bidet** sprayer. Both have pros and cons that are important to understand so you can pick the one that best suits the needs of you and your family. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most one-piece **toilet**s have the fill-in valve in view. Even if that is hard to reach, you can mostly find an alternative way to do so. But, the problem is when there is less space between the wall and the valve. If the **toilet** has a flat back, this problem would be more visible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re interested in adding a **bidet** to your bathroom, there are a few things you need to know before you get started. In this blog post, we’ll cover everything you need to know about **bidet**s, from how to install one to how to use it. Keep reading to learn more! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want an electric **bidet** seat, next you’ll have to measure your bowl to see if it’s elongated or round. Most come in varieties to fit both, so you’ll want to ensure the **bidet** you purchase fits correctly. To see which measurements are which, check out this compatibility guide from BidetKing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Brondell Swash 1400 and Omigo Luxury Bidet seemed to be the exact same **bidet** seat with different branding. The Swash 1400 didn’t have the most comfortable stream, and its dryer felt like it was only hitting half of the area it needed to. If you’re going to spend this much money on a **bidet**, we’d recommend the Toto K300 or the Bio Bidet Bliss BB-2000. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may always find **bidet**s in Asian or European countries. But, finding **bidet**s in hotels or other places can be a task when it comes to countries like the United States. So, if you want to maintain your hygiene, you can always buy a portable **bidet** in Australia. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Instead of a remote like the Alpha JX, the Toto C2’s controls are mounted on a sidearm. If you want a remote for the extra convenience, or you’re worried a **bidet** with an arm won’t fit in your bathroom, the Toto Washlet C5 is basically the same as the C2 but features a remote and added user profiles for about $50 more. However, we actually liked the sidearm better because unlike on the remote, all the buttons are labeled, so there’s no need to decipher and memorize symbols, which means it’s simple to use even if you’ve never sat on a **bidet** before. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, attach the water supply line to the bottom of the t-valve, and your new **bidet** water line to the side of the t-valve. Again, pipe sealant may help here. When finished, attach the other end of your **bidet** water line to the **bidet** itself so that everything is now connected. Make any necessary adjustments for the fit and positioning of the **bidet** at this time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since it runs using electricity, you won't have to put much effort. Remember that **bidet**s are not sterilisation tools; neither would you want them to be. You use a **bidet** to remove hard particles from your undercarriage. Electric **bidet**s are super easy to use and more convenient than other types. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another difference between installing a **bidet** and installing a **toilet** is the size and configuration of the waste line. Toilets have internal traps to prevent sewer gases from escaping into occupied spaces. Bidets don’t, and a trap must be installed in the rough plumbing below the floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since there is no tank, you do not get a chance to attach the t-connector to the fill-in valve. That creates the problem. The only way out is to conduct alternative methods. You will need special gears to install **bidet**s on tankless **toilet**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Make sure all connections are tight. Open the water supply by turning the knob in a counter-clockwise motion, and check for leaks. That’s it! You’ve just finished installation and are all set to start enjoying your new **bidet**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your **toilet** should also have a water supply hose connection from the base of your tank to your home’s water supply. With the water turned off and drained, this hose is safe to remove from your **toilet**, so unscrew and detach it. Again, older **toilet**s may require some lubricant and effort at this point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To install the mounting bracket, place it over the two mounting holes behind the bowl. Next, insert the rectangular guide rails (these guide rails hold the bolts in place) on the left and right sides of the bracket. Then, drop the bolts thru the guide rails and thru your **toilet**’s mounting holes. Secure the bolts by fastening nuts underneath. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your **bidet** should have a t-valve, a small attachment that you can now screw on to the base of the tank. This t-valve simply enables the water supply line to supply water to the **bidet** as well as the **toilet** tank. A dab of pipe sealant at this point can help if the valve doesn’t seem to be attached very well. You can also use plumbers tape or plumbers putty if you need to create a better seal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some **bidet**s use heated water. If you don’t want to be splashed with cold water, you can opt for a heated version. However, this often requires an additional attachment where you hook up a hot water line to the hot water supply at your sink. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Clean the rims thoroughly. Use a scrubbing brush to do so. You can also use **toilet** cleaners for a better result. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Are one-piece **toilet**s **bidet**-friendly? Yes, most conventional one-piece **toilet**s are **bidet**-friendly. We may call it semi **bidet**-friendly as It has a single unit with only the bowl and basin. The tank is directly attached to the mainframe. However, even after this, you can still install a **bidet** on one-piece **toilet**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many modern **toilet**s feature hoses to install a **bidet**. However, many may not, as well. So, naturally, the question arises, "Can you install a **bidet** on any **toilet**?" We'll answer this question and many others in this post. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Toto Washlet C2’s stream is really its main selling point. It was the most comfortable out of all the **bidet**s we tested, with a thick, aerated spray that gave us the best cleaning experience. The oscillation function on the Toto was a great way to get a fuller, more thorough clean, and it also features a front wash and pulsating feature, although we didn’t find the pulsing function to add much to the experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wall-mounted bides are trickier to install than floor-mounted models. Some wall-mounted units have special hardware that threads onto the bolts before the **bidet** is mounted, while others simply use nuts and washers. In either case, you’ll be supporting the **bidet** from above while securing the mounting bolts by feel from below. As you’re placing the **bidet** on the bolts, the drain must be aligned with that in the rough plumbing, and everything is pushed home at once. A helper can make a difference here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you have the **bidet** seat installed it will give you all the features of a traditional **bidet** at a fraction of the cost. A **bidet** seat uses your existing plumbing, so there is no need to tear apart your bathroom. One of my favorite lines of **bidet**s for easy install and great features, including the Vortex spray, is the Bio-Bidet line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bidet seats have separate water supply hoses. You will need to attach the **bidet** supply hose onto the other end of the T-valve and the connection on the **bidet** seat. You can now skip to step 11 below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you have already decided to install a **bidet** in your bathroom, you should know how to do it well. In most cases, you don't need to hire a professional. Most traditional **toilet**s come with a decent design that lets you install any type of **bidet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Out of the attachments, the Tushy Classic 3.0 had the most comfortable stream by far, and its adjustable nozzle made it much easier than others to get a thorough clean. While it’s a bare-bones **bidet**, you still get a solid range of pressure and directional adjustability so you can find what feels right for you. With attachments in general, we found ourselves using low pressures, as their streams felt more aggressive than their electric counterparts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In most cases, **toilet** **bidet** attachments offer DIY installation solutions. These cost you $0 and maybe 15 minutes of your time. However, in rare cases, you may need help from a professional, like a plumber or electrician. In that case, the price may increase, depending on the kind of help you need. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since a **toilet** only has a cold water supply, to get warm water with a simple attachment like the Tushy, you have to hook it up to your sink’s hot water supply. There’s no internal heater, so your water temperature is completely dependent on how quickly your sink’s water gets hot, and even then you still have to flush out the water that’s been sitting in the hose before you get a warm wash. For that reason, we recommend you get the Tushy Classic over the Tushy Spa and avoid attachments altogether if you want to use warm water. If you do prefer a heated wash, we suggest you upgrade to a full **bidet** seat, like one of our picks, the Alpha JX or Toto Washlet C2. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many **toilet**s do not come with a **bidet** option. If your bathroom is old enough and you didn't know anything such as a **bidet** existed, you will have to put in additional effort into it. You can, however, install a **bidet** attachment easily on most **toilet**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Connect the Bidet Toilet Seat to the Water Supply With the **bidet** **toilet** seat safely secured to the **toilet**, you can go ahead and attach the water supply hose from the **bidet** **toilet** seat to the open end of the T-valve. Also, make sure that the other end of the **bidet** water supply hose is properly connected to the **bidet** **toilet** seat. Double-check all of the connections and tighten them with your channel locks if necessary. Keep the bucket and towel in place to make sure that there won't be a huge mess if there are any leaks when you turn the water on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Toilet papers don't always do a good job when it comes to wiping your butt. So, even though the concept of **bidet** originated in Europe, it has taken over in Western countries. If you decide to get a **bidet** for your home, you will often find yourself at a crossroads. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, mount the **bidet** seat on the catch plate or the mounting plate. Adjust it accordingly. You can always remove the **bidet** seat from the mounting plate later. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1. Removing your existing **toilet** seat – If you close your seat and lid, you’ll notice there are two caps there right behind the seat. These caps cover your **toilet**’s mounting holes, where bolts are inserted to secure the seat to the **toilet**. Using a flathead screwdriver, flip these caps open to reveal the bolt heads underneath. Then unscrew the bolts with your screwdriver. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before installing a **bidet**. You need to empty the tank properly. If it is a tankless model, you can just shut off the water supply valve to stop the water flow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the **bidet** is in addition to a **toilet**, you’ll need to choose a spot in the bathroom where it will fit. They will need roughly the same amount of space as your standard **toilet**, around 30 inches wide and four-feet deep. You’ll also need to consider where the water line is located in your bathroom because the **bidet** hose will need to tie into the system. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **bidet** is a bathroom fixture that is designed for cleansing the body after using the **toilet**. Bidets are becoming increasingly popular in the United States, as they offer a more hygienic way to cleanse than **toilet** paper alone. When it comes to how to install a **bidet**, there are a few different ways, including attaching it to your existing **toilet** or installing a standalone unit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using the **toilet** seat **bidet**-**toilet** is very easy. Lift the mixer lever, adjust the temperature and the water jet. The natural fall of water offers a sensitive and an accurate hygiene due to the possibility of guiding the water jet by moving the water dispenser to reach every and each part of your genitals including washing your feet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At the back of your **toilet** seat, you’ll see it’s attached to the **toilet** bowl with two large bolts — many **toilet**s require you to lift up protective flaps to expose these bolts. They can come in a variety of sizes, may be made out of metal or plastic, and generally vary based on the **toilet** seat. Using your wrench or screwdriver (whichever fits the bolts on your seat), unscrew the **toilet** seat and remove it entirely. For older **toilet**s that may have experienced some corrosion, this can require extra work, a good pair of pliers, and a lubricating spray. However, it’s usually an easy task. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A lot of countries in the world use water to wash their undercarriage. It is more hygienic, environment-friendly, and budget-friendly. The USA has seen a huge market for **bidet**s recently. According to a recent study, the global market size for **bidet**s would soon become $2.51 Billion by 2026. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, you need to determine which kind of **toilet** you have or plan to buy. Different **bidet**s go well with different **toilet**s. For example, tankless **toilet**s suit handheld **bidet**s more. Determining the **toilet** type will help you buy the best **bidet** **toilet** seat or **bidet** attachment for your **toilet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, electric **bidet** seats vary a lot in price due to the wide range of features and technologies available. Typically, tankless units (that use a coil heater to provide unlimited hot water) are more expensive than those that use a reserve tank to store enough hot water for a single use. Most **bidet**s with endless hot water will cost you somewhere around $600, though our top pick, the Alpha JX, comes in a couple of hundred dollars cheaper, making it a great buy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want a luxury **bidet** but can’t find the Toto K300, we’d pick the Bio Bidet BB-2000 Bliss. It didn’t perform quite as well as the Toto K300, but it has a very comfortable spray and dryer, and its massage function was our favorite stream pattern out of all the **bidet**s we tested. The remote is more complicated than the Toto’s, so it takes a while to learn what all the symbols mean and what they do. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first step is to get everything you need for the project. Obviously, you should have your **bidet** out of the box and ready to go, and about an hour or so of time to work on the project (some **bidet**s take significantly less time, and others may take more). Other important supplies include: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you decide what kind of **bidet** you want, the next step is to remove the existing **toilet** seat. A **toilet** seat is normally attached to the rim with large bolts that often have plastic covers over them. You will need to pop those off and remove the bolts with a screwdriver. After this, you should be able to take the seat off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Electric **bidet** seats with a good dryer are a great purchase because not only do they give you a better experience on the **toilet**, but if you use the dryer after your wash, you end up using less **toilet** paper, which is great both for the earth and your wallet. We were expecting to use less **toilet** paper with all the **bidet**s we tested but quickly found that **bidet** attachments leave you needing to pat dry, which often takes just as much **toilet** paper as you’d normally use. For that reason, if cutting back on **toilet** paper is a big motivation for your **bidet** purchase, we’d definitely recommend getting one with a dryer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because it is attached to the side of the **toilet**, handheld sprayers aren’t as aesthetically pleasing as the seat and can also clutter the bathroom with the hose. However, handheld sprayers are less expensive, with most of them costing less than $100. You can also hook up your handheld **bidet** sprayer to the bathroom sink so you can have hot water without paying more or running a hot water line to the **toilet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These are most like the traditional **bidet**s that you can find in many European homes. Ceramic **bidet**s are also popular as standalone **bidet**s because they sit separately from the **toilet**. They often hang from the wall, making it look more like a urinal. Therefore, people without a **bidet** culture often mistake it for one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before moving on, you must shut off the water supply to the **toilet**. The shut-off valve should be located behind your **toilet** near the base and is turned off by rotating it clockwise. Once the water is shut off, you will need to drain the rest of the water in your **toilet** by flushing it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The only real setback of the K300 is that it only comes in an elongated shape, which means if you have a round **toilet**, you’re out of luck. If you do have a round **toilet** and still want a luxurious **bidet**, we loved the Bio Bidet Bliss BB-2000, which is available in round shapes. The BB-2000 had the second-most-comfortable spray experience, and on top of the oscillation stream you’ll find on many **bidet** seats, it had a fantastic massage function that was our favorite spray pattern of any **bidet** we tested. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With decades of experience, Meticulous Plumbing can help you with your **bidet** installation as well as many other plumbing services. If you’re interested in **bidet**, give us a call and we will come out and see if it’s a possibility in your current bathroom. We look forward to working with you! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tankless **toilet**s or flushometers are demanding games to win when installing a **bidet**. It is primarily because the **toilet**s do not feature a tank. The building must have substantial plumbing that directly supplies water into the basin. Hence, you cannot really access water unless you flush and see it swirling inside the bowl. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **bidet** **toilet** seat is a great option if you don’t want to install a new plumbing line for a stand-alone **bidet**. You can get an attachment for your **toilet** seat or buy a seat that has a **bidet** already. Bidet **toilet** seats do all the cleaning for you which could be more convenient. The **toilet** seats are a little expensive though, with most of them costing between $150-$500 and the most expensive ones being over $2,000. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **bidet** requires as much space as a **toilet**, a minimum of 30 inches in width, and considering the room in front of the fixture, nearly 4 feet in depth. Free-standing **bidet**s (as opposed to **bidet**-seats that mount on a regular **toilet**) come in two configurations: Wall-mounted or floor-mounted. Many of the installation details are the same. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Tushy Classic 3.0 is a fantastic **bidet** for beginners and a great value at just under $100. No other **bidet** attachment was as comfortable to use as the Tushy, and it has a gentle yet effective stream, simple installation and easy-to-use controls along with adjustable pressure and direction. However, if you want more features such as warm water, a heated seat or a dryer, then you’ll have to shell out some more cash — but trust us, it’s worth it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, you can. However, it is not as simple as it seems. Some **toilet**s can be tricky to mount a **bidet**, while others can easily incorporate it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the biggest advantages of having a two-piece **toilet** is that you can quickly locate the fill-in valve. The fill-in valve is the shank inlet for incoming water. Most **bidet**s need to be connected with the valve where some water can be rerouted into the **bidet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Tushy Classic was also relatively easy to install, and the clear instructions are simple to follow, even if you’re not particularly handy. However, when installing any **bidet**, the most important aspect is making sure it’s compatible with your **toilet**. You should also find the water connections and try taking off your **toilet** seat beforehand so you know how everything works. Luckily, the Tushy Classic fits all two-piece **toilet**s and most one-piece **toilet**s (more on this below). If you’re still not sure if the Tushy will fit your specific **toilet**, you can check out more about Tushy’s compatibility here and even browse through its searchable list of **toilet**s here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you have installed your **bidet** seat or handheld sprayer, you will want to ensure that the seal is as tight as possible so you won’t experience leaks. You do this by drying off the **toilet** so that it is dry to the touch. Then, lay down newspapers and towels, leaving them there with the water on for at least an hour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
