## 7 Shocking Facts About How To Turn Off Water Supply To Shower In Apartment | Why Is There No Shut Off Valve For Shower
-   When a home’s **water** supply system leaks or a repair to one of the plumbing fixtures is needed, you’ll have to shut off the **water**. It’s best to do this at the valve that’s closest to the problem. That way, the rest of the house will still have a functioning **water** supply. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Look for two chrome-plated or plastic stop valves under the sink, usually at the back of the cabinet. These are connected to the **water** supply tubes that serve the faucet—one for cold, and the other for hot. The cold is usually on the right-hand side. To shut off a single-handle faucet, you will need to turn off both. Turn the valves clockwise to turn them off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A toilet just has a single cold-**water** valve, called a “stop valve.” Locate the “stop valve” and shut it off by turning the handle clockwise, just like the standard valves on a faucet discussed above. If the valve is too difficult to turn by hand, try wearing a work glove, or grip the handle with a pair of slip-joint pliers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For homes with fire sprinklers and an inside main **water** meter, locate and operate the second valve (it will be above the main meter and past (downstream of) the fire sprinkler system “tee”). If you have a submeter, its second valve will only isolate the irrigation and/or hose bibbs. For homes with fire sprinklers and an outside main **water** meter, locate and operate the second valve, it will be past (downstream of) the fire sprinkler “tee.” For homes without fire sprinklers and with an inside main **water** meter, either valve will shut off supply to the home, but operating the second valve is a good practice and a safeguard if you are not sure if your home has fire sprinklers. For homes without fire sprinklers and with an outside main **water** meter, you likely have only one shut-off valve that will shut down the entire home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To shut off a **water** heater, turn off the cold **water** valve above the **water** heater. This may be a lever or a regular circular-handle valve. If it is a lever, pull it 90 degrees from its open position. If it is a circular valve, turn it clockwise until it is closed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Basements – the shut-off valve is typically located near the front foundation wall. The main **water** may come through the concrete floor or through the wall. The valve is typically within three to five feet of where the main **water** enters. In some cases, the main **water** may enter in a different area, like a mechanical room, up through the floor, near the **water** heater or furnace. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Every home was required to have a main **water** shut-off valve installed inside the home when it was built. For most emergencies or repairs, shutting off the proper inside valve is all you will need to do. However, there are also underground shut-off valves installed outside at the property line. If it's necessary to shut off this valve, please call a registered master plumber or WSSC Water at 301-206-4003 to work this valve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
