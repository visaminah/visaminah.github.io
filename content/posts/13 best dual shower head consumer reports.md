## 13 Interesting Facts Best Dual Shower Head Consumer Reports | Best Dual Shower Heads 2022
-   Users are spoilt for choice with the six jet modes offered by this Waterpik Technologies handheld **shower** head, whose variations on a theme range from a misting to a full body massage and twin spray – ooer. With the maximum flow rate of two gallons per minute, and what Waterpik call 'advanced optiFLOW technology', it’s meant to provide up to 30 per cent more water force than your average **shower** head, making it a good bet for those who like a really strong spray. Plus, users report it’s simple to set up, so you should be enjoying a proper power **shower** in no time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're looking for a new **shower** head to enjoy several settings, then consider how many you'd realistically like and use. There's no point having six modes if you know you'll only ever use two. Think about what you will use these modes for. Those with children might want to ensure their new **shower** head offers a mist mode for light pressure, or anyone with pets might want a jet mode to tackle muddy paws. Our top pick has six settings, which is the most on offer out of the options we've featured. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When investing in a high pressure **shower** head, you need to think about where and how it is being installed. Some options are standalone, which means they sit on your current **shower** setup, and you can pop them on a stand or use them as a handheld **shower** head. These are also usually super easy to fit as it's just a case of unscrewing your old head and screwing on the new one. Other **shower** heads, wall-mounted ones, need to be attached directly to the **shower** hose which might prove to be a bit trickier depending on your knowledge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, that's part of the high pressure **shower** head's charm. A little confusingly, these can be called high pressure **shower** heads or a low pressure **shower** heads, as they both do the same thing. Suited to homes with low water pressure (hence the name), they push the water out at high pressure, compensating for the low water pressure in your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Investing in a new **shower** head won't just improve your water flow, but it will also make your entire **shower** experience better. How come? More often than not, high pressure **shower** heads offer a range of modes for you to decide between when you are **shower**ing, so that you can enjoy rainfall mode to wake you up in the morning, or a light mist to help you wind down for bed. This also ensures your **shower** is suitable for everyone, from yourself to your kids and even pets who loathe **shower** time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Depending on where you're based, the hardness of the water varies. Some models might struggle with harder water, however, there are some choices that are well equipped. For this reason, it is worth checking how the water in your region compares to others before buying a **shower** head. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **shower**head promises to combine high-pressure and a luxury rainfall feel, and has rave reviews as a testament to its power. Using anti-clogging silicone jets allow this **shower**head to push water out faster and extremely efficiently so that you should be using less water as you rinse. Rather than lots of wall mounted models, this **shower** head is also very easy to adjust from left to right, so you can get the perfect angle too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are hundreds of fans of this Aqua Elegante ready to tell you just how it can transform your **shower**, with reviewers saying it changed their water pressure instantly. Crafted with materials that are meant to last, this **shower**head is an investment into having a better experience way into the future. Available in a range of finishes (meaning you can escape from chrome if you need to!), this **shower** head also has anti-clog features that will suit areas with hard water too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You might also find that water flow improves based on how high or low your **shower** is sitting on your wall. This isn't applicable to wall-mounted **shower** heads as these can be a pain to move, but standalone options might perform better placed higher towards your ceiling. Give it a try! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Users are positively evangelical about this **shower** head, with some even going so far as to say that having it was 'a whole new **shower** experience'. With a simple choice between high or low pressure, it doesn’t boast the most modes of any **shower** head on our list, but all **reports** say it does the basics brilliantly. Reviewers were left really impressed (and squeaky clean) by the **shower** head’s efforts, and found it really easy to set up, although it’s worth noting that many recommended having some Teflon pipe tape on hand for the job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you already have a high pressure system and want to channel it through your **shower** head, this is your guy. Users loved the robust output of the three jet settings, and how easy it was to change between them – even mid-**shower** – with the select button. The rotating massage jets of the interestingly named 'CaresseAir' mode got an especially warm reception from users, but the ability to not only choose between focused jets and an all-over rain effect, but to mix the two together, is inspired. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Showering in the dark might seem like a recipe for disaster, but you’ll be tempted when you see this **shower** head’s party trick. With built-in LED lights powered by the running water, it puts on a battery-less light show, fading gradually between seven vibrant colors every few seconds for a multi-sensory spa-like experience in your very own **shower**. The four spray settings number among them rain, massage, a rain-massage mix, and an eco-friendly water-saving mode, so depending on what mood you’re in you can go for stimulating, relaxing, or even planet-saving. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We're currently working to have hands-on experience with these high pressure **shower** heads. With this in mind, we've had to give them out to the team, so that everyone can have their go at testing and comparing these **shower** heads, mostly because we find it would be biased to test on only one **shower** and type of water pressure.
