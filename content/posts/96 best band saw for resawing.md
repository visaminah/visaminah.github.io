## 96 Shocking Facts About Best Band Saw For Resawing | Bandsaw Resaw Capacity
-   A sharp blade - only expect a few hours use (as low as 1-2, never more than about 5 hours) from a normal steel blade, and normal blades are generally not worth sharpening. A carbide tip blade is a good investment if you will be using it a lot, and have a **saw** that can provide good tension and alignment. Some carbide blades can be sharpened, but I have had reason to replace carbide blades before they need to be sharpened. On one forum, a user told about a place that sharpened carbide band**saw** blades at a modest cost, but admitted that they didn't cut as well as new after sharpening - sorry, no sale. The "good-as-new" sharpening services are close enough to the price of a new blade that I haven't bothered. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The SKIL 3386-01 is powered by a 2.5A motor that operates at 120 volts and provides an adequate amount of power that is required with little effort to achieve multiple smooth cuts. In addition, the **saw** has a neck capacity of 9 inches and can be easily mounted on a worktop or used with a stand for better stability. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3386-01 is excellent in primary use. You get a powerful, highly competent band **saw**, which is a minor league version of its bigger brothers, without sacrificing essential features and functions as well as a few extras. If you want a smaller band **saw**, you should buy the best portable band **saw**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Laguna Tools has been producing superior tools for the woodworking and carpentry industry for over thirty years. Its products combine efficiency, precision, and durability. Its line of band **saw**s is available with carbide-tipped blades and dust collection systems to make any job a breeze. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The JET JWBS-14DXPRO is the best band**saw** for **re**saw**ing** and is explicitly used for woodworking. Okay, that doesn’t mean it can’t compete with other products as the manufacturer doesn’t recommend it. Therefore, it is best to stick to cutting wood only to get as many positive results as possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a new **saw** cut, the sheet pressure is slightly higher than required to eliminate the wiggle. Upon working the unit, release the tension on the blade before it begins to spin or flutter. Give it tension in tiny steps and keep the band**saw** going until the wiggle is gone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although the WEN 3962T 3.5-Amph 10-Inch Band Saw is capable of cutting up to 10 inches of wood, its reduced power may impede the working process for some users. Therefore, professional woodworkers may want to consider other options. This band **saw** also has some shortcomings and is not safe for first-timers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Band **saw**s come in many styles and can be used for various tasks, including woodworking, metalworking, crafts, scrollwork, and even scroll **saw**ing. The next thing you’ll want is a base for the **saw**. The base will be either an open base, floor-mounted, or a panel base. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The blade width is critical for the **re**saw**ing** operation. You can still see with a sheet of 1/4, but it will show dull effects and significantly hover. The wider the blade is, the more potent it is. Look for the widest blade which suits your device on a 14-inch band **saw**, usually a 3/4 inch or an inch on some models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With this Laguna band **saw**, you would get special functions, and many people say it’s a good idea to invest in this machine. The 3/4 HP engine works well even under stressful conditions. The steel frame and a robust cast iron table ensure durability, reliability, and stability. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For **re**saw**ing** wood, you should consider a 14-inch band **saw**. This **saw** will fit your needs perfectly. Its capacity is over 13 inches and its motor is rated at 1.75HP, making it a powerful **saw**. It is also pre-wired to run on 115-volt power. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The WEN 3962T’s features include a flexible work light, a 3-in-1 dust port, and a miter gauge for cutting angled materials. This band **saw** also has ball bearings to provide smooth blade operation and long life. It also comes with a stand that is easy to assemble. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Grizzly Industrial G0555X-H band **saw** for **re**saw**ing** is ideal for a variety of applications, including **re**saw**ing**. Its 12-inch cutting capacity is perfect for **re**saw**ing** a variety of materials. The band **saw** has an aluminum fence that is easily removable and adjustable, and it comes with cast-iron wheels for sturdiness and stability. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another use of a band**saw** is for rough cutting thick wood such as bowl blanks. A powerful **saw** with a sturdy, tilting table is a great help, but more important is a special blade. The blanks are often cut in green wood, so a thicker blade, with an even wider kerf, is required to keep the wet **saw**dust cleared. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A tall stable fence to keep the wood steady (Be sure your work piece is flat and smooth, so it rides well against the table and fence). The "point" fences (a vertical bar aligned with the tip of the teeth) allows you to follow a line on the edge of the board if your **saw** wanders, but the quality of the cut depends entirely on operator skill, compensating for the **saw**. A well-tuned **saw** allows you to use a flat fence, and cut thinner, smoother pieces. The accuracy of your cuts with the point fence is determined by the operator, the accuracy of your cuts with a flat fence depends on a well tuned **saw**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The size of the throat is the spacing between the blade and base. The calculation is also a fast reference to a band **saw**’s size classification. A 14 “band **saw**” between the **saw** blade, and the column would have a cutting power of almost 14. The **saw**ing power is the distance from the table **saw** on the band to the highest point of the blade guide assembly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It would be best if you used a specially made blade to get successful cuts. First, seek to find a blade with three or four dents per inch (TPI). Often, 5 or 10 rates of the teeth must have a positive hook configuration. This type of **saw** blade contains a great throat between the teeth to clean the waste effectively—the teeth are hooked in to cut quicker. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Honestly, this band**saw** exceeds our expectations. It features a powerful 3 amp motor, enabling it to deliver efficient wood cutting results. Also, the heat dissipation system helps in extending its longevity. That being said, it creates less vibration than most options on this list. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are quite a lot of things that we really liked about the WEN 3935 bench-top band**saw**. For starters, it features a spacious 12-1/4″ x 11-7/8″ workspace, allowing you to slice wood with ease. The powerful 2.5 amp motor offers a blade rotation of 2,500 feet per minute, making the wood cutting process extremely efficient. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   JET JWBS-14DXPRO is definitely the best band **saw** for **re**saw**ing** and is on the top for a high-end, professional cutting machine for wood, metal, and more. It has a two-speed V-belt drive mechanism with either 1.500 or 3.000 SFPM speeds. This two-stage speed feature allows for extra precision in your cutting and enables you to customize your approach based on your materials and project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The power needed depends upon the specifications for cutting. A 1 to 2 HP motor is usually adequate for general cutting of thinner material with minimal **re**saw**ing** with the band**saw**. Consider devices with a 2-1/2 to 3 HP motor if you intend to make your veneer by cutting more extensive exotic hardwood or cutting out bowl blanks from a tree trunk. Remember that motors with an output of 2 HP or higher typically need 220 V power. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is ample evidence of the Wen 3962 **saw**’s positive response to the market from searching hundreds of online user reviews. Most users love the versatility of two speeds and the work light, while others appreciate the powerful **saw** motor and cutting performance. There are many drawbacks that users have pointed out, but they weigh less than the advantages of this power tool. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Rikon BandSaw features an adjustable micro-guide post and a safety paddle switch. This will help prevent accidents and injuries when the **saw** is turned on accidentally. It also features a large blade tension knob that is easy to grip and turn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   SIze is one of the most important factors that you need to keep in mind before buying a band**saw**. Most band**saw**s are bench-top, whereas some come with stands. If you work in a shop with plenty of space, we suggest going with a floor-standing model as they can be set anywhere in the shop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Force is the pull of the spring - pounds. It is proportional to the amount the spring compresses until the spring's coil loops contact, so can be measured by the amount the end of the spring moves - the position of the end of the spring. This is what moves the band**saw** tension indicator. Some people change their band**saw** springs to get more tension, but be sure you don't increase it so far that you damage the frame. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now that we are almost near the end of our list, here is another band **saw** that you should consider. Allow us to introduce you to the Woodskil 3A 9-Inch band**saw**. Even though this brand is relatively newer, it manufactures efficient band**saw**s that you simply cannot ignore. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Skil 3386 9-Inch Band Saw offers a good balance of performance and features. It comes with a vivid LED work light, which provides you with a better view of the workpiece and cut line. It also has a 2.5-horsepower motor and six TPI **saw** blades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One use of a band**saw** is for cutting curves in relatively thin wood - sometimes called scroll work. Most any decent band**saw**, with a fairly narrow blade, will do a sufficient job. Of course, if you need to cut inside a "hole" or do very fine cuts with sharp turns, a real scroll **saw** works better, but is slower than a band**saw**, and doesn't handle thick wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   KERF- The width of the **saw** cut. The larger the kerf, the smaller the radius that can be cut. But the greater the amount of wood that the blade has to cut and the greater the horsepower that is needed, as the blade is doing more work. The greater the kerf, the larger the amount of wood that is being wasted by the cut. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Stress (not force) is the key factor in blade tension. A low tension blade typically runs around 7,000 psi stress. High tension blades often run as high as 25-30,000 psi. The force you have to apply (the tension knob on the **saw**) is a lot greater for a large blade, but the tension, measured in psi, is the same for the large and small blades. Since it is related to the cross section area of the blade, the stress doesn't depend on the thickness or width of the blade, but the force required to achieve that stress (blade tension) does depend on the width and thickness of the blade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We did not come across any significant drawbacks while testing WEN 3935 bench-top band**saw**. However, it is not the right choice for professional woodworkers as it does not come with roller bearing guides, which helps keep the blade straight. That being said, it is worth the investment for light-duty **re**saw**ing**, especially for DIY-ers and hobbyists. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Before wrapping up, we would like to mention our top picks. So, let us do a little recap. WEN 3959 is the best overall. Rikon 10-3061 Deluxe Band**saw** features 2 blades for greater accuracy, while SKIL 3386-01 comes with a vivid LED light for visibility while working. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How to Choose the Correct Number of Teeth Per Inch (TPI) The number of teeth per inch (TPI) is important in obtaining the finish desired and the proper feed rate. A coarse tooth blade (2, 3 TPI) should be used for re-**saw**ing wood and cutting thicker stock up to 8″ thick. A fine toothed blade (18 to 32 TPI) should be used for thinner metals and plastics under 1/4″. For general cutting of 3/4″ plywood 4 TPI will provide a fast cut and 14 TPI will cut much slower but leave a smooth finish on the cut. When Selecting TPI Remember: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blade lubrication - you don't need (or want) a wet blade like metal cutting band**saw**s or some **saw**mills use, but most vendors recommend lubricating the blade. Some folks spray some cooking "Pam" on a rag, and wipe it on the blade while moving it backwards by hand. This apparently does not leave enough residue on the wood to interfere with any finish. I wax my blade with furniture paste wax, similar to the way I care for other metal woodworking surfaces (such as the cast iron tables). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Delta is a 100-year old brand that has been producing various equipment for woodworking; its products are famous for being reliable and precise. On that note, the Delta 28-400 is a steel-bodied, heavy-duty band **saw** that cuts through woods like a dream. Having said that, it is not an option you would want to miss out on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In choosing a band **saw**, the two most essential items to remember are the size of the cut and the throat. The **saw**’s cutting depth is the distance from the table to the blade guides in the top **saw**. For this feature, many band **saw**s are just sold, informing the potential buyer how thick the material can be cut with the band **saw**. However, with some **saw**s that are only 6 inches deep, an optional standpipe can be added to the unit, extending the depth from 6 to 12 inches. This allows the cutting of thicker material by some less expensive **saw**s, particularly when re-sewing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Re**saw**ing can be a hassle with a table **saw**, so the Grizzly Industrial G0555X-H band **saw** is the best choice for many jobs. Its blade is half an inch wide with three-tooth-per-inch. The blade is also adjustable, enabling you to make wider cuts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First off, we really liked the vivid LED work light; it helps in providing a better sight of the cut line and the workpiece. The sharp 6 TPI **saw** blades enable you to cut through a wide range of wood materials. Not to mention, its 2.5 motor which makes the job a lot easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You are taking care of your **saw** blade, after all. So don’t leave it, please, use it. Save that for all these cuts. So make sure they are clean and free of rust. It is worth keeping it clear and in a state of exception. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should select the best band **saw**s for **re**saw**ing** and push them to their limits in an efficient way. It is essential to choose the most appropriate one so that your needs will be fulfilled without fail. Band **saw**s can cut curves as well as having an excellent capability for **re**saw**ing** as well. If you choose a band**saw** for **re**saw**ing**, you should consider various factors, including power, capacity, frame, and sturdy base. In addition, the dust collection should be very efficient, and you should use the right blade to accomplish the task. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sale JET JWBS-14SFX, 14-Inch Woodworking Band**saw**, 1-3/4HP, 1Ph 115/230V (714400K) Large Work Piece Support: 360 sq. in. cast iron worktable and 13" re**saw** capacity, so you can tackle more... - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Grizzly G0555XH Band**saw** is the perfect choice for professional woodworkers who are looking for a heavily built versatile option. However, it is not for those who are on a tight budget. In fact, this model is one of the most expensive band**saw**s available on the market but is certainly a good investment by all means. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, a band**saw** blade for **re**saw**ing** should have at least three teeth per inch and proper tension. To test whether the blade is properly tensioned, gently pluck its open section. A well-tensioned blade should resound like a guitar string. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This band **saw** offers substantial power and a dual safety switch for added safety. This model has a high cutting capacity, with 2,500 feet per minute. The high cutting capacity makes it a good choice for **re**saw**ing** larger pieces of wood or cutting veneers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘Generation37’ is the name for the best band **saw** and bandknife blades range. Not just Dakin-Flathers’ range of ultimate blades, but the industries. Because the quality of each and every one of our blades is exceptional and the range of different blades for specific uses is mind-boggling, you don’t need several suppliers. You just need Dakin-Flathers, wherever you are in the world, simple! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In my opinion, the challenging band**saw** job is **re**saw**ing**... cutting thin pieces off wide boards, normally dry hardwood. The target may be a piece of wood 3/8 inch thick (such as the side of a small drawer), or it may be a veneer, well under 1/8 inch thick. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   PITCH THAT IS TOO COARSE- The blade has a short cutting life. The teeth wear excessively. The band **saw** or blade vibrates. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **saw** ball blade guides and thrust bearings are first spring-loaded so that you can change them quickly and easily without the gear’s need. RIKON raised the height of the fences to only 6 inches. By turning a few buttons instead of loosening and tightening the screws, you can adjust the rotation to either left or right. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The WEN 3962T 3.5-Amph 10-Inch band **saw** is a powerful woodworking tool that offers two speeds and a miter gauge. These features are ideal for everyday woodworking and DIY projects. However, it is not recommended for beginners. For larger wood and thicker lumber, a table **saw** should be used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Rikon 10-305 band**saw** is similar to the Rikon 10-306 band**saw**, but it features a sturdy door hinge and an improved dust port. It also has a longer fence, which can be beneficial for **re**saw**ing** large pieces of wood. The LS-300 Band**saw** is also compact and lightweight, and it requires no special tools to set it up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are **saw**ing wet (green) wood, such as milling lumber or cutting bowl blanks, you need a wider kerf (the wet **saw**dust expands) and perhaps a thicker blade. None of the carbide blades I have seen are suitable for cutting green wood. Of course, for bowl blanks you will be cutting curves, and therefore want a narrower blade as well. Many people use a 3/8 or 1/2 inch wide blade for bowl blanks, in a special "model" blade designed to cut green wood (such as the AS series from Timberwolf). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To be frank, this list would have remained incomplete without the inclusion of the CSA-certified G0555XH band**saw** by Grizzly. If you were not aware, this brand manufactures a wide variety of power tools, and band**saw**s happen to be one of them. That being said, this heavy-duty model is the right choice for those who slice wood for a living. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Without a doubt, the Delta 28-400 is one of the best band**saw**s for heavy-duty professional woodcutting. However, this may not be the right choice for those who are on a humble budget. That being said, once you invest in it, we are pretty confident you won’t be regretting it! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Please note: Your band**saw** blade length and width parameters can be located on the back of your **saw** on a plate above the motor. Please refer to your band**saw** for blade length. Many lengths have changed and we highly recommend you check your original order before ordering online. If you are unsure – call 800-234-1976. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When searching for the best band **saw**s for **re**saw**ing**, you need to consider features such as a big throat so that you can cut thicker pieces of wood. This feature is essential if you want to produce professional quality woodworking. Another important feature is the presence of a re**saw** fence. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Steady feed rate. If you will be doing a lot of **re**saw**ing**, consider a power feeder. People who use a power feeder on a band**saw** swear by them. Be sure you can adjust the feed-speed of the feeder to match the requirements of your **saw** with each particular piece of wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The "Wood Slicer" (from Highland Hardware), also sold as the "Bladerunner" by Louis Iturra (904-642-2802) is a non-carbide blade that has a cult following for **re**saw**ing** dry hardwood. It is a very thin blade (.022 inch, .03 kerf) which removes less wood and therefore requires less power. It has variable tooth pitch which runs quieter and smoother, and requires less tension (20,000 psi - see below), With less metal doing the cutting, it doesn't last as long, but it is far less expensive than a carbide tip blade, and gives very smooth cuts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another important factor to consider is the cutting capacity of the **saw**. A good band **saw** can handle thick stock, logs, and hardwoods. It can even be used to re**saw** large pieces of lumber down to size using book-matching techniques. You’ll also need a band**saw** blade with a large enough diameter to accommodate the material you’re **re**saw**ing**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Ryobi BS904G 9-inch Band**saw** features a convenient tilting table and adjustable table. The table can be rotated up to 45 degrees. It also has a safety key for added safety. Without the key, the **saw** cannot be operated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This band **saw** features a four-inch dust port and an optional D3348 extension block, which increases its **re**saw**ing** capacity to twelve inches. It also comes with a 2-year warranty. Grizzly has been in the business for a long time and has developed products to fit a specific market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Rikon Power Tools 10-305 Band**saw** for re-**saw**ing is a popular tool that can handle most of your **re**saw**ing** needs. It is made of durable steel with a cast iron table and steel plates on the frame and doors. This **saw** also comes with a 5-year manufacturer’s warranty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This WEN 3962T 3.5-Amph 10-Inch band **saw** for re**saw**-ing has excellent power for a low price. It can cut metals and features an automatic shut-off button. This safety feature helps avoid the potential for injury during the process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Plus, this band**saw** can cut through wood as thick as 12-inches, thanks to the tall upper frame and the powerful 1.75 HP motor. The work surface is made of a large cast iron which measures 6-inch by 21.75-inch, and furthermore, it can tilt up to 45 degrees for pulling off angled edge cuts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When **re**saw**ing** wood, a band **saw** is more appropriate than a hack**saw**. With a band **saw**, you can raise the blade to accommodate wider boards, and the kerf is thinner. This allows for smoother cuts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **re**saw**ing** band **saw** from Grizzly is capable of cutting lumber up to 12 inches thick. With a tabletop size of 21 1/2 ” x 16″, it can easily accommodate large pieces of wood. The Grizzly G0555XH offers excellent performance at a low price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A high-quality steel frame **saw** has heavy cast iron wheels-they provide a powerful flywheel effect, leading to a robust and even cut. On rubber tires, a band **saw** blade tracks the wheel rims. The tires are flat (or almost flat) on most steel frame tools that help track blades that are 1 inch or wider. This is good for sewing back heavily. Unfortunately, the classic 14″cast iron bands’ “crowned” wheels aren’t enough. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The table’s tilt adjustment allows for precise measurements. The tilt of a band **saw** must be at least 45 degrees to either right or left. A single-trunnion model, such as the Grizzly G0555XH, has its own power cord and switch. Other brands, such as Powermatic, feature built-in outlets for an aftermarket light. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The device is intended to re**saw** wood and cut it but can be used with a suitable blade for cutting metal. It might not be a good idea to deviate from the manufacturer’s manual with the one-speed engine. Nevertheless, you can easily cut unusual and complex angles thanks to the rotary table and the parallel fence. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Furthermore, it offers a cutting speed of 2,460, which is on the higher side of things. And also, the 62-inch blade really helps in cutting almost all sizes of workpieces. Did we forget to mention that this band **saw** features a switch key to ensure better safety to its users? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To be honest, we were thoroughly impressed with what the Rikon 10-3061 Deluxe Band**saw** had to deliver. Firstly, it boasts a strong cast iron table, which can be tilted up to 45 degrees for angled cuts and effective operation. The 5.5 amp motor makes it suitable for light-duty DIY projects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The side-guides should not touch the blade constantly (to prevent heat build up), but should be VERY close to prevent deflection (if a folded piece of paper fits between the blade and guide, it is too far away). Mine act "nervous" - with the **saw** running but not cutting, they are so close to the blade that they twitch from moving air and dust. Front-to-back, the side guides should be close to the gullet since that is the part that wants to wander. Euro guides, roller guides, ceramic guides, cool blocks, wood blocks soaked in mineral oil, all work fine, even though everybody has a favorite. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We are halfway through with our list, and now it would be a pretty good time to talk about BS904G from Ryobi. This Japanese brand is one of the oldest in the business of manufacturing top-notch electric power tools. Sporting a trendy green look, this particular unit of band**saw** delivers incredible and precise results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   WEN is one of the leading manufacturers of affordable yet top-quality band**saw**s. And the WEN 3959 bench-top band**saw** lives up to the brand’s name. It boasts a compact design and a powerful motor that helps in cutting through wooden workpieces like a dream. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are three main types of band **saw**s: benchtop, floor-standing, and portable. A floor-standing **saw** is recommended if you have a large workshop. The portable model is an excellent choice for small workshops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Laguna Tools 220v 2.5hp Band**saw** with 12” Re**saw** and 38” Table Height - Model mband14bx220-250,... 12" Re**saw** | height: 70 1/4" 21 1/2" X 16" | table height: 38" - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **saw** features two blade speeds, a precision geared tilting table, and an upper guide adjustment. It also features a blade tension indicator and a deluxe aluminum fence. The fence lifts and lowers easily and is secured to the table with two rails. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 3A 9-Inch band**saw** by Woodskill is an important mention on this list. However, we found out that it is not the perfect choice for those who are into professional wood cutting. That being said, it is the right choice for occasional light-duty hobbyists. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When selecting a band **saw**, consider the size and price of your working space. Band **saw**s come in a wide range of sizes. It’s best to choose one that is compatible with your workspace. You should also make sure you choose the band **saw** blades that fit the size of the piece you’re cutting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This 14-Inch Band**saw** from Jet is the best choice for woodworkers looking for a band**saw** with great re**saw** capacity. It also offers excellent blade tracking and a hefty 300-lb. steel base for stability and strength. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Motor power is, in fact, the most important factor that should be kept in mind while buying a top-notch band**saw**. A powerful motor power helps in cutting through the thickest of woods. Since there will be a lot of friction between the wood and the blade, a motor with insufficient horsepower won’t be able to cut through. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
