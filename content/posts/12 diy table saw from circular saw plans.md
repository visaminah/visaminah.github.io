## 12 Interesting Facts Diy Table Saw From Circular Saw Plans | Why making a table saw from a circular saw is dangerous
-   If nothing else, set a financial goal for yourself with the **saw** as a target. Think about everyday expenses you can cut down for a while to pay for the **saw**. Do you drink coffee every morning? Making it at home instead of visiting a coffee shop could finance it. If you already do that, look for other ways to save. Maybe you can give up soda, or pack a lunch instead of eating out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While most people assume cutting themselves is the most common **table** **saw** injury, it’s actually kickback that’s more common. Kickback occurs when the board gets stuck and then the blade catches it suddenly and shoots it back in your direction, at speeds over 100 miles per hour. You won’t have time to duck or jump out of the way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A homemade **table** **saw** lacks the safety features of even the most basic **saw**, including the riving knife, kickback pawls, and blade guard. Although frequently overlooked, kickback is the most common cause of injury from **table** **saw**s, and building your own **saw** leaves you susceptible. It’s much safer to buy an inexpensive **table** **saw**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, of course, make sure the **saw** works. If you’re confident you can fix it and can get the **saw** at a steep enough discount that you’re willing to take on that risk, go ahead and buy it. The power cord is easy to replace and the power switch isn’t much harder, and those two parts are more likely to fail than the motor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A track **saw** is another alternative to a **table** **saw**. Similar to a circular **saw**, you clamp a track onto your workpiece, then cut along a guide. But you can easily spend as much on a track **saw** as you would on a circular **saw**, so if money is the issue rather than space, a track **saw** doesn’t help much. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you use a 20% off coupon, you can get a **table** **saw** from Harbor Freight for around $90. It’s underpowered and has a sloppy fence, so it’s not an ideal solution, but it’s better than improvising with a circular **saw** and some plywood. Now, for some people, $90 is still a lot of money, and I get that. But $90 is cheaper than an emergency room visit. It’s also less painful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Table **saw**s are extremely useful, but a good **table** **saw** is expensive. Even a cheap **table** **saw** can be rather expensive. So it’s very tempting to make your own, using a circular **saw**. But here’s why making a **table** **saw** from a circular **saw** is dangerous. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The greatest danger from making a **table** **saw** from a circular **saw** comes from the lack of safety features. On a makeshift **table** **saw**, there’s no place to mount a riving knife or kickback pawls. Rigging up any sort of blade guard is also difficult, and could potentially cause binding, making matters worse instead of better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can buy the Harbor Freight **saw** and use it, keep it in good condition, then sell it when you can afford something better. You probably won’t have much trouble selling it for $60 or $70. In that case, it’s like renting the **saw** for $20 or $30. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Besides the safety issues, a circular **saw** motor just isn’t as powerful as a **table** **saw** motor. You’ll still be able to make a lot of cuts, but when you’re cutting thicker or harder lumber, you’re more likely to get burn marks instead of a clean cut. Clean, smooth cuts are part of the point of having a **table** **saw**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may be able to finance a **saw** by saving on materials. Check out your local home center’s cull lumber pile. Take advantage of having a **saw** and use it to cut cheap 2×4 boards into other, more useful-sized boards for your projects. Yes, that approach means working with pine for a while, but pine is far more durable than particle board. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rather than make a dangerous, underpowered makeshift **table** **saw**, you’re much better off buying an inexpensive **saw**. You don’t have to spend $400 on a **saw**. There are advantages to the **saw**s that cost several hundred dollars, and even more advantages to the **saw**s that cost a thousand dollars or more, but even an inexpensive **saw** gives most of the benefit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
