I place it on the floor, adjust it until it's level and then a small rotating head (red) reflects a **laser** ray all around, creating a flat "plane" at about 10 cm from the ground, which as you say is really awkward (why they didn't think to put the rotating head below is beyond me). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
