## 5 Tips to Best Round Toilet For Small Bathroom | Small Toilets Home Depot
-   One way to make more room is to replace a cabinet sink with a pedestal sink. You lose storage space – which you may be able to replace with wall shelves – but you open up a lot of floor space. My husband and I did this to a **bathroom** in our old house and it was amazing how much larger the room looked when we were done. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One option is a round front **toilet**. I selected these specific models based on their overall dimensions and reviews. Most of these have a shorter length than the standard **toilet** so they won’t jut out and eat up valuable space. Some have shorter tanks in case you also need to fit it under shelving or cabinetry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When my sister moved into a beautiful, old house in Pennsylvania, she had lots of remodeling to do but her biggest challenge was to get a **bathroom** on the main floor. She turned an existing closet into a guest bath. My parents had a similar challenge with a daylight basement that had no **bathroom**. Walling off a portion of the oversized water closet was one solution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to put a **toilet** in where there’s not the traditional ground drain, a small macerating **toilet** might be a money saving option. They don’t require the standard drain – just a dedicated outlet and a cold water connection. The built in macerator chops up the debris to liquid form and processes it without the tank. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These can also be great for a powder room. Ours is square and was designed for everything to be against one wall which makes one half of the space look really cramped and leaves the other side very empty. A small, corner **toilet** can open up the space and keep you from bumping your legs or arms on surrounding cabinets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
