-   On the other hand, if you are just getting started with your lawn care or landscaping business.

Especially if you want a tool that can be used to clear brush and do regular weed eating on the same day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Additionally, the Ryobi **trimmer**s offer the ability to use .095 size string, for about $200. Seriously, if it's all you can afford to get your business started... - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The curved **shaft**’s primary purpose is for light trimming. They are typically used for lawns that are covered in trees or areas with multiple posts that need trimming and require easy maneuvering. The size of the area these are used in is normally less than half an acre. Straight **shaft** **trimmer**s are designed with heavier trimming in mind, or trimming that will last for some time. These types are best for areas that require reaching, like bushes and underbrush. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the opposite hand, a straight **shaft** accomplishes the identical operate, however it doesn’t have to be versatile, which implies that it’s much less weak to breakage. Straight **shaft** **trimmer**s can make the most of both metal cables or simply use a stable steel drive **shaft**.

-   Curved **trimmer**s can also be cumbersome if you’re using them underneath a bush or patio furniture.

The curved **shaft** **trimmer** also generates less torque and therefore has less cutting power. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I liked a @YouTube video https://t.co/Y9BmsJAXAp Curved **shaft** vs. Straight Shaft Trimmer — Uhavemooface (@uhavemooface1) December 28, 2018 - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course you might be additionally going to pay more for the straight **shaft** than the curved **shaft** **trimmer**. While the curved **trimmer**s might provide you with an easier time with stability and control, they sacrifice the attain. Their shorter **shaft** will not provide a long attain like the straight **shaft** fashions straight vs curved **trimmer**, and because they have smaller engines, they will also not be very ideal for heavy-duty trimming jobs. In many situations, the straight **shaft** **trimmer**s will be fitted with extra highly effective 4-cycle engines to ensure they’ll handle almost any job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The problem with not tapering, or holding the tool so the string is parallel to the ground, is that the entire diameter of the string has to cut a full swath of grass. One telltale sign that a person didn't taper is a channel of grass the **trimmer** clearly cut shorter than the mowed grass. On the other hand, when you pitch the string tips toward the object you're trimming against, you're cutting less grass and leaving a tight, tapered edge, and also blending the edge with the height of the mowed grass for a clean look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Battery Powered (Cordless): These **trimmer**s offer cord-free mobility, so you don’t have to worry about the size of your yard. These **trimmer**s require no maintenance, no fueling, fumes or pull starting. These **trimmer**s can only run for approximately 30 minutes before the battery needs to be recharged for multiple hours. They’re emissions free, on-the-go machines you can easily pick up and trim your yard without the hassle of gas-related issues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Curved **shaft** **trimmer**s have a coil spring for the driving **shaft**. A straight **shaft** **trimmer** has a rod. You could ruin the coil spring driving **shaft** if it has too much resistance. Cost to repair would probably exceed anything that you saved buying the one you have over the straight **shaft**, and definitely would spend anything you would save by renting one from Ace Hardware or Home Depot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, curved **shaft** **trimmer**s have their disadvantages as well. We’ve already mentioned that for frequent use, they may not be as durable. In addition, if you’re tall, the **trimmer**s might require that you bend over as you work, which can be very uncomfortable and even painful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Electric Powered Trimmers: Electric powered **trimmer**s are recommended for smaller jobs. These tend to cost less and don’t require tune ups. Electric powered **trimmer**s are equipped with a push button start, eliminating the recoil of the gas powered models. These **trimmer**s are almost maintenance free and are quieter than the gas models. However, you are limited in range when it comes to cord length. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before we get into straight vs. curved **shaft**s **trimmer**, it’s good to know a little about **shaft**s in general. To begin with, in both of these **trimmer**s – the **shaft** is considered the part where the throttle and handle are mounted. A drive cable runs the length of the **shaft**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First of all, **trimmer**s with curved **shaft**s are generally shorter than those with straight **shaft**s. As a result, the **trimmer** is usually more lightweight and therefore easy to use when you have a longer job in front of you. If you’re short, all of these things might be beneficial to you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Anyway, I've found the string **trimmer** that I want. I will be using it more as an edger than a weed wacker. I held both but can't get a feel for which will be better for my application. Does anyone have a strong preference for straight or curved **shaft** for any particular reason? Both are much longer **trimmer**s than I'm used to and I'm not sure which one will be more accurate. As I write this, I feel it will be deleted for immoral content despite this really being about a string **trimmer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Walk-behind **trimmer**s are similar to a push lawn mower. These **trimmer**s are good for increased mobility to tackle overgrown areas and large amounts of weeds. Large wheels handle rugged terrain. Most wheeled **trimmer**s have 4-cycle engines, just like a push mower. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Edging your garden beds makes them look cleaner and more professional. Position the **trimmer** at 90 degrees to the area you’re edging. Move the end of your **trimmer** slowly from left to right along the edge of your garden bed. You should notice a nice vertical edge being created as the **trimmer** cuts through excess grass and debris. As with mowing, don’t cut more than one-third of the grass height to avoid scaling and damage to your lawn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Curved **shaft** **trimmer**s provide more control and are typically lighter in weight. They are easier to maneuver around flower beds and sidewalks. Curved **shaft** **trimmer**s are usually more comfortable to hold, making it more manageable for any homeowner, big or small. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have had nothing but great experiences with Husqvarna's pro line of **trimmer**s. In fact, they last years with little maintenance. The one downside I would have to say is the poor quality of the **trimmer** head. The bump heads of their weed whackers deteriorate rather quickly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This extra weight mostly comes from the fact that the straight **trimmer**s will use the larger and heavier 4-cycle engines. The extra inches you get for the **shaft** add some ounces to the overall weight of the **trimmer**. And the biggest disadvantage with this is that it makes the **trimmer** harder to balance and control. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to make quick work of long grass and weeds that pop up in your lawn and gardens, hold the spinning end of the **trimmer** parallel to the ground and slowly walk with the **trimmer** over the overgrown areas. You may want to cover a few areas and then stop to clear the cuttings using a yard bag or compost pile. For really overgrown yards, this makes the process a lot more manageable. You’ll also want to watch out when trimming near trees and shrubs, because string **trimmer**s are powerful enough to remove and fling bark. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The thing to keep in mind is that both **trimmer**s are ideal, but they are not designed with the same jobs in mind. It’s important to know what kind, how long, and how large of a job you will be performing before selecting a type of **trimmer** to use. Remembering these key points will ensure you have the right **trimmer** in mind when accepting your next landscaping job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These choices will not be suitable for heavy weed-consuming needs, they usually are inclined to spit a lot of debris around. Once you understand how to use the straight **shaft** weed eater, it is going to be the higher of the two choices. Until then, the problem of utilizing this type of weed eater may encourage newbies to go for the curved **shaft** weed eater as a substitute. Normally, many more powerful products are extra durable as well, and the same goes for straight **shaft** weed eaters. Because of the straight design, the unit is more stable and less vulnerable to compromise. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brush cutters work similarly to string **trimmer**s except they are used to clear dense grass, thick growth, and heavily weeded areas. Many brushcutter users outfit the **trimmer** head with cutting blades to pack more punch behind each cut. Brush cutters are typically have larger engines for more power than a string **trimmer**. The straight **shaft** offers durability and the bike-handle design gives comfort and maneuverability when using the equipment for extended periods of time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You have to make certain that you could have a prepared provide of **trimmer** string available before you begin a job. While some companies provide straightforward-reload modules, these is probably not available everywhere. The smallest of the heads we’re taking a look at at present, this can clear a one foot extensive strip without a second move. Dual inline wheels turn this from a weed wacker into an edger with just a easy repositioning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gas Powered: These **trimmer**s are perfect for any type of growth, thick or thin. Gas **trimmer**s are more powerful, and they offer more mobility in conditions that require longer operating periods. However, they do require more maintenance and are noisier than the other two types of **trimmer**s. Gas **trimmer**s use either a 2 or 4-cycle engine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before choosing your **shaft** type, determine what you need your **trimmer** for. If you have a larger yard, fences, obstacles, and hard to reach places, or you're a diehard commercial user, a straight **shaft** might be a good idea for you. If you're a residential home owner that needs to do some light trimming now and then, you may want to consider a curved **shaft**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The key thing to avoid is cutting it too short; this weakens the grass and exposes it to all the dangerous issues that correct trimming helps prevent. A height of 2 inches is mostly thought-about a healthy length to maintain most turf grasses. Black+Decker is the leading manufacturer and marketer of corded- and cordless-electric string **trimmer**s, and provides an intensive line of electrical merchandise. Black+Decker string **trimmer**s are widely obtainable online and at Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Walmart. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The curved **trimmer**s are ideal for small to medium yard trimming tasks as they can get the job done fast and with minimal fatigue for the user. Also, the relatively simpler structure means they will give you an easier time when it comes to maintenance. And most will have smaller and less complicated 2-cycle engines. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Trimmer line is fed mechanically when the top is tapped to the ground. Tapering is cutting the sting of the grass at a 45-degree angle to mix the edge with the mowed height of the grass for a pleasant, clean straight vs curved **trimmer** look. But I can inform in my hands, the distinction between solid **shaft** and cable pushed **shaft**s on garden gear. I suppose I’d quite pay the difference for a stable **shaft** vs cable pushed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
