## 103 Fun Facts What Is A Three Quarter Bath | Quarter Bathroom Vs Half-Bath
-   A 1/4 **bath** (**quarter** **bath**) includes just a toilet and no other sanitaryware. Some people call them a toilet room or water closet. They are usually just big enough for the toilet and a single person. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Three-**quarter** **bath**rooms feature a shower, toilet, and sink. In rare instances, particularly in older homes, you may find a tub rather than a shower in a three-**quarter** **bath**. If you want to keep your three-**quarter** **bath**room but prefer showering to soaking in a tub, consider a cost-effective **bath** conversion and transform your tub into a shower. This style of **bath**room is perfect for you if you want a complete-feeling **bath**room, but don't have a ton of space to work with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These numbers are based on a full **bath**room, which is not exactly a three-**quarter** **bath**room. However, this is the closest comparison. This study is also based on nation-wide averages. Your specific location might be significantly higher or lower than these estimates. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The advantage of this option is the opportunity to get all necessary **bath** elements and save some space at the same time. That makes this design efficient for smaller and mid-sized houses, as well as flats. The specifics 3/4 **bath**room needs to meet: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **quarter** **bath** only has one fixture in the space. For example, a utility sink in the garage can be helpful to keep dirt and contaminants out of a common **bath**room. The typical **quarter** **bath** layout takes up minimal space, usually less than 18 square feet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can install it for your guests or the members of your family who can use it while the main **bath**room in the house is occupied. It is also an excellent solution for the ground floor without bedrooms. However, keep in mind that two half **bath**rooms can’t be an adequate replacement for the full **bath**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In 2017, one study says that adding a full **bath**room added $23,283. Another study in 2019 says that adding a full **bath**room added approximately $18,000 to the home's value. This same survey says you can expect about a 5.7% increase in your home's value with an added **bath**room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The other possibility is to have a **quarter** **bath** with a shower cabin, but it is not a standard solution either. An even rarer case is that you only have a sink installed here, which makes it a washroom. I suppose that people organize such a space for guests. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of the time, a 3/4 **bath** is smaller than what is considered a full family **bath**. However, it provides most of the same functions. Many 3/4 **bath**s are found as compact ensuites or as guest **bath**rooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Furthermore, a full **bath** usually comes with a **bath**room space of 40 to 45 square feet. The average size can also go up to 60 square feet, depending on the available area in the house. More often than not, a full **bath** is attached to a master bedroom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sinks come in several different versions and sizes. This means that you can choose a sink based on the size of the **bath**room. The sink pictured below would be a great option for a narrow **bath**room because it doesn't come off the wall very far. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No matter what your dream **bath**room looks like, Expo Home Improvement is a leader in the **bath**room remodeling industry with the skills and experience required to make your dreams come true. Whether you know exactly what you want or you're unsure and just checking your options out, we've got custom solutions that meet your needs. Check out two of the most desirable **bath**room types below.. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A full **bath**room is a **bath**room that includes a shower, a **bath**tub, a sink, and a toilet. A half **bath**room only contains a sink and a toilet. If you have a large family or a larger house, a full **bath** is ideal as it has both a shower and a **bath**tub and can accommodate multiple users. A half **bath** suits smaller homes and busy entry and exit points like a hallway. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moreover, the cost of maintenance is also lesser for a 3/4 **bath**room as compared to a full **bath**room. Additionally, if you have limited space, going for a 3/4 **bath**room is a better option than organizing a full **bath**room. So nowadays, 3/4 **bath**rooms have become far more popular among students and young people who usually have a limited budget and live in small apartments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is essentially very little difference between a 3/4 **bath** and a full **bath**. However, the minute differences that you need to consider can make or break your plan. These are mostly regarding **bath**room equipment and the available **bath**room space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We suggest you take some time and hire a professional architect who can help you develop a feasible **bath**room design that meets your needs. And on that note, we will leave you to it. Until next time! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A three-**quarter** **bath**room with a shower needs at least 32 square feet to be comfortable. For a **bath**room with a tub, plan on at least 40 square feet. However, you can get away with less square footage if you're willing to sacrifice comfort. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you can imagine, remodeling a large **bath**room is going to be much more costly than renovating or fixing up a smaller sized **bath**room. On average, depending largely on the amount of space available, you are looking at a price quote of anywhere between $13-15,000 depending on the size of your **bath**room and the materials you desire. Of course, 13,000 is just a starting point as large sized **bath**rooms can climb easily up to $20-30,000 if you aren’t careful as working on your home can always cost more depending on the age of your home itself and any complications that arise from it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A half **bath** is a small **bath**room that only has two of the four primary elements included in a full **bath**, namely, a toilet and a sink. Traditionally, a half **bath**room is known as a powder room and is widely popular as private **quarter**s where women can touch up their makeup. Needless to say, it is an entertaining and functional space, all at once. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As with many homeowners searching for their dream home, you’ll want to find the perfect space to grow into and enjoy. Many people tend to focus on the overall square footage or the number of bedrooms in a home. However, the number and type of **bath**rooms are also important to how well a house will function for a family. Figuring out different **bath**room configurations can be confusing. From half **bath**s to full **bath**s, this article will outline the different types of **bath**rooms to help you understand each layout, remodeling costs to fix an existing **bath**room, and even how to add a **bath**room to a home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Half-**bath**s—also known as “powder rooms”—only have a sink and a toilet. They’re usually found on the ground floor of homes, often near a door. Half-**bath**s were originally created to have a place for guests to freshen up or use a toilet without having to go into to the family’s personal space on the second floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the listing says 2 1/2 **bath**s, you might expect two full **bath**rooms and one-half **bath**. However, two **bath**s doesn’t necessarily mean two full **bath**s. This could mean one full **bath** and three separate half **bath**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are the lucky ones, you enjoy a comfortable, large full **bath**room that runs up to 145 sq. ft (13.5 m2) and beyond. It is a case when your home is built the way the master **bath**room is set up parallel with the master bedroom. It often contains double sinks and vanities for extra comfort. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In contrast, a three-**quarter** **bath**room is equipped with either a shower or a tub, but never both. And in most cases, it has a shower instead of a tub, in addition to a functional sink and toilet. If you have more than these three fixtures in the **bath**room, you can no longer call it a 3/4 **bath**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   From the googs!Gross. I think a **quarter** **bath**room should be defined as a sink + urinal, or just a sink. You can pee in a sink after all - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An added **bath**room can give the homeowner a return on investment of 47-60%, according to a survey by remodeling.com. According to the National Association of Home Builders, this translates into an additional 10-20% in property value on an average house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **bath**room is an essential part of a home and is an important factor in the home's value. There are different types and sizes of **bath**rooms that each have their own advantages and disadvantages. One type of **bath**room that has everything you need in a space-efficient way is a three-**quarter** **bath**room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a 32 square feet area, you can install a spacious and comfortable shower in the 3/4 **bath**. Any standard shower will have a size of 32-inch by 32-inch from one edge to another. So, 32 square feet of **bath**room space will be enough to organize a standard 3/4 **bath**room featuring a sink, a toilet, and a shower. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When a real estate listing describes a home’s **bath**rooms, the fractions indicate how many fixtures are in the **bath**room. A half **bath** has two components or fixtures, typically one sink and one toilet. However, other layouts that could be considered half **bath**s include one sink and one shower, one toilet and one shower, or one toilet and one **bath**tub. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The types of fixtures you can use in the full **bath**room depends on the size. You can find a standard toilet, freestanding tub, shower stall, or combinations to fit almost any width. Sink and vanity units increase in size in 3-inch increments and can be custom-built for unique spaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just like with any **bath**room, a half-**bath** needs plumbing for running water, drainage, and proper ventilation. The most critical part of a half **bath** is privacy. If you plan to add a half **bath** to your existing home or buy a home that has one, make sure there is extra soundproofing insulation between the walls or, at the very least, thick drywall to separate any noise. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At least 24 inches is required in front of the shower entry, and 30 inches is recommended. You must have at least 21 inches of clearance in front of both a toilet and sink, though 30 is recommended. Remember that these measurements are not laws. Check your local building codes to make sure your **bath**room will comply with appropriate measurements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These tiny in-home **bath**rooms are quite uncommon varieties in the average homes in the US, except the oldest ones. This space contains only one of the four possible elements a full **bath**room has. In most cases, it is a toilet. It can be quite odd since there is no possibility to wash your hands after using it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some old homes still have a combination of a toilet, sink, and tub instead of a shower. In such a case, you can quickly add a showerhead over a **bath**tub. That way, you will increase the value of your home by getting a full **bath**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Basically, the price of your new home can depend on the type of **bath**room there. Maybe it sounds weird, but you can pick out among four primary types of this crucial space. Let’s see what terms 1/4 **bath**, 1/2 **bath**, 3/4 **bath**, and full **bath** means precisely, and how you can increase the price of your property by converting one type of **bath**room to another. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While not as common, a **quarter** **bath** can come in the form of a stand-alone shower, sink, toilet, or tub. Some examples include an outdoor shower if you live in a beach town like Encinitas, CA or Tofino, BC. Or, a **quarter**-**bath** can be a single sink in a bedroom with a complete **bath**room and a toilet located down the hall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A good way to decide if it has 4 pieces is to check the size of the full **bath** in the listing. A 4-piece **bath**room typically needs at least 4.4 square metres. A 3-piece **bath** has an average size of around 3.5 square metres. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a good option for houses with a decorative dormer in the attic. There will be enough room for a half **bath** if the ceiling height is at least 7 feet at the ridge. You will also need 5-6 feet in width and 5 feet in height above a toilet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are thinking of adding a 1/2 **bath** to your home, after renovations you can expect to see a 5-10% increase in the value of the home. It may also improve the resale ability of the property for potential buyers. In many instances, this will “pay you back” the cost of the addition. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As mentioned earlier, **bath**room types differ based on their size and amenities. On that note, a tiny **quarter** **bath** is limited to a toilet. These commonly have the smallest **bath**room space and are equipped with only one of the four primary **bath**room facilities available in a traditional full **bath**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To add a three-**quarter** **bath**, you can expect to spend around $5,000-$9,000, depending on your fixtures and average costs for your area. A three-**quarter** **bath**room can easily be upgraded to a full **bath**, provided you have enough space. When it comes to shower renovations, adding a shower to a full-size tub is easier – and less expensive – than converting an existing shower to a tub/shower combination. A three-**quarter** **bath**room with just a shower stall functions well for a smaller space. If you’re adding a tub, you may need to move walls and plumbing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At the same time, a **quarter** **bath** takes up much less space than a 3/4 **bath**. So, it may be a nifty addition if you have limited floor space to work with. You can also make the **quarter** **bath** more spacious by installing a round toilet instead of an elongated toilet bowl model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At minimum, a full **bath** requires at least 40 square feet with all the additional elements accounted for. Typical building code requires at least 32 square feet for a shower, so the additional 8 feet account for the addition of the **bath**tub. As a general rule, the **bath**tub is the largest hassle of size as showers, toilets and sinks can fit into much smaller spaces comparatively. While 40-45 square feet runs the small side, the average size of a full **bath** is anywhere between 40-60 square feet, though this is dependant on the **bath**room style and how many **bath**rooms your space currently has. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you run across the term "full **bath**" it is a **bath**room that has a toilet, a sink, a separate tub, and a separate shower. It may also have a combination of a tub and shower. This is usually a larger **bath**room with at least 40 to 45 square feet but can be much larger, depending on the home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A three-**quarter** **bath** is also used as a spare **bath**room, but may also be a part of an ensuite. It will have a sink, toilet, and either a shower or a tub. Typically, this type of **bath**room will have a stand-alone shower, a sink, and a toilet. It will be around 35 square feet in size but can be a bit larger, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A half **bath** may be so small that you will bump your elbows while turning around after using the toilet. A three-**quarter** **bath** will be a little more spacious and comfortable and will likely be a worthwhile upgrade. If you have the available space and extra square feet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moreover, half **bath**s are significantly smaller than 3/4 **bath**s in terms of **bath**room space and size. Half **bath**s usually range from 11 to 20 square feet. But, if you have a half **bath**room of around 32 square feet, you’ll have enough space to transform it to a 3/4 **bath** during **bath**room renovations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As it is the smallest in size, half **bath**s are also the cheapest to remodel and replace. Since you don’t have to deal with a shower or **bath**tub, the price quickly drops to around $2,000-$4,000 starting. Of course this price is subject to change depending on what kind of toilet you install or the type of vanity you desire along with how much space is available to you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bathrooms, however, are another story. Individually, they’re often described using fractions (like a “half **bath**” or “3/4 **bath**”). Collectively this is also the case (like saying that a home has “two-and-a-half **bath**s”), but the math used to reach that number isn’t exactly what we learned in school. Here’s what to know—including the actual differences between a half, 3/4, and full **bath**room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 3: Using the **bath**room filter, choose either plus or minus to add or subtract the number of **bath**rooms. The filter is measured in half **bath** units, starting at one and searching for all properties with one full **bath**. Then it will go to 1.5 and search for listings for the typical one full and one-half **bath**, but it could also be a mix, as discussed above. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The fixtures often include larger options with more counter space. A full **bath**room may have a freestanding tub with a shower stall or a combination of the two together. It's often found in the master bedroom, but may also be another upstairs **bath**room in the home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Discerning what’s involved with “.75 **bath**s “ can be tricky. To start, you’ll have one full **bath** with four fixtures. It could be a single three-**quarter** **bath** with three fixtures like a toilet, sink, shower, or tub. Or it could mean a half **bath** with a toilet and sink plus a **quarter** **bath** with one fixture like a toilet, shower, or sink. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Based on the appliances you’re planning to install in the **bath**room, the space can vary. You’ll require much smaller square footage while organizing a 3/4 **bath** as compared to a full **bath**. So, it is best to determine the available area before organizing the **bath**room space carefully. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A full **bath**room contains all four fixtures;a shower, a **bath**tub, a sink, and a toilet. A ¾ **bath**room is missing one of the fixtures, either a shower or **bath**tub. While both **bath**rooms are similar, a ¾ **bath**room is more suited for smaller homes as a shower is more efficient than a **bath**tub. However, a full **bath**room is better for large homes with big families as it can accommodate more people. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The size of your household will impact the **bath**room you choose. If you have a large family, then you need more **bath**rooms to use. A full **bath** or ¾ would be more suited for you as they can accommodate multiple users at once. If you have a small home, then a ¾ or half **bath** is ideal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The layout for a small ensuite three-**quarter** **bath** typically includes one stand-alone shower, a toilet, and a sink. In most cases, a three-**quarter** **bath** is around 35 square feet, although some run up to 40-50 square feet. If your available space is on the lower end of the range, you may want to use compact fixtures to create the illusion of space while still functioning to meet your needs. You can install a full-size single sink vanity, standard toilet, and a single-stall stand-up shower in a larger space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A traditional full **bath** often takes up a lot of space, which can be troublesome. Furthermore, maintaining both a shower and a tub is a backbreaking and exhausting task if you’re living all by yourself. But, in a 3/4 **bath**, it is much easier to maintain the **bath**room appliances without much hassle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The layout of the necessary pieces is more compact than a full **bath** since this type is smaller. The shower is still next to the wall or window, while the toilet is next to it to save space. The best place for a sink is opposite the toilet bowl, closer to the door. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We've done the research on these things and would love to help you understand them better. Keep reading for more information on adding a three-**quarter** **bath**room to your home. We'll tell you how much value it can add, how much space you need, and other factors you should consider. Here we go! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For instance, you can have a **bath**room with two sinks, a toilet, and a tub, without a shower. In such a case, you can conclude that your new home doesn’t have the full **bath**room since one of the elements misses. The number of sinks won’t change that fact. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s worth noting that a three-**quarter** **bath**room usually does not feature a tub. However, it should consist of a sink, toilet, and shower. But, you can find a tub instead of a shower in some three-**quarter** **bath**s on rare occasions. Anyhow, if you decide to add this **bath**room to your house, it is best to have a clear idea about the available **bath**room space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you start shopping for the right home in Madison, you will commonly find full and half **bath**rooms. However, there are some properties, where you might run into **quarter** or three-**quarter** **bath**rooms. Keep these terms in mind, as you shop around, so you will better know what you will be getting with your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While half-**bath**, three-**quarter** **bath**, and full **bath** are the most common options you will find in a home, occasionally, you might run into a **quarter** **bath**, as well. This is often a **bath**room with a stand-alone shower or a toilet only or a tub only or a sink only. It has one fixture in the space and it's usually very small. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A ¾ **bath**room is a **bath**room that has either a shower or tub with 1 sink and 1 toilet. The advantage of a ¾ **bath** is to save space, making it more efficient for smaller homes and apartments over a full **bath**. These **bath**rooms are generally found in large apartments and mid-sized houses, making them much more common than a full **bath**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In order to be considered “full,” a **bath**room needs to have all four of the main fixtures: A toilet, sink, **bath**tub, and shower. The shower can either be combined with or separate from the **bath**tub. Occasionally, you’ll see the term “five-piece **bath**room,” refer to having a separate **bath**tub and shower stall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The types of people you have in your home can also affect your **bath**room size. For example, small children and the elderly prefer **bath**tubs as it is much easier to use compared to a shower. On the other hand, young adults and teenagers prefer showers as they can easily enter and exit without trouble. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you can add a new three-**quarter** **bath** in the house, you need to know what a three-**quarter** **bath**room is. Simply put, it is a space-efficient **bath**room that includes all the essential elements. In other words, it has a small and functional **bath**room design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have at least 40 square feet of space, you should consider making the **bath**room a full **bath**room instead of three-**quarter**s. This depends on the layout of the room, of course. If it is wide enough to hold a tub, this might be a great option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adding a **bath**room from scratch cost an average amount of $43,232 in 2017. While that might seem like a lot of money, keep in mind that plumbing is expensive. It's best if you have access to water in that location. The simplest way to add a **bath**room is to pick a spot that already has plumbing nearby. Can your new **bath**room go near the laundry room or an existing **bath**room? If so, you can avoid expensive plumbing to get water to the location. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Any **bath**room under forty square feet is considered small. This does not mean it cannot be done, however, with a smaller space. There are creative ways to conserve space in a three-**quarter** **bath**room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the biggest factors in a home's value comes from its location. A smaller home in a good location is more valuable than a larger home in a less desirable location. So, if your home is in a less desirable location, adding a **bath**room will not have as much of an effect on the home's value. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While there’s no official definition of a “luxury **bath**room,” you may also see this term used in real estate listings, along with “deluxe **bath**room.” It could be used to indicate that the materials used to construct the **bath**room are higher-grade, or it could mean that there are additional fixtures beyond the standard four—like a double-sink vanity, or a bidet. (Or all of the above.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As far as function goes, while the 1/2 **bath** won’t solve the morning traffic jam at the shower, it improves the quality of life for everyone in the home. Even if somebody is in the tub, another person can enjoy a private moment without hearing complaints. It also provides a welcome relief and some privacy to house guests. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A 3/4 **bath** is also known as a 3-piece **bath**. It most commonly includes a toilet, basin and shower. However, a **bath**room with a **bath**tub and no shower (along with a basin and toilet) can also be considered a three-**quarter** **bath**room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A 3/4 **bath**room is a great option to have in your home. Sometimes a **bath**tub can look a bit cumbersome, so this **bath**room layout makes for an excellent alternative. Additionally, since the 3/4 **bath**room won't (typically) have a tub, the room can be on the smaller side. This allows you to have significant value in your home without taking up too much square footage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Furthermore, if you have children or older people in the family, it is best to install a **bath**tub for a comfortable **bath**ing experience. However, if you are renting an apartment alone, it is better to go for a shower instead of a full **bath**tub to cut down the maintenance costs of the **bath**room. So, it ultimately comes down to your available **bath**room space, personal needs, and budget. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remodeling this type of **bath**room is always expensive and depends on the space available and materials used. The average price in such a case is approximately $13,000 to 15,000. However, this job may cost you up to $30,000 if your house is old, and you face some unexpected complications. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

We will be discuss the three general sizes for **bath**rooms, namely Full, Half and ¾ or Three **quarter** sized **bath**rooms to help you better decide which size is right for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While 40 square feet may be on the small side, large full **bath**s can easily run up to 146 square feet and beyond. The reason for this is because many are setup to run parallel or jointly with the master bedroom. If you include double vanities, combined with the shower, **bath**tub size and your toilet, you’ll have a **bath**room that is both spacious and easy to use, but be prepared for the average size of these to run between 70-110 square feet not counting your bedroom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many housing listings may describe a home as having a 1 3/4 or 1.75 **bath**. This refers to the number of **bath**rooms and means that the property includes both a full **bath** and a 3/4 **bath**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Building on the three-**quarter** **bath**room, a full **bath** has a tub, shower, toilet, and sink. Without all four of these components, the **bath**room does not qualify as a full **bath**, even if real estate agents say otherwise. Full **bath**rooms are arguably the most valuable to your home as they feature both a tub and a shower, but they can also be quite large, limiting space in your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As space is a premium in these types of **bath**rooms, the layout is usually always the same. The toilet is placed usually against the wall, with the sink or vanity opposite. There usually is a window or some kind of ventilation present, but the room is designed to fit just the sink and the toilet-everything else is secondary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Within a real estate listing, if a home is described as having 2.5 **bath**rooms or 1.5 **bath**rooms, it has a half-**bath**. The half-**bath** has two fixtures, usually a sink and a toilet. However, a **bath**room with a sink and a shower or a toilet and a shower might also be considered a half-**bath**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When remodeling your **bath**room, it is important to know how big your **bath**room is and what you want it for. As you can see, just having a plain **bath**room without a shower or **bath**tub quickly lowers the price and the size requirement for your house. Full sized **bath**s are quite desirable, but not all houses can support one, so research accordingly to find the right size for your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For instance, standard shower designs can easily fit within a 32 square feet area. In comparison, you will require a space of at least 40 square feet to install a **bath**tub in the 3/4 **bath**room. Hence, you need to carefully determine the available **bath**room space before installing any **bath**room fixtures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unfortunately, most houses don’t offer this comfortable option because of the space required. If there is, it will be one, usually a master **bath**room, in most cases. There are a few specifics that every full **bath**room needs to meet: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your house contains an equal number of bedrooms and **bath**rooms, an additional full **bath** will increase its overall value by 20%. At the same time, a half-**bath** will increase it up to 10%. In case you have a bedroom without a **bath**, that percentage can be even higher. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adding a **bath**room to your home will raise its value significantly, depending upon factors such as its location and condition. For a comfortable three-**quarter** **bath**room with a shower, you should plan on at least 32 square feet of space, though you can get away with a smaller space if necessary. Any **bath**room with less than 40 square feet of space is considered small. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, let’s start with the whole caboodle: a full **bath**room. In order for a room to be listed as a “full **bath**,” it must contain four key fixtures: a toilet, sink, **bath**tub, and shower (or shower/**bath** combo). A full **bath**room off the master bedroom is one of the most desired features by today’s home buyers, according to a survey conducted by the National Association of Home Builders. Other features that are popular in a full **bath** but are not necessary for that designation include a linen closet, bidet, makeup station, and/or double sink. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A three-**quarter** **bath**room usually has a sink, toilet, and a shower. On a rare occasion, a three-**quarter** **bath**room may have a tub instead of a shower. A full **bath**room has a sink, toilet, shower, and tub, and a half-**bath**room has just a sink and toilet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can expect that a **quarter**-**bath**room takes up very little space. To make it more spacious, you should mount a round toilet instead of a model with an elongated bowl. Believe it or not, it can save you at least 2 inches (5 cm). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A half-**bath** or half **bath**room is also called a powder room or, sometimes, a guest **bath**room. It's commonly found on the main level of the home. This type of **bath**room is intended for guests or for those that cannot access the upstairs **bath**room or the master **bath**room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moreover, if your house is located in a less desirable region, adding a fancy 3/4 **bath**room won’t add any extra value to the home. But, if your house is located in a highly desirable area, even a small 3/4 **bath** can greatly impact its overall value. So, along with the number of **bath**rooms, the house location also impacts its valuation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With the size being smaller, the layout changes quite a bit from a full **bath**. Since the space is smaller, the layout needs to be more compact. The shower or **bath**tub is still placed hugging the wall or window, but usually the toilet is placed right next to it in an attempt to save space. The sinks are usually placed on the other side of the toilet, typically closer to the door or entrance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your space is smaller than 27 square feet, you might want to consider simply adding a half **bath**room instead of a three-**quarter** **bath**room. This would be helpful if you don't need an extra shower but still want another **bath**room. You would then have a more spacious half **bath**room instead of a cramped three-**quarter** **bath**room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The average size of a half **bath**room is anywhere between 16-20 square feet. Typical dimensions range from 4×4, 4×5, or 6×3, with most sizes ranging from 18 square feet to 22 square feet on the high end. The space needs to be big enough to accommodate a sink and a toilet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When searching listings for a new home or flat, and it lists a 1.75 **bath**, the house will have 2 **bath**rooms. However, the 3/4 or .75 **bath** will be much smaller than the main **bath**. If you run into a listing that only has a 3/4 **bath**, expect it to be a little smaller. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The math is simple: Each utility is counted as one-**quarter**, so you add and deduct a **quarter** for each one, as the case may be. Therefore, a **bath**room with a sink, toilet, and shower is considered a three-**quarter** **bath**. A **bath**room with just a sink and a toilet is a half-**bath**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This type of small-sized **bath**room features only two out of four primary elements that make equipment of a full **bath**. In almost all cases, it includes a toilet and sink. The term ‘powder room’ goes back to the Victorian era. It was a small room or closet where people powdered their wigs. Nowadays, it is a makeup space for women. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A full **bath** will have a toilet, basin, shower and tub. In some instances, it may feature a shower/**bath**tub combination. However, it will always have the 4 main fixtures or components of a **bath**room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Is a half **bath**room defined as sink + toilet (without **bath**tub or shower)? Is there a definition of a **quarter** **bath**room? What, if anything, would you define a standalone sop sink in a Washer/Dryer room or another sop sink in a basement? Curious... I guess I would hope a **quarter** would be a stand alone sink. A stand alone toilet isn't very sanitary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your budget will play a large role in determining your final **bath**room size. The larger the **bath**room you choose, the more expensive it will be. So consider your budget carefully and plan accordingly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
