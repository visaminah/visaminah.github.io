## 5 Interesting Facts Best Project Management App For Architects | best project management software for architects

It can save you up to 70% of time spent creating field maps, and the punch lists detail deficiencies straight from the field. Collaboration is simpler too – you can send lists to colleagues and ask for updates, share observations with assignees and subcontractors, upload photos, diagrams and notes, and get real-time feedback. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As a specialist time tracking application, Timely offers **architects** supreme accuracy and usability compared to the tracking features of all-in-one project **management** solutions. Timely makes project budget and time control effortless by automating the entire process. It automatically records all desktop and web activity to a private timeline, so you don’t have to take notes or fiddle with manual timers as you move between tasks. Using AI, it can even use that data to draft timesheet entries for your approval. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the newest project **management** tools for **architects** is also one of the best. IngeniousIO is all about ending the inefficiencies and fragmentation of architectural and construction workflows.

IngeniousIO removes the need for any document exportation and allows you to streamline the entire project process, from start to end. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While managing projects is highly complex at the best of times, for **architects** project **management** is a whole other beast entirely. No matter how small your architectural office is, every project requires faultless coordination, resource **management**, tool **management**, time tracking and invoicing if it’s going to work. When you throw field reporting, construction coordination and a ton of external consultants into the mix, things quickly become overwhelming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Luckily there’s a ton of bespoke project **management** software for **architects** out there – you just need to pick the right one. All-in-one solutions keep all project **management** in one system, but can be too generalist to be truly useful – providing a collection of lackluster features. Targeted niche software excels at doing a few jobs extremely well, but increases the number of tool subscriptions you have on the go. Of course, all software can suffer from poor usability – with clunky interfaces that require ongoing **management** or input – sucking hours out of your day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
