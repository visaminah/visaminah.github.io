-   On the whole, it’s not about the color itself; it’s about the things that are associated with this color and how it works in specific color combinations. As we have discussed, neon pairs and vibrating color combos are just too aggressive to the viewers’ eyes, so that instead of attracting their attention, these **colors** put them off. As for the only dark color combinations, the associations, and feelings that these **colors** evoke come into the play. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purple and Green: You should avoid the combination of bright **purple** and green. But dark **purple** and emerald green, on the other hand, can give your outfit a royal feeling. Pastel green like mint goes well with lavender creating spring feelings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, it’s crucial to evaluate the environment in which the combinations are used. A warm and cool tone mixture doesn’t work well in the interior design, and vibrating **colors** are extremely deceiving in web design. Making sure that your chosen qualitative color scheme transmits the message you intend them to and in the most comfortable way possible for the viewer is the safe path for the designer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best solution would be to use a toned-down right shade of one of the **colors**. As you can see in the picture, the neon cyan color was switched to dark indigo blue.

Moreover, in such vibrant color combinations, the neon would be powered by the lightness or, in our case, the darkness of other **colors** to make use of its best qualities. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Similar to the above-mentioned point about neon **colors**, we have another “fighting for your attention” unique combination — a huge design “no go” – vibrating **colors**. So-called vibration happens when two bold similar **colors** (usually with the same intensity) are placed next to each other. They create an impression of movement: some flow on top of each other, and others resemble a dent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The right side of the painting is a cool muted **purple**, though lighter than the other side of the wall. The lower far left side of the wall is much darker and slightly warmer than the right side. However, there are patches of lighter areas on the left side of the wall as seen by the middle arrow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hue – The terms “color” and “hue” are often used interchangeably by artists and designers. For all intents and purposes, this will get you by but the words “color” and “hue” actually mean different things. In general, “color” is used to refer to all, well, **colors**, including black, white and grey. While “hue” refers to the origin of the color we see. It is the base of the color we see and is always one of the six primary and secondary **colors** on the color wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Pairing yellow or mustard **colors** with **purple** can work and traditionally evokes feelings of royalty. Purple is bold, as we’ve mentioned, so pairing it with a bright color like yellow just works. The key to this color combination is to find a balance, which will take a bit of planning. Yellow walls with **purple** furniture or **purple** walls with yellow accents? The decision is yours depending on what you’re going for, but either way, you’ll be pleasantly surprised. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re going for a contemporary look, **purple** walls with black accents will create a deep vibe that achieves just that.

Often just adding a small amount of **purple** can help to create a rich and complex color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tone – This is very similar to “tint” and “shade,” only instead of being a hue with white or black added to it, it is a hue with only grey added to it. The grey that is added to make a “tone” must only consist of black and white, no other **colors** (many **colors** that are considered grey actually have a base that is a hue). Toned **colors** tend to be viewed as more sophisticated than pure hues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   **purple**’s complementary **colors** are basically, yellow, Green & Light Green and you can’t go wrong with a neutral grey. but for spaces you’re designing for people to gather, we can say amethyst is a must not only it is a mythical and spiritual color, but it works well with muted **colors** like gray.

-   Purple and lime green have gone together for ages, especially lavender and lime green in nurseries or children’s rooms. But if you’re not decorating a kid’s room and want to try out this look, don’t be afraid to experiment with darker shades of **purple** paired with lime green for a contemporary look. Since the two **colors** are drastically different, they demand attention when paired together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I am showing a painting by one of the old masters to prove that they too used the color **purple**!

The color scheme works very well as Vermeer uses a complementary color palette. Since the girl in the painting is dressed in yellow and the background is in **purple** the painting provides a beautiful Purple – Yellow complementary color scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, you can also mix dark shades of **purple** using Provence Violet Bluish or any other lighter **purple** color. Though keep in mind that when using Provence Violet Bluish you will end up with a lighter **purple** than Dioxazine Purple. However, you can still make a dark **purple** color with it as seen in the color chart. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Usually, having two (or more) neon **colors** results in them fighting for your attention, meaning that, in the end, it’s just hard to concentrate on any of them. Also, it’s just painful for some people to look at a bunch of neon **colors** in one go because it hurts their eyes. Not the best way of transmitting information if you ask me. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now that we’ve had an introduction to color theory, we should take a quick peek at the psychology of color. This is important because the **colors** and hues you choose set the tone for how your customers and clients feel about your website, business cards, and/or office space. Choosing a color combination is not about choosing the **colors** that you like, it’s about choosing the **colors** that evoke the emotions that you seek from your audience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

With a bit of planning and experimenting, you can find endless ways to incorporate **purple** into your home decor. Don’t be afraid to get creative with your color choices; you won’t regret it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

In the color chart below you can see that Blue (Cobalt Blue and Ultramarine Blue) can be mixed with Burnt Siena to create a **purple**.

However, if you do not have any of these **colors** on hand. Simply use the blue and red **colors** that you have to make **purple**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to introduce some **purple** into your home decor but don’t want to go contemporary or bold, light blue is the way to go. Light blues paired with **purple** will give you a more traditional or country vibe while remaining fresh and unique. Something as simple as a baby blue lamp with a bright **purple** lampshade will liven up the room while bringing in a pop of color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The effect of disturbance and disarrangement as if something is wrong, but you are not sure what exactly. On the one hand, it has no distinct mood, and it’s hard to notice something. On the other hand, when you do notice the **colors**, it has no point of visual interest. You would probably want to skim the piece and move on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As we have already mentioned, **colors** have different moods and associations, and they influence us even more when we are placed in a room filled with certain hues. For example, a living room with marigold orange walls would bring a sense of coziness and playfulness. On the contrary, a bedroom with navy blue decor would create a refreshing and calm ambiance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, we will take a look at what **colors** make **purple** when mixed together. Then I will show you how to make different shades of **purple**. So that you can create any **purple** color you may need – let’s get into it! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You might be wondering, how come cool and warm **colors** make a bad combination. We all know the rules of complementary **colors** and how they look good together. Green goes well with magenta and blue looks great with yellow. And I agree with that – complementary **colors** make a great base for color palettes if you know how to use them properly. However, let’s move to a more specific sphere – interior design and see how complementary **colors** react in the environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Neon **colors** are known for being eye-catching, bold, and daring. However, with such distinct qualities, they are also referred to as disturbing and reckless. Because of these two contradicting sides, having two or three neon **colors** alongside each other is not the best of options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
