## 90 Things You Should Know About List Of Vintage Axe Makers | 19 Types of Axes and Their Uses (Photos Plus Buying Guide)

-   The best quality **axe**s have wooden handles, though increasingly big box stores are selling **axe**s with rubber handles. A wooden handle is more ergonomic and will last longer. For the best quality, look for a hickory or ash handle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The blade of a felling **axe** has a flared shape and a sharp and thin tip. These are designed to cut against the grain of the wood, so when felling a tree, it should be swung sideways at the tree trunk.

This is a type of carpentry that was commonly used before industrial sawmills came into being. In order to facilitate the hewing process, one side of this **axe** is flat, while the other has a broad beveled edged blade for chopping. It is a medium-sized hand tool which is now commonly used by carpenters, and rarely seen in general use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Except possibly for Kelly **axe**s, production locations are unknown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Viking **axe**s were used throughout the Viking Age as battle weapons. Though it is true that many Viking **axe**s were large, you’d be wrong to assume they were brutish and cumbersome. Well-made Viking **axe**s were exceptionally well balanced and could weigh less than two pounds, making them light to carry during battle, and swift to use. The size of these **axe**s varied greatly, though most were double-handed, with handles being as long as 55 inches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The ideal size of an **axe** handle is a much-debated topic and one that will largely be determined by its intended use. For a felling **axe**, a longer handle will give a greater swing and more leverage, but a shorter handle will result in better precision. The standard length of a full-sized felling **axe** is 36 inches, but this should be the maximum length most users should consider. A person who is six foot tall would be best with a handle measuring around 32 inches, as this will offer a good balance between accuracy and force. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   430 Kelly True Temper 5 1/2 lb lb rafting **axe** in excellent, little used condition. 8 1/2 x 5 x 32", 3.3kg - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A hunter’s **axe** is the essential tool for a hunter, serving the dual purpose of chopping wood and meat. A good hunter’s **axe** will have a grooved handle, which improves grip even if the user’s hands are wet or sticky, be it from rain or animal blood. An ordinary **axe** would not work well to skin an animal, as the straight poll with sharp corners is likely to inadvertently damage the animal hide. By comparison, a hunter’s **axe** has a rounded ‘flay poll,’ which will be more useful for animal skinning. This type of **axe** is not widely available, and you would need to find a specialist forger to buy a hunter’s **axe**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   418 Kelly Rockaway pattern 3 1/2 lb with good **vintage** hickory handle. 8 x 5 x 30", 2.3kg - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Forest **axe**s are robust **axe**s that are solely used for felling trees. They are extremely heavy-duty tools and are too cumbersome to carry around on camping trips, but it would be great to store permanently at a cabin in the woods. These **axe**s have extra long handles and are intended to cut down very large trees. A forest **axe** will have a sharp and flared blade with a slightly curved tip. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The other head is a hammer, which is for pounding in roofing nails when fixing shingles to the roof. Often, the hammer head will be magnetized, so you won’t need to hold the nails in place, and instead just attach them to the front of the hammer and jam them in. Roofing **axe**s also have an additional feature, in the form of a node on the sharp blade side. This node is a shingle gauge, which can be used by hooking it over the front face of the shingle below the one you are setting, with the hammer head pointing upwards. The next shingle should sit up against the hammer head, giving you evenly placed rows of shingle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, eBay sells a variety of used hatchet or **axe** shafts and heads. You can choose a set of shafts in the wood that you prefer. You can also find handles or shafts in various lengths.

-   458 Impressive French Doloire broad **axe** / hewing **axe** with old handle including worm holes. Steve was lucky to get this one through customs/quarantine without fumigation. I believe the stamping reads Thibeau, Libourne which would put this **axe** right into the centre of the Northern Gironde wine making region and most probably in the hands of a cooper but these aptly named 'shoulder of mutton' **axe**s were used by many other trades and even weapons going back to the Middle Ages. 6" deep with a 13" cutting edge, overall length 28", 3.4kg - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   453 Kelly True Temper half **axe** with hardwood handle. Mild pitting marks. 6 1/4 x 3 3/4 x 23", 1.5kg - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Around 1900, all-steel heads came into use. An online video from 1964 captures the effort required to make **axe**s, including steeling the head and hanging ("hafting") a handle or haft.[2] Initially, output was limited to felling ("chopping") **axe**s and soon grew to over 300 **axe** heads per day.[3] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   444 Kelly Flint Edge/ True Temper Rockaway pattern 3 1/2 lb fitted with re-used **vintage** hickory handle. 7 x 5 x 26", 1.9kg - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **axe**s are specifically designed for felling trees and chopping logs of wood. The head of a felling **axe** will weigh between two and four pounds, and sit at the end of a long handle. This long handle enables the user to produce a more powerful swing with greater leverage, making for a better cut. Traditionally the handles are made from hickory wood, which is strong. The grain of the hickory should follow the handle lengthways and curve along with it, for superior strength. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   478 True Temper Flint Edge 12" broad **axe** in very good condition. 8 1/2 x 12 x 32", 3.9kg - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The double bit **axe** has two blades, one on either side of the head. These will usually be symmetrical from the front, but one blade will blunt while the other is sharp. The sharp side would be used to chop wood or fell trees, and the blunt side used to split the wood into small pieces of kindling ready for the fire. These types of **axe**s are not in mainstream production anymore and are now only used by lumberjacks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   This type of medium-sized **axe** was designed by Canadian fur trappers. They used it to chop firewood while on extended trips to the cold north, and also as an all-purpose **axe** for other tasks. Size-wise, it is in between that of a hatchet and a full-sized felling **axe**. It can be used with one hand or with both, and is good for smaller chopping and splitting jobs. It won’t be much use on larger trees, but its size makes it more manageable to camping trips. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   415 Embossed 12" broad **axe** Clean Cut, also marked DCH SF ( Hardware Wholesaler Dunham Carrigan Hayden Co San Francisco) Crisp logo, nice showy **axe** with just a few pitting spots to the toe. 9 1/2 x 12 x 32", 4.3kg - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The tactical **axe** is a modern invention, which is something of a multi-tool. Also commonly known as a tactical tomahawk, this **axe** has gained popularity among law enforcement officers, soldiers, and security staff, as well as survivalists. The primary use of this **axe** is chopping, but it can also function as a close-range weapon, a shovel, a pry bar, and a hammer. It’s ideal for camping trips, as it can help with cooking, chopping wood for campfires, and digging holes. These **axe**s are generally made from steel so that they have the strength to cope with a multitude of tasks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   472 Collins 6 1/2 lb felling **axe** with painted hickory handle. Very good, little used. 11 x 4 1/2 x 32", 3.6kg - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also known as a ‘cutter mattock,’ a grub **axe** has a head with an **axe** on one side and an adze on the other side. The **axe** blade will be at a vertical angle, while the adze blade, which is the longer of the two, will be at a horizontal angle. The name ‘grub **axe**’ comes from the way the tool is used, as it is great for grubbing in compacted soils and rough terrain. These tools are very useful in the garden, as they can dig holes to set new plants in or break up resistant roots of old plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   488 Little used Marples slaters **axe**. 5 1/2" wide with 9" cutting edge. Overall length 14 1/2" - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   William Mann Jr. first arrived in Bellefonte in 1823, and together with his brother Harvey built an **axe** factory at Boiling Spring on Spring Creek's Logan Branch. For the next 100 years, members of the Mann family would establish and operate **axe** factories at four main locations in central Pennsylvania: Axemann-Bellefonte in Centre County (Spring Creek); Reedsville-Yeagertown and Lewistown in Mifflin County (Kishacoquillas Creek); and Mill Hall in Clinton County (Fishing Creek). Affiliated operations occurred at Paradise, Unionville, Tyrone, Mackeyville, and Flemington, PA. Throughout this lengthy period, the businesses endured despite personal illness, early deaths, family disputes, financial difficulties, and fire and flood disasters that often struck **axe** works. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The heads on Viking **axe**s could be varying shapes, but predominantly they are noted for being heavily bearded. This shape was useful for a variety of things in battle, such as hooking an opponent’s ankle to trip them over or hooking their shield out of the way to render them defenseless. The tips of the blade would be incredibly sharp so that they could slash throats like with a knife, and the blunt butt of an **axe** would also be utilized, usually to bang someone on the head to cause a humiliating but not lethal blow. The heads were almost always made from iron, while the handles were wooden. These types of **axe**s are no longer used today; instead, they are studied to learn about past civilizations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Canfield, James (1976). "County’s **axe**-making history began in 1835" and other titles. Lewistown Sentinel, Jan 20–23, 1976. Describes **axe**-making in Mifflin County. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Today, the factory site on Water St. is a senior citizen housing complex – Mann Edge Terrace. A replica of MET's office signage is placed outside the housing agency offices. After 175 years of entrepreneurial vigor, all Mann factories in central Pennsylvania disappeared from public view: Axemann (1828–1892); Reedsville (1835–1903); Yeagertown (1840–1927); Tyrone (1881–1890); Mill Hall (1849–1926); and Lewistown (1893–2003). Many **axe**s produced by the Mann Family live on as items prized by collectors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The original throwing **axe** was used by foot soldiers in the middle ages as a weapon in battle, which was thrown at an opponent to cause fatal damage. In recent years, **axe** throwing has been introduced as a competitive sport that is growing in popularity. The **axe**s used in this sport can vary in type and design, but their main feature is that they need to be incredibly durable and sturdy so that they can cope with the pressure they are put under from numerous throws. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The weight of the **axe** head will affect its use. If it’s too heavy, you will gain force but lose accuracy, while if it’s too light, it won’t cut very deep. For your first **axe**, the head should weigh no more than three pounds, and you can work up to heavier bits with more experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   455 Reaney & Sons Irish pattern felling **axe**, re-steeled by Ron Devin. 9 1/2 x 5 1/2 x 30", 2.2 kg - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **axe**s are specifically designed for splitting logs into kindling. They have a design very similar to a felling **axe**, with a long wooden handle to give a good swing. When using a splitting maul, you should use a downward swing, not a sideways swing like that used for a felling **axe**. Unlike felling **axe**s, which cut against the grain of the wood, splitting mauls cut with the grain, which is what results in split wood rather than chopped wood.
