## 31 Shocking Facts About How To Take Apart A Bathroom Faucet | How To Remove Bathroom Faucet Handle
-   If you are not used to working with plumbing or taking a **faucet** **apart**, it can be easy to forget what part goes where, even if you just took it **apart** five minutes ago. To avoid this problem and the need to call a plumber to put your single-handle **faucet** back together, take a video of yourself disassembling the **faucet** (or just take pictures along the way) to help keep track of each part. It's a simple way to save yourself a lot of headaches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remove the screw from the middle of each **faucet** handle with a screwdriver. Lift the handles off the **faucet**s. Remove a corroded handle with a handle puller. Compress the two jaws at the bottom of the puller around the base of the handle. Turn the handle at the top of the puller in a clockwise direction to draw the handle off the **faucet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have water at the base of your **faucet**, check to see if it is running down the spout and puddling at the base. This can be caused by a loose or faulty aerator or even by a small pinhole in the spout. If all looks good and the problem is not a leaky **faucet** spout, then the problem could be a loose retaining nut under the dome cap. Remove the **faucet** handle and the dome cap and check to make sure the nut is tight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Delta makes a key for removing a Delta **faucet** aerator, and you can also buy a third-party key that works on most available **faucet**s, including Delta **faucet**s. If you don't have a key, you may, in true DIY style, want to look for an implement you already have that will do the job rather then waiting for a key to be shipped to your door. Several tools and utensils will do the job, but you might not need any of them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The type of water control valve your **faucet** uses is not always readily apparent just by looking at the **faucet**. For example, a single-handle kitchen **faucet** could use a ball, a disc, or a cartridge **faucet** valve. Usually, though, a single-handle cartridge **faucet** will give you the distinct sensation of the inner cartridge lifting upward when you turn the water on. With ball-type or disc-type **faucet**s, the sensation is inner parts sliding or rotating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It can also be that the rubber or plastic gasket under the **faucet** is cracked or faulty, allowing water that puddles on the counter or sink rim to leak through. To fix this problem, you will need to remove the **faucet** and replace the gasket or seal it with plumbers' putty before reinstalling. For a homeowner who is uncomfortable working with plumbing, this will probably require calling in a plumber to fix the leak. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before following this guide, ensure the replacement **faucet** is the right pick for the sink it is being placed in. The replacement **faucet** in this guide is a MOEN Adler 4-inch Centerset Single-Handle Low-Arc Bathroom Faucet. The **faucet** being replaced is an older model of the same kind. Be wary that the instructions for alternative **faucet**s may differ slightly. However, most **faucet**s have similar parts so this guide will still be helpful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This type of leak could also be caused by a faulty cartridge, which is also the cause of a dripping **faucet**. The solution is the same for either problem: replace the cartridge. If there is water coming from under the single-handle **faucet** beneath the sink or counter, it could be caused by a variety of problems, including a leaky or faulty supply line or supply line nut. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also keep in mind that there are different types of internal valves for single-handle bathroom **faucet**s, including cartridge, rotary ball and ceramic disc. According to Fine Homebuilding, ceramic disc valves are less likely to leak and will generally last longer than other types of **faucet** valves. While different **faucet** brands have different internal valves, most single-handle bathroom **faucet**s can be taken **apart** and repaired using the same basic steps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If water begins to spurt erratically from your **faucet**, it’s probably time to clean the aerator. Fortunately, this is one of the easiest plumbing tasks you’ll ever have to do. Get water flowing smoothly again by removing mineral deposits and other debris from your **faucet**’s aerator by following these simple steps: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the water from your **faucet** comes out as a stream of fine bubbles, the **faucet** has an aerator. If you can't see the aerator on the end of the spout, it's a cache aerator. The name indicates that the aerator is tucked up inside the **faucet** spout, and if you need to remove it, which you do from time to time, you can't do it with a wrench. The cache aerator is a common feature on Delta **faucet**s, so to complete a basic Delta **faucet** repair, you need a tool to remove the aerator. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first thing to do when you realize that you have a leaky **faucet** is investigate the source of the leak. If the water is dripping from the spout, that's a pretty clear sign that the internal valve isn't shutting off the water completely, and the **faucet** cartridge needs to be replaced. If you have a leak around the **faucet** base or underneath the **faucet**, it could either be water running from the **faucet** body or from a different source. Because different leaks require different repairs, it's important to determine where it's leaking before taking the **faucet** **apart**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A single-lever **faucet** gets a lot of use because the lever is continually moved to change the water from hot to cold. After awhile, the parts break down and you may get a leak from the base or a drip from the spout. Disassembling the **faucet** allows you to examine the parts to determine which ones need to be replaced and what other repairs are necessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Took your **faucet**’s aerator **apart** to clean it? Trying to figure out how to put it back together again? Internet absolutely no help because it tells you that you should have noted how it came out in the first place? Yeah, I’m with you, pal, and you’ve come to the right place. This is how. Click on the photos for larger versions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Third-party manufacturers sell similar keys of different sizes joined in a cross-shaped tool, but the most ingenious key of all is a flat one with two pairs of evenly spaced projections on the ends. This key, manufactured by Zurn, is widely available online and costs less than $2. If you have a **faucet** with a cache aerator, you need one of these keys. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now it’s time for the real fun to begin. Aerators simply twist off of **faucet** spouts, so they are generally pretty easy to take off. That said, sometimes the mineral deposits act like miniature welds, which can increase the difficulty tremendously. If you cannot twist off the aerator by hand, wrap a cloth around the aerator to protect it and use a pair of pliers or an adjustable wrench to twist it off by force. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My bathroom **faucet** is leaking around the base of my right handle. With previous **faucet**s I've been able to use a set screw to loosen the handle and replace the washer. With these, though, I can't seem to pop off the **faucet** handle. Does anyone know how to remove this handle? Does anyone know the brand of this **faucet**? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After screws are out, pull out the handle with your plain hand. If stuck, use a plier to grasp parts of your **faucet** and pull the handle out. As said earlier, try covering the sink and base of your **faucet**’s handle to avoid unnecessary scratches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   6. Once the screw has been removed, you should be able to pull the handle off yourself. However, you may need a specific tool like the **faucet** handle puller or a pair of pliers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Repairing a leaky single-handle bathroom sink **faucet** is often a lot simpler than you think. With the right tools and parts, a **faucet** repair can be completed in just a few minutes by most homeowners, even those with little or no plumbing experience. By doing the work yourself, you will save money on the cost of a plumber and stop that annoying drip in less than an hour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the leak is minor, you can definitely try a DIY approach. If it is severe, you will always want to call in a professional! Did you know that the most common cause of a leaking **faucet** is a worn or missing O-ring? This is definitely DIY-friendly repair if you are feeling ready for it. Steps include: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You might not want water to spill off all over the surface. When working with **faucet**s, it is always recommended to turn off the water supply as this prevents water from flooding out. This can be done by turning off valves located under the sink. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 2: Shut off the supply valves under the sink. Turn the **faucet** handle on to completely drain the lines. With the aerator removed and the **faucet** handle in the on position, turn the water supply back on. The sudden burst of water may remove the debris that’s gotten stuck inside. If you still hear the noise, the debris may be trapped inside the **faucet** itself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As the name implies, an aerator oxygenates the water coming from the spout while saving water by reducing flow, and it does this through a very simple mechanism. The reverse side of the aerator, which is the part inside the **faucet**, is punctuated with many tiny holes. When water is forced through one of them, the pressure increases. The result is that, instead of a languid waterfall from the spout, you get a brisk, invigorating spray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your **faucet** handle or knob will have a small cap located at its base. Pop the cap off with a small screwdriver. Use an Allen wrench or small screwdriver to remove the screw, then carefully use your hand or pliers to remove the handle of the **faucet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. If your **faucet** has a cartridge, keep reading as you will next unscrew the top piece and expose the top of the cartridge. If the **faucet** does NOT have a cartridge, you have reached the actual **faucet** from which the water comes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, removing the **faucet** handle with a capped screw mount can be tricky. In this type of **faucet**, screws are hidden below caps or plugs to make the **faucet** look screwless. If you are dealing with capped screw mounts, follow the next steps shown below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Gently slide the retainer clip (#3) back into the valve body (#4) on top of the cartridge (#1). If you encounter any resistance, do not force the retainer clip (#3). The cartridge (#1) may not be properly aligned, see step 1. If the retainer clip (#3) cannot be installed for any reason or appears to be damaged or broken, the water cannot be turned back on to the **faucet** until the retainer clip (#3) is replaced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you notice that it is very weak, or it is cracked, you will need to replace it in order to make sure that your **faucet** is working properly. The only time you can repair a cartridge is if it is build-up. All other issues should get a replacement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cartridge **faucet**s come in both single-lever and two-handle versions, and various models use different types of plastic or brass-body cartridges. In a single-handle **faucet**, the handle raises or lowers the cartridge within the **faucet** body to start and stop the flow of water. Both hot and cold water flow into the same cartridge, and a turn of the handle controls the mixture and temperature. Two-handle cartridge **faucet**s operate similarly, but in this design, there are two cartridges, each controlling the flow of either hot or cold water. In these, the motion of the handle twists the cartridge rather than lifting it up and down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 1: Check the aerator that’s at the end of the spout. Use the tool that came with the **faucet** to unscrew the aerator counterclockwise by hand. Simply unscrew the aerator at the end of the spout and check it for any debris. You can scrub it with a toothbrush and a solution of white vinegar and water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
