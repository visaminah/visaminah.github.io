In contrast, it's almost effortless to take your bare-faced look to stunning with a few tips that will play up your natural beauty. The choices are endless! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Darker shades of eyeshadow are ideal for dark brown eyes. Choose a charcoal gray, a sweet plum, or a fir green color. The aim is to turn up the notch of intensity to your look. And finish it off with a **black**, navy, or brown eyeliner. This will add depth to your allure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light brown and blonde hair **colors** will be stunning with your light skin tone and green eyes. Consider also adding blonde highlights if you’re getting light brown hair. These highlights add depth to the hair and flatter your eye color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The importance of having a good hair color is that it can make you look more attractive. This is why experimenting with various shades and **colors** for your hair is important. There are various shades that work well on people who have blue, green or brown eyes. Golden-brown hair with green eyes would be a good example of the type of color that would enhance the individual’s beauty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With such gorgeous brown eyes, both warm and cooler tones brighten up your look. So, play with both according to your mood, the occasion, and your tastes. For work, you can turn to more neutral and subtle tones, whereas for a night out, you can blend more unique **colors** for a wild, interesting look. Everything is about what you want! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can enhance your porcelain complexion by wearing your hair in contrasting **colors**. Use dark shades like **black** and brown. Dark blonde hues also pair well with your fair skin and green eyes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purple will flatter many different eye **colors**, and brown is absolutely one of them. Whether you have light, medium, or dark brown eyes, you will find that you add depth to your look because purple is an intriguing color. Take the time to speak with a makeup artist at a hair salon in Charleston about the different shades that will work with everything from your hair to your eyes to your skin tone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Otherwise, **black** or jet **black** are wonderful **colors**. If you want something brighter, lighter shades of brown are fantastic. Hazels and chestnuts are wonderful for bringing out your beautiful brown eyes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nothing beats the combination of blue and gold. Adding warm gold highlights to brown or **black** hair can intensify the blue eyes magically. The gold tones will also work well to bring radiance to your complexion, making your face look even more graceful. If possible, ask your stylist to blend different gold tones across different sections of your hair to add the perfect finish to your face. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For something lighter, consider a peach or bright rouge. These **colors** may not go well with **black** or brown eyes, but blondes or bright chestnut tones will match well. You could also stick to streaks or highlights of this flashy color to keep from distracting from your eyes! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to color dressing, we’ve covered the best **colors** by skin tone, seasonal trends, what to wear (and avoid) in photos, and even what’s most flattering for blondes, but what about our girls with dark hair? Well, today is all about you (and your locks). While, as you can see, there are so many factors to keep in mind when choosing a color to wear, we thought we’d tailor a story just for our raven-haired readers. So whether you’re looking to expand your selection of neutrals, brights, or both, continue to see and shop the most flattering **colors** for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the best ways to wear your hair to complement dark skin and green eyes is to keep it natural. Natural **black** hair contrasts with green eyes and goes well with dark skin tones. Get chestnut brown hair if you’d like to try something other than your natural **black** hair color. If you want something striking, ask your stylist to color your hair vibrant red, as Rihanna did in the 2010s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Colors to Wear and Colors to Avoid Due to your hair and eye color, there aren't any specific **colors** that you should avoid. Since both are very dark, nothing will clash with them. Focus on your undertones instead. If you have cool undertones, stay away from the yellow-based or golden shadow shades and look for royal purple, deep turquoise, cobalt blue, burgundy, and cool chocolate browns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re a brunette that has a medium skin tone with cool undertones, go for a glossy, rich chocolate brown. Alternatively, a tone with a purplish tinge, or even a blue-**black** colour will offset your complexion. Those with a warmer undertone should keep clear of brunette colours that have a bluish tint to them, but apart from that, anything goes; dark mahogany browns are especially flattering. If you want to go lighter, a honey almond colour works wonders on those with warm undertones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the hottest hair **colors** at the moment, copper hair just so happens to also be one of the most flattering hues for hazel eyes. Try our GO Orange and get the most vibrant and long lasting damage free hair color out there. The contrasting shade will draw out the green and blue tones in your eyes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best bet for people with light brown eyes are golden, champagne, and bronze shades. But that’s not all! Other eyeshadow **colors** like taupe and brown go so well with your eyes, too. If truth be told, applying makeup to light brown eyes is child’s play. Green, yellow, orange, and red hues also show off the beauty of brown eyes. And bold **colors** that pop are a safe bet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Women with warm skin tones and green eyes should get cinnamon, ginger, copper, and light shades of red hair. Go for deep brown **colors** if you want a more low-key hair color to suit your golden skin undertone. These include mahogany, chestnut, auburn, and dark brown hues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The good news is that all hair **colors** look good with green eyes. If you want to know what hair **colors** to avoid with green eyes, take into account your skin tone. If your chosen hair color would make you look old, dull, tired, it’s better to avoid it, even if it basically flatters your green eyes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Olive skin does a great job complementing your green eyes but only if you combine it with the right shade of brown. Very dark brown, which almost seems **black** is a perfect choice. You can also opt for the chestnut brown base with burgundy highlights. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Create Smoky Eyes Smoky eyes are fun and straightforward to produce. If your skin is dark, you can sweep a **black** shadow from your lash line almost all the way up to the crease from the inner corner to the outer. Then fade it out with a lighter brown, pink, or other color you want to incorporate into your look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some women can rock the pale skin **black** hair combo, but not everyone can pull it off. Black hair can wash out your skin. Instead, pick a cool blonde hair color. Some examples are platinum, ash, sandy, and creamy blonde. If you want to try a darker hair color, go for cool brown **colors**, like ashy brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Females with natural olive skin tones look great with red hair **colors**. Your eyes and skin’s green undertones will fit dark reddish **colors** smoothly. Get **colors** like golden blonde, copper, chocolate brown, and rich golden brown. Don’t get hair with blue, green, or violet bases if you have olive skin. Platinum and ashy blonde would also clash with your natural skin tone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We’re well aware that hair color, skin tone, and makeup techniques play a role in the intensity of your eye color. A touch of bold lipstick or a swipe of a striking eyeliner are surefire ways to play up your eye color, but today, we’re proving instead that the extra sparkle in your eye has everything to do with the **colors** of the clothing you wear. Whether you have a set of baby-blue, sparkly green, sharp hazel, or deep-brown blinkers, here are the basic color guidelines to making your eyes look the boldest and brightest they’ve ever been. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark brown hair **colors** look flawless on medium skin tones. Sport those natural coils with utmost confidence by dying them in a rich chocolate hue. Spice up the look further by going for subtle babylights that are one or two tones lighter adding an instant shine to the hair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to go with something lighter, consider sky blues or sapphires. These blues have much more of a pop to them and will stand out much brighter. However, they can sometimes clash with some natural hair **colors**, so try a few out before you decide on the one you love! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Green eyes are perfect for warmer and more natural **colors**, which in this case, are portrayed by blonde hair.

However, this does not make brown hair any less suitable for green hair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

You can add depth to naturally dark hair with tonal highlights in bronzes and lighter browns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hair color choices for cool skin tones include cool-toned blonde, brown, and red hair **colors**. Women with cool skin tones can go for highlighters like taupe, ash, and honey. Try to avoid **black**, gold, caramel, and orange-based hair **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Applying makeup is an art, and it is important that you spend time learning about your canvas and the **colors** that make it stand out. Your eyes are a big part of that canvas, and if you have brown eyes, you will find that there are some specific **colors** that will enhance and make them pop. You won’t always want to wear the exact same shades as a someone with blue or green eyes would, and here we look at the hues that are always a great choice for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Create Eyes That Sparkle Using just liner and mascara on your eyes will give your dark eyes a subtle definition and barely-there drama. This combination will also make your eyes stand out and the whites of your eyes look even whiter: Smudge a little **black**ish-brown (if your skin is light-medium) or **black** (for medium to darker skin tones) eyeliner along your top lash line and the outer one-third of your lower lash line. Apply a pencil or kohl liner and then run over it with a cotton swab for a diffused, shadowy effect of naturally thick lashes. If your lids are oily, set the liner with a similar colored shadow. Put on a **black** lash-defining mascara to accent your eyes without looking overly made up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Copper or other **colors** that can give a neutral feel will be ideal for brown eyes, while still letting them shine. Copper and brown shadows will be perfect for every day when you can’t quite pull off electric **colors** that may not be right for business presentations or other events in your day. You can also jazz this color up by incorporating some fun **colors** on the bottom lash. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark Winter is the colour season reminiscent of deep winter nights, when the stars contrast with the **black**-and-blue sky, creating an atmosphere of mystery and magic. These colours are dark and cool, just like when the moon tints the night sky bright and illuminates the dark, misty forests beneath. Dark Winter colours are the colours of the night. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The complementary **colors** of red and green help each other stand out due to their polar opposite positions on the color wheel. To avoid looking washed out with a pale complexion, steer clear of darker shades. Our favorite hair color for fair skin with cool and warm undertones is a light auburn shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have dark **black** color hair, simply adding a few highlights of balayage or ombré inspired by red tones will do the trick. The benefit is you do not change your entire hair color, and only a few highlights bring out the blue color of your eyes. You could also add some carefully placed sections of deep red that intensify as you move down the hair length. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The range of makeup **colors** for brown eyes is huge. As previously mentioned, brown is a mixture of the primary **colors** red, yellow, and blue. So, any hue in the color wheel goes great with brown eyes! But of all the **colors**, blue tints are the most adapted for brown. We therefore suggest going for the different shades of blue if you want to add makeup to your brown eyes. Electric blue, navy, stone, and even indigo will make your brown eyes shine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Follow these simple and straightforward color suggestions, and watch as compliments start streaming your way.

-   If you have pale, fair skin, you can trust yellow, cool, and neutral tone ash hair color to suit your style perfectly. Some of the combinations you can consider are beige, champagne, bronde (brunette + blonde) and other cool undertones. These hair **colors** will add depth to your hair, making them look voluminous and attractive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Girls with pale skin and light brown eyes can enjoy the bright auburn brown hues. They are usually lighter than brown but not quite dark blonde just yes. Have fun walking the fine line between the two **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mid value **colors** to bright and jewel tones will be more complementary. Now let’s explore that in more detail. I was trained in the color analysis concept and believe that your skin undertone remains the same as you age. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Olive green is a natural, committed color. It is one of the eyeshadows for brown eyes everyone should have in their makeup case. It blends well with other shades of green or brown for an intense gradient effect reminiscent of enchanted woods. It also goes great with taupe or copper natural eyeshadow **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   People with cool skin undertones tend to have blue, green, pale brown or grey eyes and naturally blonde, brown or **black** hair with ash tones. If you’ve got brown, amber or hazel eyes and strawberry blonde, auburn, brown or **black** hair with hints of red, copper or golden tones, it’s likely that you’re warm-toned. Those with neutral skin undertones typically have hair and eyes that are a mix between warm and cool; you might have blue-green eyes with hints of copper, or eyes that can appear slightly cooler or warmer depending on what you’re wearing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For the best match, consider using deep, dark blues. Indigo and navy are two wonderful shades, but you can go as bright as cobalt or lapis and still be in the same aesthetic. These **colors** match wonderfully with naturally dark hair, such as a deep blue highlight to **black** or dark brown hair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Green eyes and beautiful curly locks warrant this royal mix of **colors**. Deepest and richest hues look amazing no matter what your skin tone is. But they do the best job on the pale skin tone. Black, brown, pale, and green are a killer combination. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ivory skin has a fair skin tone with a yellowish tinge. Blonde women with ivory skin and green eyes look beautiful, to say the least. Natural light blonde hair **colors** are definitely the best choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The eyes of a green-eyed girl shine with life and personality. Even when she’s wearing a basic outfit, the color of her eyes will draw in attention. But getting that beautiful shade can be very difficult if you don’t know what **colors** work best for your skin tone. This blog is dedicated to highlighting the best hair **colors** that are perfect for green-eyed girls. We hope this list helps you find some new inspiration! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Enhance Your Eye Color The key to making your eyes appear more intense is **black** eyeliner and mascara. Use a pencil, kohl, gel, or even eyeshadow to line your eyes. Always line the upper lid and the outer one-third to one-half of your lower lash line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
