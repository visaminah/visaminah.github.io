If you plan to make your roller **shade**s stand out, then a nice valance will make them look a lot nicer and sleeker. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Roller **shade**s are exactly what they sound like. It’s a solid piece of material that rolls up and down to cover or expose the window. The material is wound around a hollow tube with brackets on the side to hold the roll in place. You can mount your roller **shade**s inside your window frame or outside the frame. This should be specified when you are entering your order into our website. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

This provides a soft finished look as the folds continue down the window when closed but also are neatly arranged at the top. They are ideal for bedrooms, living rooms, dining rooms and create a casual chic look to your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   In large **shade**s, I like adding hidden rib tape. This tape is adhered on the backside of the **shade** (it doesn’t get sewn through thus interrupting the pattern) with an adhesive and again, especially on a larger **shade** it helps the **shade** raise and lower neatly. A word of caution- if your fabric is thin, and you don’t want to “see” those ribs as the light shines through the lowered **shade** – chose a blackout liner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Style- There are many different styles to choose from, and as the product is custom, you should explore options with your consultant to find the best fit for you space. However, my favorite is a flat **roman** **shade**, with the fabric off the back of the board and a valance – usually 8-10″ off the front of the board. Flat style **shade**s are great at showing off a patterned fabric. They look really nice when stacked up in the window. When you put a valance on the face of them, the treatment has enough depth that it does not look like you are hanging a sheet of the window. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Essentially, the value of retractable screens lies in the convenience of rolling the mesh fabric in and out of its housing as desired. The housing for retractable **shade**s may be mounted to a wall or, in the case of an outdoor patio, a soffit system. Proper installation of retractable screens is key to their reliable performance, which means professional installation by trained and experienced technicians is recommended. If you are planning to have a roller **shade** installed, you’ll also want a screen that’s custom-manufactured to fit the opening you want to **shade**, so that your home will sport the sophisticated look of a tailored fit and also to ensure optimal performance. Again, that means hiring professionals to take precise measurements and determine the best placement of your retractable **shade** to give you the results you’re looking for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Keeping it clean. If you are scared of your beautiful **roman** **shade**s get dirty, consider getting a fabric protection spray.

-   On our blackout rollers (as well as other blackout products) you’ll notice a note in the description explaining the light gap. If you choose inside mount, there is usually a gap of about ¾” on either side.

Here, you can seal just the clearly frayed territories, or you can choose to seal the entire roller **shade**, to keep any future issue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   I would not recommend putting a **roman** blind into a young child’s room unless I was totally sure that every single cord or chain will separate and come away from the blind system. Curtains on a manual track are a much safer and reliable alternative. If you want that extra layer of dim out there are alternative options. If the child is older and more responsible you could put a **roman** blind in without worrying. Common sense is required for anything using cords and loops to operate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A roller **shade**, also known as a retractable blind or screen, can be a great addition to a window or patio to let you control how much of the sun’s light and heat to allow into your home at any given time. Many homeowners prefer to have easily operated retractable screens installed so that they can enjoy **shade** or sun when they want it without expending a lot of effort on rolling the fabric up and down. In fact, with a motorized, remotely operated roller **shade**, a homeowner can simply touch a button to lower the screen when the sun becomes annoying or raise it to let in more light, all without getting up from his or her chair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **roman** mechanisms work on the ratio of transferring rotation from the chain cog to the cord drums that move the fabric. It’s the relation between the length of the chain pulled and the distance the fabric’s travelled. So, with a 1:1 mechanism, one revolution of the chain cog equals one revolution of the cord drum. A 1:4 mechanism utilises a gearbox which decreases the ratio by 4, meaning that one revolution (360 degrees) of the chain cog would turn the cord drum inside a headrail only by 90 degrees. Simply put, the 1:1 mechanism is fast but stiffer to operate and the 1:4 mechanism is slow but easier to operate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This option works very well if you have a very wide window. It breaks up the wide window covering to give it a little more style. It also puts less stress on the **shade** itself. The weight is more evenly distributed so your **shade**s may last longer this way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rollease- A beaded looped chain stays the same length at all times, regardless of where the **shade** is positioned. This is my preferred system. It is available from most all custom workrooms. You can see the metal lift cord if you look to the outside of each **shade** on these doors below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Roman **shade**s feature fabric that folds when the **shade** is lifted. They use a pull cord or a loop of cording to raise and lower the fabric. The cording controls the draping along the bottom of the **shade**, and allows you to set the proper height of the **shade**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main activity when attempting to repair this is to not go about it while the roller blind is yet appended to the window. Rather, expel the roller **shade** from its help, and lay it down on the ground. The best thought here is to put it over old daily papers or another smooth surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
