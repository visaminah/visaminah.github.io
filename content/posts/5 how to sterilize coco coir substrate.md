## 5 Shocking Facts About How To Sterilize Coco Coir Substrate | 25lb pack of 5lb Coco coir+vermiculite sterilized substrate bags
-   Combine 1 part of **coco**nut coir with 2 parts of distilled water (neutral pH, without mineral content) in a clean beaker or container. For example, 50 ml coir with 100 ml distilled water or 1 cup coir with 2 cups water. Mix and let the sample stand for 30 minutes to equilibrate. Pour the mixture into a clean funnel lined with a filter paper. Collect the extract in a clean container, mix again, and place drops of extract ontothe calibrated pH sensor and conductivity sensor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Coir is the fibrous material found between the hard, internal shell and the outer coat of the **coco**nut. Ripe **coco**nuts have thick, strong brown coir, which is typically used in upholstery padding, sacking and horticulture. Unripe **coco**nuts have fine, white or light brown coir, which is used in producing household products such as mats, brushes, strings, ropes and fishing nets to name a few. To harvest coir traditionally, the fibrous husks are soaked in pits or in nets in either fresh water or sea water or both to swell and soften the fibers prior to extraction. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our proprietary substrate mix! Crafted through years of experience providing great results consistently. Tired of reading all the websites telling you to add this that or the other thing? Forget it, weâ€™ve worked through all that ourselves and figured out what works best! This product is **sterilize**d and ready to use. Just mix with your mycelium spawn and you're ready to go! 5lbs is enough substrate mix to top dress multiple bags of mycelium or to create 1 monotub of substrate when mixed with the recommended ratio of spawn in a typical container size; feel free to message us to confirm which size for what size tub. Heat sealed, preventing contaminants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The brown **coco**nut coir has become popular growing substrate or medium in horticulture due to its high lignin content, which lasts long, holds more water, and does not shrink when dry allowing for easy re-wetting. Most commercially available coir is washed thoroughly to remove high sodium and potassium content that can damage crops. After washing, some suppliers treat coir with calcium buffering solution to adjust its cation exchange capacity (refers to the ability of substrate to absorb and release positively-charged cations, thus buffering the substrate against sudden changes in pH or nutrient levels). Good quality coir is essential to achieve optimum growth for your crops. To determine if the **coco**nut coir that you purchased is suitable for growing crops, measure the pH and conductivity before using it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Covering the soil for a longer duration can be helpful, too. One day is effective, but leaving the tarp in place for a week to a month can yield even more impressive results. To **sterilize** media outdoors, solarization should be coupled with a chemical agent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
