## 14 Reference List: White Kitchen Cabinets With Gray Floor Tile | white kitchen cabinets with gray floor tile
-   Create contrast with black floors and white **cabinets** for a retro look. Place some colorful appliances on the counter to create eye-catching accents. Brown flooring: Establish coziness with earthy tones. Brown flooring materials can add some depth to your floors and prevent your kitchen from feeling washed out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can complement white countertops with flooring that suits your style. As you would when choosing **cabinets**, you’ll want to define the aesthetic you want. Come up with a general color scheme for the kitchen before your project begins. We recommend picking two dominant colors and one accent color for your design to avoid a setup that’s too busy or one that lacks depth and contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gray is one of the more trendy floor colors for kitchens with white **cabinets**. Utilize vinyl materials that mimic marble for a one-of-a-kind layout. Beige flooring: Beige floors enhance a warm environment. Beige tiles and vinyl leave room for you to paint the kitchen a different color later without drawing attention to the floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ideally, you’ll pick out the countertops and **cabinets** you want first, and the flooring will complement them. Your countertops and island should serve as the kitchen’s main focal point, so choose the options that highlight those design elements. As long as you select a flooring style that pairs with your dominant color selections, you’ll be in excellent shape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   #2 Grey marble effect tiles A classic décor choice, grey marble looks very elegant against white. The veining pattern is the ideal foil to the even white **cabinets**, adding texture and visual interest. View all grey marble effect tiles → - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark colors, from espresso to true black, make a dramatic statement with white **cabinets**. Dark options are best with white **cabinets** in modern spaces, especially if you have dark accents in your kitchen, such as your backsplash. Medium floors: If dark feels a bit too overwhelming for your kitchen or style, go a few shades lighter with medium colors. A slightly dark **gray** shade is modern, while beige wood tones are natural and versatile. Avoid hues that are too orange, as that can look outdated and clash with your white cabinetry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are two ways to choose a flooring color for your kitchen — coordinate the floor with the countertop and **cabinets**’ colors or use the floor to create contrast. If you opt for the first approach, the colors of countertops and storage compartments serve as secondary colors. Setting up your kitchen with flooring that contrasts with those elements can separate your space from the remainder of the home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   #4 White kitchen & dark floor When it comes to flooring in the kitchen, black and dark greys, such as anthracite, are very forgiving in terms of care and maintenance. The classic combination of black and white is eternally on-trend because these two colours belong together. With dark floor tiles, the flooring becomes a neutral pedestal or blank canvas allowing the **cabinets** to become more of a focus. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   #3 Patterned tiles Against the block-white **cabinets**, a pattern floor tile can become more of a feature in the kitchen. Try to keep a busy geometric pattern within a more controlled colour palette. A single or perhaps two colour scheme will work best. View all patterned floor tiles → - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If we were to list the three most important elements of kitchen design, they would be the **cabinets**, the worktop and the flooring.

This is especially true for white kitchens, as they require careful attention to detail to avoid looking cold or sterile. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If dark feels a bit too overwhelming for your kitchen or style, go a few shades lighter with medium colors. A slightly dark **gray** shade is modern, while beige wood tones are natural and versatile. Avoid hues that are too orange, as that can look outdated and clash with your white cabinetry. Light floors: Light hardwood is the best color floor for a white kitchen if you want to maintain an airy feel. Pine or golden oak options — as long as they aren’t too yellow — will add just enough color contrast to let your kitchen stand out without overwhelming the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
