## 225 Facts Best White Primer For Miniatures | best white spray primer for miniatures
-   My experience with Dupli-Color was that the first half of the can is perfect. It goes on as it should and creates a great surface to be painted. That first half of the can is probably the best **primer** I’ve used ever. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Don’t let the Rust-Oleum Automotive Primer fool you. Even though it has the word “Automotive” in its name doesn’t mean that it’s primarily intended for automotive models only, no. The **primer** can still be used on miniature models but they aren’t exactly ideal for very small models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The advantage of an automotive **primer** is that it is strong. It cures into a very durable surface over which you can paint confidently. Because it also has a subtle gap-filling component, it also helps smooth out layering imperfections, which are a hallmark of fused-deposition modeling (FDM) 3D prints. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best thing about this product is its consistency. The liquid is quite thick, and depending on your requirements, you can apply it in any particular way. If your project requires just a single layer of **primer**, don’t mix any thinner in it, and you are good to go! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you need to get your **primer**s on your models fast, then spraying should get what you need fast. On the other hand, if you need to add **primer**s accurately in specific parts of your model, then the brush method should give you more control. Unfortunately, this is time-consuming compared to sprayable **primer**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the case of most brush-on options, don’t thin the **primer**. Instead, use an ever-so-slightly damp brush – rinsed and squeezed of its excess water – to apply thin (THIN) coats. I like to use a fluffy brush that’s actually designed for applying eyeshadow. It allows me to carry a fair amount of **primer** in my bristles, alternate easily between strokes and stippling (to get **primer** into those details), and helps the process go a bit faster than if I use a smaller brush. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s hardly any downside to this product that we could notice. However, it needs to be mentioned that the price of the product is on the higher end and at par with all premium **primer**s. So, if you are on a modest budget, you might want to look for a cheaper option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to choosing the right **primer** for you, you should base it off according to the colors you will be using. If you are going to use darker colors, then know that you will need a darker **primer** to get the right darkness. On the other hand, if you are going to use light colors, then a light **primer** will fit best. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Regardless, the quality of the coat is something you will definitely be proud of afterwards. It has a really good finish on models but lacks the “hands-on” feeling. But because it gets the job done fast, you can count on the **primer** to finish more miniature products within a specific amount of time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These three **primer**s create a smoother surface without being too glossy, which is intended to reduce the surface tension for Contrast and “one coat” paints so that they apply more evenly. Which is not to say that Contrast paints don’t work on other light **primer**s, or that these **primer**s don’t work for regular acrylic paints. But the smooth finish plus the eggshell colour of Wraithbone and light grey of Grey Seer compliment the Contrast paint style very well, as they can add a warm or cool tint to your transparent Contrast paints. Coverage is pretty decent for such light colours, two maybe three thin coats should be enough most of the time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’ve had good results with cheaper **primer**s for terrain pieces. Cheap spray **primer**s are especially useful for MDF terrain, laser cut parts and terrain pieces, gaming boards, and 3D printed pieces, e.g., PLA or resin 3D printed pieces, which are larger than smaller scale models. Resin 3D printed miniature with white **primer** - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like I said, I liked Krylon but it was getting too expensive. When I couldn’t justify the cost for a can for Krylon, I started looking at **primer**s again. I found this one at an automotive store for less, tried it, and haven’t looked back since. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Primers don’t always have to be the expensive, niche, and one-purpose kind. You can get many cheap alternatives that are packaged as industrial or automotive **primer**s. Krylon is a leading name in such **primer**s which cater to a wide audience with different interests. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Apart from airbrush-like thin layers, you will also get a matte finish which helps outer coats shine vividly. Speaking of thin layers, don’t hesitate to apply multiple layers of **primer**. After all, the product is designed to dry very thinly, so it works hard not to diminish any parts, small or big. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painted models that were primed before painting are less likely to paint chipping when damaged during a game. Imagine that by a mistake you or your friend caused a model to fall from the table on the floor. Such fall can damage the models itself, not to mention the paintjob. Primed models, even when the paintjob is damaged and chipped in few places, should not show the bare metal or plastic, but the **primer** in those chipped places. In some cases, the paintjob will not take any damage thanks to the paint strongly sticking to the **primer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dropper bottles are going to usually be pretty small and offer a pretty low amount of volume. These kinds of bottles are usually designed for smaller **miniatures** and won’t typically last long if you’re an avid painter. The benefits here are that it is great for those who are just starting out with painting **miniatures** due to how affordable they are. You might come across some more expensive kinds of dropper **primer**s but you should probably stay away from these. If you’re going to get a dropper bottle of **primer** remember it’s probably going to be smaller and the **primer** itself might be a little thin. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Applying **primer** to an object will do no harm to anyone. Almost every surface that requires a coat of paint requires a **primer** coat. However, there are some materials that should be almost mandatory to use best miniature **primer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because gesso is thick, it can take much more time to dry than traditional **primer**s. Moreover, it is recommended to do two coats, which may or may not sabotage tiny details. Generally, you have to wait about 24 hours after application for it to be dry enough to use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Terrain pieces also need love and care. However, these require more products, or just one product that has good coverage. This **primer** from Rust-Oleum is great for similarly large and oblique figures that don’t have too much detail. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It doesn’t matter if you’re painting on plastic, metal, or resin **miniatures**, a **primer** coat provides a universal surface for you to work on. One of the most visible ways that **primer**s do this is by smoothing out the texture of a surface. Almost all **primer**s have a matte finish when dry, which gives overlying paint a texture to stick to. This prevents peeling, chipping, and improves the durability of your paint job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The difficult part is figuring out where to start and knowing what you’ll need. Now, getting the paints and the brushes needed are fairly easy and it won’t take long to figure out what you’ll need there. But the most important part that a lot of people don’t realize is that you need to make sure you have a good, high-quality **primer**. It’s necessary to make sure that whatever model you paint looks great and stays looking great. In this list we’ll be taking a look at some of the best **primer**s you can get right now! So let’s jump right into our list for ‘The Best Primer for Miniatures’. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At the end of the day, there’s a lot of worthwhile **primer**s you can find at varying prices. The point is to make sure you’re using one. Seriously. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rattle cans are great for large models, terrain, or when you are priming a lot of minis at a time. Their nozzles are designed to spray paint in a manner that covers a large area. If any of these is the situation where you find yourself, then rattle can **primer** is hands down the way to go for this project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If there’s one piece of painting advice I can give anyone it’s to use a **primer**. The second piece would be to seal your models after. If you do those two things then you’re going to have models that will last you forever. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Consider a Collection of Black, White, and Gray Primer For a complete **primer** set, I recommend you have the three neutral colors available on your workbench: black, white, and gray **primer**. The reason I suggest this is because black and white **primer**s have their place in helping you paint **miniatures** with different techniques. Applying the zenithal highlighting technique with black and white **primer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to **primer**s there’s a bunch of different kinds you can get and they all vary in their own ways. But one of the most important distinctions between different kinds of **primer** is its delivery system. Whether that’s a drop bottle, a spray can or a squeeze bottle. They actually all indicate a variety of different aspects that the **primer** will have. It’s going to indicate its viscosity and will have an impact on the volume of the **primer** you’re going to get. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best practice for painting a miniature requires that you “sandwich” your acrylic paint between a **primer** and varnish. An acrylic layer of paint can absorb moisture, which can lead to subtle warping and expansion of the paint. Hence, you also should use a good varnish seal to protect your models when you finish painting (see more info about best uses for varnishes and my thoughts here). A good **primer** forms the foundation of the protective acrylic paint “sandwich”. A varnish forms the protective exterior seal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Games Workshop Citadel 5120999904206 Spray Paint is a top-notch choice for applying a base coat on plastic, metal, or even resin **miniatures**. The upgraded formula provides a uniform coat of color on all types of miniature models. All this in the least amount of time and with minimal fuss! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing the right **primer** doesn’t just revolve around picking the right texture or shade. You see, there are other factors that could make or break your purchase. In this section, we will cover the things you should worry about besides color or shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remember that the **primer** is simply coating the surface to help prevent your acrylic paint from absorbing into the surface. It’s also smoothing out the surface. Use a large, flat headed brush (synthetic tuft) to brush-on **primer** – you don’t need expensive brushes for undercoating your models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Primers are used as a foundation before you begin painting. You will require a good **primer** to ensure that further applications of products do not result in any problems. A **primer** is a product that is utilized to coat a surface that has not yet been painted. You will use the **primer** to ready the surface for the necessary modeling paint to be applied. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the end, you are left with a perfect matte finish that is far from grainy or chalky. Without a doubt, we urge you to go for this time-tested product which, interestingly, is also weather tested. While it is advised to finish your priming responsibilities before winters set in, this **primer** can work under a variety of weather conditions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Army Painter Primer also comes in a variety of colors, so if you need a specific color base, you can choose from plenty of color options. But of all the colors, the black **primer** has the best reviews. Note that the white **primer** may have a rep of causing problems with the quality of the final surface but most of these were due to environmental conditions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **primer** you choose is up to you as well. Try some different colors and see what you think. Try the spray, airbrush, and brush-on if you like. They all have their use and one of them will suit your needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pros This is a highly recommended all purpose **primer**. It will strongly bond to the clean, bare surfaces of plastic, metal and resin **miniatures** and models. AK Interactive is one of the best **primer**s for those looking for a no-nonsense acrylic **primer**. Due to its formulation, the **primer** applies easily with a brush or airbrush and creates a smooth and even surface for model paint color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Army Painter Primer sells for $15-20. In general, this is similar to the Citadel **primer** (shown above). Army Painter is a modeling company that makes a lot of different products for the miniature hobby. This **primer** is no exception. It is formulated for all types of **miniatures**, including those made of plastic and metal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spray cans of **primer** are the best for those who paint **miniatures** pretty often and they’re especially good for metal figures. They usually offer a ton of volume for a pretty affordable price. They’re also pretty easy to use and apply on to your **miniatures**. It’s much easier to use than other kinds of **primer** that you need to brush in to apply the coat. Though this kind of **primer** also has its negatives too, though it’s all down to preference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I used to promote using dark **primer**s because they can hide some of your paint job’s faults. While that is still true, I have learned over the years that painting over these dark **primer** colors uses a lot more paint to achieve coverage, especially when it comes to bright colors like yellow, orange, and red. Now I usually start with a light grey **primer** or colored **primer** if I am painting up more space marines. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to go with colours, I would recommend the Army Painter spray-on **primer**. I think the cans are easy to use and the color range is just great. I think they have about 12 or more different colors to choose from. They have a color match system. That means, you can also buy the same tone of color as regular brush-on paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With a colored **primer**, you’ll still need to paint the other elements on the model for a decent finish. This means that some of the **primer** color will be covered by overlying paint. This would remove much of the time-saving benefit of a colored **primer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, too much **primer** might make the surface of the miniature too smooth. As mentioned beforehand, **primer** helps the paint to stick on your miniature. This works, because the **primer** kind of roughs up the surface of the figurine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An ingenious combination of Primer and Colour Spray in one. The Army Painter Colour Primers unique formula has been designed to be used on all metal, plastic and resin **miniatures** to leave a perfect finish. The extra-fine pigment and special nozzle combination makes the Colour Primers easily cover the first time. The colours have a matt finish, making your freshly sprayed **miniatures** or models ready for basecoat almost right away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When painting **miniatures**, a **primer** coat is what sets the tone for your final paint. Without good priming, your paint is likely to turn blotchy and chip off soon. However, choosing the right **primer** from the plethora of options that are available on the market is not an easy thing to do. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By not using a **primer** you are only hurting yourself. Your paint is less likely to stick to the model, and in turn more likely to come off either through handling, or by dropping the model. This is especially true on metal models. Oh god, if you don’t prime a metal model first then your paint is not staying on there at all. Trust me. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Automotive **primer**s, which are generally sold for industrial use, come in large cans at cheap prices. These are good fillers for 3D projects, and often cover up blemishes while providing extra durability. The thick coating does provide protection, but it also hides intricate details. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Speaking of finish, the **primer** will go easily over your miniature and leave a clear matte finish that does not obscure even little details. Also, since the product has an oil-based formula fit for exterior use, your **miniatures** are protected from the sun and rain. What’s more, the product can dry as soon as 20 minutes, so you don’t have to wait very long to get on with painting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Any change in air pressure also leads to a change of the pressure within the can. Low temperatures decrease pressure. So there might be less **primer** coming out of your can. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, when we really put it to the test, it scored tens all across the board. The finish is very fine, and no matter how much product you apply, it dries up very thin. This means that none of your details are covered – in fact, they might be highlighted even more. To top it all off, the layer of **primer** dries up in about 10 minutes, so you don’t have to wait too long to start painting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note that there are many colors of Citadel Primer. As mentioned above, each has a purpose. In my opinion, the black **primer** is the best in terms of quality of the **primer** surface. It is also useful for most of us who are trying to paint a lot of **miniatures** in our Citadel model collection. White colored Citadel Primer can be problematic, because I’ve found in my experience that it often leads to a bumpy, powdery surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It takes skill and careful adherence to instructions to get the best out of this **primer**. Since it creates thick layers, we cannot rule out the fact that minute details can get lost. We conclude that this is a good **primer** for larger models, and not so much for high-resolution figures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tamiya is a popular name in the market, and their product, the TAM87042 87042 Surface Primer, is well-loved by many users. This is because of the high-quality materials used in the formula, making the **primer** last for a long time. To know about this product in detail, keep reading. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you apply your **primer**, you want to ensure that you in no way obscure any details. To do this, make sure that your initial layer of **primer** is very thin. Select a **primer** that is not too thick, so that you will be able to apply thin coats with ease. Thus, a spray **primer** is an ideal solution for smaller **miniatures**, as it makes it simple to apply thin layers to the model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You will find there are many projects where you will be unable to use a spray-on **primer**, as you always require a well-ventilated area to apply an aerosol spray. Circumstances may arise where you will be required to use a paintbrush to apply your **primer**. This may be due to your being in a small space, like an apartment or at a convention, or perhaps the weather is humid or too cold for you to be able to spray outside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do **primer**s work on all kinds of miniature materials? Miniatures and scale models are often made of plastic, metal, or resin. In some scale model kits, wood is also a part of the construction. The best **primer**s for **miniatures** are all-purpose **primer**s and will work great on multiple material surfaces. Just keep in mind that you may need to apply multiple coats of your **primer** depending on the material of your model. For example, you may need additional layers of **primer** on resin **miniatures** for a solid coat as compared with metal **miniatures** where a single **primer** coat would suffice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But, if you’re having trouble with using water to thin your **primer**, you can use an airbrush thinning medium. The one that I use to thin water-based polyurethane surface **primer**s is made by Vallejo. The Vallejo Airbrush Thinner is super versatile, because it is also useful for thinning model paints as well, acting as a flow-improver (check it out here). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) What is a **primer**? A **primer** is basically a layer of paint that acts as the first layer on the model or miniature. The **primer** provides a surface for you to apply your second, third and fourth coats of paint. You can directly apply acrylic or oil paints directly on top of any hobby **primer** coat on your **miniatures**. Primers also help to create a surface that the paints bond stronger to rather than just sit on top of the model or miniature. It is not uncommon to prime a miniature twice, especially for metallic paints. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Citadel Model Primer sells for about $21-23 per can. At first glance, it’s fairly expensive, but it is a good choice if you’re looking for spray-ready **primer** for plastic **miniatures**. My experience with this **primer** for metal **miniatures** is also good. As an affordable alternative, I would also recommend Rust-Oleum Flat Black Surface Primer (also shown below). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a higher quality paint job, where small details matter, you’ll want to use a white **primer**. White **primer** helps you see details on the surface of an unpainted model. The white **primer** color will reveal shadows created by textures and details on a model’s surface. As you rotate a model under a good hobby lamp, you’ll see where the natural cast light and shadows fall. Glazing or using commercial contrast colors over a white **primer** also gives you a predictable way to add color saturation to a model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For example, you can combined black and white **primer** in the zenithal technique. Here, you first prime black, then spray white **primer** from above the model. This simulates an imaginary light source and gives you a quick way to show how light and shadow appear on the 3D surface of your miniature. It is great for achieving a high contrast paint job using glazes, or as a way for you to navigate seeing details. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An advanced step to priming **miniatures** is called Zenithal Priming. This technique utilizes the fact that paint is not completely opaque, to simulate light from the sun when it is at its zenith. After priming the whole miniature with Matt Black, simply spray Matt White only from above, with either a Colour Primer or using an airbrush. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many colors are available from Army Painter for this **primer**. However, the black colored **primer** has the best reviews. The white **primer** seems to cause some individuals some problems with the quality of the final surface. Some of this is due the environmental conditions in which the **primer** is sprayed. In general, it is best to use rattle can **primer**s in lower humidity and normal room temperatures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Looking for a **primer** that is versatile and affordable at the same time? Well, look no further. This spray paint by Krylon provides the best of both worlds. Its glossy formula is suitable to work with a variety of materials when it comes to your **miniatures**. So, this **primer** provides all the flexibility you need. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Miniatures have fine details that are present thanks to small markings on the surface of the material. Higher quality **miniatures** tend to have finer details and be more textured. If you are using a high-quality **primer**, you will be able to apply thin coats to the surface of the miniature without compromising the finer details in any way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spray cans usually use a much thinner and diluted type of **primer** that leaves the coats on your models much thinner. This doesn’t mean that the coating is useless by any means. However, if you want a slightly thicker coat you probably want to use a different kind of **primer**. You also need to be careful not to breathe in any of the fumes that the spray causes. So be sure to wear a mask if you’re going to use a spray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **primer** will take roughly 24 hours to dry, which means that you will require some patience before you can apply any paint. Gesso may be prone to developing bubbles, but it makes up for this by being a flexible material that will last a long time without yellowing. The best way to apply this gesso is by using a brush. You will therefore have to be careful that you do not compromise any of the finer details. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, applying the **primer** with a flat-headed paintbrush is something most start with. And as their skills progress, they might invest in an airbrush for their products. Airbrushes are even more expensive than spray-on, so if what you are looking for is an economical **primer**, then paint-on is the one to go for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can find one of those brands in most countries and builders warehouses or even supermarkets. Before buying any of them please make sure that you are buying a PRIMER, and that it’s a MATT one. Believe me, you don’t want to end up with a gloss **primer** or just black gloss paint instead of a **primer**. Also make sure that you are NOT taking a VARNISH - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Krylon Ultraflat Primer is a very versatile spray **primer** that sells for $10. It comes in many different colors. I would recommend neutral gray as a color for most **primer**s when I’m not sure what colors I’d like to paint my **miniatures** with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Primer plays an important role in filling any imperfections and small scratches on the surface of your miniature to ensure that you have a uniform surface to apply your paint to. This is a great feature of **primer**, particularly as most **miniatures** become dented or scratched due to wear and use. Primer is even more beneficial in filling imperfection and scratches when used in other applications, such as on automotive parts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are working with plastic **miniatures** that are 28 to 35 mm in scale, we recommend a spray-on **primer**. If you are working with bigger **miniatures**, however, you can use any **primer**. The main goal of a **primer** is to ensure that you have a thin, even surface that is ready to be painted on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It takes fewer coats to paint “up” from grey, but it’s also less dramatic. You’ll spend less time highlighting vibrant parts of your model, however, and laying down base coats of color. Worth mentioning, too, is that grey **primer** makes it easier to see all the fine details of a model than black **primer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of the **primer**s that you find in the market either come in gray or white color. You can choose any of the options just like they are or choose to tint it according to your requirement. If you choose a tinting **primer**, you can achieve a more profound and uniform color coat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most people use both terms and mean the same thing. But the difference between **primer** and spray paints is that “real” **primer**s contain a solvent that creates a stronger bond with the surface of the miniature and thus provides better adhesion and higher resistance. Spray paints do not contain solvent, or less of it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Additionally, the spraying can is very lightweight and compact. This is a beneficial feature if you are planning to work on your miniature projects while traveling. Hence, it is a great portable **primer** for those who are always on the go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Can You Use Colored Primers to Paint Models? Yes! Some game companies make colored **primer**s that you can use as your basecoat color. For example, you can use a “flesh’ colored **primer** if most of your model is skin. All you may want to do is use a wash or layering technique to increase the contrast. But, otherwise, a base color **primer** does most of the miniature painting work for you. Paint the details, add wet transfer decals, and you’re done! Army Painter Barbarian Flesh colored **primer** doubles as a **primer** and base coat of paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cons The cap dispensing system clogs easily. That’s the only problem I have with this **primer**: the bottle cap. Other than that, I actually can’t find a weakness in the actual **primer** itself. Buy Vallejo Surface Primer - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   AK Interactive offers a range with various spray **primer**s, paints and varnishes. Their Fine Primers come in 400 ml cans and are very affordable with a price of around 8/9 Euro (UK price is, unfortunately, a bit more expensive at around £11). The quality is excellent, the **primer**s are straightforward to use and go on thin with good self-levelling properties. My favourite is their black **primer**, which is quite matte, but the white and grey (which is more of a light grey) are also great. I really like that the cans come with wide and skinny caps, as the skinny cap produces less overspray and is absolutely sufficient for smaller models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should use a matte or flat **primer**, as it is nonreflective. Apply your **primer** by spraying short bursts while holding the miniature roughly a foot from the spray can (this is roughly one third of a meter). You will only have to apply enough **primer** to cover the reflectiveness of the miniature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moreover, this layman’s **primer** can be easily obtained from local stores in large quantities. In terms of coverage, well, it has you covered. You won’t be worrying about your product getting over any time soon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Stippling can be tough on brushes (as can be the resins in **primer**s), so choose a brush for your brush-on miniature **primer** that’s used only for priming. A tapered round, full brush works great, but so will old or worn-out brushes you can’t bear to part with. Don’t bother with anything smaller than a size 2 brush in most cases – much too small for the task. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We could not help but notice how versatile this item is. Take any type of surface, and you can use this item to put a **primer** on it. Even if your miniature is made of metal or plastic, this can help you apply a generous and even layer of a **primer** coat on it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I will not recommend White Den Braven Super Color Universal spray paint for priming MDF or models. The paint is way too thick for my liking and the coverage is not too good either. However, white is a tricky color and it is hard to find a good white paint and **primer**. In the contrary, Den Braven Black Matt is OK for me. I can recommend it, but you need to be careful not to overspray the miniature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cons Although this Krylon Primer is durable, versatile for many surfaces, and inexpensive, it sprays on pretty thick. That means you can easily over spray this **primer** and obscure details on **miniatures**. It’ll happen fast if you’re not careful. So, if you use this in small **miniatures** (29-35mm scale) just be aware and spray from a farther distance. Buy Krylon Ultraflat Primer - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can see the shiny spots now from where the toothbrush buffed the **primer**. If you wanted, you could go ahead and use a brush on **primer**, or spray prime, in these areas to remove the glossy sheen to give you better adhesion for your base coat. However, I don’t typically bother. I find even buffed as it is, the **primer** still takes the base coat well enough, and I’ve never had any issues as a result. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tips for Using an Airbrush with Primers Airbrushing a **primer** is a quick way to apply solid, even coats on your models. The simplest way to airbrush a **primer** is to use an airbrush-ready **primer**, such as the Badger’s Stynylrez airbrush-ready surface **primer**s or AK Interactive Primer and Microfiller. Simply add a few drops of the **primer** to your airbrush, set your air pressure to about 25-30 PSI, and spray away. READ MORE: 6 GREAT PRIMING HACKS YOU WANT TO KNOW - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Undertones are part of color theory, an immense topic for another article. They’re important, but I think, in the end, the question of what **primer** you ultimately choose actually comes down to your own personal preference, and has a lot to do with your own style of painting. Lean into that. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cons I’m not a fan of the bottle caps on these Badger paints and **primer**s. The caps tend to clog up, and little drops of liquid dry on the edges of the opening, which makes them hard to close. The Stynlylrez are a somewhat new brand compared to some of the other **primer**s on the list and less well known. So, it may be harder to find more established miniature painters from recommending them. Buy Badger Airbrush Primer (Stynylrez) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What I’m currently using is Brite Touch. It’s another automotive **primer** and also by Dupli-color, but a different version. This one works great. The Brite Touch I’ve been using for a few years now. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A super-fine mist also means that it gives great coverage. Feel free to use it on multiple **miniatures** at once, and best believe, it will adhere to any kind of material you spray it on. And, once it dries, there is no possibility of flaking. In case you were wondering, it does dry within minutes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are a seasoned miniature painter, you already know better than to skip the **primer**. For those who are new to this creative pursuit, and are wondering if priming is as important as they say – yes, it is. After all, **primer**s give the paint something to really adhere to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And lastly, you have a mix of both worlds in the form of gray **primer**s. Gray **primer**s are not as good at hiding awkward spots as black **primer**s, and colors won’t look as vibrant as with a white **primer**. However, it is a safe option when you are working with a colorful palette. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Acrylic paints do not stick well to metals, plastic, or resin very well. However, **primer**s do adhere to these surfaces really well and also provide a layer for your colored paint to cling to. Without **primer**s, you will see the paint flaking off sooner or later. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And this item aces this requirement. It is an oil-based formula that is resistant to rust. Since the item is corrosion-free, it provides two times more protection than just a coat of regular paint! Moreover, you do not have to restrict yourself to using this **primer** on **miniatures** that are made of metals only. You can very well use it to prime other surfaces like wood, cement, plastic, and so on! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rattle cans are less expensive in the short term. You can avoid the start up cost of an airbrush by buying a can of **primer**. This is especially good for you if you are just getting your feet wet in the hobby and are unsure if it will be a long term activity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I would say that the best idea would be to choose one of the brands dedicated to miniature painting. Which means: Games Workshop, Army Painter, Vallejo, Tamiya and the list goes on… Miniature dedicated **primer**s were made especially for priming models. In other words they are designed for **miniatures** and should not melt them or damage them in any other way. Plus, they are expected to provide good coverage with thin layer(s) of paint and allow all those nice details to be seen through the **primer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pros The Citadel Model Primer is a **primer** that is useful for plastic and metal **miniatures**. It is formulated for Games Workshop kits, but can be used on almost any surface material that **miniatures** and models are made of. Because of it’s branding, this **primer** is usually found in most hobby or local game stores. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cons It stinks literally. Harmful vapors are not friendly to painting in a basement or enclosed area with poor ventilation. Testors enamel **primer** is a premium product for modeling, and is priced as such. In my opinion, though, Testors spray **primer** is a solid product (just make sure you shake it well and spray in a preferably cool, low humidity environment). Buy Testors Enamel Primer - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The only **primer** that is marketed specifically as brush on **primer** that I have tried is Reaper brand brush on **primer**. It took a long time to prime minis with a brush and it was more difficult to not obscure the details of the model. Granted, it might have been the brand that I used, or it might have been that I tried this when I was still new to painting minis and might not have thinned it correctly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mold-release lubricant is similar to a non-stick spray you would use in a skillet, and it ensures that the miniature can be removed from the mold with ease. This does mean, however, that your miniature will be covered in an invisible, thin layer of lubricant. This lubricant negatively impacts the application process of glues, **primer**s, and paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is not every day that you come across a reliable **primer** and one that you can confidently use on plastic and metal. The Games Workshop Citadel Spray Paint 5120999904206 is great when it comes to this. It is a spray-ready **primer** that can help you get your work done in no time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Colour Forge **primer**s come in larger 500 ml cans, so they contain 100 ml more paint than comparable products at a price that is well below Games Workshop sprays. The 23 colours are all designed to closely match the Citadel Colour range. There are equivalents for almost all current Citadel spray paints, which makes them fantastic budget-friendly alternatives. The quality is good, some go on a bit thick, but with good self-levelling properties, it’s really not much of an issue. You can find a more detailed review here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Oh, and one more thing: you’ll likely encounter tiny air bubbles when using brush-on **primer**s. Do your best to brush them away while applying your product, and give your **miniatures** a good puff of air from a few different angles to pop them before you set the model to dry. Bubbles are annoying, but they’re unlikely to ruin your overall project, and easy to get rid of before the **primer** cures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a number of tips and tricks to help you prime your miniature surfaces for paint. Before you can apply the **primer**, however, you must ensure that the surface of your miniature is completely clean and dry. You may also need some help on selecting the best **primer** shade for your project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Tamiya Surface Primer Spray sells for around $10-15 and is highly-prized by professional and competitive miniature painters. Tamiya fine surface **primer** provides a very thin mist that finely coats your models, preserving all the small details. This is especially important for gunpla models, where you need to preserve panel line and rivet details. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another easy application for **primer** is via aerosol spray cans. You can purchase general, industrial **primer**s or miniature-specific **primer**s. The general industrial **primer**s are very affordable and can be bought in big quantities. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best Primer for Plastic Miniatures? The best **primer**s for plastic **miniatures** in the 28-35mm scale are spray **primer**s. These include aerosol or rattle can **primer**s, e.g., when you shake a rattle spray can, agitator beads inside the metal container makes a “rattle” sound. You know you’ve shaken the **primer** spray can vigorously and long enough when your hear the rattle sound for at least 30-60 seconds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Liquitex Professional Gesso 5316 Surface Prep Medium is a perfect choice for the ones who like to experiment with priming. Available in multiple sizes, it is an ideal option if you want to try something new instead of regular **primer**s. Plus, its special anti-yellowing formula allows your **miniatures** to withstand the test of time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We recommend that you go for a tinted color option when you decide to shift from darker to lighter colors. This is particularly helpful when you have to hide darker base coats. In such scenarios, using a tinted **primer** reduces the number of paint coats required. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We suggest selecting an option that does not take more than 20-30 minutes to dry. Curing time is generally around 24 hours, so keep that in mind when you start with a project. Only when the **primer** is dry can you begin applying a layer of paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although the product claims to be a white **primer**, users have complained that it is too gray for their liking. Gray-colored **primer**, however, works well as an undercoat for most vivid and light-colored topcoats. In the end, it all comes down to personal choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After using it for a few weeks, we have to say that we do not have any significant complaints about the item. However, there’s one minor issue. The smell of the **primer** is pretty strong and heady. If it makes you feel nauseous, consider using a face mask to prevent the smell. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Water-based acrylic paints are pigments suspended in a water/polymer emulsion. (Brands have their own proprietary formulae, but all acrylic **miniatures** paints follow this basic formulation). Depending on the ratios of this mix, acrylics can be extremely thick, or airbrush-thin. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Should You Use Gesso for Priming Miniatures? Gesso is inexpensive, forms a protective surface for applying paint, and smooths out surface imperfections. Gesso comes in many forms, but they are all brush-on type **primer**s. Many miniature painters use gesso for priming **miniatures** and models. Liquitex Gray Gesso is my preferred gesso medium for priming larger models and terrain pieces. Not only is it inexpensive, it is resilient to scratches and stretches out as it dries on models, providing a very smooth and pleasant surface to work on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Applying best miniature **primer** on any object that needs a long lasting paint is a good choice. Due to its wide range of functions, it offers us a series of advantages that will make our life as art creators much easier. Among its advantages are: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using **primer** on your **miniatures** is an essential part of the hobby. It’s something everyone should do prior to painting their models. So, let me walk you through what to buy and how to prime your models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remember, don’t apply too many layers of **primer**. Each layer slightly removes details from the **miniatures**. A good rule to follow for spraying **primer**s is to spray in bursts with the nozzle some distance away from the model. Sweep the nozzle spray back and forth so you don’t apply **primer** on a single area of the model for a prolonged period of time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The only downside to this product is that you need to have a considerable amount of time in hand to use this **primer** on **miniatures**. The curing time is considerably long, so the **primer** does not dry up very fast. Hence, if you’re running short on time, check out other quick-drying options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using black **primer** allows you to more easily create contrast with paint. Since **miniatures** are so miniature, contrast is really important. A nice black **primer** lets you paint “up” from your shadows using lighter colors, instead of applying shadows atop your light colors (as is the case when applying washes or inks). The shadows are more or less taken care of already; your job is to use color and highlights to bring depth to your model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You will not get as thin an application when using aerosol spray cans as you would with airbrushing, where some cheaper spray can options can result in a grainy surface. You can sand down industrial **primer**s once they have dried, something which you aren’t able to do with miniature specific **primer**s. This sanding down allows you to create a smooth surface before you begin applying paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I used their sandable **primer**, basically their run of the mill one. Don’t get their filler **primer** or anything like that, bad things will happen. Dupli-Color also has their **primer**s in white, that lovely rust red color, and gray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note that there are times when you want a brush-on **primer** (more about this below). For example, when you have limited space for a spray booth, indoors in an enclosed space, or in a public convention where spraying might not be appropriate. Aerosol or rattle can **primer**s also pose an issue because of the odors and potentially harmful vapors. These should be generally used outdoors (in low humidity for best results!) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Liquitex Neutral Gray Gesso is available to purchase for only $9. It is a gesso, which is an alternative to the standard **primer** and can be used on **miniatures**. Gesso is known to be used as an undercoat before painting, with either acrylics and oils. It is a compound that is fairly hard and is formulated with either a glue-type substance or plaster. It is recommended that you sand between multiple coats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In addition to these purposes, **primer** also fills in small scratchs and holes so as to provide a level and even surface. If the surface is not smooth, the paint may not adhere to it. Primers also offer a colored undertone, although its thicker consistency means that it can be easy to lose details on the surface of your miniature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The nice thing about automotive **primer**s is that they are designed specifically to smooth out imperfections on surfaces. For smoothing out the build-lines in 3D printed models, you can use a sandable 2-in-1 **primer** and filler. A **primer** and filler is great for 3D prints and large models. After these **primer**s dry, you can sand the automotive **primer** even out the surface in preparation for paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It can be thinned out using water to be applied with an airbrush, or it can be applied as is with a brush. When it is used in an airbrush, the **primer** gives thin coats and dries quickly. It leaves a smooth surface, making it ideal for working with pewter or plastic **miniatures**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And, last but not least, the affordability. As it’s often better to apply two or even three thin coats of **primer**, a can of **primer** will only last you for so long. And if your army’s paint scheme requires **primer**s in multiple colours, it can add up quickly. Warhammer is already an expensive hobby. Luckily, there are a host of hobby companies which offer budget-friendlier alternatives to Citadel spray paints. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many users often complain about heavy **primer** containers that make the task of base coating extremely exhausting. But when it comes to this item, rest assured that you will face no such problems. It is lightweight and provides an even finish that is as smooth as butter! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let the coat dry completely, and, if necessary, a second thin coat of **primer** can be sprayed to complete the coverage. It doesn’t take much **primer** to get where you need to be. This goes for both spray and brush-on versions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moreover, it will help you save both money and time. You do not have to buy a **primer** and a color spray separately. It combines the goodness of traditional **primer** and that of well-pigmented color spray in one bottle! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have compiled this list of my personal best spray paints & **primer**s for painting Warhammer **miniatures** to share my experience from over 20 years of painting and hobbying. On Tale of Painters, I have reviewed a plethora of hobby products from minor to major brands. Only those products that I actually use myself regularly have made it to this list and receive my Seal of Hobby Excellence. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Primer bonds well to metal and plastic. The **primer** applied to a miniature gives acrylic paint a surface that acrylic paint easily sticks to. This was something I didn't understand well when I first began painting **miniatures** over 20 years ago, but this has a lot to do with how my painting techniques have evolved since then. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Citadel Paint Contrast Spray is about $25 online and more in stores. It is a new formulation designed for use along with the Citadel Contrast Paint line. Simply, you apply this to a model as a **primer** coat. The white color acts as an undercoat for applying the Contrast Paint over it; speeding up the process of painting with Games Workshop model paint colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The solution here is to wash your metal and resin **miniatures** with soap and warm water. Personally, when I have a lot of models or **miniatures** to wash in this manner I use an ultrasonic cleaner filled with soapy water (see my article on cool ultrasonic cleaners, which I also happen to use for cleaning my airbrushes). You should apply a **primer** only after washing and drying your models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Time needed: 1 minute. You’ve got your miniature, you’ve got **primer**, so it’s time to get to it! Attach the Miniature to Something A little tip is to attach your models to a stick or piece of wood. You can do this using Blu Tack easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   White **primer** will give you the most saturation (brightness) on your colors. It’s great if you’re working with a lot of very bright colors. It’s more difficult if you’re using darker colors, but still not the worst thing in the world. Dark colors over white is easier than light colors over black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A major downside to this product is that it has a strong odor. If you are using it in the basement or in an area that is not well-ventilated, it might cause a major problem. We recommend using a mask while applying the **primer** coat to avoid the pungent smell. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In second part of ‘How to prime your models with spray paint’ I will talk more how to use spray **primer**s, or better to say how to make them work. How to prepare cans before priming and use them properly. I will also give you some tips how to avoid most common mistakes that people do with spray paints in general. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Or you could use a red **primer** for that nice dragon miniature you are currently working on. Keep in mind that some colors might not cover as nicely as others. The **primer** provides an undertone for the paint color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like most industrial-grade **primer**s, this one leaves a thick layer on application, so be mindful if you are dealing with detailed figures. However, you can’t compromise on the strong odor it releases. Using it outdoors is not a recommendation – it is a necessity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pros All the pros of regular Citadel Primer plus the added bonus of combining with Citadel Contrast Paint application. The bright color may also be useful for painting traditionally difficult to paint colors like yellow or orange–colors that have generally poor coverage. A brighter base coat **primer** can help get those color saturations quicker with less effort. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tips for Aerosol Spray Can Primers You can follow the same **primer** application tips as airbrush **primer** applications. Spray with your rattle can **primer** in short bursts, sweeping the nozzle back and forth over your model(s). This prevents the **primer** from pooling on the surface of the miniature and helps preserve details. Hold the nozzle about 6-12″ away from the miniature while you spray. You’re looking to create a **primer** “mist” that settles on the model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cheaper **primer**s most advantage is that they are cheap. Sometimes they also provide a better protection and adhesion than miniature dedicated spray **primer**s. Unfortunately they are few downfalls that you need to have in mind when buying and using those cheap **primer**s: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We are almost reaching the end of our list, and next up, we have the Games Workshop 5120999904106 Warhammer. This product is designed to provide a perfect **primer** coat on plastic, metal, and resin **miniatures**. To know more about the item, keep reading. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What is a Primer and Do You Need It? A **primer** is an undercoat you use to prepare a surface for paint. Primers create the foundation on a surface that smooths out imperfections, creates an even undertone, and helps overlying paint adhere to the surface. A good **primer** will also prevent paint colors from peeling and chipping off a model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With a few exceptions, I’m not a huge fan of The Army Painter’s Colour Primers (anymore), but the new Greedy Gold **primer** has unique formula and is much easier to use. It covers very well and the metallic flakes are fine. The gold tone is a very rich orange gold, a perfect match to Greedy Gold Warpaint, and coincidentally, it’s also much closer to Retributor Armour base paint than Games Workshop’s Retributor Armour Spray, which is paler and more yellowish than the Base paint version. With an RRP of 17 Euro / £14.50, it is unfortunately much more expensive than other Colour Primers, but still much cheaper than Retributor Armour Spray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even narrowing down the field to this narrow bunch of **primer**s there are still numerous brands and I have yet to try them all, but I have tried many different brands. Below are the top brands that I have tried. There are a couple that I plan to try in the near future, and if they are equal to these I will add them to the list. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Regardless of the type of material you are working on, whether it is resin, plastic, or metal, you can create a universal surface to work on by applying an initial **primer** coat. If you are someone who enjoys using cosmetics and make-up, you will already have a good idea of the importance of **primer**. In make-up application, a **primer** is applied to the skin to stop any make-up from being absorbed into the skin. Primer also ensures that you have a smooth surface to work on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In worst case, you can cause condensation because of the fast temperature changes. Always make sure to be quick, but thorough. Leave your miniature outside to try, but make sure it is sheltered from the weather. The paint or **primer** should ideally be fully dry before you take it inside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My general opinion of brush-on **primer**s is that I don’t like them. I don’t find they give you the same surface to work with that a spray **primer** does or an airbrush **primer**. It just feels less like a **primer** and more like black paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How long does it take for a **primer** to dry? It depends on the ambient environment you’re priming your models. Under normal conditions, you can expect most hobby **primer**s to dry completely within 10-30 minutes. For best results, allow your **primer** to dry before applying any paint. You can use a hair dryer with a low heat setting to speed up the drying process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Are you wanting to paint some plastic or metal **miniatures** and are looking to find the ideal **primer**? Each **primer** works differently, depending on the product and the surface you will be using it on. On the surface, all **primer**s work the same and are used as an initial coat to prepare the surface of unpainted plastic, resin, or metal. Primers are also applied to stop the paint to be applied afterwards from being absorbed by the material you are working on. Another benefit of **primer**s is they create a smooth work surface, covering up and filling in any imperfections. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I use many brands of miniature paints for my work, e.g., Scalecolor 75, Citadel, Master Reaper Series, P3, Badger paints, Vallejo Model Air and Game Color, but only keep a few kinds of **primer**s on-hand. In comparing different **primer**s to paint **miniatures** and models, you might be wondering why you need a **primer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cons Expensive as a **primer**. As above, it is an aerosol based spray **primer** and will require proper ventilation for safe use. A respirator mask (organic vapor P95 rated like this) or spray booth could help when you’re spraying in more enclosed areas. Buy Citadel Contrast Spray: Grey Seer - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   10 Best Primers for Painting Miniatures and Models The following are my recommended top 10 best **primer**s for painting plastic, metal, and resin **miniatures**. Although some **primer**s are available in more than a single color, I’ve recommended the color you should start with first due to how well it works. 1. Citadel Model Primer - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **primer** auto-levels as it dries evening out any small bumps in your model surface. It also sticks really well to any model surface, including plastic, metal, or resin. It can be painted on any surface with a brush or with an airbrush. AK Interactive recommends that you use their thinner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Krylon **primer** is popular and works really well for both plastic and metal **miniatures**. It is even good on models made of wood or cardboard surfaces (e.g., MDF terrain) as it seals with a solid coat, filling and sealing off porous surfaces. You can even buy it in multiple colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cons As with any **primer** with filling properties, be careful you don’t over-coat your model. It doesn’t take much **primer** to effectively cover your model. As mentioned, AK Interactive **primer** is a little hard to find in the United States. But, if you’re willing to wait for an overseas delivery this may be a great **primer** for any model you’re preparing to paint. Buy AK Interactive Primer - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the world of miniature painting, Vallejo needs no introduction. The **primer** in black remains one of the most sought-after **primer**s among their products, and also in the entire business. To apply this, you need to have other painting supplies like a brush or an airbrush. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Primer is generally the first type of paint that we apply to our minis. They are there to prepare the surface so that other types of paint will stick better. Many **primer**s have polyurethane in them that helps them to adhere to the surface of your models and have a more durable finish. This doesn’t mean that you can disregard proper surface prep, it just means that many **primer**s are extra sticky. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a good many years I used Krylon’s black **primer** and had very good luck with it. The problem I had was that it’s on the expensive end of things. However, I never had any issues using Krylon. It sprayed well, adhered well, and didn’t wear off. I’d definitely recommend this one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It happens to everyone eventually. Whether you’re new to the hobby, or a veteran, fuzzy **primer** happens. In my case, I was priming from too far away. When you do that, the **primer** begins drying before it hits the model, and in turn leaves a fuzzy coat. I know better, but we all mess up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before applying any **primer** on your miniature take a spare model or a model sprue and check if you are satisfied with the result. If you are not happy how the **primer** looks, it’s too glossy or maybe it is flaking off the plastic it’s not for you. The same goes if it melts the plastic, it’s sticky, or the paint is to too thick – it is not worth the hassle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cons As with other aerosol sprays, it requires a ventilated area for safe use. Aerosols aren’t great for the environment. In general, rattle cans have more limited use than compared with polyurethane-based **primer**s, which come in larger volume bottle for less cost. Buy Army Painter Primer - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First and most importantly, a good spray **primer** should be easy to apply, cover well, and dry out thin and smooth so that no detail is lost. There should be some leeway if conditions such as humidity or temperature are not ideal, or if you accidentally spray on too much paint. Good self-levelling properties are important. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best practice for painting a miniature requires that you “sandwich” your acrylic paint between a **primer** and varnish. In this scenario, your paint job is protected from being absorbed into the model’s surface (if it is porous, some resins for example), and from external insults from the environment, e.g., your hand touching the model during normal handling or tabletop gameplay. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You will also commonly find grey as a choice as well for a **primer**. Grey, unsurprisingly, is somewhere between using black and white. It’s an easy color to paint over for darker and lighter colors, making is pretty ideal for most stuff you’re doing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rattle cans use pressure to atomize their contents. Pressure responds to temperature (raising temperature increases pressure; lowering it decreases pressure). The depressurization that happens when you hold down a rattle can’s nozzle also lowers the temperature of the **primer** inside the can. All the chemicals in the **primer** itself are also temp-sensitive, and much like many humans I know, just won’t do the thing when they’re too cold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Testors Enamel Primer can sells for $10-15. Testors is a direct competitor of Tamiya’s product. Both are similarly priced with a similar kind of enamel-based formulation for undercoating highly-detailed **miniatures** and scale models. Everything I said for Tamiya’s **primer** holds true for Testor’s version. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We recommend you stick with the neutral colors, such as black, grey, or white. You can purchase a variety of colors, but those that are different from the basics can be quite pricey. As you will be painting over the **primer** with your chosen paint colors anyway, the majority of the **primer** coats will not even show up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before painting you need to **primer** your models. This is one of many ‘golden rules’ of miniature painting. You can **primer** your models by using a brush, airbrush and spray paint **primer**. If you have a horde of **miniatures** to prime a brush is not the most tempting way to do it. Not everyone have an airbrush, so a spray paint seems to be the best and quickest option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It also makes colors more vibrant. When light passes through your paint layers, some of it bounces off the white surface of the **primer** layer and back through. That helps make your colors more clear and bright than painting them atop a grey or black surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Badger Airbrush Primer (Stynlrez) is about $8-12 per **primer** bottle or $23-27 for a set of 3 colors (black, gray, and white). It is probably the best deal in terms of volume of **primer**. But, also note that these are airbrush-ready **primer**s formulated as an acrylic-polyurethane undercoat. This means that they form a tight, non-porous and auto-smoothing layer directly on the unpainted surface of your models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Additionally, the kind of coverage that this **primer** provides is quite incredible. One bottle covers around 14 square feet. And once you apply this **primer**, drying does not take more than 15 minutes. How convenient does that sound? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   From our research, we have found that latex **primer**s have short dry-to-recoat time. On the other hand, oil-based paints take longer to dry. You will find all the necessary information to be printed on the package. Make sure that you read the label carefully before making the purchase. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How you go about applying **primer** to your **miniatures** can significantly impact the results. The main aim is to apply your **primer** as evenly, consistently, and thinly as possible, without compromising any of the miniature’s fine details. You want to create a smooth surface that the paint will be able to adhere to with ease. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Testors Enamel Primer is a direct competitor of the Tamiya Surface Primer Spray. Apart from having a very similar price, both are also enamel-based formulated specifically to work for undercoating. Moreover, it also is perfect for high-detailed **miniatures** and scale models as it doesn’t provide a thick coating when applied. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – they might damage your models. I am thinking mostly about plastic and resin models, but metal **miniatures** are no exception. You never know how the **primer** will react with plastic, metal or resin. Car **primer**s melting plastic or resin **miniatures** are nothing new 😉 - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best miniature **primer** serves as a pre-coat that is applied to whatever we want to paint next, thus preparing it for the painting process. This product can be confused with paint, but it does not give the same finish. Its main function is not to give colour, but rather to protect and provide a better support for the paint that we will later use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note that because this is still a spray can, painting in a well-ventilated room or places is still highly advised. To avoid overcoating the model, keep some distance away from the model. This also ensures you will not lose any details on your **miniatures**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Priming is the first step in painting durable **miniatures**. To ensure that your paints work the way you expect them, and maintain a uniform bond to your model, it’s a step you just can’t skip. Any **primer** is an essential base from which to begin work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The other thing to avoid with hardware store **primer**s is anything that is marketed as extra thick, or super coating. These are for large surface areas where filling cracks and other imperfections is a desired result. We don’t want that from a rattle can **primer** on **miniatures** as it will destroy fine details on the models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using the VALLEJO Surface Primer for 3D printed pieces also works wonders as it allows you to apply thicker coats– perfect for hiding print lines from 3D printing. Nevertheless, the **primer** still performs outstandingly compared to most of its competitors in the market. Considering how affordable it is, they are ideal for working with pewter or plastic **miniatures**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best Primer for Metal Miniatures? Similar to **primer**s for plastic **miniatures**, the best **primer**s are those that you apply using a spray application. This provides the thinnest, most even coats on your models. For brush-on **primer**s, the advice is also the same: brush-on **primer**s are situationally useful, but in my opinion secondary to spray **primer**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **primer**s sold for miniature painting need only a short time to dry enough to receive paint. Army Painter sprays – the **primer**s I personally use – are usually ready in 20-30 minutes. Others will vary, so read your labels (and follow the instructions). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, a good reason to use gesso as your **primer** for painting **miniatures** is if you use oil paints. Gesso creates a more absorbent surface than typical **primer**s, which is helpful for toning the model’s surface and allowing those first “lean” oil layers stick. Read more about painting **miniatures** with oil paints here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another unique feature is its advanced double cover technology. This is what enhances the hiding power of the **primer**— wondering how that helps? Well, this makes it easier and faster to complete your project. You won’t miss another deadline ever! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Liquitex Neutral Gray Gesso is a gesso compound that sells for $10-15. Gesso is the perfect alternative to normal **primer**s designed for **miniatures**. Gesso is fairly hard compound formulated with plaster or some type of glue-like substance. Traditionally, gesso is used on canvas an undercoat before painting (with oils or acrylics), or on stone or ceramic sculptures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For the price, a single bottle has lasted me hundreds of models. No kidding. As an airbrush-able **primer** it sprays really well in thin coats. It dries fast and auto-smooths on the surface of both plastic and pewter **miniatures**. Because of how thin I’m able to apply this **primer**, it helps retain details while also smoothing out small imperfections. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Second, the mattness. The more matte the **primer**, the better the paint will adhere on your Warhammer miniature. A matt surface is rough on a microscopic level, which gives acrylic paint more grip. If, on the other hand, the **primer** is too glossy, paint adheres less well and you need to apply more coats for an opaque result, and thin paints such as washes / Shade paints or Contrast paints can even drip off. The gloss is a disadvantage of many metallic spray paints, and the only thing you can do about it is to paint over with a thin layer of a matching metallic paint or a matt/satin varnish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Citadel White Scar spray With their new White Scar spray paint, Games Workshop succeeded in creating a white **primer** that goes on without a fuss. This stuff is easy to use, has a very high coverage, and goes on thin and smooth, which also makes for a nice basecoat for Contrast and other “one coat” paints. It’s not exactly cheap, but its so nice to use that I gladly spend the extra money. You can find a more detailed review here. Where to buy: Everywhere you can find Games Workshop products, for example from our partner shops with a discount up to 15%: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because it is an indoor/outdoor **primer**, it is resilient to many insults from the environment. The Krylon **primer** can therefore provide a solid undercoat foundation for any miniature painting project. The Ultraflat version of this **primer** is a key feature because it provides some texture for your acrylic paint to adhere. This adds to the durability of your paint job. There is some limitations though to this **primer** (see below). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The quality of the miniature **primer** cannot be doubted. However, you don’t get a lot of product for the price. Especially if you are a novice, you might have to get more than one can to figure out how to make the best of it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Different types of **primer**s cater to various surfaces. If you are applying it on bare wood, using an oil-based option is a good idea. Wood is a porous surface, and this type of **primer** helps seal the layers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mainly, to prevent paint from flaking off your **miniatures**. Paint can have adhesive problems when used directly on plastic, metal or any other material that the miniature is made of. By priming the model you are creating a better surface for next layers of paint. You will find that primed models can be easier to paint as the paint sticks to them better, than to unprimed **miniatures**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In general, although hard to find in some countries, and usually with long delivery times, the AK Interactive Primer has some of the best features of my personal favorite Vallejo Surface Primer. Though, I would be careful because it does have a strong odor. If you decide to airbrush AK Interactive **primer**, I suggest using a filtered spray booth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Vallejo Surface Primer sells for $16-20 and worth every penny! This is my favorite **primer** for most miniature and modeling jobs. I use this as both a brush-on **primer** or thinned out with water (usually) for use in an airbrush. Here’s in my full in-depth review of the Vallejo Surface Primer applied with an airbrush or a regular brush. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While Rust-Oleum does offer a base spray that is geared towards miniature painting, this one is more for industrial use. However, it still is a **primer** for wooden, metal, and plastic surfaces, and it comes at a steal. If you like the brand, but want to save a few extra dollars, try this one for size. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ultimately, you’ll want to plan ahead to see if a colored **primer** will help you. If you paint a lot of models with the same primary color, then using a colored **primer** will increase your productivity. If you’re only painting a few models, or if the **miniatures** don’t have a majority of the main color showing, then a colored **primer** will not be a good investment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The “Acrylic Paint Sandwich”: Why You Need to Prime Your Models Primers aren’t formulated like miniature paints, which are generally acrylic polymer water-based mediums. In contrast to acrylic paint, **primer**s do not absorb water after they dry. This makes **primer**s a key element in a durable paint job for models or **miniatures**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some spray **primer**s from Citadel and Army Painter have colors from the most popular model paint schemes. If you’re painting a company of Warhammer 40k Space Marines in the Ultramarine Chapter, for example, there is a perfectly matched Citadel blue-colored **primer** you can use to prime and paint your base colors in a single spray session. Model companies like Vallejo or Tamiya have also been in the business of making color **primer**s specifically formulated for their model kit product, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To begin with, this item provides a magnificent finish once you apply it. If getting a uniform **primer** layer that does not chip or peel off quickly is your prime concern, this is the best bet. It also provides you with a long-lasting layer of premium-quality **primer** coating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Depending on the number of layers of **primer** you put will be how the surface will look like. For example, if you put too much **primer** on the **miniatures**, you will have an extremely smooth, plastic-like surface. Unfortunately, too much **primer** could cause the paint to not stick properly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The short answer is yes, that is totally something that you can do. You don’t have to use paint only in the way that it is marketed. Some people prime their models with a brush if they don’t own an airbrush, especially during cold or otherwise bad weather. If you are looking into the brush on **primer**s because you want to prime your minis in the winter check out this article that I wrote about how to prime minis in the winter with a rattle can. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While the **primer** is created to be applied under the paint, the substance isn’t clear in color. Primer has an opaque color that you can either use to your advantage or fight against. Grey, black, or white are the most common **primer** colors, but you will be able to find **primer** in almost any color you can think of. White **primer** is the go-to for most hobbyists, while some will use grey as a compromise should white not be available. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As a **primer**, it works well and provides a very smooth surface for applying overlying model paints. It’s fairly expensive for a **primer**, but may be valuable for the Contrast Paint Technique of “one thick coat”. As an alternative to Grey Seer, I’ve found that Vallejo Grey Surface Primer works well with Citadel Contrast Paints. You can see my full review of Vallejo Surface **primer**s for **miniatures**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Warhammer 40k is a franchise created by Games Workshop, detailing the far future and the grim darkness it holds. The main attraction of 40k is the **miniatures**, but there are also many video games, board games, books, ect. that are all connected in the 40k universe. This subreddit is for anything and everything related to Warhammer 40k. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best enamel based **primer**s are those in rattle spray cans (aerosol based **primer**s). The best **primer**s for metal models include the Tamiya Surface Primer and Testors Enamel Primer. To my knowledge, I don’t know if there is an airbrush ready enamel-based **primer** designed for **miniatures**. The best airbrush **primer**s for **miniatures** are polyurethane water-soluble solutions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The brush-on approach is favored by some hobbyists, but you will require more patience and skill should you go with this application option. Using a brush to apply **primer** will give you thicker layers. We recommend that you take your time with this application method, and that you use a flat-headed brush. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The product itself dries very fast, claiming to be ready to use for 5 minutes. However, we would give it about an hour before use, so as to be on the safer side. Overall, we wouldn’t give it any less stars than a fine hardware store **primer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking to speed paint your miniature collection, board game, or horde army, then a black **primer** will help you paint fast. When you want to paint fast, maintaining contrast is key. Using a black **primer** fills in all the shadows of a model for you. All you need to do is paint in the midtone and highlights. This usually means you can use quick, brute force painting techniques such as with dry brushing or airbrushing to get your colors on the model quickly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While spray-on **primer** is recommended, there is also brush-on **primer**. This kind of **primer** is handled like paint: It is liquid and needs to be applied via paint brush. But I have not found good results with it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The propellants and solvents in spray **primer**s behave badly when applied to certain materials. This can be as simple-but-frustrating as a sticky texture, or as catastrophic as melting your miniature. Resin **miniatures** are particularly finicky. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next up on our list, we have the Vallejo Black VJ73602 Primer Acrylic Polyurethane. This is an ideal option if you are thinking of giving your miniature projects a coat of **primer**. Depending on your requirements, you can also go ahead and use it as an airbrush **primer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fondly dubbed “magic black” by loyal customers, this **primer** has been around for more than 20 years. Apply this black **primer** on darker **miniatures** like Warhammer characters, and get your money’s worth. If you don’t want to take our word for it, just ask their huge fanbase. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   They look a lot alike. They smell a lot alike. If you’re using a brush-on **primer** and lick your brushes back to a point after rinsing (and you should lick your brushes back to a point), they even taste a lot alike. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even if you have cleaned your miniature thoroughly, whether it be made of plastic, resin, or metal, you will find that acrylic paint does not adhere well to it. Through the use of **primer**, you can create a surface that the paint will bond to, especially the likes of a metal surface. If you choose not to use a **primer**, your acrylic paint could potentially chip or flake off the surface with ease. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some heavier **primer**s can easily cover these details. As an enamel based **primer**, it is also durable for plastic and metal **miniatures**. I’ve recommended the gray color **primer** as it is the most versatile of the **primer** colors. But, if you prefer Tamiya makes other colored **primer**s as well, including black and pure white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may be required to thin out your **primer**, particularly if you have chosen a brush-on **primer**, which is thicker. You are looking for a consistency of **primer** that is similar to milk. To thin **primer**, you can use one part airbrush thinner or water to approximately three parts of **primer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Additionally, it is an enamel-based **primer** which makes it highly durable and robust. It does not chip easily and stays for an extended period of time. Also, it is suitable to be applied on a range of surfaces, even on metal and plastic **miniatures**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While we like a good spray-on **primer**(as opposed to brush-on), we love one that comes at a bargain. Apart from being inexpensive, the versatility of this product makes it a crowd-pleaser. Because of its water-resistant abilities, the spray is widely used to make jewelry, furniture, and **miniatures** water-proof. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cons You can easily lose details on small models with an automotive **primer** like this. It’ll easily obscure things like panel lines, rivets, and small folds in sculpts that are in the 28mm scale. I would only suggest the use of this **primer** on large models. As with any aerosol, there is also the need for good ventilation. Buy Rust-Oleum Automotive Primer - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An Alternative to Enamel-Based Spray Primers is Gesso Gesso is especially useful for metal or resin **miniatures**. Here’s why: Gesso is a hard compound, usually plaster or glue-based, that is traditionally used on canvas, or stone and ceramic sculptures, before painting. It effectively forms a hardened surface with the model you’re working on. Gesso forms a durable surface for paint. Gesso is affordable, will cover a large number of models, and also works well on large models, 3D prints, and terrain pieces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When choosing which **primer** color to use, it is very much up to you. We suggest that you take into consideration the paint colors you will be using, and whether they will be mainly dark or light colors. If you choose not to use a light undercoat, the lighter spaces of your piece may end up looking fairly drab. A good go-to is to use a white **primer**, as it works well with more vibrant paint colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How much **primer** should I apply to a miniature? You only need a thin layer of **primer** on **miniatures** to properly prepare a surface for paint. Good **primer** is there to help paint stick. Your paint won’t chip with light coats of **primer**. The cause of paint chipping is primarily due to the quality of the **primer** and paint you’re using. If you apply too much **primer**, then you may lose fine surface details as the **primer** fills them in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If we are talking about miniature painting enthusiasts, we cannot leave out the 3D printing aficionados. 3D printing will provide a lot of customized figures, but prepping them is another story. Dupli-color’s product is a filler and **primer** in one – and a great tool for those jobs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
