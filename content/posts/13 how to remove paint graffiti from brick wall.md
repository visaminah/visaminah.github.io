## 13 Tips to How To Remove Paint Graffiti From Brick Wall | How To Remove Graffiti From Concrete Wall
-   Most chemical removers won’t remove **graffiti** from limestone due to the **graffiti**’s pigment and the limestone’s porous surface. Just a small amount of spray **paint** will bond and stain limestone and you can often think it has been removed, however, it will show up in different light. A lot of chemical removers need the limestone to be jet washed to remove the chemical, however, intense pressure can damage the limestone surface by removing its protective top layer. Soda and sand-blasting are sometimes used to remove **graffiti** from limestone however these can cause irreversible damage to its protective top layer which will always be visible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Removes 200 to 300 square feet of **graffiti** per gallon. Removes 2 to 3 times more **graffiti** than all other thickened and brushed on products. 1. Spray TAGINATOR® **graffiti** remover onto **graffiti** using TAGSPRAYER™. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Marker pen and permanent marker pen can be used by **graffiti** artists if they want a quick and easy way of leaving their mark. Permanent marker pens are often used in public toilets, on walls and doors, on play park equipment, mirrors, gates and paving and it looks horrible and unsightly. Even though it’s more likely to be a smaller area compared to **graffiti** spray **paint** you will want to remove it quickly and easily. Permanent marker pens are also often used by children around the home, on surfaces they shouldn’t have used it on and in these situations it can be devastating if your walls have been marked, a table has been drawn on or your sofa has been marked. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can try using a pressure washer to remove **graffiti** coating from masonry but don’t ever use a narrow or small tip as it can etch the surface of the masonry leaving an outline where the **graffiti** was. Sand-blasting is another option; however, this is something you would need a professional to do and it can be costly. You can try using a wire brush or steel wool to remove it from masonry, however, you need to be very careful not to damage the surface. If these don’t work then you can **paint** over the masonry but be aware that you may think a couple of coats have covered it but if it’s a light colour it can show through eventually, or in certain lighting. Also remember, you will need to re**paint** the whole surface rather than just where the **graffiti** area is to ensure you don’t end up with patchy colours all over the surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes home improvement projects go wrong and you end up with spray **paint** or **paint** in places you wish you hadn’t but there are ways of removing it. If you wipe the **paint** when it is still wet you can sometimes remove it but you need to be quick and try to do it so you don’t spread the **paint** further and then wash with warm soapy water. Quite often you don’t realise you have **paint** on your skin so it’s usual to have dried by the time you have seen it. Before you try to remove any **paint** always check the product’s packaging to see if it’s water or oil-based **paint** as this will determine how, and what products you should use to remove it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the **paint** has dried then scrape off as much of it as you can. Traditionally you would use a **paint** remover or stripper to remove any **paint** remaining, however, most **paint** removers and strippers contain strong chemical removers which dissolve the **paint** and varnish from surfaces but which are harmful. They can cause skin and eye irritation, they can burn the skin as well as causing headaches, drowsiness, nausea, dizziness and loss of coordination if not used very carefully. Because of this, we recommend that you use our specialist Graffiti Go product which is a safe **graffiti** remover which has been formulated from the most advanced, innovative water-based technology not using any solvents, as well as being better for the environment than most other hazardous solvents. Also, be aware that some caustic chemical solutions can cause surface failures or can change the colour of your bricks resulting in long term damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Oil-based **paint**s can be loosened and removed with pure essential oil which dissolves the oil-based **paint**. Again, rub it into the skin in circular movements and use an old soft toothbrush for those stubborn stains then wash with warm soapy water. Beware your skin will have a layer of grease after using oil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Try using a common **paint** thinner, WD40, lacquer thinner or acetone or even a light penetrating oil with a microfiber cloth. This often leaves grease on the surface and you will need a degreasing product to remove it. If this doesn’t work you can try rubbing it gently with steel, a bronze brush or light sandpaper. If you try to remove it this way, always be aware that the surface of the metal may get damaged in the process leaving it looking dull, scratched or discoloured. If none of these work, then you can try removing it by jet washing the surface but be aware this isn’t often a successful removal method. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can try wiping the plastic with a light penetrating oil, again this will leave grease on the surface so you will need a suitable degreasing product to remove it. If it’s a small area sometimes a magic marker can remove the **graffiti** coating. We advise you not to use **paint** thinners on plastic as it can soften it, causing it to misshape, discolour or can result in a permanent stickiness on the surface. You can try **paint**ing over the plastic if neither of these options works, however, the best way to remove **graffiti** from plastic is by using our specialist Graffiti Go Product. Simply, apply, wait, wipe and wash off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Graffiti Go was researched, developed and is manufactured in the UK. It is a safe **graffiti** remover compared to normal chemical removers so plastic gloves, rubber gloves, a face mask or safety glasses aren’t essential as it is a water-based and non-toxic product. It has been formulated by Eco Solutions from the most advanced, innovative water-based technology which uses” science not solvents”. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the **paint** is still wet then you should soak it up using an absorbent cloth, when you are doing this try not to wipe the **paint** as it will spread. When you have removed as much as you can with the absorbent cloth you could use a solvent like white spirit to remove the rest. White spirit has a patent smell and will leave a grease residue so you will need to use a degreasing solvent to remove it after. This removal process is time-consuming but our specialist Graffiti Go product will do the job quickly and efficiently without multiple treatments as well as being water-based, non-toxic making it much safer to use compared to other products. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the wood the **graffiti** is on is a **paint**ed surface or sealed with stain or a sealer then you can try removing it by wiping it with a white or mineral spirit. If the wood is weathered or doesn’t have **paint**, stain or a sealer then doing this drives the chemicals and the **paint** further into the porous surfaces. If the wood has no protective layer and it is bare wood then you can try lightly sanding the surface, following the grain of the wood. Power washing can sometimes remove it, however, if it is softwood then it can take the top surface off and splinter. If none of these methods works then you can try giving a couple of coats of **paint** or stain to cover it up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, try using some diluted bleach to wash over the door, this doesn’t always work and it depends on the type of garage door it is. If this doesn’t work then wipe a **paint** remover over the **paint** or **graffiti** you want to remove and use small circular motions with a soft cloth, remember to always wear protective gloves and goggles when using these industrial-strength chemicals. When the **paint** has lifted, you can wash down with warm soapy water. Using a **paint** remover will mean you will need to **paint** your whole garage door a couple of times, however, if you use Eco Solutions Graffiti Go it will lift the **graffiti** leaving your door looking as good as new. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
