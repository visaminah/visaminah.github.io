## 100 Things You Should Know About What Colors Does Purple And Green Make | Mixing Green And Purple
-   Blue and red are essential to creating **purple**, but you can mix in other **colors** to create different shades of **purple**. Adding white, yellow, or gray to your mixture of blue and red will give you a lighter **purple**. Incorporating black into your blue and red mixture will give you a darker shade of **purple**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mixing opposite **colors** on the color wheel is an excellent way to create multiple variations of black. For instance, you can combine **purple** and yellow to create a deep shade of rich black. Rather than mixing the two shades equally, you’ll need a larger portion of **purple** to yellow here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When learning how to make the color **purple**, you can also use different types of blues such as Pthalo Blue, Prussian Blue or Cerulean Blue. However, if you do not have any of these **colors** on hand. Simply use the blue and red **colors** that you have to make **purple**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To make a black paint darker, there’s no specific technique that works for everyone. It all depends on the primary method you use to make your black. If you’re using the method of mixing primary **colors**, you can use darker shades of red, and blue, to create a deeper shade of black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So, what are the two **colors** you can mix to make blue? Mix cyan (greenish-blue) with magenta (purplish-red), to create true blue. Now that you have created your true blue, you can experiment with creating different shades of blue. These shades can used for painting the ocean, or the sky. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are trying to create a strong color palette, try to combine **colors** analogous **colors**. The analogous **colors** are those that you can find on the left and right of the color. So, for the color pink, the **colors** you are looking for are red and red-orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For fashionistas looking to incorporate more **purple** into their wardrobe, consider this winning combo. Purple and mustard don’t just balance each other out – they make you look and feel like royalty. We suggest wearing a more reddish-**purple** so that the tones are closer to the warmer side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bear in mind that the ratios you use to create your different shades of blue will depend largely on the materials you are using. For example, if you want to create a particular shade of blue and you are using acrylic paints, the ratio of **colors** will be different than if you are working with water**colors**. This is because water**colors** blend quicker and more thoroughly than other more solid paints. The heart of the matter is that the color blue, as a primary color, can be made into any shade of blue you want, as long as you start by using cyan and magenta. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A tint is made when you add white to another color. Pink is an example of a tint because it is made by combining red with white. So by mixing **purple** with white, you can create a tint of **purple**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Subtractive mixing creates color by removing wavelengths of visible light by using physical elements like paints, pigments, or dyes. This process is called subtractive mixing because some wavelengths of light are absorbed instead of being reflected back as colored pigments are mixed together . When it comes to how to make **purple** paint, for instance, you’d want to use subtractive mixing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So now you know what happens when you mix green and **purple** paint. The result comes to be a dark greenish-brown color or muddy gray. This is because green and **purple** are both secondary **colors**. When mixed, they create a color scheme resulting from all three primary **colors**. The color’s hue depends on the mixing quantity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Colour theory states that you can gauge which colours complement each other by looking at them on a colour wheel. Colours directly opposite each other – or colours that “contrast” each other – are seen as complementary colours. They balance each other out. So what are the colours that compliment **purple**? Yellow, orange, and green are the most obvious ones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You will soon learn that learning how to make blue can only be perfected by practicing and experimenting. Once you have selected the **colors** you will use to create your perfect color, be careful, as blending too much of the paint will cause your color to become dull. A perfect mix will bring out all of the characteristics of your original blue base color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By adding black paint to your blue paint, you will create a dark blue color. However, you can also blend orange, or **purple** to give you the same result. So, you can try following both methods to see which one works best for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The length of a wave of light is measured in nanometers (nm). Longer wavelengths translate to **colors** that appear “warmer,” and shorter wavelengths create **colors** that look “cooler.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do you like earth tone **colors**? They can make great shades of **purple** and are an alternative way to mix more muted **purple**s, outside of mixing **purple** with its complementary color yellow. In the color chart below you can see that Blue (Cobalt Blue and Ultramarine Blue) can be mixed with Burnt Siena to create a **purple**. However, just mixing blue with Burnt Siena alone does not create a strong enough **purple**. So, I recommend mixing in a little bit of Alizarin Crimson or Cadmium red. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The three additive primary **colors**, for mixing light or illumination, are red, green and blue. Combining these **colors** produces the color white. Mixing red and blue creates magenta, red and green produce yellow, and blue and green combine to make cyan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What I found is that mixing red and **purple** became a “Maroon” color. Not a super pretty maroon, it had a muddy quality that would make a great neutral background, but I like making Maroon by mixing red and blue rather than trying to take an already mixed color and make it what I want! Additional Resource :: How To Make Purple Purple Mixed With Orange This was maybe the one that I liked the least! It did make a Taupe color, but it was a super dull, taupy brown color. That is because **purple** and orange are sort of caddy corner across the color wheel. Mixing paints that are at the “corners” or even right across works better! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to establish a harmonious color scheme, start by identifying two **colors** on the color wheel next. In addition, you can expect the new color’s hue when you mix green and **purple**. These two contrasting **colors** are also called neutral **colors**, and one can create tones of different hues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Little by little fold the orange paint into the blue using your paintbrush or a palette knife. By making use of complementary **colors**, you will be able to create a brilliant shade of dark blue. Try not to do too much mixing, as this will dull the paint color. Again, if you have accidentally mixed too much of the orange paint, add some extra blue paint to even out the ratio. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now that we have covered the practical side of how to mix different shades of **purple** it is time to look at the color **purple** at work in art. In the paintings below you will see how different shades of **purple** help to serve different roles. Muted **purple**s can act as shadows while bright **purple**s can be highlights. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So, since yellow is the complementary color of **purple** (and vice versa) we will mix **purple** with yellow to get a muted **purple** color. Below you will see different combinations of **purple** and yellow that you can mix together. In order to achieve various shades of **purple** **colors** that are muted. Here we reference the complementary color wheel but there are many variations in the color wheel for artists and it is well worth learning and understanding its nuances. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red and **purple** usually clash. But there’s a saying that goes, “you need to know the rules to break them”. No one knows this adage better than fashion icon Meghan Markle, who stepped out in an unexpectedly bold but chic **purple** dress and red coat ensembles. So, if you’re looking for more colours that go with **purple** clothes, red can work if you’re brave enough to try it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No, green and pink cannot make **purple**. As stated earlier, all complimentary **colors** will give you the color brown or gray. Complementary **colors** cannot stand on their own, so they can only produce a more neutral tone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red, a primary component of **purple**, is approximately 700 nanometers in wavelength. Red is one of the longer wavelengths that our eyes can see. The distance from crest to crest is only a little bit thicker than the membrane of a soap bubble. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And what about black and white? An object will appear white when it reflects all **colors**. This is because white contains all wavelengths of light and is made of all **colors** of the rainbow. The light from the sun is an example of white light! Then there’s black. Black objects absorb all color because they reflect no light back. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So what two **colors** make **purple** through additive mixing? In additive mixing, you can make **purple** by combining the wavelengths of blue light and red light in different proportions. Depending on the combination, you can get a pale **purple** like lavender...or a bold, dark **purple** like merlot! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The right side of the painting is a cool muted **purple**, though lighter than the other side of the wall. The lower far left side of the wall is much darker and slightly warmer than the right side. However, there are patches of lighter areas on the left side of the wall as seen by the middle arrow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Below, the hue emerging from the combination by using the “Wet Sponge” brush and “Smudge” blending yielded a totally muddy gray-black-blue. I think we’ve found our answer to the resulting color of mixing green and **purple**: it’s a dusty blue-gray that ranges from lighter to almost black, depending on the saturation and technique used. Unexpected! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We are all aware that temperature plays an important role when it comes to **colors**. Seeing that blue is regarded as a cool color, it is, therefore, possible for us to mix warm shades with blue **colors**. Ultramarine blue is indeed a warm color on its own, but at times you may need a warmer blue color. This is where you can mix ultramarine with alizarin crimson, creating a much warmer blue color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In some case, paint mixing can result in average wavelength. For example, mixing blue and yellow usually results in some shade of green despite them being complementary **colors**, because there is a green spectrum between yellow spectrum and blue spectrum. It's also one reason why mixing red and blue along with white can result in gray, because red and blue averages to **purple**, but the average wavelength is green which is a complementary color of **purple**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take your paintbrush and gently dip it into the black paint and drag only a small amount over to your blue paint, as black is a very strong color and will have a significant effect on your blue. Next, fold the **colors** making use of a mixing tool or your paintbrush, and at this stage, do not mix it thoroughly as it will make your color dull. Mix just enough to be able to assess the shade of dark blue you are creating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The color wheel can be a helpful tool for choosing contrasting **colors** that go well together. When choosing **colors** for your project, you can start by finding two **colors** next to each other on the color wheel. These **colors** will usually look good together. You can also create a color scheme by choosing **colors** opposite each other on the color wheel, creating a more striking effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the case of green, two primary **colors** have their role. One is yellow, and the other one is blue. And in the case of **purple**, red and blue are primary **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purple is such a standout color that it might seem like a problematic hue to build a decor scheme around. In reality, **colors** that go with **purple** span a spectrum of shades, including black, navy blue, white, and metallics. Gold, copper, and yellow are **colors** that go with dark **purple**, imparting a regal ambiance. And lilac, pink, and white are **colors** that go with light **purple** for a softer, delicate feel or a space for a child. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, depending on how you mix **colors** green and Pink, you will get some variation on brown or gray. For instance, if you choose light green, you will get a much brighter shade. The color you will get will be more gray or white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In general, **purple** refers to any color with a hue that is between red and blue. But getting the perfect shade of **purple** is a little more complicated than simply mixing these two **colors**. This is where the science of color comes in! Understanding the science behind making **purple** will help you make **purple** all on your own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may not always want to have a bright, saturated **purple**. Muted **colors** are a very important aspect to any painting as they are what make bright **colors** to stand out. So knowing what **colors** make **purple** muted, allows you to create different shades and combinations of muted **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paying attention to color temperature is absolutely essential when painting. It is one of the most important things to consider when you mix your **colors**. So what **colors** make **purple** cooler? Well, blue is one of the best **colors** to mix into your **purple** when you need to create a cool **purple**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, contrasting colours aren’t the only ones that matter. Colours right beside each other on the wheel also complement each other, like **purple**, indigo, and pink. You can also form a colour scheme or a colour palette by pinpointing three colours that form a triangle on the circle or four colours that form a rectangle. So for a triad, you’d get **purple**, green, and orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We’re calling it. Aubergine colour schemes will always be in style – it’s backed up by theory after all. As contrasting colours, **purple** and green go together in perfect harmony. Just check out these beautiful deep **purple** and dark green living rooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **colors** are opposite each other on the wheel. You can use a generous amount of green with touches of pink to create gorgeous nature-inspired patterns. Imagine a space that reminds you of botanicals and floral. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Green and yellow are adjacent to each other on the color wheel. Placing them together will give you and harmonious look. Both **colors** have an affinity with nature and spring. Their combination will instantly suggest flowers and leaves. It is refreshing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purple has many uses beyond just using the color to paint areas of **purple** in your painting. It is very helpful to mix into all sorts of other **colors** as well, even if that color is not meant to look **purple**. In fact you can mix a really nice shade of brown color using **purple**. Often just adding a small amount of **purple** can help to create a rich and complex color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Locate the color pink on the wheel, check for its exact opposite. The color on the exact opposite is pink’s complementary color. These **colors** complement each other because they will create balance and harmony when placed side by side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to make the blue appear deeper, then you need to add some gray or black. To make the color lighter, you need to add some white. Do not overdo it when you are adding extra **colors**, but just add a small dab of paint, so you can see the effect it has on your painting. Here are a few simple rules to follow when you are creating different shades of blue: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, we will take a look at what **colors** make **purple** when mixed together. Then I will show you how to make different shades of **purple**. So that you can create any **purple** color you may need – let’s get into it! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While green is considered a cool color, some shades of the color can veer toward brown, yellow, or red. You have to compare your shade of green with different paint swatches to identify the undertones. After that, use the **colors** to dictate the others in your palette. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To learn how to make **purple**, you need to have an understanding of the science behind color mixing. In this article, we’ll teach you everything you need to know about how to use **colors** to make **purple**. We’ll cover the following: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you explore the color blue, you will soon discover that each shade or tint has its characteristics. Below you will find a table that makes this a lot easier to follow and understand. For this example, we have only taken three of the best-known **colors** of blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most painters hardly ever use blue directly from the tubes, so they spend a lot of time mixing muted blue **colors**, or blue that is dull or has a low saturation. So, let us now learn how to create different muted shades of blue. When it comes to making muted **colors**, then complementary **colors** play a vital role. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like black and white, green and pink complement each other. The combination of these two **colors** is gorgeous. Green and Pink are great for outdoor weddings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Burnt umber mixed with **purple** creates a nice muted dark **purple** color. It also makes the **purple** a bit warmer as burnt umber is warmer in temperature than **purple**. Pthalo Green mixed with Alizarin Crimson makes a dark black color. So when you mix this color mixture with **purple** then you end up with a very dark **purple** color. This is probably one of the darkest **purple** **colors** you can mix up for yourself! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first step is to print out a copy of the color wheel. When choosing which color wheel to print out, rather choose a tertiary color wheel that has 12 **colors** that include various shades, hues, and tints. Apply some of the original blue paint to a piece of white paper and allow it to dry. Now compare that color with the color on your color wheel and make an accurate match. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What is a complementary color? These **colors** lay on opposite ends of the color wheel. The color wheel shows that yellow lies directly opposite to **purple**, this makes them complementary **colors**. In the same way, that blue is transversely situated from orange. Since blue and orange are both complementary **colors**, by mixing them, you create a muted shade of blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Saturation” refers to the amount of color in a hue relative to the amount of white or black. The more white or black added to a color, the less intense it will be. So a **purple** color like mauve isn’t very saturated because there’s a higher proportion of white to color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So what **colors** make **purple**? Purple is a combination of red light and blue light. An object that we perceive as **purple** has a makeup that causes it to absorb all wavelengths of light except those that fall around 700 nanometers and 475 nanometers in length. The object reflects those exact wavelengths mixed together, which gives the impression that the object is **purple**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When we mix specific **colors**, we create new **colors**. It refers to color mixing. For example, when we mix red and yellow together, we create orange. When we mix red and blue together, we create **purple**. In addition, green color and **purple** **colors** are called secondary **colors** from the color wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All the **colors** portrayed in the rainbow are beautiful, but the color of blue seems to catch your eye with its beautiful rich tone. The color seems to stir up feelings of peace, tranquility, and calmness. Yet, the color blue can also invoke an icy cold look and feel, and immediately arouses your alertness. All human beings are attracted to the color blue in some way or another, whether it is gazing up into the clear blue sky or looking into pools of sparkling, freshwater. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take your palette or paper plate and squeeze out some blue paint, and then squeeze out some **purple** paint next to the blue paint. Purple or violet are both analogous **colors** as they are found adjacent to blue on the color wheel. Ensure you have plenty of paint to finish your entire painting. Make sure that you have more blue paint as a base color than **purple** paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purple is sometimes confused with violet. But **purple** and violet are different **colors**. Here is the difference between **purple** and violet: violet refers to the color of a single wavelength, but **purple** comes from a combination of wavelengths. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **colors** pink and blue go well together. These **colors** don’t go well together because they complement each other, but people see them as the opposite. Pink is believed to be a girl’s color, and blue is seen as a boy’s color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hue refers to pure color. When we talk about a “hue,” we’re referring to the full saturation of a color or mixture of **colors**, with no white or black added in. The dominant wavelength in a color will create its hue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Average mixing obtains a new color out of two component **colors**, with brightness equal to the average of the two components. This is different from additive mixing, which results in a color lighter than the **colors** being mixed; and from subtractive mixing, which results in a color darker than the **colors** being mixed. Some examples of average mixing are: black and white averages to gray, and blue and red averages to **purple**. Average mixing has eight primary **colors**: white, cyan, magenta, yellow, red, green, blue, and black, and a maximum of four of those **colors** would be needed to archive a particular color, for example, using two **colors** that are part of a color wheel, along with white and black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Violet is considered a spectral color. Like blue and red, violet is created through a single wavelength of light which falls on the visible spectrum between 380 and 450 nanometers. Purple is not a spectral color. Instead, **purple** becomes visible to our eyes when the wavelengths of the spectral **colors** red and blue are mixed together and reflected by an object. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you create a dark blue color, take your blue, and mix it with another color. There are several different **colors** you can add that will make your blue darker. Learning how you can mix **colors** will increase your options and will provide you with the perfect blue shade. Let us have a look at some of these options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Additive color mixing is specifically used for mixing light waves. Additive color mixing is used to create **colors** for televisions, computer monitors, and disco lights, for instance. Basically, additive mixing creates **colors** by layering different wavelengths of light onto each other, then combining them with a white object. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to make a blue or any other color lighter, all you need to do is add some white. However, be careful to add the white paint in small amounts each time. When you are blending **colors**, always start with the lighter color and then add the darker color in small amounts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Truth is, **purple**, just like any other colour, is easy to experiment with. And you don’t even need to study design to know that. All you need is a basic understanding of colour theory. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to **purple**, adding in either white or black to a mixture of red and blue will adjust the value. If you’re going for a lighter **purple**, like periwinkle, add more white. If you want a darker **purple**, like deep violet, add more black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Muted **colors** are created by mixing a color with its complementary color. Take a look at the color wheel below. The **colors** that are opposite each other are the complementary **colors**. So, for example, yellow is the complementary color of **purple** and red is the complementary color of green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The artist used dark muted **purple** under the lemon as well as underneath the plate to denote shadows. He mixed a cool **purple** for the area that is behind the lemon. Having a cool **purple** in this area works well as cool **colors** recede back in space while warm **colors** move forward. On that note, he used shades of warm **purple** for the foreground area of the painting as you can see in the front center area of the work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Overall, Ultramarine Blue makes a dark **purple**, while **purple** mixed with Cobalt Blue will create a lighter shade of **purple**. Purple mixed with Alizarin Crimson, will also be a little cooler in color temperature, than if you create a **purple** with blue and Cadmium Red. You can also mix **purple**s with other varieties of reds than mentioned here such as Burnt Siena, Quinacridone Red, and Vermillion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, you can also mix dark shades of **purple** using Provence Violet Bluish or any other lighter **purple** color. Though keep in mind that when using Provence Violet Bluish you will end up with a lighter **purple** than Dioxazine Purple. However, you can still make a dark **purple** color with it as seen in the color chart. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many shades, hues, and tints of blue, for example, dark blue, light blue, muted blues, and warm blues. The list can go on and on, which is why we are here to help you learn what two **colors** make blue and how to create various shades of blue. At this stage, you may be asking the question what two **colors** make blue? The answer to what color makes blue is none, as blue is a primary color so there is no need to mix any two **colors** to make blue. However, there are two **colors** that you can mix to make blue. Once you have created your true blue color, then you can begin creating any blue hue that you can imagine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You are not limited to the **colors** mentioned in the color chart for creating a muted **purple**. You can use different shades of **purple** that you mix up yourself and then mix those with any yellow you choose. Other options for yellows are Cadmium Lemon Yellow, Hansa Yellow, and or whichever other yellow you might have on hand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are various **colors** which can combine together to make black. Red, yellow, and blue can all combine to create a primary shade of black. Alternatively, you can experiment with shades of red, blue, green, and **purple**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the **colors** I enjoy exploring the most, and I find people need most assistance with mixing, is green. It is a color that many people find difficult to control. Once you get out of control, everything looks very fake. Living in Tennessee means exposure to LOTS of green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I am showing a painting by one of the old masters to prove that they too used the color **purple**! This painting by Vermeer is an example of how muted **purple** can play a strong role in a painting. Most of the wall in the background is made of different shades of muted **purple**. The color scheme works very well as Vermeer uses a complementary color palette. Since the girl in the painting is dressed in yellow and the background is in **purple** the painting provides a beautiful Purple – Yellow complementary color scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What color does red and blue make when you add black or white? Adding black or white to a mixture of blue and red allows you to create many different types of **purple**. Tints of **purple** are created by mixing red, blue, and white. These tints will be lighter **colors**, like orchid. Shades of **purple** are made by mixing red, blue, and black. Shades will be darker and deeper **colors**, like indigo. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The color blue can make excellent dark **colors**. Ultramarine, for example, is already a dark blue color, and by using it, you can create outstanding shades of dark blue. By mixing dioxazine **purple** with ultramarine blue, you create a brilliant dark blue. The dioxazine **purple** tends to make the ultramarine blue much darker, and also adds a slight **purple** shade to it. When taking the dark blue, you created with the dioxazine **purple** and the ultramarine blue, and you add phthalo green, you make the color even darker, with a slight green tint to it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For my first experiment, pictured above, I used a white background, then drew diagonal swaths of different shades of **purple** using the “Acrylic” painting brush. Next to these, I added various hues of green. (Because both **purple** and green have different incarnations, I wanted to test a range of them.) I then used the “Smudge” tool to blend and mix all three versions of the color combinations together — similar to my experiment, “What Color Do Orange and Purple Make?” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red-green–blue additive mixing is used in television and computer monitors, including smartphone displays, to produce a wide range of **colors**. A screen pixel uses a juxtaposition of these three primary **colors**. Projection televisions sometimes have three projectors, one for each primary color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A shade is created by combining black with another color. So when you add black to **purple**, you get a shade of **purple**. The brightness or intensity of a color is also determined by how much black or white is added to it.
