While warm and bright colors look better with ivory, the cream color would look best with cool tones and deep **gray**s. If you’re planning on using either of these two colors in your home décor or as paint options, you must choose the former as ivory makes everything more lively and cream can come out as a little dull and old-fashioned.

-   10 of 21 Punchy Gray Color Scheme Emily Followill Gray-Brown + Orange + Coral Like a fine woolen jacket paired with a patterned tie, this **gray**, brown, and orange bedroom exudes elegant-yet-playful sensibilities.

-   01 of 21 What Goes with Gray? Kim Cornelison Far from boring, **gray** is the neutral of choice for many designers.

The fixed finishes were all over the place, and the **gray** they’d picked was too cool to coordinate with any of them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
