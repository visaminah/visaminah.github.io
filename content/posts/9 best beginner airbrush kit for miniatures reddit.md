## 9 Facts Best Beginner Airbrush Kit For Miniatures Reddit | Airbrush Pressure For Miniatures
-   If you’re looking for an **airbrush** to really get down close and do detailing the Badger Sotar is a great option. There’s two different models, the 20/20 and the Slim, which differ in the size of the paint cup. The 20/20 comes with a paint cup sized similar to most **airbrush**es while the Slim has a tiny reservoir intended to unblock your view while you’re painting. I own the Slim and I personally wish I had gone with the 20/20 as I need to do a lot of out-of-cup mixing and refill often while using it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Well now we’ve had our fun priming and painting our **miniatures**, next we’ve got to do the boring, and arguably most important, part of **airbrush**ing. We gotta clean the dang thing. Proper cleaning of your **airbrush** will ensure it works well and will save you the awful realization of sitting down to **airbrush** and finding you’ve left a half cup full of primer sitting overnight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At the end of your painting session you’ll want to do a little more involved cleaning. For myself this is mainly doing the rinse process I used above, but also cleaning the needle separately and doing another rinse without the needle in the **airbrush**. Usually I’ll put a bit of **airbrush** cleaner onto a paper towel and wipe down the needle until there’s no more paint on it. At this point you can apply a bit of **airbrush** lubricant to the needle in a similar way with the paper towel and then reassemble. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An **airbrush** cleaning pot will give you a good place to rest the **airbrush** and spray into when cleaning your **airbrush**. If you don’t pick up an **airbrush** cleaning station you’re going to at a minimum want an **airbrush** stand. Either way you need somewhere safe to put your brush when it’s not being used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So we’ve got an **airbrush** and a compressor now, what else do we need for a set-up? Bare minimum you absolutely need at least a respirator mask for safety. A half face mask is more than enough protection but you’ll also want the correct cartridges for it. I use P100 cartridges with mine, which are suitable for gas and vapour, as you’re going to be working with aerosolized paint. The specific mask I use is the 3M Dual Cartridge Respirator. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In our Fabricator General series, we talk about hobbying techniques and tricks, and ways to build, model, shape, and fix everything, with an eye toward information for both beginners and veterans. This week, That Gobbo and Pvt_Snafu are talking about the equipment, set-up, and basics required to get started **airbrush**ing models. Then in How to Paint Everything we’ll be talking about the basics of **airbrush** painting and the techniques you can use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Airbrushing opens up a whole host of new tools and benefits for any miniature painted. My favourite is being able to prime and varnish no matter the weather! It could be pouring with rain or freezing cold, but your **airbrush**ed primer doesn’t care about either of these. As you progress in confidence, laying down large, smooth base layers and creating transitions becomes easier and easier with an **airbrush**. For newbies, figuring out how to get started **airbrush**ing can be an intimidating process: There are lots of new tools to research and techniques to figure out and it can be daunting to figure out where to go and what to buy first. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   NOTE: Badger **airbrush**es use a different connector from most **airbrush**es so you will need to purchase an adapter in order to use it with most compressors. This is one I use: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038NJYHG/ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Learning how to **airbrush** opens up a whole new tool set to enhance your hobby productivity. Airbrushing has some large upfront costs, and we understand this, however in the long term it allows you to paint faster and with greater flexibility. We hope this guide has helped you take your first steps towards owning an **airbrush**, and shooting some paint! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
