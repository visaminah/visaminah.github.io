-   So, how does **blue** make you feel? Humans through the ages have believed that certain colors arouse various kinds of moods. Research shows that various colors can prompt certain emotions. However, **blue** is one of those colors that form part of nature in the sky or the water, which may be the reason why many feel the color **blue** has a calming effect on them. Let us now look at how the color **blue** can affect your moods and feelings. The study and psychology of the color **blue** can indicate the following. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for a dignified yet non-traditional combination with **blue**, violet is a great color to choose. And one of the best ways to use this combination is to incorporate a variety of shades ranging from **blue** to **blue**-violet. One example is a living room with shades from sky **blue** to navy **blue** to deep purple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like the stone it’s named after, peridot incorporates a pleasant mixture of green and yellow. This is a great, vibrant color that can be used similarly to lime when paired with **blue**. If you just want a few accents of this color, try finding medium **blue** and peridot patterned pillows or blankets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although **blue** and gray is usually a conservative combination, one of the boldest things you can do for your overall outfit is to wear these colors as footwear. Dark navy Oxfords are the best choice with a suit since they resemble a standard black business shoe with just a hint of added color, but they are difficult to find. Those with dandy impulses and in a less conservative environment could go with brighter **blue**s, such as a **blue** wholecut Oxford or monk strap, paired with a light gray suit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Socks are also a terrific option to coordinate **blue** and gray. As a rule, begin with the principle of matching socks to your pants, not your shoes. You can show some panache by wearing socks that contain the complementary color to your pants (for example, **blue** socks with gray trousers ) or, better yet, socks that contain both colors, like a light **blue** and light gray shadow stripe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to make a **blue** or any other color lighter, all you need to do is add some white. However, be careful to add the white paint in small amounts each time. When you are blending colors, always start with the lighter color and then add the darker color in small amounts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As we’ve seen so far, **blue** almost always looks good with various shades of brown. And mahogany is a highly dignified shade of brown. The easiest way to integrate it with **blue** is to incorporate mahogany-stained wood furniture (or even darker-stained wood flooring). Most designers recommend using bolder **blue**s in this context, so navy, marine **blue**, or even slate **blue** are all great options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re a fan of rich, jewel-tone shades, golden yellow is one that looks great with **blue**. The shade of **blue** you choose will make a dramatic difference in any room. Soft **blue**s can work almost like neutrals, so you could make a statement with golden-yellow furniture or a bedspread against a backdrop of soft **blue** walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Accessories, including gloves, hats, and scarves, are another great way to use these two colors, and, again, you have two broad options. If you have a gray coat on, you could go monochromatic and select elegant gray cashmere-lined peccary gloves to match tones. Alternatively, go with a contrast and choose a pair of bold petrol **blue** leather gloves in lamb nappa leather. With a scarf, you may be able to “kill two birds with one stone” by purchasing a double-sided version, like this dark **blue** and gray one in alpaca from Fort Belvedere, which lets you contrast or blend with a flip of the cloth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for a way to revitalize a living room, a **blue** and soft orange color scheme is a great way to do so. And just like most color combinations on the list, you can create a variety of moods with this one depending on the exact shades you use. For an airy, coastal feel, combine sherbet orange with pastel **blue**. Either one makes a great wall color, and you can even incorporate **blue** and orange patterned rugs or throws for some high-energy contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The opposite move–a gray sports coat with navy trousers–is rarer, maybe because it is generally more difficult to pull off a lighter jacket with darker pants. However, there’s no reason to be dissuaded, as long as your **blue** pants don’t look like the bottom half of a suit. Here, a pattern can be your friend and using a gray sports coat that contains a pattern, again the classic glen check or Prince of Wales, will enhance your chances of success. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The lavender shade is a symbol of love and devotion. It is an excellent color that reaps astonishing results when paired with Blue. The **blue** and lavender combination on the walls will represent a calm bedroom. You can also add a touch of blended furniture for instant magic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   4002 Fire and Ice’ is the right way to describe this colour combination with dark **blue**. Mustard yellow can get very striking so a good option is to paint your furniture in this shade. Place the piece of cabinet or table against a stark dark **blue** wall and you have yourself a combination that beautifully blends a cool and warm colour palette. These **colours** work beautifully for a living room that seeks to give off a tropical island vibe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A mid-width, solid pink tie in silk will look great at any gathering. Pink will match with any shade of **blue** suit. In my opinion, the color works better in summer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you like the combination of **blue** and red but want a stately palette, try combining burgundy with **blue**. In particular, navy and burgundy look great together. Generally, designers suggest using the 60-30-10 rule. That means to choose a neutral (white, gray, and soft beige are all good choices) and make that neutral take up 60% of the room. Choose either burgundy or navy and make that color take up about 30%, and then take the remaining color and make that one take up about 10%. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But **blue** projects confidence and daring. And I’m not talking about navy here. I’m talking about true **blue** as a clear sky. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **blue** you choose is up to you. Since burnt orange is a lot more muted than bright shades of **blue**, brighter **blue**s are an option here. Navy or slate **blue**s are also a way to use this combination while still maintaining a relatively calm atmosphere. Burnt orange walls and dark **blue** appliances can create the perfect balance of creative energy and grounded calm in a kitchen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is another great option for those who love jewel tones. And burnt orange is ideal for creating an autumn-inspired palette. Adding a little burnt orange is a great quick fix if you feel like a mostly-**blue** room has become too cold and unwelcoming. Throw pillows or wall hangings that are mostly burnt orange are easy and inexpensive options for evening out a room. If you want to capitalize on this autumnal aesthetic, add in some golden yellow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue color mixes well with other colors to add a perfect touch to your bedroom walls. Several shades of **blue** provide a two-color combination for your bedroom. You can choose to give yourself beach therapy by using the 'Turquoise + Beige' combination or add a power statement to your bedroom with the 'Blue + Black' combination. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   CMYK 100, 50, 0, 60 Mysterious and elegant at the same time, midnight **blue** can spark a range of emotions. Though it’s commonly linked to concepts like tranquility, due to its connection with the night sky, it can also be seen as deeply luxurious and sophisticated. This could be an excellent shade for a company trying to demonstrate a depth of knowledge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So for somewhat of a similar reason as the light **blue** shirt, this color is appropriate for wearing to school or work because it’s also pretty understated. But unlike the light **blue** shirt, you can only wear it when it’s appropriate to wear such outfits hence the “light.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here are a few **blue** suit/shirt/tie combinations worth playing around with until you find what works for you. Remember, it’s not just the color of the tie that counts. The shape and texture play important roles too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In a kitchen, try black tile flooring with a deep **blue** backsplash and white cabinets and countertops. Or for an old-school look in a moody room, you can even include black-and-**blue** patterned brocade curtains. You can also go subtle by combining a navy couch with cream-colored walls decorated with black-framed photos or art pieces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   CMYK 70, 70, 0, 0 Blue RYB is the name given to the color **blue** on the RYB color spectrum. This is a historical set of colors used for subtractive color mixing. Blue RYB can make a fantastic primary color for an artist’s composition. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, you need to identify the shade of orange that is opposite and complementary to the shade of **blue** you identified. This will be the color orange that you will be mixing with your **blue** to darken it. Some examples of this are mixing ultramarine **blue** with burnt sienna or cobalt **blue** with cadmium orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   CMYK 100, 58, 0, 33 One of the most popular hues in the **blue** spectrum, cobalt **blue** is actually created by sintering aluminum oxide and cobalt oxide.

-   CMYK 12, 0, 0, 0 Cyan is one of the brighter **blue** shades on the color wheel, and one of the richest kinds of **blue** you can create for any composition. To create light cyan, artists include additional white in the image. The white helps to subdue some of the liveliness of the brighter color, while still maintaining many of the eye-catching elements of cyan itself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Beyond avoiding sharp contrast, try adding complexity and interest to your **blue** and gray combinations by introducing textures and patterns. Sure, you can start simply with a white shirt, solid tie, and a plain worsted wool suit, but this gets boring fast. An easy way to add a pattern while remaining classic is to use a gray glen check tie in silk (or wool for winter) with a navy suit. For a gray suit, get a navy grenadine tie in either a large or fine weave (garza grossa or garza fina) to inject texture. In the reverse scenario, pick up a silver grenadine for a **blue** suit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some people might consider turquoise to be a shade of **blue**, but many actual turquoise stones are closer to being green. Either way, this shade is one that can be combined with **blue** for a memorable look. If you like patterned wallpaper, a turquoise and white accent wall can be a great way to add some character to a room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   CMYK 100, 50, 0, 0 Azure **blue** is a deeper, richer **blue** intended to convey one of the darkest shades of the natural sky.

It’s a beautiful color for all kinds of compositions and it’s great for standing out with branding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like many tech companies, Facebook’s brand identity has been grounded in **blue** since its early days, attempting to call to mind trust and security. It’s arguable if Facebook has achieved real trust, but it has become utterly ubiquitous. So, perhaps actual trustworthiness is irrelevant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   CMYK 70, 70, 0, 0 Compared to other **blue** colors, neon **blue** is one of the brightest on this list, intended to immediately grab attention and strand out against a range of backgrounds. Neon **blue** is vibrant and exciting, with a significant amount of richness baked into the shade. Many types of neon **blue** have a kind of purple hue to them, which provides additional warmth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you prefer largely-neutral palettes, you can sprinkle in a few **blue** accents when you have a room with champagne furniture and walls. A couple of **blue** vases, bowls, and throw pillows are often enough. This is also a combination that works well in bathrooms: try soft **blue** walls (or tile floors) with champagne-colored hardware. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This rich, vibrant red can add some real color. But since the red and **blue** combination can become overwhelming if you aren’t careful, this combination is a prime candidate for the 60-30-10 rule. In a dining room, try mostly-cream walls, a red accent wall, and a **blue** table runner or **blue** upholstered chairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take your palette or paper plate and squeeze out some **blue** paint, and then squeeze out some purple paint next to the **blue** paint. Purple or violet are both analogous colors as they are found adjacent to **blue** on the color wheel. Ensure you have plenty of paint to finish your entire painting. Make sure that you have more **blue** paint as a base color than purple paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   CMYK 96, 30, 0, 18 One of the most popular shades of bright **blue**, electric **blue** is light, bright, and brimming with life. The shade is much deeper and often more eye-catching than many of the common light **blue**s mentioned above. Sometimes, artists and companies will darken or lighten their electric **blue** to shade to give it additional depth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Printed silk ties with **blue** and gray geometric patterns or knit ties with both colors in them are likewise excellent options. I especially like the versatility of striped ties with either a repp pattern or large block stripes for this purpose. If you get a tie with stripes of both colors you can wear them easily with either gray or **blue** suits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another understated way to harness this combination is to hang photos or art pieces in silver frames on **blue** walls.

Alternatively, for a cool contrast, place the mustard couch in front of a deep **blue** accent wall. Couches aren’t your only option here, though. Even a simple mustard-yellow lampshade or two can add some subtle warm energy to a room with a lot of **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take your palette or a paper plate and place an ample amount of **blue** paint onto the surface, enough to finish your project. You need to make sure that the amount of **blue** paint will be enough to cover what you need because it is difficult to try and match the same shade of dark **blue** paint a second time. If you make too much paint, it is no problem, as you can store the excess paint in a plastic container. Take a sponge or paper towel, wet it, and place it under your palette or paper plate to prevent your paint from drying out while you are busy painting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To be clear, I’m not condoning wild, free-for-all color choices here. True, the real beauty of a **blue** suit is that it’s so darn versatile. But that doesn’t mean you can throw everything together in a haphazard frenzy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a lighter look, even a few lavender accents will add some character to a soft **blue** room. Start with a lavender-patterned accent pillow or two and then add more lavender accents if needed.

-   CMYK 100, 74, 0, 47 Sophisticated and elegant, Resolution **blue** is brimming with a sense of deep heritage. This shade has a mature element to it which could make it a good pick for a branding strategy for a company hoping to portray a worldly and cultured image. The color is also excellent for all kinds of interior design and product options, as it’s still bright enough to catch the eye. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even the color **blue** is very popular, it is also the least enticing or appealing color. This is why many of the plans for weight loss encourage you to eat from a **blue** plate, as it only occurs in nature in the form of berries and plums. We are all encouraged to avoid any foods that are regarded as poisonous, and food that has **blue** coloring in it is a sure sign of spoilt or poisonous food - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The same techniques mentioned above can be used when wearing sports coat and trouser combinations, though some men may be put off by the perceived difficulties of coordinating an additional article of clothing: pants in a different shade. If you begin with **blue** and gray, this is actually a piece of cake. Like the navy suit, the navy blazer is a staple, foundational item of menswear. Technically, a solid blazer has to be **blue**, so begin there and add gray pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The color **blue** can make excellent dark colors. Ultramarine, for example, is already a dark **blue** color, and by using it, you can create outstanding shades of dark **blue**.

The dioxazine purple tends to make the ultramarine **blue** much darker, and also adds a slight purple shade to it. When taking the dark **blue**, you created with the dioxazine purple and the ultramarine **blue**, and you add phthalo green, you make the color even darker, with a slight green tint to it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   CMYK 50, 25, 0, 20 Blue-gray, or **blue**-grey, is a medium **blue** color mixed with elements of grey.

While this color is quite cold, it can also appear very mature and professional, ideal for various kinds of branding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink and **blue** might evoke memories of baby showers. But when combined carefully, they can make a lovely palette in any room. Try cornflower-**blue** couches with a few pink vases, bowls, or accent pillows in a living room.

-   CMYK 100, 20, 0, 0 Similar to many shades of **blue**, vivid **blue** sky is named for its close connection to one of the many colors of our natural sky. This is the kind of color you might spot above you when taking a stroll on a spring day. It’s also a popular color for interior décor, particularly in bathrooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   CMYK 85, 70, 0, 27 A restorative and reviving shade, Persian **blue** has roots extending all the way to Persia.

-   When using this lively color, it’s a good idea to temper its energy with cooler **blue**s. Slate **blue** and cornflower are two examples.

-   For those seeking a sleek, modern appeal, incorporating metal into a room is a must. And the combination of **blue** and silver is a popular one for a reason.

-   Take your palette or paper plate and squeeze out just enough **blue** paint required to complete the dark shade of **blue**. Now add some of the orange next to and not on top of the **blue** paint, you will only need a small amount of the orange paint so add it carefully. Drag a very small amount of the orange into the **blue** paint making sure it is not too much, and then keep adding a small amount each time until you are satisfied with the color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As seen from the first step above, mixing **blue** with green will give you a light form of cyan. This light cyan color is acceptable on your color printer. However, when using paint, it needs to be made darker as it is a cool color, and the whole effect will only be appreciated in its darkened form. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also take cadmium green and mix it with cobalt **blue**, creating a warm **blue** shade. This warm color may not be as warm as when mixed with alizarin crimson, but it does give you a **blue** shade that is warmer. Now, if you use cobalt **blue** which is regarded as cooler than ultramarine **blue**, with the same combinations as seen above, your **blue** created will not be as warm as when you use ultramarine **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By adding black paint to your **blue** paint, you will create a dark **blue** color. However, you can also blend orange, or purple to give you the same result. So, you can try following both methods to see which one works best for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   CMYK 23, 3, 0, 10 Powder **blue** is one of the paler shades of **blue** in the spectrum. This color is similar to a lot of grey-**blue**s, as it has a colder tone to it.

-   You can find this color in many Persian-style rugs. Even something as simple as adding one of these rugs to a room with **blue** couches can do wonders. Or if you want something more subtle, go for an eclectic mix of cranberry red and **blue** vases and/or bowls in a largely neutral space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pastel yellow is a beautifully light, springlike touch in any room. It’s the color of baby chicks and daffodil petals.

Just about any **blue** shade will look nice here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For most people, the **blue** and orange combination is quite tricky and scary to try. Not all are willing to take the risk for that fashion statement. However, gurus can say that it is possible to pull this color combination off as long as it is done correctly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want a rustic, Southwest-inspired aesthetic, try a palette of warm terra-cotta and cool **blue**. Some designers recommend pairing dusk **blue**, a pale near-neutral **blue**, with terra cotta. But almost any shade of **blue** will do! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
