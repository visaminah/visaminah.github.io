## 229 Fun Facts Best Sony E Mount Lens For Landscape | sony e mount lenses for landscape photography
-   Sony FE 24mm F/2.8G - Sony FE What a delight to have such a light and compact **lens** that handles superbly and delivers excellent sharpness both centre and edge. The **lens** is a real joy to use and is 'Highly Recommended'. Interested? Help support ePHOTOzine by using these links. Amazon UK Amazon US - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony makes a number of FE-mount (full frame) **lens**es for its a7 series cameras. Are these **lens**es compatible on E-mount cameras without an adapter? The short answer is yes. However, FE **lens**es are quite expensive and beyond the price range of many people who buy APS-C cameras. In addition, FE-mount **lens**es generally are heavier and bulkier than E-mount **lens**es, which you’ll notice even more on compact and lightweight cameras like the a6500 and a6300. On full-frame cameras like the a7R IV, Sony actually reinforced the **lens** mount, and those cameras were much larger to begin with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you need anything better than the Samyang 85mm f/1.4 manual focusing **lens**, then it has to be the Sony FE 85mm f/1.8 auto-focusing **lens**. It does come at twice the price of the Samyang though. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** has 16 elements in 13 groups with two aspherical, two SLD, and three FLD elements to minimize chromatic aberration. It is a bit large and heavy. But it should not overbalance the crop-sensor cameras too much. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Given the rather expensive wide-angle **lens** options above such as the Sony 10-18mm f/4 and Zeiss 12mm f/2.8, we like thinking outside the box with the Rokinon 12mm f/2. This manual focus **lens** comes in a Sony E Mount and is reasonably priced at around $250. And perhaps most impressive is its maximum aperture of f/2, which is terrific for astrophotography and other low-light photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **lens** from Samyang also has an unusual focal length with its 75 mm. 85 mm is more common for portrait **lens**es, but the 75 mm in combination with its aperture of f/1.8 is just as capable of producing a great background blur, so you can really make your subject stand out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** has nine elements in eight groups with one extra-low dispersion element. It uses a Dual Linear autofocus motor. The aperture has nine rounded blades. A Focus Hold button and an AF/MF switch are on the barrel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In recent years, Sony has pushed to include faster telephoto **lens**es in its lineup. The A9 camera bodies and fast telephotos have made the system attractive to more sports and wildlife photographers. Most recently, Sony has focused on **lens**es for video. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sigma is half the price of the Sony FE 24-70mm f/2.8 GM but gives it stiff competition. The Sony version has an edge with image sharpness. But this **lens** is not far behind in quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony labels **lens**es designed for full frame cameras “FE.” Sony labels APS-C **lens**es with an “E.” This can be confusing at first. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For APS-C shooters, the Canon APS-C 24mm f/2.8 is a fantastic value. Slightly wider than a standard zoom **lens**, it’s perfect for a range of landscape scenery. The compact size and weight make it ideal for travel. The optical design features one aspherical element to minimize distortion and spherical aberrations, both common issues for wide angle photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony’s 24-105 mm f/4 G OSS is the perfect travel **lens**. It covers a wide range of focal lengths and is small enough for everyday use. The images are sharp, and the autofocus is fast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, the reality is that many Sony APS-C photographers are priced out of buying a $1,000-ish prime **lens**. No matter how good the optical quality is, 35mm truly has to be your focal length of choice to merit the high cost. That said, we love the image and build quality—the Sony 24mm f/1.8 has a professional feel and performance that are tough to match. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 85mm F1.8 **lens** comes at only 371 grams which is perfect for the compact body of most Sony cameras and it costs only around 550 USD retail which is almost half the price of the Sigma 85mm F1.4 DG DN **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It has an aperture of f/1.8 and a surprisingly good image quality. At 500 euros, this portrait **lens** definitely offers the best value for money in the market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** has 17 elements in 14 groups with two ED, two Super ED, one XA, and one aspherical element. The RDSSM and four XD linear motor (LM) autofocusing system is four times faster than the previous model. And it has 11 rounded aperture blades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM is a fast and high-quality telephoto prime **lens**. It has a medium build quality with a plastic **lens** mount and a metal **lens** barrel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Samyang AF 85mm f/1.4 RF is a very large and heavy **lens**, but it’s also quite fast. It has a non-rotating front filter thread, so you can use slim filters or polarising filters without the need to rotate it during composition. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And yet another 35 mm prime **lens** from Sony. This **lens** excels with its incredible **lens** speed of f/1.4. However, that also means it’s very bulky and heavy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This specific article will help you to choose your **lens** for landscape photography. You’re going to tell me, you can do landscape photography with any **lens**, even with a 18-55mm kit **lens**. Of course, this is not wrong. But the purpose here is to suggest the possibilities that are available if you want to upgrade to better equipment than the one you got in a kit when you bought your camera. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It has nine elements in eight groups with seven rounded aperture blades. It has good image stability, and the images are sharper than third-party equivalents. The **lens** is fast with quiet autofocus. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony FE 90mm F2.8 Macro G OSS Lens: A macro **lens** can really give your photos a unique perspective that you can not get from any other **lens**es and the best macro **lens** you can get for your Sony camera is the Sony FE 90mm F2.8 Macro G OSS **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This review is based on a loan sample of the Samyang AF 85mm f/1.4 F **lens**, provided to me by B&H. You can purchase it here or check for availability at Adorama and Amazon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And this **lens** certainly lives up to those demands. It can easily go toe to toe with the Sony 24 to 70 mm. Top image quality, fast, quiet, and slightly more compact and lighter than the Sony G Master. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That means this **lens** has some big boots to fill, and we’re pleased to report it does so with aplomb that befits this **lens**’ high price. It’s ultrawide – 14mm is about as wide as you can get on a full-frame sensor without seeing goldfish bowl-style barrel distortion – while the 2x zoom ratio allows you a little compositional flexibility. The aperture opens as wide as f/2.8 – yes, bigger apertures are available on other **lens**es with similar focal lengths, but, while this might not be the brightest **lens** on the block, you could still use it to get into nightscape photography without astronomical (sorry) ISOs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The bokeh is creamy, smooth, and beautiful. If you are looking for a macro **lens**, look no further. For the cost, you get a super-sharp **lens**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can use this **lens** for real estate, landscape, astrophotography, or as a walking around **lens**. It is probably too wide for portraiture. But the bokeh is beautiful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With some **lens**es, you can get close to your subject. With other **lens**es, you have some distance for the focusing system to work. It is worth looking at a **lens**’s minimum focusing distance if you like to get close to your subject. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Handling is excellent; compared to its legendary predecessor, the Z 14-24mm’s 650g is positively featherweight. We appreciate a few pro-grade touches, such as the customisable function button and the OLED display on the top, which can be set to display current focal length, aperture or focus distance. Of these, focus distance is clearly the most useful, but it’s handy to have options. The final box ticked is weather and dust sealing, making this a **lens** that should be able to live a reasonably hard life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This option from Tamron for Sony E mount photographers features dual linear focus motors. In addition, a whopping six low dispersion elements help create gorgeous colors, high contrast, and low ghosting and flaring. The bright f/2.8 aperture will make capturing landscapes during dawn and dusk easier, and the weather sealing will protect your investment while out in the elements. You can read our full review of this **lens** here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nevertheless, the **lens** is an affordable starting point for getting into photography, especially when purchased in a kit. And its compact size really comes in handy when you’re traveling. The **lens** currently costs 380 euros on its own. That’s an okay price, but you can save even more money buying it in a kit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   OSS image stabilization is useful in that it can help make certain tricky hand-held photos in low light possible. With faster **lens**es that have maximum apertures of f/2.8 or better, OSS isn’t a major priority since you can typically eliminate shake by opening the aperture to bump up shutter speed. If you’re wanting more depth of field, a tripod is the more surefire solution, but OSS definitely is an upside to any **lens**, and especially heavy models with long zoom ranges. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony compact trio **lens**es consist of 3 **lens**es, the 24mm F2.8, 40mm F2.5, and 50mm F2.5 and they are all extremely versatile in their own rights with a fast aperture, an almost identical form factor, and a size as small as a pancake kit **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 45 mm is special because the focal length is rather unusual. The normal focal length for full-frame **lens**es is typically around 50 mm. In purely mathematical terms, however, 45 mm is closer to the field of vision of the human eye, making this **lens** an interesting alternative. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Compact prime **lens**es never look as impressive as professional zoom **lens**es. Don’t let the small size discourage you. Within hours of putting a wide-angle prime **lens** on your camera and heading out for a few landscape shots, you’ll be blown away at the image quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony E 20mm f/2.8 is a super compact pancake **lens** for APS-C E mount cameras. Extending just 0.8” from the mount, you won’t find a more compact, lightweight setup for APS-C E mount cameras. The 30mm equivalent focal length is a great choice for landscape photographers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony 14mm F1.8 GM **lens** is designed to do just that. With the ultra-wide focal length of 14mm, you will be able to capture the stunning landscape in all its glory while also retaining the expansiveness of the night sky all in one frame. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This fast nifty-fifty **lens** has Sony’s widest aperture. The **lens** is sharp and produces superior image quality with beautiful colors. It is an all-around **lens**. You can use it for portraits, street photography, or landscapes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There aren’t all that many E-mount **lens** choices at the telephoto end of the spectrum, but the wallet-friendly 55-210mm model has the farthest reach with an equivalent of 315mm (second is the 18-200mm below with an equivalent of 300mm). All in all, you get decent optics, a low weight for a **lens** of this type at 12.2 ounces, and a reasonable price. Keep in mind that the 55-210mm OSS is available in many of Sony's mirrorless camera kits, or you can buy it on its own for around $350 (it’s a much better value as part of a kit). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony 50mm F1.2 GM **lens** is the fastest prime **lens** Sony has ever manufactured. With the incredible F1.2 aperture, you are guaranteed to capture sharp images even when the light is poor. The bokeh effect of this **lens** is also incredibly smooth and you can throw any busy background at it and it will smoothen your image out with no problem. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** is ideal for landscape photography. The image quality is outstanding, even with an open aperture. The **lens** is also protected against dust and splash water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 12-24 mm f/2.8 GM is a ridiculously sharp **lens** with the widest angle of view Sony makes. The edges are sharp with no coma or chromatic aberrations even at 12mm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here are the 19 best Sony **lens**es. On our list, you will find a variety of focal lengths—wide-angle, mid-range, and telephoto **lens**es. We have listed both prime and zoom **lens**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hear us out. Using telephoto zooms for landscapes isn’t as bonkers as it may sound. Yes, wide-angle **lens**es are fantastic for landscape photography as they allow you to capture sweeping vistas; however, when you’re out and about, you’ll often come across a scene where exquisite details could become lost. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a plethora of **lens**es available for Sony cameras, but until recently, options were a little on the thin side when it came to E-mount ultra-wide **lens**es. Now, though, photographers who use Sony cameras have more choices than ever in this specialty category. If you’re a landscape photographer, a cityscape photographer, or if you like to dabble in astrophotography, and you’re in the market for some Sony E-mount ultra-wide **lens**es, the ten we rounded up after the break are the ones you should check out first. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Landscape photography means different things to different people. For some, landscape photography is something they do during a walk or while out on their bike. For others, it’s the whole point of going outside and the reason they set their alarm to go off before dawn. While both of these types of photographer want to be able to capture high-quality images, they are likely to have different requirements for the build of the **lens**es that they use and their price expectations may vary accordingly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many of Sony’s E-mount **lens**es have built-in Optical SteadyShot (OSS) image stabilization (you’ll notice the OSS moniker at the end of the **lens** name). This technology is similar to Nikon’s Vibration Reduction (VR) and Canon’s Image Stabilization (IS) in that the **lens** itself helps to offset camera shake in subpar lighting conditions. Essentially, a floating element in the **lens** shifts according to movements, which can be particularly helpful when using bulky telephoto **lens**es. This differs from in-camera image stabilization, which occurs when the sensor itself undergoes a similar process. The Sony a6600 and a6500 currently are the only Sony E-mount cameras to offer in-camera image stabilization (it’s also available on Sony’s full-frame a7 series). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **lens** is similar to the EF 85mm f/1.2L II USM (MSRP $1,549.99), with a few minor differences: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This pro-grade **lens** features a multi-focus stepping motor autofocus system, which enables the **lens** to be quick and precise when autofocusing. The optical image stabilization will help you handhold this **lens** easily, the programmable control ring lets you set up this **lens** to work for you and your style of shooting and the weather sealing makes it so that this **lens** can be used no matter what the weather is doing; providing you use a weather sealed camera. This **lens** is pricey, but it’s more than worth the cost of admission. Be sure to check out our full review. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   APS-C and MFT format users will be familiar with using different focal lengths to achieve the same angles of view as full frame, so the crop factors do need to be taken into account. This will be around 1.5x for APS-C, meaning a 20mm **lens** would be roughly equivalent to the field of view of a full-frame 30mm **lens**. For MFT, a 12mm **lens** and the 2x crop factor means that the equivalent full frame field of view is similar to 24mm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** has 17 elements in 14 groups with multiple aspheric elements and extra-low dispersion elements. This increases sharpness and reduces chromatic aberrations. The aperture ring has nine rounded blades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “The Tamron 17-70mm f2.8 Di III-A VC RXD is a fantastic **lens** overall. You’re getting old-school Sony image quality, **lens** character, weather sealing, fast autofocus, and a lightweight body. How could you complain? My absolute favorite thing about this **lens** is the nostalgic feeling I get working with it. “ Chris Gampat – Editor In Chief - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The image quality is very good and the **lens** is extremely fast with a maximum aperture of f/1.4. Only the autofocus leaves something to be desired with this **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** has three Focus Hold buttons and an AF/MF switch. There is also a focus limiter, and you can control image stabilization. The **lens** comes with a removable and rotating tripod collar. The barrel also has a zoom torque adjustment ring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This full frame wide-angle prime **lens** will do it all. It works as a wide portrait **lens**. It is also good for video or astrophotography. It is light, bright, and tack sharp. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for the best of the best and are less concerned with cost-saving, then the Nikon Z 14-24mm f/2.8 S should be right up your alley. The ‘S’ designation means it’s a premium Z-mount **lens**, designed for serious enthusiast and professional users who don’t want to compromise on optical quality. And as such, it delivers – in our review, we found the Nikkor Z 14-24mm f/2.8 S to be capable of producing images with absolutely stunning sharpness, in a range of situations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony’s f/2.8 1635 mm G Master **lens** is one of the best landscape, wide-angle **lens**es you can buy. It is also great for real estate and indoor photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** barrel includes a sliding focus ring for AF/MF selection. There is also a Focus Hold button and a focus range limiter to set your capture distances for easier focus. You can also control image stabilization. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It also is slower, with a variable maximum aperture of f/4.5 to f/5.6. Both **lens**es use the same focusing system and work with Sony’s teleconverters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With a focal length equivalent of 18mm, the Zeiss Touit 12mm is for serious wide-angle photographers. For those who don’t know, Zeiss makes some of the premier glass on the planet both for consumer and industrial use, and the company’s **lens**es are extremely popular among enthusiasts. The Zeiss Touit 12mm f/2.8 offers better low-light performance than the Sony 10-18mm f/4 above by a full stop, excellent sharpness, minimal distortion, and superb color rendition. All told, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better wide-angle **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The HD PENTAX-D FA 85mm f/1.4ED SDM AW’s construction includes five elements in four groups, including aspherical elements that are featured in the fourth group to reduce spherical aberrations. This minimizes the number of **lens** components, reducing overall size and weight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There aren’t many telephoto zooms available for those who use L mount cameras. However, when you have one available that’s as good as the Panasonic Lumix S f/4 Pro, it doesn’t matter. This **lens** lives up to its Pro moniker thanks to its stellar build quality, excellent weather sealing, and sharp optics. So whether you’re focusing on a lone tree in the distance or the peak of a mountain, this **lens** will capture all of the glory. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony FE 20mm F1.8 G Lens: If you are looking for a great prime **lens** to shoot landscape photography, the Sony 20mm F1.8 G **lens** is an awesome option with a fast aperture, lightweight form factor, and great performance while remaining affordable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of them is the 20 mm with an aperture of f/1.4. The **lens** is perfect for landscape and architecture photographs. It costs about 800 euros. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Recently Sony has added features to the barrel on **lens**es designed for video. A **lens** may have a de-click button and an aperture ring. This lets the photographer change apertures and depth of field smoothly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, we still favor going in a different direction, and particularly when you factor in the size and weight of the Sony 18-200mm at 16.3 ounces. Mirrorless cameras are supposed to feel small, which is difficult to achieve with a **lens** of this size attached. Furthermore, you get good image quality throughout much of the range here, but the **lens** isn’t great at any particular focal length, which is why we generally favor going with more targeted zooms or primes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nikon Nikkor Z 28mm F/2.8 - Nikon Z This **lens** has yet again proved that it is possible to produce really high-quality results at a very affordable price. With superb performance and slick handling, it's a wide-angle **lens** Nikon Z fans will be happy to have in their kit bags. Interested? Help support ePHOTOzine by using these links. Amazon UK Amazon US - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s also a bit faster with a **lens** speed of f/1.2 and the image quality is exceptional. And so is the price. The **lens** currently sells for about 1,350 euros. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are looking for a crop-sensor, wide-angle prime, look to Sigma. This **lens** works for video, landscapes, and street photography. It is sharp, fast, and works in low light. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s also worth looking out for weather sealing, so that a little rain doesn’t put a premature end to your whole shoot. Also, pay attention to the filter compatibility. Many ultra-wide **lens**es can’t take front-mounted filters at all because of their bulbous front element, while others will require ones with a sizeable filter thread. Filters can be hugely important in landscape work, so it’s worth thinking about the filter setup when you buy a **lens**. Check out our guide to the best filters for landscape photography to get an idea of the kinds you might use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s got a pretty decent heft to it – it clocks in at nearly 1.2kg, which is heavy for a landscape **lens** – but it’s weather-sealed and, frankly, the weight offers a bit of reassurance that you’ll be able to head out on some adventures with it. Inside there are 16 elements in 11 groups, plus a nine-bladed aperture, which isn’t going to produce particularly spectacular bokeh, but at 14mm depth of field is never going to be terribly pronounced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s exceptionally sharp – the middle of the frame in particular stands up to being shot at f/2.8 all day long, though the edge of the frame drops off a little in both exposure and sharpness, but by f/8 all is forgiven – one of the very sharpest wide-angle **lens**es you can buy at any price. It’s also incredible when it comes to purple fringing (chromatic aberration) – you’ll hardly see it at any aperture – making this an excellent **lens** for producing images that don’t demand hours of post-production to bring out their potential. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like many ultra-wide **lens**es, it has a bulbous front element. This means you cannot screw a filter onto the front. But you can place gels behind the **lens**. With the 4x XD linear motors, autofocus is fast and precise. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** strikes the perfect balance between great price, awesome quality, and a compact form factor that no other **lens** can match. It also costs around 600 USD which is more than half the price of the Sony 35mm F1.4 GM **lens** I recommended above. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sharpness at the centre of the image is superb throughout this **lens**’ aperture range, though if you’re concerned about the corners – which drop off a little when shooting at f/2.8 – you’ll want to stop down a bit. If you do that, you’ll be rewarded by one of the very best wide-angle landscape **lens**es of all time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Olympus 12-100mm f/4 PRO is a superb **lens** for landscape photography. The manual focus clutch will let you quickly override the autofocus so you can nail the shot. The weather sealing will fight off the weather when you’re in the field, and the colors it renders are gorgeous. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Samyang AF 85mm F1.4 is a **lens** designed for full frame cameras, but can be used on an APS-C camera providing a 127.5mm equivalent focal length. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Photographing the best landscapes calls for the best landscape **lens**. Can you take a good landscape photograph with the **lens** that came with your camera? For sure! Can you take a sensational one? Maybe. But you can increase your chance of success by using the right tool for the job. Focal length, aperture size, build quality and, of course, your budget all have their part to play. Not to mention your final intended publishing place – an Instagram post will have very different requirements to an enormous fine-art print. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s a tough little customer – while it only weighs just over 500g, it’s still weather- and dust-sealed. And there’s some quality glass on display here: 14 elements in 11 groups, featuring Olympus’ ZERO **lens** coating. That’s an acronym standing for Zuiko Extra-low Reflection Optical, in case you were wondering. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 70-200 mm f/2.8 GM OSS II is Sony’s flagship telephoto **lens**. It ticks the boxes for wildlife, sports, concert, and portrait photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In many respects, the **lens** is like the popular Sony Vario-Tessar T* FE 16-35 mm f/4 ZA OSS (Zeiss) **lens**. But added to the barrel are a host of video controls. The **lens** has a physical aperture ring with a de-click switch and a PowerZoom with a rocker switch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll recall from our buying guide that owners of Micro Four Thirds cameras – which includes everything that Olympus offers, plus a number of Panasonic cameras, among others – need to multiply the focal length of every **lens** by two, because of the small sensor. For wildlife photographers this is a benefit – a 200mm **lens** becomes a 400mm **lens** – but there are drawbacks for landscape photographers, and you’ll need an extra wide optic to match relatively tight 35mm **lens**es. Still, with a widest focal length of 7mm (14mm in 35mm terms), the M.Zuiko ED 7-14mm f/2.8 Pro is an eminently practical **lens** for those shooting landscapes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to wide angle zoom **lens**es, the selection is fairly limited. Sony has a total of three **lens**es on offer, which are very good but unfortunately also very pricey. Then there’s also one from Tamron and another from Sigma. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a couple of important considerations in choosing the Zeiss Touit 12mm. First, 18mm is fairly wide, so if you’re not a wide-angle specialist, it may make more sense to go with a zoom **lens** that is more versatile (for more info on this, check out our article on Lenses and Focal Lengths for Landscapes). Second, the Zeiss manages to be heavier than the Sony 10-18mm f/4—often it’s the other way around with primes. But if you’re a dedicated landscape, architecture, or astro photographer, this **lens** won’t disappoint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **lens** offers a larger zoom range with a focal length of 70-300 mm. The downside is the underwhelming aperture between f/4.5 and 5.6. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Canon EF 85mm f/1.2L USM II **lens** has a fast maximum aperture of f/1.2, allowing great control over depth of field. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are looking for a mid-range budget zoom **lens**, the Sony E 55-210 mm f/4.5-6.3 is the **lens** for you. It is small in dimension and weight, perfect for APS-C bodies. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The second Sigma Art **lens** is a top-notch portrait **lens**. With a focal length of 105 mm and an aperture of f/1.4 it allows for wonderful bokeh and leaves nothing to be desired. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sale Canon RF 85mm F1.2 L USM Lens, Black High image quality and bright f/1.2 aperture L **lens** for EOS R System cameras. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes. Sony **lens**es labeled with a “G” are higher quality **lens**es. G Master (GM) **lens**es are top-of-the-line flagship **lens**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** comes in only 173 grams and 43mm in length which makes it a perfect street **lens** to travel and carry around on your trip abroad. The aperture of F2.5 is fast enough for most situations and the focal length of 40mm is not too far from the recommended 35mm focal length for street photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of particular interest to landscape photographers is the fact that its 24mm focal length is practical, if not ultrawide, while the ability to zoom in 4.4x gives you the ability to shoot details as well. It also benefits from built-in image stabilisation which, in conjunction with the In-Body Image Stabilisation (IBIS) found in some of Canon’s high-end RF-mount cameras, will allow you to shoot sharp shots at much longer shutter speeds – Canon claims the **lens**’ image stabilisation will hold you steady for five stops longer than an unstabilised **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Samyang AF 14mm f/2.8 RF - Canon RF 14mm **lens**es for full frame cameras are not the easiest to handle from a compositional point of view, but once mastered they can certainly help to make very dramatic, powerful images. This offering from Samyang is well-made, offers excellent sharpness and is available at a price that can't be ignored. Interested? Help support ePHOTOzine by using these links.

-   There are a number of viable travel zooms for Sony APS-C mirrorless cameras, but we think the 18-105mm f/4 offers the best combination of price and performance. For around $600, this **lens** is sharp, focuses reasonably well, and has the same f/4 maximum aperture and OSS image stabilization as the pricier 16-70mm f/4 below. We also like the additional reach at 158mm vs. 105mm, although you do sacrifice a handy 3mm at the wide end. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vintage **lens**es are usually not optically perfect, but they have characteristics that give them certain charm. The aforementioned Helios 44-2 for example is famous for it’s swirly bokeh. It is not sharp, but it is quite unique and fun. But for peak performance or sharpness, better to go for one of the **lens**es listed above! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 90 mm f/2.8 is one of the best macro **lens**es on the market. At this focal length, it is also useful for close-up portraiture. The wide aperture with nine rounded diaphragm blades gives you a sharp look with terrific bokeh. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You need to factor in your camera’s sensor size too, as the smaller your camera’s sensor, the more your **lens**’ focal length will be multiplied. For example, cameras with a Micro Four Thirds sensor multiply every **lens** that’s attached to them by two, which means a 14mm **lens** will actually have a field of view equivalent to a focal length of 28mm. However, this doesn’t apply to full-frame cameras, as they don’t multiply the focal length of any **lens**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For landscape photographers looking for the versatility of a wide-angle zoom, the Sony 10-18mm f/4 is the leading option. This **lens** is sharp, has minimal distortion, focuses quickly, and weighs a reasonable 8 ounces—that’s considerably lighter than comparable wide-angle options for digital SLRs. Pair this **lens** with a camera like the a6600, and you have one heckuva set-up for outdoor photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sigma has completely changed the **lens** game over the past decade by rolling out their stellar Art **lens**es. The 30mm f/1.4 strikes a nice balance in their lineup with a low price point and versatile focal length. While you won’t get the range of a zoom **lens**, you’ll get a more compact design. The low light capacity is unrivaled. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another wide-angle **lens** from Sony. This one has very high-quality build, the product of excellent optical and technical workmanship. And the image quality is impeccable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** is large for a prime. But it seems well-balanced. The autofocus is superior, and it has amazing low-light performance. The **lens** is expensive, but it is one of Sony’s best! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once again, there is a lot to like about the 16mm f/1.4 from third-party manufacturer Sigma. This wide-angle prime is extremely impressive in terms of sharpness and low-light performance, beating out the Sony 16mm f/2.8 by a wide margin. With a focal length equivalent of 24mm, it’s a nice option for landscapes, and you simply won’t beat the low-light capabilities with any comparable prime or zoom **lens** for Sony E Mount. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony FE 24mm F1.4 GM Lens: For those of you who prefer traveling with prime **lens**es, the **lens** you must have in your backpack at all times is the Sony FE 24mm F1.4 GM **lens**, an incredibly fast wide-angle **lens** that offers excellent image quality while keeping the form factor small and compact. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 25mm is a must-have prime **lens** for all mirrorless micro four-thirds shooters, landscape photographers or otherwise. The focal length is plenty wide for landscape photography and works beautifully for portraits, street photography, and more. It’s compact and high quality with fast performance, even in low-light settings, and makes it easy to create stunning bokeh backgrounds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** has three Focus Hold buttons and an AF/MF switch. There is also a focus limiter, and you can control image stabilization. The **lens** also comes with a removable and rotating tripod collar. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony’s mirrorless **lens**es corrected for use on full-frame bodies like the A7 and A9 series, are labeled FE and have no reduction in their field-of-view when shooting in full-frame modes; these also work on cropped bodies or in cropped modes, albeit again with a 1.5x field-reduction. Sony’s A-mount **lens**es have SAL in their product codes, but models additionally labeled with DT are designed for bodies with cropped / APSC sensors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This M.ZUIKO Digital **lens** has an aperture ring that allows you to change its aperture from f/1.8 to f/22 with just a flick of your finger. It also has three ED elements that reduce chromatic aberration and increase sharpness and contrast for clear images. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** is hefty and built like a tank. But for the build, it is surprisingly light. The **lens** has a customizable Focus Hold button and an AF/MF switch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony offers **lens**es at a range of focal lengths. Some are prime **lens**es, fixed at one focal length. Others zoom, letting you choose from a range of different focal lengths. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many of the high-end **lens**es have a Focus Hold button. This button is not labeled. You can customize the button’s function in the camera’s menu system for what you want it to do. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The AF-S Nikkor 85mm f/1.4G is the second **lens** in Nikon’s range of professional f/1.4 **lens**es, complementing the excellent (and expensive) AF-S Nikkor 58mm f/1.4G in Nikon’s line up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When we think of landscape photography, it is quite likely that the wide, dramatic vista produced with wide-angle **lens**es is the one that springs to mind. The great landscape photographers delivered these images and we can too, with just a little care and thought as to how they are composed. The wide vista, with distant mountains rising into a broiling sky, will look very distant and small if we just shoot a straight wide-angle shot. The composition will need foreground interest and a great viewpoint, or we need to move much, much closer, something repeated again and again when thinking of wide-angle **lens**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But if you really want to get up close, there’s nothing like a long telephoto zoom **lens** in your arsenal. This is where the new Nikon Z 85mm f/1.8 S comes in It offers an equivalent focal length of 127 millimeters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It also comes with optical stabilization that will be extremely handy when shooting close-up shots of a very small moving subject like insects. You can also use this for other kinds of subjects like flowers and food which makes it one of the most versatile prime **lens**es to get for your Sony cameras. For the latest price of this **lens**, be sure to check it out with the link below: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Samyang 24mm f/2.8 is a full-frame auto-focus **lens** for Sony E mount cameras. If you’ve steered clear of Samyang **lens**es in the past because you didn’t want all-manual **lens**es, the time has to come to check out their newest offerings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s a close call between the Sony 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 and Sony 18-105mm f/4 above. At the end of the day, we appreciate the fixed maximum aperture of the latter and better performance at the long end, not to mention the additional focal length coverage of the 18-135mm isn’t all that helpful—-neither **lens** is a true telephoto. At the end of the day, both are viable do-everything **lens**es that rarely need to come off your Sony camera, and that convenience can be worth it for travel and everyday use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   35mm is an excellent focal lenght for a mixture of different types of photography, it is the wider cousin of a generalist **lens** like a 50mm. At f2.8, you get less bokeh, but you also get a wider **lens** that is somewhat better suited for stuff like landscapes, while still being perfectly usable for portraits and general photography. It’s also the favorite focal length of many street photographers out there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony FE 40mm F2.5 G Lens: For a cheaper alternative to the Sony 35mm GM **lens** and the one that fits better with the smaller form factor, the Sony FE 40mm F2.5 G **lens** is definitely worth your consideration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While Sony’s mirrorless **lens** mount is generically-known as the E-mount, the single letter E on a model name specifically refers to **lens**es that are only corrected for cameras with cropped APSC sensors, like the A6000 series, or full-frame bodies running in cropped / Super-35 modes; in either case, the crop reduces the field-of-view by 1.5 times, so a 50mm becomes equivalent to 75mm. Note older NEX bodies also employ cropped APSC sensors, but may not have the firmware to correct distortion on some of the latest **lens**es; they’ll still work, but you may see more distortion that you would on an A6000 series body. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are rumors of an 800 mm f/5.6 **lens**. Currently, the widest focal length available is in the full frame FE 12-24 mm f/2.8 GM. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Quality-wise, it’s a great **lens**. We definitely recommend it over the Sony 12-24 and if you can live without 35 mm, also over the Zeiss 16-35 or the Sony G Master. And last but not least, the **lens** is also comparatively affordable at around 1,450 euros. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Giving an equivalent 15-30mm view, at 230g and 77x73mm **lens** is seriously tiny, making it suitable for the most arduous hikes. But just because it’s small, it doesn’t skimp on the image quality. This **lens** uses three aspherical **lens** elements within its construction to give rich, natural colour and excellent sharpness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This wide-angle zoom is designed for Canon cameras with an APS-C sensor, like the Canon EOS 90D or 250D. It gives a view similar to a 16-35mm **lens** on a full-frame body, so there’s plenty of options for big scenes. And being made to be compact and lightweight at only 83.5×89.8mm and 385g, it’s a great choice for landscape photographers who’re doing extensive hiking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   We’ll discuss focal length in more detail below, but as a general rule you want to go wide, but not too wide, when shooting landscapes. Ultra-wide-angle **lens**es will introduce distortions to your scene that will be distracting. They also often have built-in **lens** hoods to protect their bulbous front element, which makes it difficult (and costly) to mount filters should you, for instance, want to shoot a long exposure in daytime. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of these **lens**es have aspherical components for better focus. And most have more than nine rounded aperture blades for more circular bokeh. Whether you are a Sony purist or in the market for a third-party **lens**, you will find the **lens** for you! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **lens** produces beautiful bokeh as you can come to expect from a **lens** with such a wide aperture. It is also considerably sharper in most use cases compared to other 85mm **lens**es, even sharper than the Sony 85mm F1.4 GM **lens**, and best of all, it is almost 700 USD cheaper! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pro Tip: We always talk about the importance of cleaning your **lens**es for good reasons. Lenses are a huge investment, so it’s always a good idea to protect and clean them as often as possible. Cleaning your **lens**es is easy, and it doesn’t take a lot of time; you don’t even need an expensive **lens** cleaning kit to keep them in prime condition. Clean your **lens**es as soon as you notice anything on the front element, and give them a more thorough cleaning at least bi-weekly. Doing this will ensure that your **lens**es will keep on working for years to come. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What’s more, it’s both lighter and more compact than pairing the Nikon AF-S 14-24mm f2.8 G with an adapter, making it a good excuse for Z-mount users to go all in and opt for the native **lens**. While there is some distortion evident if you leave it uncorrected, there’s no reason you ever would leave it uncorrected, with Nikon’s automatic correction profiles ready and able to swoop in and take care of matters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To further demonstrate just how popular the all-in-one **lens** trend is, last year Sony released the 18-135mm to complement the existing 18-105mm f/4 and 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6. In terms of performance, we are impressed for the most part: the **lens** is decently sharp, lightweight for a zoom with this broad of focal length coverage, and comes with OSS image stabilization. At the end of the day, it’s lighter than both the Sony 18-200mm or 18-105mm and feels a bit more modern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best of all, the **lens** is extremely compact and lightweight, weighing only 445 g (15.7 oz) which makes it a great travel **lens** to carry around while you are out and about. Not to mention its extreme corner-to-corner sharpness that allows you to capture places in great detail with no compromises. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many cameras, like Sony’s Alpha a6600, now come with impressive video capabilities. These little bodies can pack a punch with the ability to shoot in 4K at 30fps and 1080p at 120fps with internal stabilization. Although we didn’t focus too much on video above since it’s not a priority for most shooters, many of the **lens**es on our list are great choices for those looking for a solid video set-up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you need a bit more reach, Sony’s 100-400 mm f/4 GM comes in a close second to the 70-200 mm f/2.8 **lens**. But it is heavier and larger. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At 77.6х87mm and 385g it’s highly portable, but that doesn’t mean any compromise in optical quality with four aѕрhеrісаl and four extra-low dispersion elements. While this is a fairly minor upgrade on the previous version of this **lens**, as we pointed out in our review, landscape photographers will appreciate the addition of weather-sealing, which justifies the extra cost outlay. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **lens** is the latest upgrade of the Sony Vario-Tessar T* FE 16 – 35 mm, f/4 ZA OSS (Zeiss) **lens**, a staple for many photographers. The newer version is faster and sharper and uses the upgraded autofocusing system. But the improvements also increase weight and size. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** performs well in low light and creates a beautiful shallow depth of field. The three aspherical elements minimize aberrations while the rear focusing design improves auto focus and achieves a minimum focus distance of 7.9.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s optically superb, which is no small achievement given its fairly extreme specifications: 14mm is about as wide as you’ll get on a full-frame sensor, and f/1.8 is a particularly large aperture, yet the **lens** produces a gorgeous, rectilinear image with very little distortion. So for landscapes that don’t bend in the middle – including architectural photography – it’s a natural. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tamron’s 70-180mm f/2.8 Di III VXD is a stellar optic for landscape photography. Because it’s a third-party **lens**, you can get a significantly faster maximum aperture for roughly the same price as a first-party f/4 zoom without compromising in many areas, including optics and build quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A brand new G Master version of the 16-35 mm has just been released. With an aperture of f/2.8 and the image quality the G Master **lens**es are famous for, this **lens** is the absolute cream of the crop when it comes to wide-angle **lens**es for the Sony Alpha 7 series. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The **lens** has very good sharpness in the center of the frame at f/1.8 and f/2. However, performance degrades significantly towards the edges of the frame until you stop down to f/5.6 or f/8 where performance is excellent.. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 20mm focal length is great for all kinds of landscape photography as it is wide enough to capture the expansiveness of most landscapes you might encounter. You can also use this **lens** for astrophotography as well if you ever need a fast ultra-wide prime **lens** to do so. The Sony 20mm F1.8 G **lens** is definitely a bargain and you can check the recent price by hitting the link below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Landscape photographers who use Nikon Z mount cameras have it good when it comes to **lens**es. Nikon has knocked their Z mount optics out of the park, and they made no exception to that rule with the NIKKOR Z 70-200mm f/2.8 S. This **lens** is simply stunning in every area. The **lens** features solid construction and incredible optics to help you create incredible landscape images no matter what conditions you find yourself in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That said, the Rokinon 12mm faces a major drawback: no autofocus. While some people may not have an issue with focusing manually—and some of us even prefer it— it’s not a great system for beginners. In addition, we found the manual focus to be a bit clunky on this **lens** in particular, but we like the sharpness and build quality. For comparison, the Zeiss 12mm Touit has similar optics and is more than double the cost. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The f/4 maximum aperture might not scream low-light landscapes, but it’s only a stop slower than the EF 16-35mm f/2.8L III USM so can easily be made up in ISO, it’s constant, and will save you about £1000. If you’re caught without a tripod, the **lens**’s Optical Image Stabilizer is rated at four-stops, so that could get you out of a (dark) hole, too. Weighing a reasonable 615g, it’s by no means huge either, at 83x113mm and boasts some decent weather sealing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Autofocus technology has changed and improved in the newest **lens**es. The Direct Drive Super Sonic (wave) Motor (DDSSM) is currently the best autofocus system in Sony **lens**es. It is precise, quick, and quiet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you haven’t bought a Sony Alpha 7 III yet, we recommend purchasing the camera in a kit. That way, you’ll spend a bit less on the **lens** than if bought separately. Sold individually, it’s currently available for about 300 to 400 euros. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Given the cost and technical challenges of adapters, we tend to think of them more for full-frame cameras than APS-C cameras. First, the cost of the adapter is significant relative to the cost of the **lens**es (the Metabones adapter currently is $399, for example). And the weight and bulk of many DSLR **lens**es will be noticeable on Sony’s relatively compact mirrorless camera lineup. Grab an adapter if you absolutely need it, but we prefer going with Sony’s native **lens**es or third-party models with E mounts. And the good news is that in 2019, there are ample options to choose from that don’t require an adapter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   We were lucky enough to snatch up a bargain at a clearance sale, but even at full price, it’s a very affordable **lens**.

If you can live with that, this **lens** is definitely a good investment at less than 200 euros. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   One major shortcoming of the Sony 18-105mm f/4 G is weight: 15.1 ounces makes it one of the heaviest models on the list behind only the 18-200mm and 16-55mm. It also can struggle with edge sharpness across some apertures, although that is fairly normal for a **lens** of this type. In terms of other options in this category, we also like the Sony 16-70mm f/4, which is pricier but adds Zeiss glass to the mix. And the Sony 18-135mm has more reach and is lighter, albeit with inferior low-light performance at the telephoto end. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For such a compact size and an affordable price point, it is hard to beat the Sony FE 85mm F1.8 **lens** when it comes to price-to-quality ratio. If you want to save some money, I highly recommend you go for the Sony 85mm F1.8 **lens** and use the money you saved to invest in other **lens**es instead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Within each series, Sony indicates its superior models by the letter G and names its flagship mirrorless **lens**es G Master or GM for short. Models involving a partnership with Zeiss are labeled ZA, and are generally pitched between Sony’s own G and GM **lens**es in quality. Meanwhile, **lens**es labeled PZ have a Power Zoom for smooth motorized zooming while filming, while those with OSS refer to Optical SteadyShot stabilisation.

-   There are several advantages to using a prime **lens**. A fixed focal length will allow you to get closer to your subject without having to move around as much. This helps you avoid the distortion of zooming in or out while taking pictures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For those who can afford it, the Sony 16-70mm f/4 is one of our favorite zoom **lens**es for Sony APS-C mirrorless cameras. It gives you superb sharpness and image quality from an equivalent of 24-105mm, which covers everything from landscapes to portraits (it’s a terrific option for travel too). The long name is a result of Sony’s partnership with Zeiss, which is most obvious in the T* coating that results in excellent clarity and color. Compared to any of the kit zooms, this **lens** will blow them out of the water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sure, primes will get you better optical quality. But lugging a bag of five or six **lens**es is no small matter if you’re tramping through the lakes, and changing **lens**es in wet weather is not recommended. A good zoom **lens**, as long as it’s high-quality, can be a much more pragmatic choice. You just have to make sure that you do indeed get a good one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We’d say that the Sony 135 mm is the better alternative to the Zeiss 135 mm. The main difference is the higher **lens** speed of f/1.8, which makes it much easier to create a bokeh effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **lens** is the ultimate macro **lens** for Sony cameras with its incredibly close focusing distance of 0.28 m (0.92 ft) allowing you to get extremely close to your subject and the fast aperture of F2.8 that can blur out all the distractions from the background allowing you to isolate your subject. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We are looking in this article at the wide-angle **lens**es that have been reviewed by ePHOTOzine and might be considered for wide-angle landscape photography. The idea of what represents "wide angle" has changed over the years, mirroring the changes in style and format of cinematography and wider shots becoming more mainstream. In full frame terms, a 35mm **lens** was once considered a wide angle but is now more of a wide standard **lens**. The once ultra-wide 28mm is offered as a fixed **lens** on many compact cameras, becoming a new even wider standard **lens** than the 35mm. So the ultra-wide 24mm perhaps becomes the first true wide angle **lens** and focal lengths down to even 14mm and beyond become affordable as **lens** design and manufacture become ever more capable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** produces exceptionally sharp images, and the color is excellent. The **lens** has 22 elements in 16 groups, with one super ED and two ED elements. It has nine rounded aperture blades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **lens** has a variable f/5.6 to f/6.3 maximum aperture. It has 24 elements in 17 groups with five ED and one aspherical element. It uses the newest DDSSM autofocusing system and has 11 rounded aperture blades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The crop-sensor 50 mm f/1.8 OSS is one of the lightest **lens**es Sony makes. It is the perfect balance of focal distance and aperture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some photographers also like using a 35mm focal length for landscape photography. The best 35mm **lens**es are still wide, but again without the distortions that come with ultra-wide angles. What’s great about the 35mm focal length, though, is this is effectively what your eyes can see. So if authenticity is important to you, here you can capture a scene as you saw it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most obvious drawback of the Sony 16-70mm f/4 is cost. At nearly $900, it’s one of the most expensive **lens**es on this list of any type. In addition, there can be some softness when shooting at the extreme ends of the zoom range, but the **lens** is tack sharp between about 35 and 50mm. If price is a major concern, the Sony 18-105mm above offers more range for $300 less, but we think the 16-70mm is superior from an optical perspective. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We’re proud owners of a Sony Alpha 7II and we would never want to part without this great camera. In this guide we’ll show you which **lens**es are available for the Alpha 7 series. If you’re looking for the perfect full-frame **lens** for E-mount cameras, you've come to the right place! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony’s longest focal length is now the Sony FE 600 mm f/4 GM OSS. It is a sports and wildlife photographer’s dream. But it comes with a hefty price tag. It is currently Sony’s most expensive **lens**, followed by the Sony FE 400 mm f/2.8. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One thing to bear in mind is that ultrawide **lens**es give a fairly distinctive look to objects that aren’t miles away, on the horizon. And that might mean buildings with slightly bulging vertical lines, or distorted-looking people. The more specialist your **lens**’ focal length, the less you’ll be able to use it for general-purpose subjects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony FE 85mm F1.8 Lens: Even though the Sigma 85mm F1.4 DG DN **lens** is the best portrait **lens** to get, it is not as light and affordable as this **lens** and if you are looking for a travel portrait **lens** that is the most compact and lightweight but capable of producing stunning bokeh, the Sony FE 85mm F1.8 is a much better option for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What are the downsides of the Sony 35mm f/1.8? The most notable is cost: at around $425, it’s decently expensive for a prime **lens** of the APS-C variety (as we mentioned above, you can go cheaper with third-party options from brands like Sigma). Second, the zoom **lens**es below are more versatile, although you do sacrifice sharpness and low-light performance. Last, if you really want the best in image quality at this focal length, the Zeiss Touit 32mm f/1.8 is tough to beat, but that comes with a big jump in price to over $700. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 85mm f/1.8 is a **lens** for those who want a longer focal length and faster aperture than the Sony FE 85mm f/1.4. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony FE 35mm f1.4 GM Lens: In street photography, you will be running around shooting at moving subjects that often move spontaneously and you will need a **lens** that is at the most natural-looking focal length, unobtrusive, and extremely fast which is why I recommend the Sony FE 35mm F1.4 **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What’s considered to be an ultra-wide **lens**? Anything 24mm or wider on Full-Frame cameras can be considered ultra-wide. All of the E-mount ultra-wide **lens**es listed below seriously impressed us when we put them through our real-world tests. The **lens**es are well made, feature stunning optics, and all produce life-like colors, which can be a blessing to photographers who mainly shoot landscapes. We have rounded up E-mount ultra-wide **lens**es that vary in price, so you’ll be sure to find one below that will meet your shooting and financial needs. Grab a chair and take a look at these ten stunning E-mount ultra-wide **lens**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Quick final note: We receive several emails every day with questions about which **lens** is best for a specific purpose. We hope you understand that we just can’t answer them all. As a small company, we simply don’t have the time. If you have any questions, please leave us a comment below the post and we’ll try to get back to you as soon as possible. Deal? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s quite bulky for a 50 mm **lens**, but the photo quality is excellent all around. The price isn’t exactly low at just under 1,400 euros. But then again, it’s certainly justified for a high-quality **lens** with Zeiss technology. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In terms of focal length range, this **lens** is a direct competitor to the Sony 12-24 mm f/4. However, the Sigma is significantly faster with an aperture of f/2.8 and still only slightly heavier at around 795 grams. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But there are plenty of **lens**es that are beautifully sharp at typical landscape apertures that cost way less, and you can expect quality budget options to start at around £500. While it’s possible to go a bit cheaper, you’ll find you have to start compromising. For example, apertures might not open as wide, which won’t matter too much for landscape photography, but will limit a **lens**’ appeal for more general-purpose work. You’ll probably also lose weather-sealing, and images might be a bit less sharp – not really an issue if you’re looking to be the next big thing on Instagram, but more problematic if you want to perform big crops on your images or get them printed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many photographers buy mirrorless cameras to reduce the size and weight of their equipment. But they are then surprised by the heaviness of the **lens**es. Size and weight may be an issue if you are traveling or hiking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Tamron 70 to 180 mm is a real insider tip. The **lens** has a speed of f/2.8 in combination with a focal length of 70 to 180 mm. It’s very compact for this type of **lens** and only weighs 815 grams. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not only has Sony improved the optics in this **lens**, but they have also managed to make it lighter than the previous **lens**. The 29% reduction in weight makes it much easier to carry around. In addition, the weather sealing has been improved, and so have the autofocus motors, which are now four times faster than the motors in the previous **lens**. The image stabilization is top-notch, and the coatings used on the elements help boost contrast and help render some of the best colors seen from a Sony **lens** yet. You can find our full review here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We have nothing bad to say about third-party **lens**es in general. We actually use Tamron **lens**es ourselves and are very happy with them. So you might also want to consider going third party to take advantage of a wider range of options or better value for money. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pro Tip: A lot of the E-mount ultra-wide **lens**es in this roundup feature weather sealing, but there are a couple that do not have this feature. This, however, does not mean you can’t go out into inclement weather to get some great shots. Carry a few of these weatherproof camera and **lens** covers with you in your camera bag, and if the weather takes a turn for the worse, simply cover your gear and shoot away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Featuring a large maximum aperture of f/1.4,the Pentax HD PENTAX-D FA* 85mm f/1.4ED SDM AW is one of the brightest, fastest **lens**es in its class. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 85mm F1.2L is a unique **lens** because it’s the only one in this series designated as a “L” **lens**. All the other RF **lens**es are considered “new standard zoom” or “wide angle zoom” **lens**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It has 20 elements in 15 groups with XA and Super ED elements. It uses the DDSSM autofocusing system. The **lens** has 11 rounded blades for a smooth, creamy bokeh effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many of Sony’s best **lens**es have a constant aperture. You can use the widest aperture at all focal lengths. If the **lens** has a range of apertures, the widest aperture becomes smaller as you zoom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony E 11mm F/1.8 - Sony E This is a gorgeous little **lens**, light, compact, easy to handle and giving sharp, lively results for both stills and videography alike. Without a doubt, a very versatile and high-quality **lens** that can be 'Highly Recommended'. Interested? Help support ePHOTOzine by using these links. Amazon UK Amazon US - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The focal length is classic landscape – 12mm is ultra-wide by 35mm standards – and the ability to zoom in to 24mm gives photographers the ability to re-compose without uprooting their tripods. It’s a fast **lens** too – f/2.8 – and this, plus the wide focal length, means this could be an excellent general purpose **lens** for wide-field astrophotography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony Vario-Tessar 16-70mm above may be more versatile, but if you want top-notch image quality at a 35mm equivalent focal length, the 24mm f/1.8 Zeiss Sonnar is one of the best E-mount **lens**es on the market. It’s tack sharp, great in low light, focuses quickly, and produces impressive bokeh. Plus, you’re getting the premier focal length for street and travel photography, which is where much of the following for this **lens** comes from. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are an experienced photographer or have used a full-frame camera before, crop factor can be very helpful in choosing **lens**es. For example, the Sony 10-18mm f/4 wide-angle **lens** is equivalent to 15-27mm, which actually is much more useful than the listed range (10-18mm would be ultrawide on a 35mm camera). Because of the importance of focal length equivalent in choosing **lens**es, we’ve provided it both in the product specs and our **lens** comparison table. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this photography/travel blog, I’ve been writing more and more recently about camera equipment in general, from choosing the best DSLR to choosing a mirrorless camera or a wide-angle **lens**. However, there was still one topic that I hadn’t covered much on the blog, at least from a material point of view. This topic is **lens**es for landscape photography. Indeed, landscape photography is one of the domains that I practice the most and the one where I am the most comfortable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is the best telephoto **lens** Sony makes. But quality comes at a price. It is one of the more expensive on the list. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is versatile and sharp with beautiful colors. The autofocus is super fast and quiet. And the **lens** is small and lightweight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The ATX AF 85mm f/1.8 is a fast telephoto prime **lens** designed for portraits and low light shooting. It has a minimum focusing distance of 0.8 meters/2.6 feet and a maximum magnification ratio of 1:10. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony E 70-300 mm f/4.5-6.3 G OSS is the most expensive APS-C **lens** on this list. This G **lens** has many features of the mid-level, full frame **lens**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are looking for a prime **lens** that can do it all, the Sony FE 50mm F1.2 GM **lens** is the best **lens** to get. They don't call it the nifty-fifty for nothing! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** barrel has three Focus Hold buttons and an AF/MF switch. There is also a focus limiter. Plus, you can control image stabilization. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is not Sony’s sharpest **lens**. But it is versatile with good image quality. If you buy this **lens**, you are getting a good **lens** at an affordable price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are still a few holes. But there are many top-of-the-range **lens**es you can choose from. If you are on a budget, the smaller and less expensive APS-C **lens**es work on both the crop-sensor and full frame bodies. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The high aperture of f/1.4 makes this **lens** great for taking portraits in low light conditions without having to use a flash. The bokeh (the out-of-focus area) is also very smooth and creamy which makes it perfect for creating unique looking images. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM Medium Telephoto Lens for Canon SLR Cameras - Fixed 85 millimetre standard **lens** with f 1.8 maximum aperture for Canon SLR cameras, Lens Type:Telephoto... - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It has a very compact build, is sealed against dust and splash water, and even comes with a filter thread. What’s more, it has a practical zoom range of 17-28 mm and a very good **lens** speed of f/2.8. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Kit deals are also available for professional cameras. Who would have thought? Since it was barely more expensive than just buying the body, we also bought our cameras in a kit with the 28-70 mm, f/3.5-5.6 zoom **lens** included. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sigma 24mm F/1.4 DG DN Art - Sony FE The 24mm **lens** is a terrific **lens** in use and is capable of really dramatic results if used well. The Sigma is well made, delivers high quality and handles beautifully, so is high on the list of possibilities if we are looking for a high-quality full-frame 24mm **lens**, and is Highly Recommended.

-   Fujifilm Fujinon XF 16-80mm f/4 OIS WR - Fuji X With the partial caveat regarding edge sharpness under some circumstances, overall the Fujifilm Fujinon XF 16-80mm f/4 R OIS WR **lens** put in a pretty sparkling performance. Above all, it has proved to be an incredibly useful range of focal lengths and I could easily imagine this **lens** staying firmly on the camera almost all the time. Interested? Help support ePHOTOzine by using these links. Amazon UK Amazon US - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sigma 24-70 mm f/2.8 DG DN Art **lens** has 19 elements in 15 groups with six FLD and two SLD elements. The aperture has 11 rounded blades, just like the Sony. The **lens** barrel has a Focus Hold button and an AF/MF switch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The upgrades also more than double the price of the **lens**. Many photographers prefer the older version. The older Zeiss **lens** may be the answer if you are on a budget. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We understand the draw to all-in-one **lens**es. Instead of buying and carrying multiple zooms or primes, one **lens** covers everything from wide angle to telephoto. They aren’t, however, the best from an image quality perspective and lag behind purpose-built **lens**es at their respective focal lengths. The Sony 18-200mm does capture sharp images, comes with OSS for when natural light is low, and is faster than the 55-210mm above. Most importantly, you can throw it on your camera and never need to change glass. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony cameras and **lens**es have some of the best auto-stabilization technology on the market. OSS indicates the **lens** has “Optical SteadyShot.” This is Sony’s image stabilization system. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It has taken quite some time for dedicated APS-C **lens**es for Sony E Mount cameras to emerge. Fortunately, the wait has been worth it for those who shoot with the capable crop sensor cameras. No matter what genres of photography you shoot, you can get **lens**es that will suit your style. The APS-C **lens**es we’ve featured here are affordable, reliable, well built, and all produce stunningly sharp images. If you want to expand your library of E Mount APS-C **lens**es, check out four of our favorites after the break. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can get this **lens** with an aperture of f/1.4 for less than 500 euros. The quality may not be on par wih the Sony **lens**, but it only costs a third of the price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 7‑14mm F2.8 PRO: Best **lens** for Micro Four Thirds cameras - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course with a **lens** that compact, there are some trade-offs in performance. For example, the **lens** only has an initial aperture of f/4-5.6. It isn’t protected against dust and splash water, and there are certainly better **lens**es in terms of image quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
