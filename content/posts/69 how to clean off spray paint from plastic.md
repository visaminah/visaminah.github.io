If you find that the denatured alcohol is safe for use on the plastic, use a liberal amount of the solvent on the **paint** surface and allow it to stand for a few minutes. This allows the denatured alcohol to loosen and dissolve the **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are looking for a product specialized product for removing **paint**, then you do not need to look any further than this fantastic product. The water-based formula allows you to safely and easily remove all kinds of **paint** from a range of surfaces, including metal, plastic, concrete, fiberglass, and more. This product is eco-friendly and safe for the user. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Acetone should be the main ingredient of the nail polish remover; otherwise, it won't work. Acetone liquifies **paint** making it easier to remove. Rub polish-soaked cotton on the **paint**; as you do this, some colors have already transferred to the cotton. Finish it off with warm water and a clean rag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the safest ways to remove **spray** **paint** from your glasses is to add a small amount of warm water with soap in it to a cotton bud or cloth. Although this method can take longer than others, it tends to be the best option if your lenses have protective coatings on them. After a few minutes of dabbing the warm water and soap on the glasses the **paint** should easily be removed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hold the wet microfiber cleaning cloth against the **spray** **paint** to loosen the bond. Once you notice the **paint** starting to soften, use the cleaning cloth to scrub it away. Keep repeating this process until all the **paint** is removed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How to remove **spray** **paint** from plastic. Cleaning **spray** **paint**, or any other type of **paint**, from plastic, can be a messy and time-consuming process, especially if you don’t have the right tools. Unfortunately, this is not a trial-and-error process because any errors will cause the plastic to deteriorate, destroying any progress you’ve made. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can use a **paint** scraper to remove **spray** **paint** from plastic, but it might not work all the times. For this, it is highly recommended to use a plastic putty knife or a razor blade. When using the scraper, you should not apply too much pressure as it might lead to the scratching of the plastic surface and may even blemish it. Use it only as a last resort or when you are stuck with thick and dried up **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dip a cloth or even a paper towel into a small amount of acetone (or rubbing alcohol which works slower). If the **paint** turns gooey, it is a latex-based **paint** and you can proceed by **paint**ing over the surface with any type of **paint**. If it’s oil, just hit it with medium sandpaper first to create bonding. If you don’t, it will flake off with just a fingernail…then you are removing all the **paint** and starting over, like John and Yoko. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Try wiping graffiti with any common **paint** thinner (i.e. mineral spirits, lacquer thinner, acetone), or try graffiti removal products such as Goof Off. Sometimes wiping the graffiti with light penetrating oil such as WD-40 or Three-in-One will remove it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Which type of stain remover to use will depend on the type of **spray** **paint**. Since most **spray** **paint** is acrylic, use dish soap and vigorous rubbing to get as much of the stain out as possible. Next, use a dry cloth on the stain by rubbing it thoroughly. This will help remove more of the stain, while also driving the soap deeper into the fabric so it's more effective. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When using a **paint** stripper for plastic, you have to be careful what you use. Harsher chemicals like **paint** thinners can melt the plastic. First, try using simple soap and water, then try some vegetable oil. If the **paint** is dry, you can also try scraping it off and if that does not work, try a little acetone or rubbing alcohol. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is essential to take precautions throughout the process since the **paint** stripper is a corrosive material. These precautions include reading the warnings stated on the product label. Keep reading this article as we further discuss this topic, and it may also answer some questions you have in mind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are other ways of getting nasty. Stripping **paint** from metal and wood could be a combination of methods including a drill attachment. Attach it to any drill: it conforms to curved surfaces on fiberboard, wood, metal, plastic, etc. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Plastic models and **paint**ing them is a popular hobby and at some point, a **paint** stripper for plastic will be necessary. Maybe a mistake was made, or you could simply want to apply a fresh coat of **paint**, either way, the old **paint** needs to be removed. Plastic models can either be **paint**ed with enamel or acrylic **paint**s and these can be removed by using a commercial **paint** remover you get at a model store. You could also try out other products like Easy Off, Simple Green, Purple Power cleaner, or SuperClean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’re also able to use household ingredients. These may be more convenient to use, as they’re commonly found in households. You can consider using some of the ingredients below, instead of a leather stain and **paint** remover. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We use **spray** **paint** for a wide range of purposes. It's easier and more fun to **paint** and create colorful graffiti, **paint** vehicles and much more. But a lot of times, we accidentally make mistakes and apply **paint** in places that we don’t intend to. While it may be easy to remove or scrape off **paint** from wood, metal or ceramic, plastic is a whole different story. So, do you know how to remove **spray** **paint** from plastic? We’ll find out in this article. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nail polish remover is another good alternative as it contains acetone which is very strong and very effective for **paint** removal. Simply soak a cotton ball with the nail polish remover, then rub the stain, which should easily remove the **paint**. Mineral spirits can be used in the same way you would use nail polish remover. It's not as harsh as the acetone in the nail polish remover, but whichever one you use, again be sure to wash the stained area clean with soap and water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thinners as a **paint** stripper for plastic may not be the best method. Thinners might not damage some harder plastics, but they will definitely harm softer plastics and dissolve Styrofoam. Trying something less harsh first would be a better idea. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brake Cleaner? Yes. If the lacquer thinner doesn’t work or works too slowly, try brake cleaner in a **spray** can. This one is “moderate VOC” which means it’s dangerous. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Denatured is a stronger type of alcohol compared to rubbing; thus, it often results in skin irritations. Take precautions when dealing with this solution and wear protective clothing. Rub the solvent onto the **paint** until it is off, then wipes it clean with a clean rag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best method for removing **paint**ed graffiti from glass is to use a razor blade to carefully scrape it off. This method is 99% effective. Use the razor blade in a holder and scrape at a 30-degree angle to the glass. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   There are other options available as well, and these methods use materials that might be lying around the house. One cheap and easy method is to use Dettol or some other antiseptic product. This will work best on acrylic **paint**s. Follow the process below for removing **paint** from plastic models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also use ammonia, which works more on acrylic and latex **paint**s. Mineral spirits will work better on oil-based **paint**s. Solvents should always be tested out first in an unobtrusive area. The different plastic will react differently, so take a Q-tip and place a drop on the plastic surface, and wait to see what happens. If you do not notice any difference, it should be okay to use the solvents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is always a chance of spilling a little **paint** when working around the house. Maybe you have done the best you can to cover areas, but you still somehow manage to find **paint** splatter on surfaces when you are finished. Removing **paint** from metal and most other surfaces is easy; you simply wipe it off with a solvent. Removing **paint** from plastic, on the other hand, can be a little more difficult as solvents can damage the surface. Thankfully, when it comes to how to remove **paint** from plastic, there are a few safer methods. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use a dry, absorbent cloth to gently dab on the **spray** **paint** stain. Repeat dabs with parts of the cloth that are still dry and untainted with the **spray**. During this process, it is essential to not wipe the stain as you want to minimize the surface area of your leather gear that is exposed to the **spray** **paint** stain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You might need something stronger than vegetable oil when it comes to how to remove enamel **paint** from plastic, which is where acetone comes in. You can use nail polish, however, if the plastic is colored, a regular acetone-based product will work better. Apply directly to the **paint**, wait five minutes, and then wipe off with a cloth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rubbing alcohol is less harsh than denatured; thus, it is preferred and widely used. Coat the area with the solvent, then rest for five minutes before washing it off with warm water. To avoid the alcohol from evaporating, cover it with plastic. If a large quantity of **paint** remains, repeat the process as needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best method would be to get rid of the **paint** straight away. However, you can also lightly sand the surface to get rid of the **paint**. Do not overdo this method as you can leave marks, sanding will also dull the surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spray **paint**: Use both solvents and elbow grease. (We list some **paint** removal tools below the list.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Known as the go-to remedy for getting off anything sticky, it is also a solution worth trying. Vegetable, mineral, coconut even essential oils will do the trick. Cover the **paint** with oil and let it sit for five to ten minutes. Use a putty knife or blade to scrape off the **paint**; alternatively, you may opt to scrub or brush it off as a safer option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main solvent for most **spray** **paint**s is either **paint** thinner, lacquer thinner, or acetone. These work for removal but can also smear the **paint**. These are all very flammable: keep out of reach of children and do not breathe the fumes: (please wear a respirator: read about the best respirator …it’s not expensive and it’s a life-saver).* Every home should have a respirator. The Zombie Apocolypse is coming too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Regardless of how careful you are when **spray** **paint**ing, over**spray** is going to happen. And controlling where the over**spray** ends up is extremely important so you don't end up with a big mess that needs to be cleaned later.

When finished, use a microfiber cloth to remove any leftover wax while brightening the finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most importantly, time is of the essence when it comes to cleaning any kind of **paint** stain.

This article will review some of these to hopefully help you clean up nicely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This heavy-duty alternative is of the same level as **paint** thinners and removers due to its chemical content; if the other method fails, this is the last resort.

Spray some WD-40 on the **paint**, then wipe it with a clean towel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A friend taught me a trick for removing **paint** or chrome from plastic car models. On chrome pieces that you want to remove the chrome from the plastic, put it in a Tupperware container, cover with Windex and seal it up for a day or two.

Next day it comes off clean like you used **paint** stripper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Paint thinner or remover is a strong option but uses it with caution because it has the potential to damage the plastic. It should be considered a last resort. The best option is to mix a little with water to see if you can remove the **paint** while preserving the plastic, gradually increasing the concentration of thinner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If soap and water didn’t help, your **spray** **paint** has already dried. The next step is to reach into the kitchen pantry and whip out some vegetable oil. While it works wonders in a stir-fry, this every household staple is even better at dissolving **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you can see, plastic is quite a broad term as there are many different types of plastics available today. The type of plastic can also play a role in removing **paint** from plastic as some are harder and more durable than others. So, what are the possible cases where removing **paint** from plastic is necessary? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another easy method to help you strip **paint** from plastic is by gently scraping it off using a **paint** scraper. This method works best on smooth plastic, but whatever the case, be careful to not be too aggressive or you could damage the surface.

-   Wiping Tip: You can get a lot more pressure as you rub/scrape **paint** to remove it if you cover a stiff scraper with a rag: you get more pressure than with your finger, yet don’t create scratches. As your rag gets soiled, move it to expose clean cloth, and repeat. See my video at the very bottom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sand-blasting is another removal option. As with pressure washing, be careful not to allow the sandblasting tip to remain in one spot too long as it can permanently etch the surface. Keep the tip moving over the **paint**ed area and the surrounding area so as to blend in the surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paint remover for plastic products may contain harmful ingredients that could affect the plastic surface. So, always read the label and make sure what you are buying is correct and follow the instructions for use. Even some of the household items can also cause damage to plastic surfaces.
