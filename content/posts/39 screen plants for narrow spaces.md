## 39 Fun Facts Screen Plants For Narrow Spaces | Block Out Thy Neighbour: Privacy Plants for the Modern Home
-   A very narrow growing native Australian shrub. This Syzigium is a lovely compact, dense grower which requires very little pruning to maintain a narrow habit, making it ideal for **screen**ing and hedging in tight spaces. Foliage is glossy and deep green in colour with new growth being tinged in tones of red-brown. Small, white flowers appear in the warmer months, followed by fleshy pink-red fruits. This variety could easily be used as an Australian native alterative to the Italian pencil pines. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cypress trees come in many varieties, over 130 species to be exact, which means there is sure to be something for your garden. The leaves range in colour from silver-green to dark green. They grow in whorled patterns or spirals and handle just about any soil type. Most people think of cypress trees and tall narrow trees but many varieties such as Thuja Plicata (as pictured above) are wider and make excellent **screen**s if spaced and trimmed a couple of times a year. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is very easy to grow, it just needs cutting down to the ground in February. Don’t cut it any earlier, as the **screen**ing effect will last over winter, and it looks very pretty when the fronds are dusted with white frost. Grows to a height of around 2m if it’s kept well-watered. Plant in a large pot in full sun or partial shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fast growing ‘Fine Line’ buckthorn is ideal in containers, to block views from windows, or to create privacy as foundation planting. Its feathery foliage is very elegant, with thin and long mid green leaves that grow on upright branches giving you very elegant and refined texture, and a dense **screen** from spring to late fall. It is also ideal for cold regions, including most of Canada, thanks to its great hardiness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Screening **plants** are an excellent choice for those who want natural, attractive, and low maintenance barriers. Screening **plants** grow swiftly, provide privacy, and elevate the look of a home. Not only do they block out line-of-sight, but they also serve as a windbreak. Many hedges can be used for **screen**ing, but there are also **screen**ing **plants** that are particularly fast-growing and dense. Here are 15 of the best hedges recommended by us – Harwood’s Garden Supplies - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Where space is not a problem a mixed **screen** of some depth can be planted. For example, silver birches (Betula Pendula) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) interplanted in two rows 4.5m (15ft) apart can be very effective especially when underplanted with cotoneasters, viburnums and poplars which can be removed as the **screen** develops. A more formal approach might include Catalpa bignonioides 'Aurea', Davidia involucrata, Fagus sylvatica 'Fastigiata', Quercus rubra, Prunus padus or Sorbus aria 'Lutescens'. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for a **screen** with needle leaves rather than broad leaves, the Cypress is a good choice. Cypress is better in hot, humid areas, but it can grow in some areas if well-cared for. It will have bright green leaves for much of the year, though the foliage will drop during the winter months reducing its utility as a privacy block. Cypress grows very quickly and does need to be trimmed regularly to keep it as a **screen**, but that also means it will become a **screen** quite fast.

-   A useful way of using large shrubs as tree substitutes is to clear the lower branches as they grow so that the space underneath is maximised and **plants** below receive adequate light.

-   People’s taste in the architectural aesthetic of houses has changed over the last 10 years, and so have the **plants** that accompany these homes.

Screening **plants** are not only just about privacy from neighbours though – they also serve as a windbreak, protection from the sun, or are simply a way to block an unsightly aspect . Below are my top tips for creating **screen**ing and privacy for your contemporary home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A hardy plant that is often seen in the wild, what the Bottle Brush somewhat lacks for in appearance, it makes up through sheer hardiness.

Bottle Brush can grow up to ten meters high; an impressive height that is suitable to virtually any home. Check out our guide How to Select, Grow and Care for Your Bottlebrush. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These are easy-care **plants**, which thrive in light shade. Cut back the flowered stems by a third in late summer, and then tidy up again in late winter. Try ‘American Beauty’ a hardy, semi-evergreen, for its gold and rose scented flowers and fast-growing habit (ultimate height is 5m). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Opt for taller varieties with feathery plumes and bleachy colours. Although they are perennials and die off during the winter, the fronds can be retained until February when they need to be cut back. This means that you get the **screen**ing effect almost year-round. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Dogwood, both a tree and a shrub, is known for its stunning bracts of white or pink flowers and the minimal care requirements, it is also equally popular for the bright stems in winter, as pictured above. When you use Dogwood in your garden as part of your **screen**ing, you can choose from many types, including single-trunked trees to small shrubs. The most common include the flowering dogwood, Pagoda dogwood and the Cornelian cherry dogwood.

This partial **screen**ing creates an inviting glimpse into the area beyond, tricking the eye into thinking that the garden is larger than it really is. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are dozens of popular **screen**ing **plants** out there, depending on what you want. Some of them flower, and some don’t.

However, the caveat is that they will also require more maintenance once fully grown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
