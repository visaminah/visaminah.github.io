## 7 Unexpected Facts About Difference Between 21 And 30 Degree Framing Nailer | What Degree Framing Nailer Is Most Common
-   Increasing the magazine angle to 28 degrees saves even more space, but it's challenging to design a drive mechanism that has enough power to drive full-size nails at such a steep angle. Consequently, the nails for a 28-degree **nailer** are usually smaller than those for 21-degree **nailer**. Moreover, except for one or two exceptions, they often have clipped heads, so that more of them can fit into the magazine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The heavy-duty pneumatic **nailer**s you find on construction sites usually have a 21-degree magazine angle. Framers need to drive full-size nails, and more important, they need the nails to have full heads. Many local codes prohibit clipped-head nails for **framing**. You might also find zero-degree **nailer**s on construction sites, but these are usually lighter-duty tools for installing subfloors, siding and roof decking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The magazine angle doesn't affect the angle at which the nail emerges from the head of the **nailer**. As long as you hold the head flush against the work surface, the **nailer** will drive it perpendicularly into the wood. The purpose of angling the magazine with respect to the head is almost exclusively to save space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Number of tools being used x the number of nails each tool will drive per minute x 1.2 (safety factor) x the Amount of Air per Shot (SCFM) at the operating pressure (psi). This number is found on the chart in the tool schematic and parts list provided with the **nailer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Power **nailer**s that shoot brads and staples are often designed with a zero-degree magazine angle. This simple design is practical because brads and staples are thin, and you can fit a lot of them into a small space. Three-and-a-half-inch **framing** nails, on the other hand, are relatively fat, and the magazine needs to be longer to accommodate a reasonable number of them. Enter the 21-degree magazine angle, which reduces the horizontal extension of the magazine by about 15 percent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you're installing interior trim, your gun doesn't need as much power, because it's driving finish nails or staples -- not **framing** nails. Consequently, interior trim **nailer**s often have steeper magazine angles, such as 28 and 34 degrees, to save space. You'll be thankful you have a that extra space when you have to use the **nailer** in tight corners. Battery-powered **nailer**s--the ultimate in nailing convenience--aren't as powerful as pneumatic **nailer**s, and they usually have a 28- or 34-degree magazine angle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One angle isn't necessarily any better than the other. The overall design and quality of the tool and its purpose are more important than the magazine angle. Because nails used in 21- and 28-degree **nailer**s are not interchangeable, it's best to stick with one angle if you're supplying tools and nails for a crew. The main advantage of the 28-degree tool is that its compact design makes it easier to handle, especially in tight places. If you're a home handyman looking for an all-purpose tool that you can use for a variety of tasks, it's probably better to choose a 28-degree **nailer** than a 21-degree one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
