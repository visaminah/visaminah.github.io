They will never be the same and you will more than likely have to go out and buy a new set. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a tricky one. While there are **brushes** specifically marketed for use with oil-based and water-based paints respectively, you could use the same paintbrush for both.

When in doubt, ask a salesperson or a fellow painter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another pro tip for looking after your **brushes** is to follow a painting schedule.

This will maintain their form for a long time and you won’t have to replace your **brushes** prematurely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do not soak some of your **brushes** in the water while working with the other one. This temptation usually happens if you are using multiple **brushes**. This is a bad idea because the bristles tend to spread when resting in water, thus bending out of shape. Store your **brushes** horizontally on a paper towel or sheet while you are working. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Acrylic is a stubborn substance to clean out of **brushes**. And when stuck near the ferrule, it can be downright impossible to properly remove. Hence, it’s an excellent practice to submerge only the tip and rinse the brush between colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Acrylic paint dries very quickly, so it's best to clean your **brushes** right away. If you don't have time at all, you can put the **brushes** in a glass of water to prevent the paint from drying out. But you can leave the **brushes** like this for a short time; otherwise, the water will affect the instrument negatively. The bristles will stick out in different directions, the metal base will rust, and the wooden handle will deteriorate and flake. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best way to clean dried **acrylic** paint **brushes** is with a mild soap and warm water. Just make sure you rinse them well afterwards. If the paint has been on your **brushes** for a while and is starting to dry, you can use white vinegar to help loosen it up. Simply soak the bristles in a cup of vinegar for a few minutes, then rinse with warm water. You may need to repeat this process a few times before the **brushes** are completely clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The answer to this question is: it depends. Some nail polish removers are designed to remove **acrylic** paint, while others are not. It is important to read the label of the product before using it to remove any type of paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, and we will explain a few simple options to get you started. The first solution is to use soapy water. It is not as intensive on your **brushes** and makes use of existing products in your home. If this does not work, using acetone or an alcohol-based solution will work too – all you need to do is pour the solution into a jar, let the brush sit for a few minutes, and then wash with soapy water. As a last resort, you can always cut the bristles to remove any stubborn paint clumps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We recommend using a natural brush when using **acrylic** paints. This is due to the water-based nature of **acrylic** paints as well as the more durable nature of natural bristles. It also prevents damage to the bristles when using harsh chemicals to remove **acrylic** paint build-up on your **brushes**. While synthetic bristles will melt and dissolve when exposed to acetone or alcohol-based solutions, natural bristles can withstand chemical exposure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Simply dip your affected bristles into a solution of rubbing alcohol up to the ferrule level, letting it penetrate the bristles and release the **acrylic** paint buildup. Let sit for a few minutes. Use a cloth to help wipe off the bristles after each dip to aid in the paint removal process or use a steel-wire brush (brushing away from the ferrule) to remove excess paint and then rinse with water to remove any remaining alcohol. Repeat as necessary until all the paint has been removed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To remove dried **acrylic** paint from **brushes**, soak the bristles in a cup of white vinegar for a few minutes. Then rinse with warm water. You may need to repeat this process a few times before the **brushes** are completely clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using a glass jar, pour enough alcohol or acetone in it to cover the **brushes**’ bristles. Leave your brush to soak in the solution for a few minutes. Once the brush has soaked, remove it from the solution and wash it thoroughly with soapy water. Dishwashing soap is our preferred option as it can penetrate the bristles and provide a more thorough wash. Repeat this process if there are still bits of **acrylic** paint that need to be washed off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can use the EZ Air Acrylic Brush Cleaner to clean your **brushes** after you finish painting. Follow the directions on the label. They recommend mixing 1 ounce of cleaner to 8 ounces of water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re struggling with dried **brushes**, then fabric softeners can come to your rescue. Alternatively, you can make some at home by mixing three parts of baking soda in two parts of warm water. The effectiveness of a fabric softener is not only limited to **acrylic** paint, making it a viable brush cleaner for all paints. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wet **acrylic** is water-soluble. Dipping your **brushes** in water will help in breaking the paint particles. Keep a jar of water handy whenever you are working on your projects. Every time your eyes wander in the direction of the water jar, you will remember to dip your **brushes**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another quick fix when it comes to **acrylic** paint cleaning up is to wash your paint**brushes** with hand sanitizer. This solution makes use of ethyl alcohol and offers the same results as alcohol or acetone. All you need to do is squirt some hand sanitizer into the palm of your hand and then rub it onto the brush. Leave the brush in the solution to sit and soak before washing it off with soapy water. Do not leave it overnight as this can damage the bristles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to cleaning **acrylic** **brushes**, make sure that you clean the bristles at the base as well as the tip to remove any excess paint. If you want to go the extra mile, try to condition your brush bristles regularly in order to prevent them from hardening and becoming unusable. Ensure that there is no paint build-up when conditioning. We recommend a quick wash of your **brushes** with a soapy mixture before applying conditioner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After you’ve cleared the **acrylic** paint out, keep the wet **brushes** bristle-side down to dry. Keeping them upright while wet will allow moisture to seep into and damage the handle and ferrule. And ensure they are completely dry before storing them properly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most people think that once **acrylic** paint has dried on their **brushes**, it is already a lost cause. However, it is relatively simple how to get **acrylic** paint off **brushes**. It is so easy in fact that it will only take you a couple of minutes, so it will not take that much of a time investment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re always forgetting to wash out your **brushes**, you may want to switch to slow drying **acrylic**s. I’ve been using Golden OPEN **acrylic**s and I find that they’re much easier to clean from my **brushes**. This is because they stay wet for a much longer period of time than regular **acrylic**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After using a certain brush, don’t just place it away. Dip the brush into some paint thinner, give it a good swirl, and that should be enough to remove the paint stuck on the bristles. You can also “beat the devil out of your **brushes**” to remove excess paint thinner, although you should do it outside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’ve seen artists use lacquer thinner or alcohol to clean dry **acrylic** paint from their **brushes**. Many household cleaning products contain strong solvents. For example, nail polish remover is mostly made from acetone, and many stain removers contain xylene, toulene, and other toxic chemicals. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do not clean natural bristles when they are still wet. Natural bristles are not as springy and flexible as synthetic bristles; thus, they are not compatible with **acrylic** paint. The **acrylic** emulsion tends to stick to the bristles when wet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You only need a small amount of this product to get rid of dried **acrylic** paint from your **brushes** and save the day. The best amount is 10 ml and below for it to work effectively on your paint **brushes**. Pour a small amount of the mixture into a glass jar, and leave your **brushes** to soak in the mixture for up to an hour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The problem with using these solvents, aside from the safety concerns, is they can damage synthetic **brushes**. Many **brushes** that are made for **acrylic**s are synthetic. The bristles may be made from nylon or other man made materials. Some solvents can dissolve certain types of synthetic materials. Another issue is that the solvents may weaken the adhesive that holds the bristles in the ferrule. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After clearing the **acrylic** out of your paint brush, pass the brush through clean water for the last time. If the brush has been washed properly, there will be little to no discoloration in the water. But there’s no harm in rinsing your **acrylic** brush multiple times just to be safe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many newcomers to the world of painting and arts do not pay enough attention to the process of cleaning work tools from paint. A rigid brush with dried paint becomes completely unusable for the next painting. Therefore, you will either have to buy a new tool or try to clean it. Careful attitude to **brushes** should not be neglected. Good, neat **brushes** are the key to successful work and budget savings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rub the soap on the bristles until a thick lather builds up. Rinse in water, and repeat the process until the foam washes off the paint. The more foam you make, the less paint residue will remain. And once this is over, you’ll see no traces of **acrylic** paint left. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also remove the debris of **acrylic** paint from your **brushes** using hand sanitizing gel. This is because of the ethyl alcohol used in the making of hand sanitizing gel. It is the easiest method that you can use to remove **acrylic** paint from **brushes** because it does not require any form of equipment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To make your own brush cleaner, mix approximately 20% laundry detergent with 80% warm water and stir it until it dissolves. Then follow the instructions that I list above for the brush cleaner. I’ve used it to successfully remove dry **acrylic** paint from my **brushes**, but the brush cleaner is easier to use and more convenient. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The longer your **brushes** stay with **acrylic** paint, the harder it will become to salvage the paintbrush. If weeks have passed by, then the paint might not even come off from the paintbrush. Thus, you must do regular check-ups to ensure that your art equipment is in order. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have tried all of the above methods and nothing seems to work at your end, then perhaps you have to accept that your brush is gone. There is nothing more you can do to revive it to a usable state. At this stage, you can only either trim it or throw it away and get a new set of **brushes**. A trimmed brush can be useful for stippling. You can create other painting techniques using different trimmed **brushes**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fill the jar with enough alcohol to submerge the bristles of the **brushes**. Place the **brushes** inside the jar, and let them soak in the alcohol for about five minutes. Give the jar a good shake once or twice to get the alcohol into the bristles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The easiest way to ensure that your **brushes** last is to properly clean them after each use. This is a pretty straightforward process, as most **acrylic** paints are water-soluble. This means that by keeping a jar of water on hand while painting, you can prevent **acrylic** paint from building up and leading to damaged brush bristles. Simply dip your brush into the water, give it a quick swirl, and watch the paint dissolve. While water can be beneficial to paint removal, we advise you not to leave your **brushes** to soak overnight, as this will bend the bristles and inevitably damage your **brushes**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   I don’t use it every day. Instead, I use leftover hand soap from my bathroom to clean my **brushes** at the end of the day.
