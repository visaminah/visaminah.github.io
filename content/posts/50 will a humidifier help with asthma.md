## 50 Reference List: Will A Humidifier Help With Asthma | does an air humidifier help with asthma
-   How they can help. If you heat your home for a good part of the year, or if you live in a very dry climate, a **humidifier** will make your home more comfortable to live in. Humidifiers can also be helpful if you suffer from sore throats, nosebleeds, headaches, coughs or other ailments related to dry air. In addition to your personal comfort, a **humidifier** helps to keep the home itself from suffering undesirable effects caused by air that’s too dry, including loosening of floorboards and furniture joints. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another study found the same. An additional study also found that if the air was hot humidity prevented the increased difficulty breathing in **asthma**tics when they exercised. There was no effect of humidity on the exercise-induced difficulty breathing if the air was cold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   During the winter, the continual use of your home-heating system can dry out the air in your home, irritating your eyes, throat and lungs. For that reason, most central heating systems include a built-in **humidifier**, which adds moisture to the air in the house to help relieve those problems. Portable **humidifier**s are also available, making it possible to add moisture to a single room or to just a portion of a home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The climate in the states is a bit moody, with some places having extremely cold winters and others having extremely hot summers. Due to such vastness in climate temperature, the quality of air is also affected and is highly non-uniform. For example, the air quality in the States becomes warmer as one travels further in the south, and once moving closer to the west, the air becomes dryer and dryer. Therefore, states that are in the western region such as Alaska, Arizona, California, or states that are closer to the southern region have the highest number of **asthma**-related cases. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Placing a **humidifier** in your home will make it more comfortable for you and your furry friend. The ASPCA pointed out that dry air promotes **asthma** attacks, so using a **humidifier** would be a great way to keep optimal moisture levels for your feline. Both the ASPCA and Pet Health and Care noted that it’s especially important to consider using a **humidifier** in the winter season, when the air is drier and your cat may be susceptible to more frequent and severe **asthma** attacks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Air temperature affects humidity markedly, the water carrying capacity of cold air is much lower than warm air. So humidity tends to be low in the winter and higher in the Summer. To complicate matters, temperature also affects the airways and can make them contract in **asthma**tics. Consequently the 2 factors need separating out and the clinical studies do this by using air at the same temperature with different humidities and air at different temperatures with the same humidity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1. Is it OK to use a **humidifier** if you have **asthma**? Ask your doctor before using a **humidifier** if you or your child suffers from **asthma** or allergies. Increased humidity can help children and adults with **asthma** and allergies breathe more accessible, especially during a respiratory infection like a cold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When the mouth, nasal cavities, pallet, and airway get dried out it tends to make snoring worse. The vibrations of these dry tissues caused by each breath in and out can intensify the sound of snoring. Turning on a **humidifier** before you go to bed can help alleviate loud snoring by providing more moisture to these tissues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To keep humidity levels stable throughout your home, consider installing a **humidifier** unit into your HVAC system. When tied into your water line, it requires no refilling and poses no danger of bacteria growing in standing water. (Follow manufacturer’s instructions for periodic cleaning.) Central units are usually less expensive to run, but require professional installation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The use of a **humidifier** will only be effective if it is maintained properly, otherwise it can easily become a breeding ground for moulds, virus and bacteria. The presence of these pathogens might eventually lead to a severe lung infection which can be fatal for **asthma** patients. There are a few guidelines that the **asthma** patient should keep in mind for the proper maintenance of **humidifier**s4: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. Should you close the door when using a **humidifier**? Do not open the door of a room where the **humidifier** is the appropriate size for the room; if you do so, the humidity will escape the room. While using a **humidifier** that is too powerful for the room, keep open the door to let some of the humidity escape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **humidifier** for an **asthma** sufferer should only disperse water into the air by evaporation. You may think that all **humidifier**s use evaporation to get water into the air. However, this is not the case – please see the diagram below and this article for further details. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How they can help. A good air-filtration system can make a significant improvement to the overall purity of the air in your home (some HEPA [high-efficiency particulate absorption] filtration systems are said to be up to 99.9 percent efficient in removing unwanted particles from the air). To the extent that your severe allergies or **asthma** are irritated by airborne pollutants, an air-filtration system could make a noticeable difference for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cats may have allergies just like humans. The ASPCA stated feline **asthma** is believed to stem from allergic bronchitis. Symptoms to look out for include more obvious ones such as a persistent cough, wheezing, overall weakness and lethargy and gagging up foamy mucus. There are also more subtle signs to watch for, such as squatting with hunched shoulders, an extended neck and rapid or labored breathing, blue lips and gums and open-mouth breathing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, doing everything you can to reduce the risk of an attack during winter makes sense. If the cold, fluctuations in humidity, or allergens are your main triggers, one of the finest **humidifier**s for **asthma** is worth a try. It is best if you evaluate first what works best for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is direct evidence that humidity affects airways resistance. Strauss et al investigated the influence of heat and humidity on airway obstruction induced by exercise in **asthma**. Their results are shown in the following table. As you can see high humidity air reduced the amount of airway obstruction both with air at room temperature and at body temperature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You need to keep tabs on your **humidifier** to ensure it’s clean and in proper working order, Dr. Nicolacakis says. Try following these three simple steps: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What about air at the other end of the spectrum-is dry air and its effect on **asthma**? Several studies have found an increase in airways resistance in response to dryer. In one study children were got to hyperventilate by being linked up to a mouthpiece and the more they blew the higher a balloon on the screen went. This showed a smaller increase than cold air induces, but nevertheless an increase in airways resistance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In an experiment in which **asthma**tics breathed in air of different humidities at the same temperature through a mouthpiece as part of the experiment. The subjects were at rest. Airway resistance increased with increasing water content. So at rest increasing humidity led to increased difficulty breathing in **asthma**tics. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A room **humidifier** can be a great resource for you and your cat if used properly. However, increasing the moisture levels in your home beyond optimal conditions can have dangerous consequences such as mold and bacterial growth. This could introduce health hazards and may very well worsen your cat’s symptoms. Be sure to wipe down any surfaces where condensation accumulates and adjust the levels to maintain the best conditions for all members of your family. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What is the difference? Share on Pinterest A **humidifier** may reduce the discomfort of a dry throat or nose. Humidifiers and vaporizers add humidity to the air in different ways: A vaporizer heats water and adds steam to the air. It has internal heating technology that boils the water before releasing it into the air as steam, creating a warm mist. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **humidifier** is a device used to increase the moisture content present in the air. It works by releasing water vapours or steam. It differs from an air purifier, which purifies the air by trapping the pollutants present. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This type of **humidifier** blows moisture through a moistened filter. Fans push the humidity out into the room. Impeller **humidifier**: This option creates a cool mist that is pushed out into the room by disks that rotate at high speed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’re probably aware that room **humidifier**s help soothe respiratory ailments. You might enjoy having a cool air **humidifier** in your room to keep the atmosphere comfortable while you sleep. However, you may not know that these devices can also benefit your furry friend. According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, having one of these units around your home could help with your cat’s **asthma**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Removing particles from the air can help **asthma**tics, but what about adding water vapour to the indoor air? A **humidifier** is a device that adds water vapor to the air in order to control its humidity. They are often used for comfort, but they can also have some health benefits for people who suffer from **asthma**. Some people believe that **humidifier**s help with **asthma** symptoms, while others disagree. In this blog post I will discuss how **humidifier**s might be helpful in the treatment of **asthma** and why you should consider purchasing one if you have been diagnosed with this condition. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Which is better for **asthma** a **humidifier** or de**humidifier**? Difference Between an Air Purifier and a Humidifier-13 Significant Health Effects Read more As a general rule, if the relative humidity of the air is less than 30% a **humidifier** is better and if it is less than 50% a de**humidifier** is better. How do you know if you have an indoor air quality problem? You may notice a runny nose, wheezing or an odd smell. However you really need an air quality monitor which will measure both particles and chemicals in the air. Then you could buy test kits to detect mold and house dust mite. Other aspects of air quality that you could measure are humidity and radon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Air purifiers and **humidifier**s can certainly be helpful in improving the air quality in your home and easing your symptoms. But along with their benefits, these devices can sometimes have disadvantages. It’s important to weigh the benefits and cautions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Central **humidifier**: This **humidifier** is built directly into your home’s heating and air conditioning system and can control the humidity level throughout your entire house. It’s the most expensive option, Dr. Nicolacakis says, but it’s the most effective choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Should the **humidifier** run all night? It’s perfectly fair to leave your **humidifier** on all night. However, because some people are sensitive to excessive humidity, you should consider your health and how your body reacts to it before using this gadget. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Such kind heats the water inside until it boils, then releases the steam into the room. It was once the most popular type of **humidifier** on the market. Suppose an **asthma**tic prefers a warmer humid environment. In that case, these **humidifier**s are beneficial, but due to the heated tank, they are also the model that requires the greatest care in terms of cleanliness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is important to keep in mind that anything in excess is not good for our health and the same goes for **humidifier**s. It is crucial for us to switch-off our **humidifier**s and let in the fresh air from time to time. Thankfully, most Ultrasonic Humidifiers come with an automatic shut-off feature that allows you to use your **humidifier** without worrying to shut it off. This feature comes in quite handy, especially at night. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Asthma is a common lung condition where air flow is disturbed due to narrowing of the airways which causes occasional breathing problems. It is a long term or chronic condition that arises due to the inflammation of lungs and excessive mucus production that blocks the air passages. There are different types of **asthma**, some common types include; allergic, non-allergic and cough variant **asthma**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using a **humidifier** while you sleep has some health benefits that are apparent. For example, you will notice that you struggle less with dry skin, sinus problems, bloody noses, and cracked lips. You may also feel some relief from congestion if you have a cold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The target humidity temperature does not just determine the success of each model. The technique you need is then determined by the size of the space or rooms to be humidified. Cool mist **humidifier**s cover a larger area than steam **humidifier**s, but individuals with **asthma** should read the instructions on the package of each type to have the desired effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are less obvious benefits as well. When air dries out nasal passages makes it more difficult for the cilia to filter bacteria, germs, dust, and pathogens and prevent them from entering your respiratory system. In this way, using a **humidifier** helps your body’s defences against viruses and other illnesses. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "Very dry air increases the chances of catching viruses like the common cold or even the flu, which can be serious **asthma** triggers," she says. "Humidifiers can help people living in dry environments to maintain comfortable humidity levels in their home." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The preventative effect of **humidifier**s on illnesses comes from their ability to maintain heat in a room. Heat is better retained by moist air, leaving humidified rooms warmer than those left dry. As we all know, staying warm is essential to avoiding sickness in the winter months and for recovering from anything we may catch. Using a **humidifier** in combination with a space heater can go a long way to keep a room and its occupants warm and safe from the cold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This electric-powered option heats water and cools it off before pushing water vapor out into the room. Vaporizers can be moved from room to room. Ultrasonic **humidifier**: Like an impeller **humidifier**, this **humidifier** spreads a cool mist through the room via ultrasonic vibration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **humidifier** is built directly into your home’s heating and air conditioning system and can control the humidity level throughout your entire house.

-   For starters, check to see whether your **asthma** improves when the weather changes to hot and humid. If you’re living in a basement unit/room then chances are the quality of air would be a lot more dry than ideal for **asthma** patients. It is better to invest in a **humidifier** to control the humidity levels in such a room. If you’re living in an enclosed space with not much natural light or ventilation and if you’re constantly having breathing problems such as coughing, tightness in chess, or shortness of breath. Such a place is ideal for germs and dust particles in the air which may be triggering your **asthma**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cautions. Clearly, in some climates, **humidifier**s play an important role in keeping us, and our homes, comfortable. But for **asthma** sufferers, they are a potential source of trouble. Unless they are cleaned regularly and thoroughly, they can serve as breeding grounds for mold and bacterial growth, which then gets distributed throughout the house and can trigger your **asthma**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is a small change, but using a **humidifier** at night can make a big difference. It can help you to sleep better and help your body stay healthy.

-   The severity of feline **asthma** attacks can worsen depending on environmental factors as well as the cat’s overall health. Your furry friend’s surroundings may have a negative influence on his or her **asthma**. The level of allergens in the air, such as molds, pollens, cigarette smoke and the dust from his or her litter may make your cat’s **asthma** worse. Additionally, extreme stress can impact not only your feline’s mental well-being but also his or her **asthma**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the case of cats with **asthma** or allergies, sufficiently humid air has the added benefit of improving breathing. These various conditions are exacerbated by dry air. Heating systems of all kinds tend to lead to drier air, making this more of a concern in the winter months. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Humidifiers and vaporizers add water vapor to the air. They make the air moist and combat dryness, making them a useful home remedy for many conditions that can cause a dry nose, skin dryness, or congestion. People use **humidifier**s and vaporizers for conditions such as colds, bronchitis and allergies, and to use in baby nurseries. There are slight differences between **humidifier**s and vaporizers, which means they have different benefits for different uses. In this article, we look at which is best for various uses, and other considerations, including cost and safety. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
