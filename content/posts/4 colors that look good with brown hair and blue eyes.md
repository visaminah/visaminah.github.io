## 4 Tips to Colors That Look Good With Brown Hair And Blue Eyes | Soft Summer Brown Eyes
-   You can wear browns in nearly every shade, so add some items in dark chocolate; balance those browns with a creamy taupe. Lavender and plum are flattering, but rich pure purple make your eyes look amazing. Go for saturated **colors** that contrast your face and make your big, **blue** eyes the beautiful focus. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That said, blondes are either cool or warm-toned; that is, **blue** undertones vs. red or gold undertones. So, a warm-toned blonde has more of a strawberry or a golden undertone, while the cool-toned blonde has a sandy/ ashy look and looks good in cooler tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Clear, bright **colors** such as lemon and pear green are great choices. Lighter greens flatter more than the darker hues, and warmer tones are preferable to muddy ones. Pumpkin and gold enhance your **blue** eyes, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For deep **blue** eyes, add bold **blue** near your face. Cobalt and turquoise **blue** will deepen your eye color, while robin’s egg **blue** and washed denim will lighten it. Most shades of **blue** work well for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
