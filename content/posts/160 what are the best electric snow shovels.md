-   There’s little need to explain what an electric **snow** shovel is, the name gives you a pretty idea of what you’re getting. For those who might not know – an electric **snow** shovel will do the same job as a regular shovel when clearing **snow** from your porch, stairs, walkways and other areas where you would use a regular shovel. The only difference being that an electric motor does the hard work for you. This means that you’ll get the job done faster and with a great deal less effort and backache. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

The discrete safety switch offers an extra layer of protection against any accidents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The holiday season is filled with a lot of activities. While there are a lot of festivities and merrymaking, there also exists one issue resulted from the winter season: **snow**-clearing becomes a top task in your activities. From my experience as a gardener, this activity can be fun if you are equipped with the right tool. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On a graveled surface, generally speaking, avoid using an electric **snow** shovel. For gravel roads, not even single-stage electric **snow** throwers work well. Injuring someone, shattering glass, and ruining the plastic auger paddles are all possible consequences of using an electric **snow** shovel or **snow** thrower on gravel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cordless electric **snow** blowers never need gas, and they start instantly with the press of a button. This model is powered by an efficient brushless motor and a heavy-duty 80-volt lithium-ion battery pack. It offers top performance for up to 90 minutes of use. The LED battery indicator tells you how much battery power is left. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Winter weather tends to hit at the least opportune times, and a **snow**-filled driveway can pose problems when you have places to go. Heck, we are headquartered in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, so we know a thing or two about **snow**. When it dumps 500 plus inches of **snow** in the Tetons, the best way to quickly clear a path for your car is with a **snow** blower, but using one can lead to unintended environmental consequences. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   5. Motor The motor is another one of the things that makes a huge impact on the overall performance of the given electric **snow** shovel. So it’s pretty important that you know how powerful the motor is and if the electric **snow** shovel can remove the **snow** efficiently. So the power of the motor should be something that you look after while buying the best electric **snow** shovel for yourself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 7.5A 120V electric motor drives a curved rotor auger via a ploy V-belt, this is a very efficient system and gives impressive results from this relatively small electric motor. This makes the power consumption excellent when compared to similarly sized electric **snow** **shovels**. It has a clearing width of 12” and a cutting depth of 6”. It works through about 300 LBS of **snow** per minute and blasts it a distance of up 20 FT. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. LED Headlights The LED Headlights are also something that you would need to consider. You have to know that removing **snow** can be required at any time of the day or night, which means you may not always have a good light to see the **snow**. This is why it is important to have LED headlights in the electric **snow** shovel so that you would be able to clearly see and use the shovel at your convenience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The greatest thing about the WEN 5662 Snow Blaster is that it costs the same as many electric **snow** **shovels**. This does mean that it’s not a heavy duty machine and you’re limited to light to medium **snow**. It will, however clear a much larger area, much faster than an electric **snow** shovel and cut quite a few inches deeper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turn the **snow** blower off if you experience a blockage in the auger or chute. Then using a stick or broom handle, gently prod **snow** and ice loose. Never use your hands to remove objects from the auger. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You are probably among those people that believe clearing **snow** should be simple before you head off to work. If you belong to this category of individuals, you have allocated this activity very little time. Therefore, you will need a tool that helps you stick to this tight schedule. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Snow Joe iOn 24V – SS13 cordless **snow** shovel – most reliable and consistent performer. Because it’s lightweight, budget friendly, and has a 13” clearing path (not too narrow and not too wide), this tool fits the needs of the majority of small yard owners. Earthwise SN74022 battery powered electric **snow** shovel – most powerful and efficient, will clear a path 22 inches wide and 10 inches deep in one move. If your area gets a lot of **snow** – this machine is your best bet! Greenworks 2600702 12 inch 40V cordless power **snow** shovel is ideal if you live in areas with occasional **snow**fall. It’s great for tight spaces, and really small properties. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should pay attention to intake chute depth when buying an electric **snow** shovel because this metric will determine the depth of **snow** you can clear. Usual chute depth ranges from 4 till 8 inches. So, if your area is gets deep **snow**, you should go for a deeper chute. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Below is a roundup of some of the best cordless electric **snow** blowers and electric **snow** **shovels** now available. The editors of Home Garden and Homestead have selected models at different price points and from several top-name manufacturers. So, your days of shoveling **snow** the old-fashioned way are about to end. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 32 lb frame is easy to maneuver, meaning you can take it up and down steps for easier access to hard-to-reach **snow** piles. Despite its small size, the blower can clear **snow** up to eight inches deep and will remove close to 2,500 square feet of **snow** within an hour. Adjust the **snow** chute 180 degrees to put **snow** precisely where you want it, up to 20 feet away from the action. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you use the scoop-and-toss method or the long push technique, shoveling **snow** with a manual shovel can be hard on your back, knees - and your heart, depending on your fitness level. That’s why lots of people are switching to “electric **shovels**.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Greenworks Pro 80V cordless **snow** shovel is able to move a surprising amount of **snow**, yet it is probably best to only use this tool for stairs, decks, and paved walkways. You should not try to use it on a gravel driveway, that’s for damn sure. It will take you too long to clear a driveway, and gravel stones will damage the auger blade. You also should not try to use it for clearing **snow** from a roof. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The size of the electrical shovel is also another important issue to consider when buying this equipment. It becomes a major influence on the aspect of storage space and the amount of **snow**fall. If you have little space, you would like a shovel that is very lean and small. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is also a distinguishing feature among the electric **snow** **shovels**. It is actually one of the main features that most people look for when buying this equipment. These models are recommended for households that have more than one person handling the **snow**-clearing task. With adjustable handles, you can comfortably set the shovel to a height that you are most comfortable with. This means that you do not strain or excessively bend your back when using this equipment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another important consideration is the financial issue. Your available budget will determine the specific models to narrow your research to. Therefore, first, determine the amount you want to spend so as to narrow the list of **shovels** to shop for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Electric **snow** **shovels** are much less labor-intensive than a manual **snow** shovel. They do a lot of the work for you but are generally not quite as powerful as a traditional, full-sized **snow**blower. Still, they can save your back after a **snow**storm and help you drastically cut down the time it takes to clear all that powder,” according to a review article in Popular Mechanics. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The answer is yes! The latest generation of cordless electric **snow** blowers are a great choice for most homeowners. These new models do a heck of a job of moving **snow**. Plus, you never have to struggle to start up a cold gasoline engine. These battery powered **snow** blowers start instantly with the push of a button. And you never have to worry about running out of gas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of the components used in the construction of an electric **snow** shovel are plastic because this makes them lighter. Though, we all know that some plastic equipment is stronger than others. Usually, if you’re paying a little more (within reason) it means that you’re getting a higher grade of materials used in the construction of the machine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   4. Size and Weight The size and weight are also some of the features that you need to consider so that you can easily get the best performance and nice mobility as well as convenience as well. The weight should be ideal for you so that you can handle it nicely and on the other hand the size should be too moderate and not too big or too small for you. Size can also impact the storage of the electric **snow** shovel when it’s not used. So overall, do look after these specifications of an electric **snow** shovel as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Snow Joe “Hybrid” **snow** shovel gets two thumbs up for the same reasons that we liked the battery-only version, plus one. Quality, reliability, and performance are still major strong suits of this model. Its versatility and ability to use an electrical cord are another bonus for homeowners considering this model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the other hand, the Snow Joe electric **snow** shovel has a nine-ampere motor that powers its augers. This enables it to collect and throw **snow** at a rate of four hundred pounds per minute. This is one of the highest clearance rates you will find for an electric shovel. It is also an outstanding rate for a fourteen-pound electric power shovel **snow** thrower. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Snow blowers are large and can be quite heavy. A two-stage **snow** blower is going give the best results – cutting deeper and throwing the **snow** further, as well as making the job quite a lot faster. The problem is that two-stage **snow** blowers are usually very expensive and are, with very few exceptions, gas-powered machines. This means you have all the hassle and noise that is associated with gas engines. If you have to do a lot of clearing and you regularly have heavy **snow**, a two-stage **snow** blower is worth the investment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Clearing width is determined by the width of the intake chute. Most likely you will want the cordless **snow** shovel with the widest chute possible in order to clear **snow** in the least amount of passes. Chute width ranges from 10 to 16 inches in most electric **snow** **shovels**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   8. Warranty Warranty is also something that you would need to consider. Not all electric **snow** **shovels** come with a warranty so you might wanna pick the one which comes with a warranty. The warranty would help if there is an issue with the electric **snow** shovel. You can easily call the manufacturer and get it replaced or repaired. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When choosing the best electric **snow** shovel for your needs, you’ll be looking for different criteria than you would for a **snow** blower. An electric **snow** shovel is a very portable tool and you’re likely to be using it some tight spaces, unlike a **snow** blower that has to work in a relatively wide area. So let’s take a look at what this entails – what should you look out for when choosing an electric **snow** shovel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 40V 4AH EcoSharp lithium-ion battery, combined with a 500W brushless motor, gives you incredible power and one of the best working times for a battery-powered **snow** shovel. The guys at Snow Joe claim a working time of up to 52 minutes from this battery – though we all know that one usually gets quite a bit less than any manufacturers specified maximum working times when used under normal working conditions. The Snow Joe iON13SS still beats most others. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Greenworks Pro 2600602 is an 80V cordless **snow** shovel with a 2-Ah lithium-ion battery. A fully charged lithium-ion battery should provide a working time of between 30 and 45 minutes. The battery is recharged between use with the 80V rapid charger in only 30 minutes. This battery-powered **snow** shovel has a 12-inch wide auger, and it might clear **snow** that is not deeper than 6-inches. It should be able to clear both light **snow**, and the heavier, wetter stuff. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Manual push **shovels** are common among the electrical category of **shovels**. Some people consider it a huge limitation, but I disagree with them. The reason behind this form of classification is that they lack the ability to propel themselves, hence will require you to manually push them around. The motors simply do not produce enough energy to even power the wheels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Keep in mind that the auger blade is made from plastic, so be careful not to shovel straight into a rock or a hibernating garden gnome, since this might shatter the auger blade. In addition, this 11-inch electric **snow** shovel is not a good choice for clearing thick and heavy **snow**. If you regularly have to shovel wet **snow**, then you should get a single-stage electric **snow** thrower, such as the 21-inch Snow Joe SJ625E (it also has an LED light). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Earthwise Snow Thrower blazes an 18-inch-wide path through up to 12 inches of **snow**. The 40-volt brushless motor makes quick work of a **snow**-covered suburban driveway and sidewalk. Adjustable chute throws the **snow** up to 30 feet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   16″ Cordless **snow** shovel : New for 2017. Based on the reputation of Earthwise, this will quickly rise in popularity. One of the most promising electric **snow** **shovels** on the market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Earthwise SN70016 Electric Corded 12Amp Snow Shovel This **snow** blower is a bestseller, and with an affordable price point and a range of cool features, it’s easy to see why. The Snow Joe can move up to 800 pounds of **snow** per minute, cutting a 21-inch wide by 12-inch deep hole through the powdery stuff in one go. It can throw **snow** up to 20 feet and has a discharge chute that rotates 180 degrees, allowing you to be super specific about where all that frozen precipitation will end up. It even has a scraper blade on the bottom to really clear the ground without causing damage.

-   Snow Joe products know how to handle **snow**. This Snow Joe cordless electric **snow** blower easily clears a path that is 18 inches wide and 8-10 inches deep in a single pass.

-   If you live in a climate that gets **snow** in the winter, you know the “joys” of having to shovel **snow** manually. With Ryobi’s impressive range of homeowner tools, it’s no surprise that it’s tapped into the winter cleanup market. We’ve covered Ryobi’s 40V Snow Blowers in the past, but you may be looking for something for lighter **snow**-clearing jobs. That’s where Ryobi cordless **snow** **shovels** come in. We’re giving you an overview of each model to help you sort out the options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An electric **snow** shovel is an outdoor tool for picking up and throwing **snow** out of the way. It is like a **snow** shovel with an electric motor and a paddle auger. Electric **snow** **shovels** usually have an 8-amp or 10-amp motor that gets power from a 120V outlet (corded) or a lithium-ion battery pack (cordless). Here are a few examples of top-rated corded and cordless electric **snow** **shovels** that might help you to clear **snow** from decks, stairs and walkways. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Two-stage **snow** blowers, however, may operate on gravel driveways. However, you must ensure that the adjustable skid shoes on the bottom of the auger housing are in the proper position. If the scraper blade makes contact with the gravel surface, then you should adjust the runner skid shoes to prevent this from happening. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The EGO Power+ may be overkill for most people looking for an electric **snow** blower, but it compares well to similarly-priced gas-powered units. Even better, it does so without the loud noise and toxic fumes. Just keep in mind that this machine weighs a hefty 55 pounds, which means you need some muscle to maneuver it successfully. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cordless electric **snow** **shovels** work on rechargeable batteries.They are more convenient to use, but your working time is limited by battery run time. Though if you get a second battery, the problem is solved! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **snow**blower with a push-button start, the Snow Joe 48 does have a smaller cutting path at 18″ vs. The Greenworks or EGO **snow** blower. Still, This amazing little machine clears an acceptable 18″ wide path quickly, making it perfect for decks, sidewalks, or small-medium sized driveways. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Toro Power Shovel will not satisfy your **snow** throwing needs if you want to clear **snow**falls deeper than 6 inches. It also will not work for large driveways or gravel surfaces. It does not have a directional **snow** chute, so you have almost no control over where the **snow** lands. The **snow** can only be thrown directly forward. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ego’s beast of a **snow** blower features dual 5.0Ah batteries to make sure you don’t run out of power in the middle of the job. This has a maximum throw distance of 40 feet, plenty to move **snow** out of the way, and the steel auger can slice through ice almost twice as fast as other brands. This is water-resistant, with a heavy steel body, and a 21-inch width that makes it ideal for sidewalks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This group of electrical **shovels** includes the ones that are fitted with more powerful motors. This enables them to produce enough power to propel them in all terrains. Most users love these **shovels** because all they have to do is press the necessary buttons, and the machine will cope with the rest of the work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to purchasing these **shovels**, you have to be sure about the model you would like to have. Their variation is mainly dictated by the usage and source of power. The main models are as discussed below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Toro 38361 Power Shovel has a clearing width of 12 inches and a clearing intake height of 6 inches. It might clear **snow** up to 6 inches deep, but not any deeper. It is limited to clearing flat, smooth areas: do not use it on gravel. Not only that, but it prefers light, fluffy **snow** over icy wet **snow**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Who doesn’t like **snow**? I bet we all do, after all watching the **snow**fall and getting cozy in our room near the window is always fun, right? Although the time after the **snow**fall or sometimes after a **snow**storm is not always pleasant as there is **snow** everywhere and you have to make way for yourself or your car or just simply remove the **snow**. Well, this is not an easy task and we all know that. Some people remove the **snow** manually with an ordinary shovel while others want to do it with much less effort and time which means they would be using an electric appliance to remove the **snow**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Space: How big of a driveway or walkway are you working with? This one’s important for a few reasons. First, you’ll need the blower to cover the right amount of width to really clear a walkable path. Second, consider where the excess **snow** needs to go, because the street isn’t an option. You can dump it on your own yard or an unused spot of your property, but make sure your device has enough power and range to get it there. About 40 feet should do it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just like other cordless yard tools, a cordless electric **snow** shovel runs off a rechargeable battery and boasts freedom of movement. However, if you have a lot of **snow** to clear, a single charge might not last long enough. Cordless models will also tend to cost more, so corded varieties will likely be the more affordable option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The fact that the product is electrical makes it stress-free equipment. All you need is to connect the tool to a power source and press the power button to get it fired up. The Greenworks 12 electric **snow** shovel is also fitted with an adjustable handle that makes it possible to move it up and down depending on your height. This feature, combined with the light weight makes it one of the friendliest electric items to use. By friendly I mean that it will not require excessive force or special technique to operate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This corded electric **snow** shovel has a 10-amp electric motor. It is powerful enough for its 11-inch width, but do not expect it to handle more than dry, powdery **snow**. There are other Snow Joe electric **snow** **shovels**, with 8-amp or 9-amp motors, or the 13-inch wide 323E, and yet it seems like the 324E model is the only one that has a headlight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s a very easy machine to use with a simple switch button start and a weight of 14.5 LBS makes it easy to move about. The handle is height adjustable, though the grips don’t look as comfortable as some of the more expensive electric **snow** **shovels**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You might consider getting a single-stage **snow** thrower if you have back issues or shoulder problems. Single-stage electric **snow** throwers have small wheels, so they can be pushed around. They also have wider augers, bigger motors and adjustable discharge chutes. However, you can buy an electric **snow** shovel for under $200, so it is definitely cheaper when compared to your average single-stage **snow** thrower or two-stage **snow** blower. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   WEN products are always good quality and even though this is one of the cheapest electric **snow** blowers, it’s a fairly robust machine. Though I wouldn’t recommend it for heavy-duty work. The WEN 5662 is excellent for the homeowner who does occasional **snow** clearing and doesn’t see the need to spend a lot on a heavy-duty **snow** blower. WEN offers really great after sales service and this model has a 2-year warranty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The two-blade paddle auger does a great job of maximizing the exceptional power of the 40V DC electric motor, moving up to 300 LBS of **snow** per minute. It clears a path of 13” wide and 6” deep which is pretty normal for a **snow** shovel of this size. It will throw the **snow** up to 25 Ft. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   An electric **snow** shovel is made to eliminate a lot of the effort involved in cleaning light **snow**fall from tiny areas like porch stairs, narrow walks, patios, and decks. They are substantially more compact and smaller than a single-stage **snow** blower. They come in a variety of sizes, but typically have a clearance width of 11 to 13 inches. Fluffy **snow** is ideal for electric **snow** **shovels**. The effectiveness of flinging **snow** may be diminished if it is wet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Electric **snow** **shovels** come in a limited variety, since they all work on the same fundamental principle. An electric **snow** shovel has a spinning paddle that collects **snow** and tosses it forward. The paddle blades sweep up and hurl **snow** out of your way. The **snow** can only be thrown forward, since these electric **shovels** lack a discharge chute and a deflector. As a result, you have limited influence over where the **snow** lands. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Therefore, ensure the size of the motor is matched by a wide shovel and a deeper clearance range. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although electric **snow** blowers are also a popular option, some people go for electric **snow** **shovels** which are easier to handle and also very compact and lightweight. You won’t get wheels in some of the power **shovels** and they would be easy to operate with simpler features and interface. So people who don’t like the so-called tech-savvy gadgets might choose an electric **snow** shovel rather than a **snow**blower. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Greenworks Pro 2600602 weighs about 15 pounds, but it might feel too heavy for some people, since the majority of the weight is at the bottom end. Even so, the heavy 80V battery at the top end might balance the weight, but you still have to be strong enough to be able to carry and move this cordless **snow** shovel with your hands (it’s got no wheels). Moreover, do not forget that these cordless **snow** **shovels** do not have discharge chutes that can adjust the direction of the **snow**. The **snow** is thrown straight ahead, between 15 and 30 feet away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This lightweight electric **snow** shovel can handle both light, fluffy **snow** and heavy, wet **snow**. Just be cautious when removing the heavier, deeper **snow**. It may take almost as long as a manual shovel to accomplish the work, but it requires less physical effort. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), using an average gas-powered **snow** blower for an hour will generate about a pound of carbon monoxide emissions. That’s the equivalent of driving your car for 70 miles! The lesson is clear – gas powered **snow** blowers are not climate friendly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, knowing you want to get a **snow** blower and actually pulling the trigger on this purchase are two different things. To help you take the plunge, we rounded up the best options on the market right now. Nab one of these now to make future **snow** days so much easier on yourself—and your back. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It can handle up to 840 pounds of **snow** per minute, tossing it up to 25 feet away. This makes it ideal for clearing large driveways and walkways, though it may be too small for spaces any larger. Likewise, this corded model must always be used within range of an outlet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want the full power of a gas engine in an electric **snow** blower, the EGO may suit your needs. To regular readers of LeafScore, this doesn’t come as much of a surprise, seeing as EGO products have been a go-to for us winning placement in both lawnmowers and chainsaws. If you already have EGO products at home, you’ll find the batteries working between products with no issues, and the company’s eco-credentials make it one we’re happy to support and recommend. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a powerful and compact budget option, consider this Snow Joe. At just 34 pounds, it’s maneuverable and agile, and has a max throw distance of up to 25 feet, with a 180 degree adjustable chute. The four blade steel auger cuts a path that’s 18 inches wide by ten deep, ultimately moving up to 720 pounds of **snow** per minute. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Toro 38361 Power Shovel is like a **snow** shovel with an electric motor and an auger blade. It probably clears similar amounts of **snow** without the heavy lifting associated with an ordinary **snow** shovel. The Toro Power Shovel is probably too small for deep **snow**falls or large driveways, but it is big enough for clearing **snow** from decks and paths. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can rotate the cute 180°, so no matter which direction you work in, you can always choose where the **snow** is thrown. The 6” plastic wheels look quite durable (maybe not the best) and they give a reasonable clearance when working in light to medium **snow**. It weighs 39 LBS and the soft grip lawnmower-style handle is comfortable to use. You can also adjust the throw distance, in other words how far you blast the **snow**, with a simple switch at your fingertips. A carrying handle, mounted to the top of the auger housing, makes it quite effortless to carry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A cordless electric **snow** shovel is a good choice of light duty **snow** removal. The powerful 400-watt motor of the Snow Joe 24V-SS13 electric **snow** shovel can move up to 1,620 pounds of **snow** per battery charge. The two blades provide high impact **snow** removal. This model clears a path 13 inches wide and easily removes **snow**falls of up to 6 inches deep. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Power cord types are a sub-group of the general electric **shovels**. Their distinguishing characteristic is that the **shovels** will require their power-cord to be plugged into a power source for them to work. Critics consider this as the main weakness because such devices cannot be used in a location without electricity or at least a power generator. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While an electric **snow** shovel isn’t a machine with very complicated technical specifications, some are better than others. One of the big differences being that some use an electric cord, while others are cordless (battery-powered). Cordless electric **snow** **shovels** are obviously more convenient, you’ll just be paying more for this advantage and you’re always limited by the working time of the battery. As most cordless tool enthusiasts already know, it’s always a good idea to have more than one battery for your cordless tools. In this respect, you may want to choose a cordless electric **snow** shovel that shares the same battery as your other cordless garden tools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is quickly becoming a familiar choice of electrical **shovels** for most households. The simple explanation for this is that they are portable. Their rechargeable battery pack can be charged in advance before you begin the clearing process. This means that the distance you work will not be limited by the size of the cord. In certain cases, once full, the battery can sustain the clearing operation for about an hour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This cordless electric **snow** blower has a rotating chute that turns 180 degrees, making it easy to throw the **snow** in any direction. Just make adjustments on the handle-mounted control panel. It has the power to launch the **snow** up to 40 feet. The front LED lights make it easy to remove **snow** even at night. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lucky for you, there is nothing to be disappointed about because GreenWorks 2600502 has addressed all your concerns. How is that? To begin with, the tool is wide enough, so it covers a ground of twenty inches wide and a depth of twelve inches. To put this into context, it is able to clear **snow** in an area almost twice larger than some other electric **snow** **shovels** in this category do. In terms of the depth, the shovel is capable of digging out ice twice more as compared to the levels of other electric **shovels**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This model is very similar to the one listed above, except that it can be run on a 40-volt battery or an electrical extension cord. This gives it more versatility and the ability to be used for as long as needed and for longer operating capability. This is the best option if you’re looking for a tough little **snow**blower for larger **snow**falls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Basically, this PowerSmart cordless electric blower has every feature you can imagine. Buy this baby and you will welcome the next **snow**fall. The blower comes with a heavy-duty battery pack and battery charger. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At only 40 lbs., the Snow Joe 48-volt **snow** blower can shoot **snow** 20 ft. and up to 10″ deep. While the 48volt only provides 18″ of cutting path, this little machine gets the job done fast, and at an incredibly good value. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Snow Joe 324E is the perfect size for clearing **snow** from decks and sidewalks. It has a maximum clearing width of 11 inches wide by 6 inches deep. The two-blade plastic paddle auger might throw fluffy **snow** forward up to 20 feet away. Of course, you have no way of changing the direction of the **snow** throwing, except by actually turning the electric **snow** shovel to the left or to the right. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I live in an area that gets lots of **snow** and don’t particularly enjoy the task of clearing all that **snow**. In fact, I dread it—especially when I owned a maintenance business and was responsible for exponential amounts of **snow** removal. But it was an inevitable reality, so I’ve looked for every possible solution that could help me save time and energy. I relied on my experiences with many **snow** tools while evaluating electric **snow** **shovels**. After consulting reviews from hundreds of users and referring to manufacturer information for product specifications, I recommend the seven models below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Battery: Because these are replacing gas, they’ve gotta be powerful. And a 56V can handle about a six-car driveway covered with up to eight inches of **snow**, but you may not need that much. Even if you have an area larger than one battery can cover, many models have the space to hold dual batteries, and have a few more charging up back at your home base to simply swap out when ready. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Winter is coming. And though it’s hard to imagine being cold and wet right now, this is the time to start thinking about it. Traditional **snow**blowers can be the size of tanks and cost up into the thousands, not to mention they run on gasoline, which is harmful to breathe in and a fire hazard to keep indoors. But these newer models run on lithium batteries or cables, and offer a whole new set of benefits when your driveway and walkway are covered in **snow**. Here’s what to consider when getting one for your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is only one thing worse than shoveling **snow**: shoveling **snow** on a roof while trying not to fall off. It is not, however, advisable to bring an electric **snow** blower up onto the roof. Most manufacturers would probably advise against using their **snow** blowers to remove **snow** from your home’s roof. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As a compact, lightweight shovel, this 40V Ryobi **snow** shovel gives you a break from manual **shovels** and scrapers. It weighs just 16.6 pounds and features a 2-wheel design that reduces fatigue even further and makes maneuverability much easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Power Clear can clear all kinds of **snow**, but it’s best for use on concrete or asphalt. Expect to clear the space equivalent of a 12-parked-car driveway with 2-9 inches of **snow** per charge (and, if you’re tackling a bigger task, keep a backup battery on hand). This powerful machine is built for precision with a locking deflector that lets you aim the shoot exactly where you want to throw the **snow**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Snowblowers are powerful equipment capable of throwing stones or loose gravel up to 50 feet. When using a **snow**blower, never aim the chute toward people, homes, windows, cars, etc., as this could do serious damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In brief, this Greenworks Pro 80V cordless **snow** shovel might be a little bit heavy to handle for some people, because of the large battery and 12-inch auger width. However, this also makes it more powerful than other smaller cordless **snow** **shovels**: as a result, it can throw both dry and wet **snow**. Of course, heavy **snow** will be more challenging to throw, and it will use more battery power (check price on Amazon). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your cutting depth isn’t going to have a restricting influence, so a deeper cut is always going to make your life easier – that’s if you’re going to be using it in deeper **snow**. Usually, an electric **snow** shovel with an auger that cuts deeper into the **snow** will cost more than one with less cutting depth. So this might be a factor when considering affordability. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The RY408120VNM 40V 12-inch **snow** shovel retails as a kit for $269. It includes a 4.0Ah battery and a charger, as well as a 5-year warranty from Ryobi. You can find it at The Home Depot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even though gravel driveways frequently receive **snow**falls, they are difficult to shovel. Shoveling **snow** off the top of a gravel driveway is nearly impossible. If the **snow** is fresh and light, you could brush it away before spreading a deicer like calcium chloride or rock salt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Electric **snow** **shovels** aren’t too expensive and a price difference of $10-$20 can make the difference between buying a good quality machine or something that you’ll regret buying. These are not very technical machines, either, so you won’t usually be getting many extra features if you’re paying more. If you feel that a machine is of a good quality standard and it meets your requirements, there’s no point paying more for a more expensive one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The EGO 56-volt battery is fabulous. But this model uses TWO 56-volt batteries to give you the most electric power of any cordless **snow** blower. This combo kit also comes with 2 batteries and a powerful battery charger. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   7. Price Price is always going to be an important factor to look after and you can’t take it for granted. After all, everyone would want to get the best electric **snow** shovel at an affordable price. But you have to strike a balance between the two and need to find the best electric **snow** shovel that fits into your budget and also provides the best value for your money as well. Don’t forget to compare the electric **snow** **shovels** with its other competitors so you know you are getting the best one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At only 19 lbs., you can easily grab this tool and go after light to medium **snow**fall with its 16” wide x 8” deep clearing path. It runs a powerful 40V battery system capable of run times of up to 30 minutes and can launch **snow** up to 30 feet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s a reason why you see warnings every winter about people having heart attacks and random injuries while shoveling **snow**: It’s really hard work. And, if you’ve been whipping out your trusty **snow** shovel every time the flakes fall, it’s understandable that you’d be wary (not to mention, reluctant) of having to do it again. But your next **snow** day is about to get so much easier when you invest in one of the best electric **snow** blowers on the market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some will be heavier than others and if you’re not up to carrying much weight, a lighter machine will obviously be better. The dimensions are quite important for convenient storage. An electric **snow** blower with a bulky housing around the auger will not be as easy to store as a more compact model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A simple response to the question «do electric **snow** **shovels** work» is yes. The longer version of this answer would be that every product is suitable for different work conditions. For example, the electrical **snow** **shovels** are best suited for areas that receive from light to medium levels of **snow**fall. They are also a better choice if you are looking for a tool to help you efficiently clear ice from pathways and porches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When crossing gravel roads or pedestrian walkways, always bring the auger blade to a complete stop. Look over the area carefully to make sure there are no stones, sticks, cables, bones, or other foreign things before using the electric **snow** shovel. You should stop using the electric **snow** shovel right away if the auger paddle comes into contact with something unexpected. Before starting the power tool again and using it, check the auger blades for damage and make any necessary repairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Backed by this immense power, the shovel will help you comfortably move eighteen inches of ice out of your way. Moreover, it will help you to clear **snow** that has piled up to a height of 7.8 inches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You will love the fact the handle of the tool is adjustable, which means you can bring it to the height that you are comfortable with. Despite being this small, this best rated electric **snow** shovel is powered by a 7.5 amp engine, which gives it the capacity to throw 300 pounds of **snow** within a minute. What happens is that the rotor crushes the collected **snow** and effectively throws the powdered ice for a longer distance as far as twenty feet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you might expect, these capabilities would require more power. GreenWorks 2600502 has not disappointed me in this respect. Its thirteen amperes motor ensures that the shovel can throw a minimum of four hundred pounds of ice within a minute. It is these high capabilities that have led to most Greenworks electric **snow** shovel reviews rating it as almost having the same capabilities as the gas-powered blowers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In conclusion, electrical **snow** **shovels** are an excellent choice for those people who care about the environment. Their strengths outweigh their drawbacks by far. Firstly, they will not consume much of your storage space when not in use. Their lean small size ensures that the **shovels** will consume a minimum garage room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to power equipment, there is so much information you have to learn about it. In certain cases, you will even have to investigate the ways of assembly. Therefore, this section addresses some of the common aspects associated with electrical **shovels**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Speaking of tools, in this article, my aim is to give you an overview of the best electric **snow** shovel. As I write about it, I am already thinking that it would be a good Christmas present for someone living in the area experiencing low to medium amounts of **snow**fall. This tool is not only economical in terms of price and maintenance, but it is also small in size to save on your garage space. This shovel is also light, which makes it easy to push around your porch and pathway. Let’s get straight to analyzing a thing or two about it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In certain cases, you may find yourself with a lot of chores that you have to complete. Therefore, you need to arrange your schedule for clearing the **snow** to be the first thing you do once you wake up or at night when you get home. When shopping for an electric shovel, you should look for the one that comes with headlights as an added feature. They will help you illuminate the surface you are clearing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although the GreenWorks Pro 80V **snow** shovel is very similar to the Snow Joe iON13SS, it costs a little more. I suppose the GreenWorks name comes at a premium. I’m not entirely convinced that you’re actually getting much more for your money. Though if you already have any of the garden tools in the extensive GreenWorks 80V range of products, it would make sense to opt for this **snow** shovel as you’ll be using the same battery. The only thing that makes the GreenWorks Pro 2600602 better is the more comfortable and, possibly more durable, handle design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A “**snow** blower” refers to a two stage **snow** removal machine. The auger scoops up the **snow** (first stage) and feeds it to the impeller which blows the **snow** (second stage) out the chute. It called “blower” because the impeller operates like a very powerful fan that throws **snow** at large distance (up to 50 feet) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The biggest problem with electric **snow** **shovels** is that they do not have wheels. This means that you have to carry and push the **snow** shovel when you clear **snow** from the ground. This is not such a hassle when clearing small areas such as the patio or walking path. However, this becomes an issue with larger areas and might make you almost as tired as if you were using a manual shovel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main reason for getting the 324E instead of the other models is that it has an LED light. Overall, the Snow Joe 324E seems to provide a good balance between price and performance, even though it does not have the power to handle wet **snow**. It is a cheap 11-inch electric **snow** shovel, so do not buy it if you have a large driveway. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Single-Stage Electric Snow Blower Shovel with LED Light Looking for an easy-to-use **snow** blower that won’t break your budget? This Yard Force **snow** blower is here to help. It blazes a path that’s 11 inches wide by six inches deep and weighs just 14 pounds, making it practically effortless to tote up and down stairs. An adjustable auxiliary handle helps you get that just-right grip while the built-in LED light comes in handy for nighttime removals.

-   While a **snow** shovel works on a similar principle to a **snow** blower, in that it uses an auger to lift the **snow** and blast it away, it is a very different machine and fulfills a different purpose. You won’t get nearly the same cutting depth or width from an electric **snow** shovel when compared to a **snow** blower. An electric **snow** shovel is, therefore, not suitable for heavy **snow** and nor is it recommended for large areas. If you’re going to be clearing large volumes of **snow** from your driveway, an electric **snow** shovel is not the best idea and a **snow** blower would be a better option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The RY408130VNM Ryobi **snow** shovel gives you a 12-inch clearing path in **snow** up to 6 inches deep. It has a throwing distance of 25 feet to tackle areas you don’t want a full-size **snow** blower for. There’s also a 2-speed trigger that lets you customize the speed based on your clearing needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Anytime you operate a power tool, use smart safety procedures and protection. Always wear gloves, and wear eye protection to avoid injury from blowing **snow**. Avoid extended time in subzero temperatures, and take breaks to warm up inside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We think the EGO Power 56-Volt Peak Power Two-Battery Snow Blower might be the best cordless electric **snow** blower on the market. This unit has all the power you need to get your **snow** moved. Plus, it has the features you need. And it looks awesome. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The PowerSmart battery-powered **snow** blower clears a 21-inch-wide path through heavy **snow** with ease. The 12.5-inch intake height makes this **snow** blower effective when breaking up moderate-to- heavy **snow** on the sidewalks, walkways and driveways. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **snow** shovel is very similar to the RY408120VNM model, but this one uses a brushed motor. Taking off that HP Brushless designation, you lose about three feet of maximum throwing distance (up to 22 feet). It has the same clearing path of 12 inches in up to 6 inches deep of **snow**, though. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is the highest-performing **snow** shovel in Ryobi’s lineup and the wheels are very helpful in offsetting the tool’s higher weight. With its 4.0Ah battery and brushless motor, you’re going to get longer runtime than 18V or brushed models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Looking for top performance in a cordless **snow** thrower? Then check out the Greenworks 2600402 Pro. This powerful tool will quickly clear a 20-inch-wide path on any driveway, sidewalk, patio or walkway. The rotating chute will throw the **snow** in any direction you choose. The sleek design of this powerful **snow** mover makes it a pleasure to use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this section, I will focus on a sample electric **shovels** worth adding to your shopping list. I will also highlight the strengths and weaknesses associated with each product. My hope is that the information will help you make a better buying decision. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The EGO Power+ is advertised as the only cordless **snow** blower that can compete with gas and packs an impressive 56-volts of **snow** removal potential in its two ARC Lithium batteries, which are designed for use within any EGO product. This purportedly makes it capable of clearing heavy, wet **snow**, rather than just the fluffy downfall that’s all most other electric **snow** blowers can handle. The unit also includes LED lights for easier use in all weather conditions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Greenworks Snow Thrower is a quiet machine that packs a lot of power. It runs with a 13-amp motor and includes dual LED lights for easier use in pre-dawn conditions. Though its small size makes it look unassuming, this **snow** blower can move 850 pounds of **snow** per minute, making it the most efficient model on our list. And at just 30 pounds, it’s maneuverable enough for almost anyone to use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Greenworks cordless electric **snow** blower uses the same 80-volt batteries as the brands’ other outdoor power tools. This blower comes with one battery and a charger. But if you have other battery-powered tools from Greenworks, you can charge up those batteries and use them, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note that its small chute size means heavy **snow** might build up inside, so this **snow** blower tends to work best when the downfall is light and fluffy. If **snow** does start compacting, the included clearing tool lets you break up any obstructions fast. Low light conditions aren’t a concern, as the dual integrated LED headlights will keep things illuminated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of the lithium-ion batteries available on the market give your cordless **snow** shovel a runtime of 20-30 minutes per charge. Products that feature 40V batteries can work longer in comparison with 24V batteries. You can double your run time by investing in a second battery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 80V 2AH lithium-ion battery gives you up to 45-minutes on a charge, very similar to the Snow Joe. This battery does have a really good charge time (30-minutes) that also gives it quite an advantage over many rechargeable batteries. The clearing width is the same as most electric **snow** **shovels**, 12 inches, and the 6-inch cutting depth is also pretty standard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Battery-operated models give you the flexibility to use them anywhere, but they require charging before use, and most last only around an hour. This might lead to problems if you’re unprepared for the first **snow** of the year, or if your driveway requires more than an hour’s worth of attention. Some brands sell spare batteries for their **snow** blowers so you can have a backup on hand, but this will add to your total cost. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best way to clear **snow** from your roof is probably with a **snow** roof rake. This is crucial since heavy **snow**fall may harm a roof significantly, especially when it begins to melt. However, you shouldn’t fling **snow** from the roof using an electric **snow** shovel or a **snow** thrower. Most electric **shovels** that can move a considerable volume of **snow** will be awkward and perhaps hazardous to use on a roof. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The above section has been centered on understanding the different classifications of electrical **shovels**. This may have helped to shed some light on the different categories available. But what are some other specific aspects to look out for when buying this equipment? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Greenworks electric **snow** shovel is one of the familiar brands in this category of farm tools. It is a very good option for those people intending to handle low or medium levels of **snow**fall. The eight amperes motor ensures it achieves a maximum clearance of three hundred pounds of ice in a minute. This **snow** is collected from an area of twelve inches wide and a depth of six inches. Then, the shovel is throwing the collected **snow** to a distance of twenty feet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Greenworks goes above and beyond when it comes to land and garden equipment. This monster of an electric **snow** blower runs on powerful 40V lithium-ion batteries, which nets about 30 to 45 minutes of runtime, clearing a 20-inch path up to 10 inches deep. It’s also surprisingly silent, comparatively, to other brands, thanks to the brushless motor which is also easier to keep in working order. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can rely on this machine to remove **snow** up to ten inches deep in a twelve-inch path. While the company claims it can throw **snow** up to 20-feet, the 13-amp motor is less powerful than most of its rivals and means many people find it throws **snow** about ten feet at best. This makes this model best for smaller yards or relatively narrow driveways. Otherwise, you’ll find yourself blowing the same **snow** around several times. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Electric **snow** **shovels** are much less labor-intensive than a manual **snow** shovel. They do a lot of the work for you but are generally not quite as powerful as a traditional, full-sized **snow**blower. Still, they can save your back after a **snow**storm and help you drastically cut down the time it takes to clear all that powder. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The foldable handle makes this blower easy to store when not in use. Large 10-inch back wheels make it easy to maneuver. The safety design of this cordless **snow** blower can prevent accidental start-ups. And when the blower is running, just release the handlebar grips to quickly stop the spinning auger and impeller. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **snow** blower’s included battery is designed for use within various Toro products like lawnmowers and string trimmers. That’s a win for the environment because it cuts down on single-use items within your garage. Best of all, it’s lightweight enough for most people to handle it on their decks and stairwells. And, without a gas motor, it’s quiet enough to use without the worry of waking your neighbors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, if you’re clearing a long wide driveway, and electric **snow** shovel is going make the experience a frustrating one and it’s going to take a very long time. An electric **snow** shovel isn’t the best at clearing heavy **snow** – you’re limited to a depth of 6”. For larger areas and heavy **snow**, a **snow** blower is the way to go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thanks to its fully electric engine, the Snow Joe iON18SB is Energy-Star Certified as part of the brand’s commitment to environmental sustainability. Just keep in mind that its small size means it offers a relatively limited runtime compared to other electric models, meaning this **snow** blower works best for small to medium-sized driveways and sidewalks. In fact, it might be too lightweight for your needs, as many customer reviews indicated that it didn’t seem capable of handling much more **snow** than they could remove in the same time with a shovel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Toro Power Shovel is for people who want to clear **snow**falls that are less than 6 inches deep from patios, decks, stairs and walkways. It might also work for clearing **snow** from the lawn. It works well for light **snow**, but it does not work so good for wet **snow**. If you get back pain from using a **snow** shovel, then the Toro Power Shovel might be what you need. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

An electric **snow** shovel is carried by the user, similar to how a string trimmer or brush cutter is used. The majority of electric **snow** **shovels** have an adjustable handle to improve comfort while using them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   This cordless Worx **snow** blower is powered by two 20V 4.0Ah batters that can help hurl **snow** up to 20 feet away, cutting a 20-inch wide path that’s 10-inches deep.

-   Electric **snow** **shovels** are available in either corded or cordless models. If you go with a corded model, you will likely have to deal with extension cords.

-   The smallest of the Ryobi cordless **snow** shovel lineup, the P2706BTL has a 10-inch clearing width. It keeps the same clearing depth of up to 6 inches, however. This shovel is also the lightest in the lineup at 12.3 pounds, making it a good option if strength or back pain is a concern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The EGO Power+ boasts an impressive 21-inch clearing width and can throw **snow** up to 35 feet for efficient clearing. It also contains many more steel components than its competitors, and each battery charge will purportedly last long enough to clear a ten-car driveway covered in eight inches of **snow**. However, these robust features don’t come cheap, as you’ll pay over $600 for the machine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most electric **snow** **shovels** clear a path of about 12’ with a depth of about 6”. The width of your path and the depth you’re cutting into the **snow** will determine how fast you can work. Naturally, an electric **snow** shovel with a wider clearance and deeper cut will move more **snow** in a shorter time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The powerful 20-volt electric motor is powerful enough to remove 300 pounds of **snow** every minute.

Its lightweight design makes it possible for virtually anyone to operate. Additional features include an ergonomic handle that’s adjustable for your height and push-button convenience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I wouldn’t worry too much about the amps of the motor when it comes to the actual working of the machine. Depending on the design, a 9A electric motor can sometimes give you better performance than a 12A motor. You want a machine that’s going to move the most **snow** per minute and throw it a reasonable distance from the area that you’re clearing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
