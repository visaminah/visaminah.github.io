## 10 Interesting Facts How To Avoid Brush Marks In Water Based Paint | Paint Brush That Doesn T Leave Brush Marks
-   Sanding Baseboards: (higher grit, better): Whether you are installing baseboard for the first time or re**paint**ing existing baseboard, sand it. Baseboards take a beating and do not always come ready to be **paint**ed. Consider a 180 grit -220 grit sandpaper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Water Based: Water-based, or latex **paint**s, are friendlier to **paint**ers and DIY’ers because they are easier to clean up and usually less expensive.
