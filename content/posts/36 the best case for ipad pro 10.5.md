And if you want to take full advantage of its powerful hardware and use it for more than just scrolling through social media, you should invest in a proper **case** with a built-in keyboard.

So read on if you're on the hunt for the best iPad Pro keyboard **case** options on the market right now. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Apple products usually come at a premium, and that's no different with its iPad **case**s. Apple's **case**s are expensive, but also sleek and functional. The $49 Smart Cover is a thin piece of polyurethane that protects the device's display and connects magnetically to the iPad. It comes in a variety of colors and can be folded into different positions to create a stand for reading, viewing, and drawing. The design is simple and effective, but leaves the back and sides of the iPad unprotected. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   GumDrop Case for iPad Pro 11 is not limited to kids, and tutors can also demonstrate videos and presentations while taking the class for better understanding. And for that, your iPad needs a protective solid **case**, as I’ve seen many **case**s where damage occurs while handling the iPad from one hand to another. So it features a built-in magnetic stand that slides inside its chamber when not in use to keep up the flat surface of the iPad Pro. Finally, with all that stress, the Apple Pencil gets its space beside the **case**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Magic Keyboard lacks protection on the sides of the iPad. (An iPad of ours suffered a crack in the screen when it fell inside the previous generation Magic Keyboard **case**). There are other worthy keyboard **case**s on the market that address this problem, but few are as well-made as the Magic Keyboard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike most of the iPad keyboards on this list, this one comes with a faux leather cover and a felt-like interior that prevents scratches and holds well with accidental drops. All in all, we have a high level of confidence in using this product. And in **case** you need an iPad upgrade, you may want to take a look at some of the best features of the Apple iPad Air 2, which has several significant updates to the original Air. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

It also comes with a convenient trackpad, and the sleek **case** easily turns so you can adjust your iPad for different uses, whether you’re typing, watching videos, or on a Zoom call. In addition to the trackpad, the keyboard features an RGB backlit design with three brightness levels to easily see what you’re typing in the dark. You can even rotate your device and snap it closed to conceal the keyboard while you draw or take notes on the screen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Positive Amazon review: “I think this is one of the best keyboard **case**s for the 4th gen Ipad Pro. The feature that I love is the 360 feature where you can flip the screen and use it as a tablet and then flip back if you want to use it as a laptop. There's also tons of viewing angles that you can do.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not sure what iPad Pro 10.5 **case** with keyboard to pick up? If you follow along below, we’ll show you some of our favorite picks. Let’s dive right in! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are looking for a funky multi-color hybrid protective **case** to wrap up the entire iPad from upside down, Cherrry **case** would be considerable. Indeed, the **case** has a grip aside to hold the device securely, and even if you drop it accidentally, its shockproof three-layer structured material will provide better resistance against bumps and drops. The **case** is colored with Gray and Aqua to give a perfect finish, while there are several more color combinations available. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   IVSO keyboard is not a bad and affordable investment for iPad Pro 10.5 users because it comprises ease like the premium **case**, easy to carry at the office, and many more places. Work freely without worrying about the battery for 60 hours after one full charge, and it takes only 2.5 to 3 hours to charges battery fully. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We picked **case**s and covers compatible with the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Find the best for protecting your shiny new slate among these highly-rated offerings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fintie Case is similar to Cooper Cases that we reviewed in the first position, with minor changes.

-   I like how SUPFIVES has crafted the **case**, call it the protective **case**, bumper **case**, kickstand **case**, or **case** with a hand strap; its ultimate goal is to safeguard the iPad from various damages. So while working out at your home or roaming around the garden, you can use the iPad without worrying about scratches and drops.

Not only that, but the added Bluetooth keyboard makes it a whole lot easier to do things like edit documents, write papers, manage spreadsheets, and a whole lot more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   (Speaking of keyboards, plenty of third-party **case**s with this functionality are reliable and offer a cheaper alternative to Apple’s Magic Keyboard. If you’re shopping for one, I recommend looking for an onboard trackpad and support for the iPad’s Smart Connector. In addition to rock-solid connectivity, the latter will ensure that you never have to worry about recharging another accessory.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unfortunately, none of Apple's own **case**s for iPads are very protective. While they usually cover the screen and the back, they often leave the iPad's edges unprotected. If you want better protection, you'll do better by looking elsewhere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   GreenLaw might not be the most well-known brand for iPad Pro **case**s, but this one still provides you with some excellent protection in **case** of accidental drops. Made out of durable, hardened plastic, this one keeps your investment well protected. It adds minimal bulk but does still keep your iPad Pro well protected. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thanks to this iPad keyboard’s 360° rotating hinge, it allows for multiple viewing angles from laying completely flat to at a 45° incline for tabletop viewing. Closing the **case** also puts the device in sleep mode, saving precious battery life. We also love its durable construction with a rugged polycarbonate shell that can eat the occasional drop like Pacman. This is Amazon’s choice for ‘6th gen iPad keyboard’.

-   Apple's most impressive **case** is the $299 Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro and iPad Air. This keyboard **case** and trackpad combination transforms the iPad into a viable laptop replacement. The **case** uses a clever magnetic design to create a one-piece stand and keyboard that is both thin and highly functional. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, consider if you’d like to use the keyboard with other devices, too.
