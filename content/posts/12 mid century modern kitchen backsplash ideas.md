## 12 Things You Should Know About Mid Century Modern Kitchen Backsplash Ideas | Mid Century Ceramic Tile
-   One of the best **kitchen** **backsplash** ideas is to take the panel all the way up to the ceiling in areas where you don’t have cabinetry. Running the panel from floor to ceiling gives the impression of height and space, especially when you choose reflective tiles. The illusion of space makes this a great choice for those remodeling small **kitchen**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Make sure the **backsplash** design you choose complements your interior decor and the overall style and vibe of your home. If you have an antique **kitchen**, a wood **backsplash** would be a perfect pairing. If your home is modern, go with sleek quartz or Caesar stone. And marble is always a classic in just about any **kitchen**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For over 95 years, BLANCO has served as passionate **kitchen** experts delivering premium products backed by industry-leading German engineering.

-   Mirrored and metallic finishes add glam and personality to any neutral **kitchen**. The reflective surfaces brighten up your space as natural light bounces off metallics and onto your countertops. Add some whimsy by creating your own custom pattern. When you want a modern **kitchen** **backsplash**, metallics deliver a playful yet sleek, eye-catching look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   #1. Go geometric. One of the tenants of mid-century design is the use of geometric patterns. Organic shapes like a leaf mosaic or arabesque tile are more subtle, while hex, triangle and chevron tile arrangements create a more dramatic look. Retro patterned tile is also a beautiful and unique choice sure to enhance your **kitchen**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Contrasting color is one of the simplest and most cost-effective **kitchen** **backsplash** ideas. Rather than defaulting to the neutral **backsplash** colors that most people are used to, experiment with new colors to introduce personal style. You can combine two or more colors and then scatter a third color throughout for interest. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   #5. Create contrast. Finally, to create a cohesive mid-century aesthetic in your **kitchen**, contrast is the way to go. You could pair two contrasting tile colors (such as black and white), use two different tile materials for the floor and **backsplash**, or use a darker grout on light-colored tile. In any case, creating contrast is a simple and classic way to bring life to your **kitchen** design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many modern **kitchen**s are now aiming for a monochromatic look in white, grey, or black, with simple silver hardware. These **kitchen**s look great but also offer the opportunity to liven them up with a bold **kitchen** **backsplash**, like this red and grey stone look. Small accents of color allow you to combine modern stylings with a personal twist that makes your **kitchen** really memorable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wood is timeless and adds a modern organic vibe to your **kitchen**. But it’s expensive and wears more easily. Instead, use laminate materials to create decorative patterns, or combine them with traditional tiled **backsplash**es to accentuate your **kitchen** design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Need to spruce up your space without making a permanent change. Use peel-and-stick wallpaper as your **kitchen** **backsplash** to add flare in any style. Apart from giving you endless design and pattern choices to suit your tastes, washable wallpaper is easy to maintain. Modern wallpaper is also affordable and easily removable, so you can easily change the look of your cooking space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   #3. Consider a straight set design. The mid-century modern movement was characterized by clean lines and simple, uncluttered design. To echo this in your **kitchen** tile, straight-set tile arrangements can be the perfect choice. If you’re using a subway tile or something similar, a straight design gives a neat, modern and surprisingly unique appearance to this **backsplash**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ve seen the clean, minimalistic look of subway tile in all of the top design magazines. It comes in many colors, but the classic tiles are perfect if you’re looking for a white **kitchen** **backsplash** that’s easy to clean. Pair it with black grout, and you’ve achieved one of 2020’s top **kitchen** looks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
