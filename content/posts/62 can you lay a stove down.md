## 62 Reference List: Can You Lay A Stove Down | Can You Lay A Glass Top Stove On Its Back
-   Though propane, butane, or even liquefied petroleum gas can be used to power a **stove**, most gas **stove**s run on natural gas and require a gas line to the house. Depending on where you live, the requirement of a gas line may be a deal-breaker. In most suburbs, the infrastructure is such that gas- and electric-powered **stove**s are equally feasible. In more remote areas, gas lines are not a given. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you put a pot of cold water on an electric **stove**top, it can take a really long time to come to a boil, especially because electric **stove**s heat up so slowly. If you don't have the time to wait for that, pre-boil your water in an electric kettle. It takes a matter of minutes and it's perfect for when you don't want to wait around all night to cook a pot of pasta. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . Have your helpers keep the dolly balanced at all times until the moving vehicle is reached. Go slowly, keep constant verbal communication with each other and devise signals in case a dangerous situation arises. Step 12 . When you reach the moving vehicle, use the loading ramp to get the massive **stove** up and into the back of the truck. Have two people pulling the dolly from the front, and two people pushing from the back. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Extreme temperature differences between hot and cold items can cause damage. In short, placing a very hot lid on cool glass top **stove**s could damage the glass. Be mindful of this as you choose a location to place a hot item on. Keep pot holders or trivets handy whenever you are cooking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 1 . Make sure the wood **stove** moving operation will be as safe as it gets. Make sure the exit route is 100% clear of obstacles, keep small children and pets away from the moving action and wear closed shoes with anti-slip soles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Electric **stove**s do not respond as quickly, particularly when you’re adjusting the temperature down or turning the heat off. Besides that, there are also a few things that an electric **stove** simply cannot do that a gas **stove** can: charring, toasting, and flambéing. If you’re a committed home chef, the superior performance of gas **stove**s may sway you in their favor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the most important parts of the propane camping **stove** is the burner. The burner uses the gas flow from the canister to ignite the burner. The burner establishes a flame which is controlled by the temperature knob. If the burner has any breaks or rust in its shape, it will likely not perform up to proper temperature standards. Most burners can reach temperatures up to 400 degrees F, while some are higher depending on the size of the **stove**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . When you reach the moving vehicle, use the loading ramp to get the massive **stove** up and into the back of the truck. Have two people pulling the dolly from the front, and two people pushing from the back. Step 13. Once in the back of the moving truck, secure the wrapped-up **stove** to the side of the vehicle so that it won’t move during transport. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . You’re going to need at least 3 friends to accomplish that challenging mission – remember that your wood burner is still super heavy, and it’s still excessively bulky too. If there’s no one you can ask for help, then you should do the sensible thing and hire qualified moving labor. A dolly . The right type of moving equipment will really make a difference when relocating a wood **stove** safely. One flat dolly or a platform dolly (both are 4 wheelers) should be enough to get your heavyweight heating appliance moving in the right direction. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "Everybody who has ever owned an electric **stove** has burned themselves on it at least once or twice," Joshua Sauer, executive chef at Avenue Restaurant in New Jersey, tells SELF. It's obvious when a gas **stove** is on because you can see a flame or smell gas, but the same isn't always true for an electric **stove**. Newer models are often equipped to notify you if a burner is still hot, but many older models don't provide any clear indications. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No matter where you live, chances are there’s electricity. And so long as your home has electricity, you can operate an electric **stove**. It simply needs to be plugged in. Note, however, that most electric **stove**s do require a 240-volt power outlet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Explore Whirlpool® refrigerators to find out what type of features are available to best match your home’s **lay**out and your family’s needs. Or let Whirlpool brand guide you to the right fridge for your family. Refrigerators are heavy and moving is stressful, so you may want to weigh all your options when deciding if moving a refrigerator is worth it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Instead of letting the old-school electric **stove** in my new place get me down, I decided to figure out how to make it work for me. With a bit of creativity (and a lot of desperation) I managed to develop a series of tricks that enable me to cook with it as well as I would on a gas **stove**. If you have an electric **stove**, these are the things I think are worth keeping in mind, both according to experts and also from from my own experiences. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The lowest cost ventless gas **stove** with installation costs about $2,000. A high-cost installation for a premium model vented gas **stove** with installation is around $3,600. Average costs are around $2,800. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How you position a fridge while transporting it from one place to another, matters. And keep in mind that some refrigerators cannot be carried while **lay**ing down on their sides. So check appropriately before progressing with your plan to **lay** your fridge by its side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Place the **stove** on a firm, level and nonflammable surface, away from brush or overhangs. Keep the propane tank upright. If you hear or smell a propane leak, quickly turn off the **stove**, immediately exit the area and call the fire department for assistance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Taking care of your glass top **stove** seems easy at first glance; however, you begin to realize how complicated the process is. While it’s possible to reverse most effects resulting from damages, preventative measures can help you avoid the damages in the first place. Here is a list of some things you shouldn’t put on your glass top **stove**. They include: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You also risk gas leaks if not properly hooked up to a gas line or a knob turns enough to release gas without igniting. To be on the safe side, any home with a gas **stove** should have a carbon monoxide detector. And all households, regardless of whether they have gas or electric **stove**s, should be vigilant to make sure that knobs are always turned Off when the appliance is not in use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Start with a couple of bigger logs as a base, and make sure there’s room between them for the kindling stack you are about to make on top of them. You needn’t totally clear the ash from the **stove** every day, a bed of ash forms a nice insulating **lay**er to build the fire on. You can always poke a few holes through to the grate (if you have one) so that the fire gets some initial air from underneath to get it going well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . Make sure the wood **stove** moving operation will be as safe as it gets. Make sure the exit route is 100% clear of obstacles, keep small children and pets away from the moving action and wear closed shoes with anti-slip soles. Step 2 . Remove the wood **stove** pipe carefully by either following the instruction manual or using your common sense. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . Depending on the actual weight of the unit, the four of you may be able to lift the wood burner and place it gently onto the nearest plywood sheet. Have two people at each side and lift the heavyweight item using the proper lifting techniques. Step 6 . If the log burner is too heavy, then you must use the flat dolly to do it. Slide the 4-wheeler under the **stove** while having your helpers hold onto it, then place the unit gently onto the ground. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Placing dirty cooking utensils directly onto your glass top **stove** could result in additional damage. You should use spoon/utensil rests as you would on a gas **stove**. This helps prevent damage to the glass, and it will be easier to clean later. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vented gas **stove**s are considerably more expensive than ventless models. The lowest cost vented models are around the same price as the most expensive ventless units. Prices for vented gas **stove**s start around $2,000 and go up to $4,200, with most in the $2,200 to $2,600 area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . Tie one length of rope onto one of the front legs of the heating appliance, and the other onto the second front leg. Have two people pull each rope piece while the rest of you push the heavy object from behind. Step 8. Thanks to the low friction factor of the plywood, the super-heavy wood-burning **stove** should slide fairly easily towards its new location. Once you reach the right spot, position slowly your cherished possession, adjust it and then re-connect the chimney pipe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . Wrap the wood burner in thick moving blankets and fix the protective covers in place using some packing tape. Step 10 . Load carefully the **stove** onto the moving dolly using all the manpower you’ve got. Use the rope as moving straps and secure well the heavy item to the wheeled assistant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Eventually the larger logs will have burnt down to embers and now is the time to refuel. Open up the air controls again so that the new logs catch fire quickly. Open the door of the **stove** slowly to let the chimney adjust to the much higher flow rate add your logs and close the door. Once they have caught fire well then you can adjust the controls back down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Popular on camping trips, aboard boats, in cooking demos and buffet restaurants, portable burner butane **stove**s are useful but can also be dangerous. Flaws in design can cause fires and even explosions of these devices. Additional dangers include sudden pressure releases, overheating, and gas leakage. Safety requires intelligent and careful use of these portable **stove** and burner products. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Alternatively, you can take a look at an interesting method of moving a wood **stove** using only one person (you), a couple of car jacks, and an old sturdy skateboard. We cannot guarantee the success or safety of that wood **stove** moving method – you will have to decide whether it might work in your case or not. Click here to watch the 2:25 minute YouTube clip. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now use a medium sized bit of wood next and then **lay** the kindling on top. Lay the kindling a bit like ‘pick up sticks‘ so that they’re touching, but with good air gaps between them. Softwood makes great kindling, as do some of the lighter hardwoods like ash. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . A few sheets of thick plywood should facilitate the moving process and protect your flooring at the same time. A screwdriver . Have an ordinary flat-head screwdriver ready to remove the wood **stove** door. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s important to note that glass top **stove**s have a weight limit. Keep this in mind if you consider using the surface as additional counter space. You should not only avoid putting heavy objects on the surface, but no objects should ever be stored on the surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . If the log burner is too heavy, then you must use the flat dolly to do it. Slide the 4-wheeler under the **stove** while having your helpers hold onto it, then place the unit gently onto the ground. Step 7 . Tie one length of rope onto one of the front legs of the heating appliance, and the other onto the second front leg. Have two people pull each rope piece while the rest of you push the heavy object from behind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lighting the **stove** should always be done using the **stove**’s igniter–a safe method because the spark is isolated inside of the **stove**. The metal **stove** resists fire and backlash from a small gas explosion, should one occur. Making sure that fingers, arms, face and other body parts are away from the **stove** during the ignition process will reduce the risks of burns and serious injury. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your current **stove** is scorching your sauces, burning the bacon, and ruining the roast, it might be time for a replacement. We put the two types side by side—gas vs. electric **stove**s—to understand the key differences and decide what’s right for your household. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The second thing that makes wood-burning **stove**s so hard to move around is their dimensions – some models reach 36’’- 40’’in height, 29’’- 33’’ in width, and up to 25’’ in depth. It’s the outstanding combination of bulkiness + weight that makes moving a wood **stove** such a challenging relocation task. Keep in mind that one wrong move or one single tipping accident can cause substantial damage to the floor or the walls of your home, or worse – it can lead to a serious personal injury. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first step in propane **stove** safety is to get yourself and the flammable propane where you’re going. U.S. Department of Transportation and industry safety standards require propane cylinders to be transported upright, in a well-ventilated area of the vehicle. Upright storage allows the safety valve to release propane gas in the event that tank pressure becomes too high, instead of leaking propane in denser liquid form. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the more delicate parts of an oven is the door, particularly doors with a glass window. If the door has a glass window, protect it inside and out with a **lay**er of polystyrene. If there are any other panels or opening that could become open, make sure they are also secured shut. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   About 20 to 30 minutes before you plan to begin cooking, use a 350 degree Fahrenheit oven to bring it up to temp, and take it out (with oven mitts!) when you're ready to begin. According to Craig Rispoli, executive chef at Fresh & Co., it can be hard to maintain a high heat on an electric **stove**, and doing this little extra step will guarantee your food cooks more evenly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Check the connection between the **stove** and propane tank for leaks several times a season. Do this by putting a soapy water solution at the joint between the tank and hose. If bubbles pop up, there’s a poor fit or other problem causing a propane leak, which can lead to a fire. If the **stove** fails to light after one or two attempts with its internal lighter, turn off the burners and close the propane valve. Wait one minute for any propane in the **stove** to dissipate and try again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While it might be cheaper to operate a gas **stove** for your needs, you waste more energy with gas. Seventy-four percent of the energy produced on an electric range is transferred to food, compared to about 40 percent on a gas range. (Still, it’s not the most energy-efficient **stove** out there. Though a study published in the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy’s Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings found induction cooktops to be an even better option, with up to 90 percent of the energy transferred to food.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Refrigerators p**lay** a big part in our day-to-day routines. If you’re moving homes, consider starting fresh in your new place. Upgrading can help you take advantage of the latest features or pick the ideal size, style and finish for your new kitchen. Will you need more storage space for your new chapter? Maybe your family can benefit from new fingerprint resistant technology or a convenient French door **lay**out. Plus, leaving behind your old fridge could help add resale value to the home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . Remove the wood **stove** pipe carefully by either following the instruction manual or using your common sense. Step 3. Use the screwdriver to remove its door, griddle, and any other removal part to reduce the load. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A few minutes later and the kindling should be burning well. You’ll see that those air gaps that you left between the kindling let the flames wash over the pieces of wood easily, helping the fire to spread. The other advantage of the upside-down technique is that it quickly heats the chimney up, which makes it draw better, which in turn will make your **stove** burn better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even propane **stove**s that seem to be in good condition can produce CO gas. Carbon monoxide can build up quickly without being detected because it has no color, taste or odor, but it can be deadly to people who inhale it. This is why portable propane **stove**s must be used only outdoors and in well-ventilated locations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . Get 2 lengths of strong rope, approximately 6 feet long each. Moving blankets . Despite its sturdiness, your wood-burning **stove** still needs to be protected – more for the sake of your property and your own safety than anything else. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . Despite its sturdiness, your wood-burning **stove** still needs to be protected – more for the sake of your property and your own safety than anything else. Sheets of plywood . A few sheets of thick plywood should facilitate the moving process and protect your flooring at the same time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ventless gas **stove**s efficiently combust gases, producing very little carbon monoxide. Many models have a 99.9% efficiency rating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . Have an ordinary flat-head screwdriver ready to remove the wood **stove** door. A hammer . Just in case. Don’t worry, you’ll only use it for minor adjustments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You also need a well functioning chimney which serves as the “engine” that drives your **stove**. If your chimney is not drawing/sucking well, or is drawing too much then it will be hard to burn efficiently. We can help advise you as to how to fix chimney problems. Also if your **stove** is not in tip top condition then do not despair, we have a dedicated Stove Spares team - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . The right type of moving equipment will really make a difference when relocating a wood **stove** safely. One flat dolly or a platform dolly (both are 4 wheelers) should be enough to get your heavyweight heating appliance moving in the right direction. Rope . Get 2 lengths of strong rope, approximately 6 feet long each. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It would be best to be extremely cautious when using heavy cookware (including those made from cast iron or ceramic) with your glass top **stove**. More importantly, it would help if you didn’t place them on the **stove**top when you aren’t using them. While cooking with them, don’t slide them on the glass surface and be careful when lifting and placing them back down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Operating costs, however, are often different enough to be a deciding factor for many. It’s difficult to make blanket statements here, because utility rates change from state to state. But in most states, natural gas costs less than electricity, and where that’s the case, a gas **stove** typically costs 10 to 30 percent less to operate on an ongoing basis. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you're cooking, you'll often find that you need to move something quickly from a high heat to a low heat, like when you're making a pot of **stove**top rice or trying not to burn homemade caramel. It's harder to do that on an electric **stove** because the burners take longer to cool down. Instead, I keep two burners on at once, one at a lower temp and one at a higher temp. Bev Weidner, host of Food Network's Pressure Point, has had similar success with this method, telling me that it can definitely make things easier, especially when you need to seamlessly move between high and low heats. Just be triple sure to turn off all your burners when you're finished! With these tricks in your back pocket, no one will know have any idea how clunky your **stove** is. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gas **stove**s help lower energy bills by providing directed heating with natural gas or propane. While these **stove**s do have open flames, the flame burns cleanly and efficiently. With many communities banning or limiting the use of wood **stove**s, a gas **stove** can be an excellent alternative. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All in all, when shopping for a new **stove** and choosing between gas and electric, choose what you’re most comfortable using. If you have reservations about natural gas or are nervous about cooking on an open flame, opt for an electric **stove**. On the other hand, if you’re budget-minded or a budding chef, gas may be best. For small spaces, a mini wood-burning **stove** is another option. The choice, of course, is ultimately yours. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While cleaning **stove**s with electric coils is comparable enough to cleaning those gas options with burners and grates, there’s another newer electric option that surpasses all as easy-care: a smooth glass or ceramic cooktop. When cooled, these smooth **stove**tops clean up with just the wipe of a damp rag and dish soap. And, on a bad day, a caked-on mess would still only take only the minimal abrasion that baking soda to scrub off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . Load carefully the **stove** onto the moving dolly using all the manpower you’ve got. Use the rope as moving straps and secure well the heavy item to the wheeled assistant. Step 11 . Have your helpers keep the dolly balanced at all times until the moving vehicle is reached. Go slowly, keep constant verbal communication with each other and devise signals in case a dangerous situation arises. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Though covered with metal grates, the burners on a gas **stove** use an adjustable open flame. Wherever there’s an open flame, there’s a chance of a flammable item (like a rogue paper towel or dishcloth) getting too close and catching fire. Sure, electric **stove**s do not eliminate risks of burns or fires, but they are generally considered safer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It can take a long time for a burner to properly heat up—in my experience, up to 15 minutes! That's why you should preheat your burners while you're prepping your food. Have onions to chop? Turn your burner on first, then get to work. By the time you're prepped and ready to go, your **stove**top should be too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wood-burning **stove**s prove to be superb sources of renewable heat during the cold days and months of the year. As an added bonus, the majority of wood **stove**s are pretty charming and they do tend to radiate a sense of comfort and coziness throughout a home when they are burning. The mere thought of controlling the destructive power of a wildfire and repurposing that mighty force to heat your house can be genuinely appealing and pleasing, don’t you think? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cooking on an electric **stove** isn't easy, but that's not something I learned until I moved to Berlin. Before then, I'd been blessed with frequent access to gas **stove**tops, which use live fire to heat evenly and quickly so you can cook efficiently. Electric **stove**s, on the other hand, can be pretty clunky. Their burners are slow to heat up and cool down, which can be especially difficult whenever you need to quickly change the heat to prevent something from burning. Obviously there are high-tech versions that buck the trend, but Berlin apartments in my price range aren't exactly equipped with state-of-the-art technology. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Much of the cost of installing a gas **stove** is devoted to running the gas line to the unit. Expect to pay about $15 to $25 per linear foot to run a gas line. Plumbers’ hourly charges range from $75 to $100 per hour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
