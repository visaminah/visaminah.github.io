## 16 Tips to Stone Care International Granite Sealer And Protector - 24 Ounce - For Stone Countertop | Sci Stone Sealer
-   Granite is an investment. It’s costly, and, in fact, it may be the most expensive feature in the kitchen or bathroom. But when the longevity of natural stone and the extra value it adds to the home are taken into account, the cost may justify the purchase. A properly maintained **granite** surface can last up to 100 years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A plethora of **granite** care products are available in today’s market. Many of those products serve the same purpose, but they do so with different methods. The three most popular sealants are penetrating, enhancing, and topical **sealer**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are looking for an effective **granite** **sealer** for your countertops or other parts of your home, look no further than the TriNova **sealer** & protector. This effective formula has a water-based formula that is easy to apply and cures in just an hour. Alternatively, the Black Diamond spray is a budget-friendly option that is environmentally friendly and comes with enough quantity to last through multiple applications. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Penetrating, or impregnating, **sealer**s protect **granite** surfaces by plugging the porous surface with resins. Solvent- and water-based penetrating **sealer**s are available, both of which help the resins soak into the pores. Once the water or solvent dries, it leaves the resins behind to protect the surface from stains. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To get the most value out of such a large purchase, take care of your **granite**. Regularly sealing the porous surface to protect it from penetrating liquids, foods, and stains can help keep **granite** looking its best for its whole life. Read this guide for assistance in choosing the best **granite** **sealer** for your stone surfaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Topical **sealer**s create a layer of protection on the outermost layer of the stone. They create a shiny, glossy finish, and they protect the surface from scratches, dull spots, and other undesirable marks. They work well on flooring, mantels, and other rougher stone surfaces. The rugged texture of these materials gives these types of **sealer**s a “tooth” onto which they can grip to create long-lasting protection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If it’s a solvent-based **sealer**, pay attention to the directions on the bottle. Many manufacturers suggest using these chemicals in a well-ventilated room, which can pose a challenge during colder months. However, once the solvent dissipates, which is rather quickly, the surfaces are safe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Experts vary in their recommendations as to how often to seal **granite**, but most say it should be sealed every 3 months to once a year. In high-traffic areas, 3 months might be a good goal, while every 6 months may be enough for other places. Many of the best **sealer**s can last several years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The chemicals in **granite** **sealer**s are no more dangerous than those in most popular household cleaners. Sealers need to cure to be effective. It may take a day or two for some **sealer**s, but once cured, they’re completely safe to touch, prep food, and anything else you might do on a **granite** surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Granite is a big investment, so homeowners want to keep it in tip-top shape. That means keeping it clean and regularly maintaining it with a **sealer**. Not only should **granite** be sealed, but it also must be cleaned. A wide variety of products are available for cleaning **granite** surfaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While searching for the best **granite** **sealer**s available, the most popular types among users were the penetrative, enhancing, and topical **granite** **sealer**s in spray, wax, or liquid form. These top picks come with enough quantity for multiple uses, many ranging from 18 ounces to 1 whole gallon. While some of these picks are made with chemical compounds, some picks are natural, water-based, and/or biodegradable making them safe for use near food, children, or pets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Experts disagree as to how often **granite** should be sealed. A good rule of thumb is to test the surface every 3 to 6 months to determine if it needs sealing. To test it, simply drip a bit of water onto the **granite** and wait half an hour. If a damp ring appears around the puddle, you should seal the **granite**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Considering how to apply the **granite** **sealer** is a major factor in choosing the best **granite** **sealer**. While a spray bottle might work well for a countertop, an aerosol probably works better on a large floor or shower. Also, some **sealer**s need to sit on the surface longer than others to soak into the stone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   , whether in a spray bottle or jug, have the best chance of penetrating into the **granite**, enhancing and protecting the **granite** from within. These sprays also come in aerosol cans, allowing fast coverage. Polishing compounds, which are usually thicker, take a bit of elbow grease to apply. Much like waxing the surface of a car, the compound must be worked into the surface of the stone to ensure even protection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Older **granite** surfaces may need an enhancing **sealer**. They enrich the look of the countertop by soaking deeply into the surface to create a shiny, wet look. They often can reinvigorate older, dull surfaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Topical **sealer**s aren’t always ideal for countertops. Some don’t apply particularly well to smooth surfaces, and they can also block moisture from escaping the stone, causing cracks when the moisture tries to escape. Use a product meant specifically for countertops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
