## 106 Things You Should Know About How Do You Make Resin Clear After Sanding | How To Finish Epoxy Resin
-   Check the progress of the **sanding** process again and again by removing the **sanding** residues with a cloth. The epoxy **resin** surface should always be cleaned, especially when changing to finer grain size. Otherwise, there is a risk that the coarser, detached grains of sand will leave grinding marks again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We always suggest wet **sanding** **resin** for which you will need waterproof sandpaper. Waterproof sandpaper is made from silicon carbide and it is available in all the necessary grit sizes. The smallest grains can cause deep grooves in your epoxy, so we suggest starting with at least 120 grit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In some cases, your work-piece may already have largely smooth surfaces after casting. This is a huge benefit when using silicone molds in particular. In such a case, you can shorten the **sanding** process easily and sometimes you only need to use a relatively fine grain of **sanding** paper for wet **sanding**. Sometimes you can even dispense with wet **sanding** altogether and continue your work directly with the epoxy **resin** polish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use 0000 steel wool and rub in a circular motion. Allow at least 36 hours cure (brand dependant) before rubbing the coating, or it may scratch or mar rather then resulting in a satin finish. A good spray finish to put over this, is Liquitex Soluvar Spray Varnish for the satin finish. Some spray varnishes can react with cured **resin**, but this one has been used by numerous **resin** artists successfully. If your painting is going to be hung in a spot where light over high gloss is an issue, or someone prefers non high gloss finish, this is a possible alternative solution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   According to some of the best casting epoxy artists, when **resin** is polish sanded, it has such a different feel to it then unpolished **resin**. It feels like glass and looks amazing. They swear it is worth the extra effort. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note: Putting a wax or polishing compound on unsanded **resin** doesn't really accomplish much, you have to get the finish to a minimum 3000 grit polished **sanding**. It's worth the work. You just lightly sand it with each grit. And you don't need to spend hours on it with each stage, just enough so that the higher grit removes the scratches from the previous grit. Once you're done **sanding** the **resin** will pretty much be back to shiny again, then the polish will gloss it up beautifully. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Working in **resin** lets us create beautiful pieces of artwork. With **resin** work, we can create pieces for our own pleasure, or this can be the basis of a small business based on our art skills. Creating something beautiful can be immensely rewarding, either to give as a gift or as the foundation of a successful enterprise. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What is wet **sanding**? Well, it’s pretty much exactly what it sounds like. It involves using water and **sanding** paper graded for use on wet surfaces to prepare your **resin** workpieces. All that you need to do is ensure that your workpiece or sandpaper is wet and ensure that you follow the same process we mentioned previously. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For polishing larger epoxy **resin** surfaces, such as sealed floor surfaces or extravagantly designed tabletops, you should use a suitable polishing machine if possible. The difference between a drill and a polishing machine is easy to explain (apart from the possibility of controlling the rotational speed): While the drilling machine rotates only rigidly around an axis, the polishing attachment on a polishing machine moves in elliptical or eccentric movements. This has a positive effect on the result of the polishing process. Especially as a beginner, you can achieve particularly brilliant results when polishing epoxy with a polishing machine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many **resin** craftsman, say they will not leave dribbles down the sides, or attempt to spray coat with cloudy varnish. Sanding, cutting then polishing is considered the professional finish, by many. Yes, it is a ton of work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While we typically do not recommend it, you absolutely can dry sand **resin**, and there are a few instances where it is your best option. When you are working with a combination of epoxy and wood, wet **sanding** can cause the wood to swell which is not ideal. On the whole, it is not recommended to dry sand. The heat caused by dry **sanding** with an orbital sander can actually dissolve the epoxy **resin**. The dissolved **resin** will become matt, and it will take a great deal of effort to restore the luster. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You want to make sure that you have a smooth, clean surface to work with when polishing. You can do this by working your way through various grits of sandpaper: the lower the grit, the deeper the scratches on the surface. So, if you’re trying to remove a bug, or level out the surface then you are going to want to start with a lower grit and slowly work your way up, until the surface is smooth. If your surface is relatively ready and free of imperfections than you are more likely going to start with a higher grit sandpaper since the surface needs less work. Again, check out our **sanding** tips prior to polishing so that you’re ready to take on the polishing process! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   - sand with 800 Abranet. Abranet is a dust-free **sanding** material. On a random orbital, on high speed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No, **sanding** epoxy does not make it dull. Epoxy is a very durable material and can withstand a lot of wear and tear. However, if you do sand it, it will create a smooth, matte finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re wondering if epoxy **resin** can be polished the answer is yes. Epoxy **resin** resembles glass once it has had a chance to cure completely. Like glass, with the right polish and the right tools, you can be epoxy **resin** practically reflective given enough time and effort. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The dust produced when **sanding** **resin** can cause serious health problems if inhaled. The small **resin** particles are carcinogenic and can damage your lungs, so it is always recommended that you wear some sort of mask when you sand epoxy. Wet **sanding** can also help reduce the amount of dust that is produced and set airborne as you sand epoxy **resin**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sanding, Buffing and Polishing, is not always necessary. Sometimes a dome coat or a flood coat of clear **resin** is all that is needed (and can sometimes be the easiest). In some cases a flood coat vs wet **sanding** and oil/polish is a matter of preference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use a paper towel to dry your workpiece frequently during wet **sanding**. Dry **sanding** can produce heat. So, make sure you take breaks in between to ensure that high temperature doesn’t cause the **resin** to melt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After you coat or cast and demold your epoxy, you might realize your project has a flaw—a scratch, a hair, a bump, or an uneven coat are all common mishaps that can occur. To fix these flaws, **sanding** is highly recommended. If you haven’t already, make sure to remove any of these imperfections before moving on to the buffing process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a matte finish, you simply sand the surface with 3,000-grit sandpaper. Most oil-based finishes should adhere to the epoxy or at least form a film overtop, which can clear it out after **sanding**. The optimal grit for most finishes is 320 or higher. Proven brands like Osmo, Rubio, and Odie’s oils/waxes have been used with great success by many customers. This will help to resist moisture while retaining a natural matte look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   - If your piece has wood, and you're trying to keep the wood dry (which you don't have to), or keep the wood from too fine **sanding**, tape it off. That way, a little water under the tape isn't a concern, but you can sand the epoxy to a really fine grit, and keep the wood closer to 320-400 for a finishing product. You can always dry the wood quickly after **sanding** with a blowdryer or heat gun on low (and keep it moving). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Well, there are actually a few possible reasons as to why your cured **resin** might be cloudy. It could be that you didn’t mix your **resin** properly, or that your curing environment was too humid. Another possibility is that you used old **resin** that had started to degrade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sanding of epoxy **resin** creates the perfect finished look for your **resin** craft. Without this step, you can not achieve the shiny and glassy look typical of **resin** materials. So, if you want that, you shouldn’t skip **resin** **sanding** (no matter how much you dislike doing it). Having read through this article, you must have been aware of what **sanding** is and how it is done. All that’s left is for you to choose the method which suits you best and start **sanding**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We always recommend that you sand epoxy **resin** wet with waterproof sandpaper. Wet **sanding** is by far the best way to remove any uneven areas and it reduces the clogging of your sandpaper by the **resin** dust particles. As we have said already, wet **sanding** can also be the safer option, as the water prevents too many of the epoxy dust particles from becoming airborne. As the water gathers the dust particles, you are able to see the effects of your **sanding** more clearly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you’re prepping to polish, you’ve got to sand down your surface. You can choose either wet **sanding** or buffing to achieve this. With wet **sanding**, you’re carefully **sanding** from coarse grit to grit, going from 120 to 1000 in circular movements, either by hand or with an orbital sander. When getting up to the highest grit, you may find your epoxy is polished enough to your likening. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you’re satisfied with the job you’ve done, use a microfiber cloth to remove any excess polishing compound from the surface of your workpiece. Once the excess has been removed, give the workpiece a thorough once over with the microfiber cloth again. This repetition is the key to how to make **resin** shiny without the use of a Dremel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Make sure that you only use colorless polishing paste to avoid any coloring effects on your piece. Further, make sure that after every application you use a separate clean cloth to wash off the polishing paste. Until removed, polishing paste can give an epoxy **resin** object a matte appearance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to regularly polish larger areas of epoxy, then the purchase of a polishing machine specially designed for this purpose will certainly pay off. With such a machine you can use different polishing sponges for polishing the **resin**. Also, the speed of the polishing machine can be adjusted in such a way that an optimal polishing result is possible. With a reduced number of revolutions, you make sure that the surface of your work-piece does not get too hot due to the frictional heat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To prepare the surface for a subsequent epoxy coating or painting work, wipe the dry surface with a paper towel to remove any remaining deposits, then gently sweep the surface with a broom. Do not use rags – they could contaminate the surface. If you want to paint the surface immediately after **sanding**, use an electrostatic dust cloth afterward. This will remove any dust particles that may still be present, which would worsen the result when painting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to **sanding** blocks, you really cannot do better than this warner hand sander. The 12cm long block fits perfectly in your hand and allows you to easily sand flat surfaces as well as corners and curves. The dimpled rubber surface helps you to smooth out small surface imperfections. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When **sanding**, you start with a coarse 120 grit and work your way carefully in circular movements to a fine 3000 grit. You can do the wet **sanding** by hand without any mechanical assistance. Alternatively, you can also use a random orbital sander. When you have finished wet **sanding**, the surfaces of your epoxy **resin** work-piece should be even and smooth. After that, however, the actual epoxy polishing will only begin. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If only smaller objects or shapes made of **resin** are to be polished, it is sufficient to use an ordinary power drill with a polishing attachment suitable for this purpose. Usually, you can choose between polishing discs and polishing sponges in different sizes in the corresponding assortment. With a small polishing ball head, you can even polish very small workpieces mechanically. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you’re working with wood, plastic, metal, or epoxy **resin**, preparing your surface is one of the most important steps in the polishing process. While the processes used to prepare these surfaces are different, they’re essential to a good-looking finish. How do you prepare a **resin** workpiece for polishing though? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dry **sanding** produces a lot of **resin** dust which creates an unhealthy work environment. On the other hand, during wet **sanding**, the dust produced gets mixed with water and doesn’t become airborne. This, however, can be a bit messy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   One way is to use a clear epoxy **resin** topcoat. This will provide a clear, protective layer that will make the **resin** less susceptible to staining and smudging. Another way is to use a clear epoxy **resin** primer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This set of sandpaper sheets has everything that you need for any kind of **sanding** project. The sandpaper is made of waterproof silicon carbide and the electrocoating ensures that the grit is homogeneously distributed. You can easily use this sandpaper for wet and dry **sanding** projects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One way is to use a polishing compound. This will help to smooth out the **resin** and make it shiny. Another way is to use a clear coat. This will help to protect the **resin** and make it shiny. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dremel tool makes use of rotatory motion to even out **resin** surfaces. It can also be used to carry out epoxy **resin** **sanding**. But as with all other electric tools for **sanding**, you have to be careful when **sanding** with Dremel tools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wet **sanding** **resin** would be significantly more difficult if you were to use traditional sandpaper. Normal sandpaper would become soggy and fall apart with extended exposure to water. As such, if you are going to wet sand epoxy, we suggest using waterproof sandpaper. Waterproof sandpaper is made from a closed layer of silicon carbide that resists the effects of water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you’ve settled on which **sanding** method you’d like to go with, pick a grit anywhere between 120 to 1000 and start **sanding**. One of the best ways to go about **sanding** **resin** is by working in a circular motion, this will ensure that no lines or accidental recesses are created during the **sanding** process. Once you’re happy with your **sanding** job, ensure that your surface is flat before moving on to the next step in the process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Resin polish is usually a clear liquid or paste that is used after **sanding**. Any product that can be used for wood polishing also works great on **resin**. Various kinds of automobile polish also work very well with **resin**. You should experiment with test castings and determine what works well on the type of **resin** that you like to use in your castings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can purchase waterproof sandpaper for **sanding** **resin** in grit sizes that range from 60 to 1000. When it comes to **sanding** epoxy, we suggest using a grit size of 120, as this will prevent the formation of deep scratches on your **resin** surface. For polishing purposes, we recommend using a grit size of 1000 to create a beautifully smooth and shining surface. Here are a couple of our top suggestions for waterproof sandpaper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Buffing on the other hand, acts as more of a filler than a remover like **sanding**. While buffing you are using a compound to essentially fill in the scratches previously made on the surface of your project. You work in the compound with a variable speed polisher, slowly working the material into the surface. You can do one, you can do the other, or you can do both—either way, skipping this step isn’t going to give you the glass-like finish your project deserves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When choosing a suitable polishing compound, you may be spoilt for choice given the wide range of different products on the market. The number of different product variants reflects the multitude of possible areas of application. However, there are also polishing pastes with very different coarse or fine polishing grains. In most cases, the simple rule of thumb applies: With polishing pastes for use on wooden surfaces, you can also make epoxy **resin** shine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   During curing, especially at fluctuating temperatures, a slightly sticky, waxy layer may form on the surface. Its appearance changes depending on the moisture content of the air, but it is usually more noticeable in cool, humid conditions. It may be difficult to see at all, or it may appear as a thin, greasy, or dull layer. However, this so-called amine redness can be removed and underneath it, the epoxy **resin** should be intact. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can shape your pieces on a 320 grit disc sander, then 400 grit dry (wear PPE designed for dust particulates). From there it's all wet **sanding** 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1500, 2000, etc. up to 3000 (some kits go up to 10,000+grit). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once all the **sanding** marks are gone, now is the time for you to apply a new **resin** layer. This will give your **resin** a shiny and glassy finish. You can also use wax for this purpose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When polishing by machine, follow the same general steps using a circular on and off motion. However, you should still be careful to use machine polishing only with **resin** pieces that have cured to a high level of hardness. Soft cured **resin** objects can warp due to heat or even breaking. A combination of machine polishing and hand polishing can be used for **resin** objects that have many curves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Typically, wet **sanding** should always be done by hand. The combination of water and an electrical sander is a recipe for a horrible shock. There are a few different methods that you can use to wet your **resin** while **sanding**, and we will cover all of these in a little more detail. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your **resin** is cloudy, there are a few steps you can take to clear it up. First, make sure that your **resin** is properly mixed. If you see any lumps or clumps in the **resin**, mix it again until it is smooth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   - then use the 1200 - 1500 - 3000 Trizact clear coat **sanding** disc abrasives. Wet on the same random orbital. Only water, no soap needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After your **resin** embedment or piece of jewellery has fully cured you can apply numerous finishing techniques to finish the **resin** jewellery and refine the appearance of the article. It can be drilled, sanded or polished. As always when the possibility exists of inhaling **resin** dust while buffing **resin**s, wear a dust mask. Hand Sanding and Polishing - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to wetting your **resin** for **sanding**, you have a couple of different options. You can use whichever method works best for you. One of the most popular methods simply involves dipping your sandpaper block into a bucket of water every now and then to keep it wet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When preparing a **resin** for good polishing you need to ensure that it has been sanded. Why do you need to sand **resin** before you polish it? Well, **sanding** ensures that the surface of your workpiece is level and that any dust has been removed from the surface you’ll be polishing. It also works to ensure that your polish adheres to the surface of your workpiece correctly and won’t be contaminated by any debris sitting on the surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Epoxy **resin** has two components; a hardener and liquid **resin**. When combined, the chemicals in the two components react, creating a very hard solid surface. The hardness of this **resin** surface can quickly dull and clog abrasive sandpaper. You will need to replace your sandpaper relatively frequently, in order to keep the **sanding** process effective. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When working with casting **resin** that is greatly affected by high temperatures, you should definitely go for wet **sanding** (dry **sanding** is a big NO in this case). This is because dry **sanding** produces a lot of heat which can cause the **resin** to melt. Wet **sanding** makes use of water as a lubricant which makes it less abrasive. This property of wet **sanding** greatly adds to the final finish of **resin** making it smooth and shiny. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This will help to seal the **resin** and prevent staining. Finally, you can use a clear epoxy **resin** finish. This will give the **resin** a glossy, protective finish that will make it easier to clean and less likely to stain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you are making an epoxy and wood table or creating beautifully hand-crafted **resin** goods, **sanding** is an essential part of the process. By **sanding** your epoxy, you will create a smooth and polished surface that finishes your piece off perfectly. Sanding **resin** can be a tricky process, especially if you are attempting to sand epoxy for the first time. In this guided article, we discuss the best methods for **sanding** **resin** and show you exactly how to sand epoxy **resin** to produce the best results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As with the machine buffing, drilling must be done at slow speeds to prevent the bits from being clogged with melted **resin** particles. It is essential to hold the piece firmly in a vice while drilling to get a straight hole. We have found that a couple of pieces of scrap leather will enable the **resin** to be held firmly without marking, while drilling your holes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sandpapers last longer in wet **sanding** and are much more efficient compared to dry **sanding**. The **resin** dust in dry **sanding** causes the sandpaper to clog quickly hence needing replacement or cleaning. The heat produced during dry **sanding** can cause the **resin** to melt. The application of water during wet **sanding** keeps the temperature down, thereby preventing the **resin** from melting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What is the best polishing compound for **resin**? This is a bit of a tricky question to answer considering that most polishing compounds, whether they have been specifically designed for use with **resin** or not, tend to do a pretty good job. This being said, using an epoxy **resin** polish will do an objectively better job, create less residue, and produce a superior sheen finish. We think that this product nails down all of these characteristics and even a bit more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To achieve a final polish we often use a soft cloth and Brasso for buffing **resin**s available at any hardware store. To maintain this finish a carnauba wax polish helps fill in any imperfections and provide a highly polished finished article. This wax is available at auto supply stores. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a finer and smooth finish, you should gradually go from lower to higher grit sandpapers. Low grit sandpapers are coarser, while higher ones are finer and are used later for a smooth finish. Start **sanding** your **resin** with 150 grit sandpaper and gradually move towards higher ones. It is preferred to start with this grit size because a lower grit size can put deep scratches on the surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wet **sanding** is mostly carried out by hand. This can lead to uneven **sanding** because it may be possible that you’re applying more pressure on one side without being aware of it. To deal with this issue, all you have to do is frequently change the direction of **sanding**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Today, we will share information and tips concerning how to polish **resin**. We’ll share ideas on how to use **resin** polish after **sanding**, what epoxy objects are easiest to polish, and what the best epoxy polish compounds are. Polishing epoxy **resin** is easy and will make your artwork shine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For wet **sanding**, you should always go for waterproof sandpapers. To ensure that your sandpaper stays smooth while **sanding**, you’ve to provide it with suitable backing. You can do so by wrapping it on a rubber **sanding** block. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wet **sanding** can get quite messy. So, if you opt for that, ensure that your workspace is covered properly with a newspaper or tarpaulin. Use a paper towel to dry your workpiece frequently during wet **sanding**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wondering how to polish epoxy **resin**? The process of polishing epoxy **resin** is pretty much the same one you would follow when polishing any other surface, and it even uses similar (if not the exact same) polishing products that you would use when polishing things like wood and metal. This being said, let’s have a look at what you need to do to ensure that you get the best finish possible when polishing your epoxy **resin** workpiece. Here are some of the things you will need: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dry **sanding** produces a lot of **resin** dust which creates an unhealthy work environment. On the other hand, during wet **sanding**, the dust produced gets mixed with water and doesn’t become airborne. This, however, can be a bit messy. Sandpapers last longer in wet **sanding** and are much more efficient compared to dry **sanding**. The **resin** dust in dry **sanding** causes the sandpaper to clog quickly hence needing replacement or cleaning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This waxy layer is not much visible; however, it can hinder the **sanding** process and spoil the final look. This layer also prevents the adhesion of the **resin** to the next coatings and other substances. But worry not. Below are a few ways you can get rid of amine blush: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Due to the waxy surface, **sanding** with normal sandpaper does not work, as it will clog up immediately. Amine redness is not a problem in itself: it is the effect of it that is the problem. If you continue to work without removing this layer, it will prevent lacquers, other epoxy coatings, and other substances from bonding effectively and ensuring adhesion. The surface should therefore definitely be cleaned. Here is a great method for removing amine blush from your **resin** projects: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In principle, it is possible to carefully polish the surface of almost any type of work-piece or **resin** sealant for a great shine. Of course, this works easier with a corresponding size of the work-piece or a larger area of the sealant than it might be the case with very small work-pieces with many edges. Epoxy polishing usually works without any problems for the following applications: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The powdered **resin** removed from the **resin** product gets added to the abrasive paper, thereby making it dull and ineffective, thus requiring it to be cleaned or even replaced frequently. Another main concern when **sanding** epoxy **resin** is the harmful effects of powdered **resin**. When inhaled, this powder can get absorbed easily into our respiratory lining because of the small size of its particles. This, in turn, can cause irritation and/or inflammation of the respiratory tract and lungs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to **sanding** epoxy **resin**, there are a few things that you should be aware of. Epoxy **resin** can be tricky and a little risky to sand, but with the right tips and tricks, you will be able to sand epoxy safely. The main difficulty when **sanding** **resin** lies in the hardness of the surface. The main safety concern when **sanding** epoxy lies in the toxicity of the particles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is the part where water comes in the process of wet **sanding**. You have to make your **resin** wet quite frequently during this process. You can do so by dipping your **resin** in water or by using a spray bottle. Once you’ve made your **resin** wet, you can continue your **sanding**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let’s assume that you’re **sanding** from left to right. Once you see the edges turn white, stop **sanding** and make your **resin** wet. Use a paper towel to dry it partially. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The sandpaper lasts longer as it doesn’t get clogged during **sanding**. This is because the added water quickly removes **resin** dust from the surface of the material. Resin dust produced is much lower, providing a much safer environment for working. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the many reasons we love crafting **resin** products is their glassy and smooth finish. However, to achieve that, you’ve to put in a bit of effort by **sanding** your epoxy **resin**. After properly **sanding** epoxy **resin**, you get a polished and smooth surface that is like a cherry on the top. Another reason why you need **sanding** is to get rid of sharp edges. This ensures that the finished product doesn’t hurt the users. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dry **sanding** produces a great amount of **resin** dust. So, make sure you’ve your dust mask on before starting. Start from a grit size between 80 to 120 and gradually work your way up towards 1000 or 1200 grit size. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One possibility is that your epoxy was not completely cured before you sanded it. If your epoxy is not fully cured, it will be more susceptible to scratches and other damage from **sanding**. Incomplete curing can also cause your epoxy to yellow over time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While dry **sanding** may not be recommended, there are scenarios where dry **sanding** is the best choice. Dry **sanding** of **resin** is the option when you have to sand larger surfaces. When working with **resin** that has wood incorporated in it, you cannot go for wet **sanding** as it can cause the wood to absorb moisture and swell. In such cases, you must use dry **sanding**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, you can polish **resin** with toothpaste. Toothpaste is a mildly abrasive material that can be used to remove scratches and other imperfections from surfaces. When polishing **resin** with toothpaste, it is important to use a non-abrasive toothpaste and to avoid using excessive pressure, as this can damage the **resin**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Epoxy **resin** is one of the most versatile substances on the face of the planet. These days, it’s used in pretty much every industry on the face of the planet, in fact, more and more applications are being discovered for this miracle substance every single day! It can be really challenging to work with though, different brands and even different types of **resin** can produce different finishes, even the mold you use can obscure your finish. This being said, let’s have a look at epoxy **resin** polishing, what it is, how it works, how you can use it to resurface and maintain the finish of your **resin** workpieces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are several types of epoxy **resin** polishing compound on the market. We recommend that you experiment with each type of epoxy polishing compound available. As previously stated, automotive and wood polishes can work very well with **resin** jewelry and other small objects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Please note that unlike the polyester **resin**s, epoxy **resin**s such as Crystal Cast Clear will not develop a high gloss on polishing. Finishing **resin** jewellery of this material to a high gloss requires the surface to be recoated with the epoxy **resin** or use Aristocrat or Envirotex Lite. (More information on **resin**s for jewelry here) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Polishing epoxy **resin**, like all other steps, is actually an indispensable part of working with epoxy **resin** in various projects. Only with careful polishing can the shine be created that turns a nice craft idea into a true work of art. But this only works if you lay the foundation for a perfectly polished **resin** surface by **sanding** (with different degrees of grain size) before the actual polishing. If unsightly **sanding** marks are not removed carefully enough during this initial step, even the final polishing cannot produce the desired surface quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this first step, you start with the **sanding** of epoxy **resin** through the so-called wet **sanding**. First of all, you need ordinary tap water and special sandpaper that is suitable for use in wet conditions. The decisive criterion for this is the application of the abrasive grains on a waterproof fabric that cannot tear when wet under mechanical stress. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All epoxy **resin** objects can be polished, but the methods that you use will depend on what kind of object you are polishing. The rule is that softer cured **resin** objects should be polished by hand, and hard cured **resin** objects can be polished with a buffing wheel or drill head. Smaller objects should be polished by hand if possible or with a buffing wheel. Hand polishing is the correct option for small objects that have many curves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Polishing your workpiece is a bridge you’ll have to cross if you’re looking to get that perfect finish for your **resin** castings. This being said, there are a few ways you could go about polishing your workpiece, you could either polish it by hand or you could use a Dremel if you’d really like to get the job done quickly. Let’s have a look at the best way for you to get your workpiece as shiny as possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First things first, put on a dust mask. Sanding produces **resin** dust which can be quite hazardous when inhaled. Make sure that **resin** is completely dried before **sanding**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Waterproof sandpaper is used for wet **sanding** of epoxy **resin**. Waterproof sandpapers come in various grit sizes ranging from 60 to 4000. Using waterproof sandpaper is the best method for **sanding** epoxy **resin** for two reasons: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When wet **sanding** the idea is to use progressively finer grits of sandpaper until the grit that you’re using is so fine that it leaves behind virtually no evidence of **sanding**. You could start with 400 grit, then move to 600 grit, then to 800 grit, and then eventually to 1000 grit. Wet **sanding** is usually reserved for larger **resin** surfaces as it reduces the amount of dust produced in the **sanding** process, or at the very least ensures that it doesn’t become airborne. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When **sanding** epoxy **resin**, you’re going to want to do it either by hand with a **sanding** block, **sanding** paper, or with an orbital sander. If you’re working with a larger workpiece, the orbital sander might be the better choice considering the amount of elbow grease you’re about to sink into this process. We do not recommend using a belt sander as it will chew up your workpiece. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wet **sanding** is usually done by hand. Do not use an electrically operated grinding machine if you are **sanding** wet, as you could otherwise suffer an electric shock. As an alternative, you can use an air-powered sander for large surfaces. Here is a brief video tutorial for wet **sanding** a **resin** coaster. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tip 1: After a few minutes of patient polishing, doubts often arise as to whether the surface will ever have the desired shine. It is not uncommon, however, that the matt appearance of an epoxy **resin** surface is actually only due to residues of the polishing paste on the epoxy **resin**. If, on the other hand, you regularly wipe off these polishing residues with a soft, clean cloth, you will always be able to keep a close eye on the progress of polishing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Air-powered sanders are tools that make use of compressed air to power rotating **sanding** discs. Air pressure is controlled by a button present on the sander. Electric **sanding** machines are powered by electricity to perform **sanding**. These tools are to be employed when you want to carry out dry **sanding** of your **resin**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first thing to do when starting **resin** dusting is to put on a dust mask. This is to prevent inhaling **resin** dust, which is hazardous and can cause irritation and inflammation. Even though wet **sanding** doesn’t produce much dust but better safe than sorry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Make sure that **resin** is completely dried before **sanding**. Wet **sanding** can get quite messy. So, if you opt for that, ensure that your workspace is covered properly with a newspaper or tarpaulin. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rub with the cloth in careful circular movements over the surfaces of your **resin** work-piece to be polished. You should apply light pressure. But don’t be surprised if you notice a visible effect only after some time. It may take a little longer until the surface you are working on finally reaches the desired gloss. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The purpose of polishing pretty much any surface is to obtain a clear surface finish, this is why metal objects like brass, silver, and even gold are polished to maintain a pristine aesthetic appearance. Does the same principle apply to epoxy **resin**? Well, yes it does. Besides things like the molds and the quality of **resin** you use, simply **sanding** your workpiece to get rid of excess material can leave the surface murky and scratched up. This is where the practice of polishing your **resin** workpieces comes into play. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After every pass, ensure that you wipe away any of the milk-like residues that have built up on your workpiece. Once you are happy with the job you’ve done **sanding** the surface, ensure that all the residue has been removed. Your surface should be completely dry before any polish has been applied to the surface of your workpiece. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dry **sanding** can produce heat. So, make sure you take breaks in between to ensure that high temperature doesn’t cause the **resin** to melt. Go from the lowest grit size of sandpaper to the highest grit size gradually. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, check your mold for any defects or imperfections. If you see any bubbles or cracks in the mold, discard it and start over with a new one. Finally, place your **resin** in a sunny spot to cure. The UV rays from the sun will help to clear up any cloudiness in the **resin**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Actually, there are not many pitfalls lurking in cast **resin** polishing. Nevertheless, you should always work very carefully and thoughtfully during this step in order to get a nice shiny surface in the end. With the right polishing paste, for example, epoxy **resin** can be made to shine very well. Further factors for an optimal result are the choice of the polishing sponge used and the set speed of the polishing machine used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
