-   The new generation of **paint**-primers (also known as “self-priming **paint**”) is a thicker **paint** with primer added. Many of these **paint**s are great and provide amazing coverage. The **paint** manufacturers advertise one coat coverage, however achieving this is very rare. However, these **paint**-primers can’t tackle every job, especially the ones listed above. If you’re in one of the situations above, you’re far better off taking the time to prime the surface properly before adding **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll mostly need to prime before **paint**ing when you’re going from a very dark color to a very light color. Paint colors that are very saturated will show through lighter, less saturated colors. If you want to save yourself the hassle of five or six coats of **paint**, prime over that fire-engine **red** before you put up that picture-perfect white. Often the most popular primer color to cover extreme colors or prepare the wall for extreme colors is grey. Studies have shown that it helps the human eye diffuse extreme colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may also want to prime before **paint**ing if you’re switching between two very saturated colors. Priming the walls will help you get a better idea of how the new color is applying and covering. It can be helpful to ask your local **paint** store to tint the primer for you ahead of time (most are white), which can also help you gauge the effect of your new color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For drywall, badly stained walls or high gloss **paint**, we recommend bringing in a professional **paint** company for the job. They’ve worked with these scenarios hund**red**s of times and will use the right primer to cover, seal and prepare the surface for **paint**ing. Plus, they’ll complete the project quickly and neatly, saving you hours on your weekend warrior time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Primer looks a lot like **paint**, but has a higher concentration of solids plus an adhesive binder in it. It essentially seals the surface and provides a smooth and clean area for **paint** to adhere. In some ways, it’s more of a glue or sealant than a **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Always prime your walls before **paint**ing if the surface is porous. The surface is porous when it absorbs water, moisture, oil, odors or stains. For example, brand new drywall is a very porous material. Both the paper that covers it and drywall mud are compromised by water or moisture when they are not sealed first with primer. This material will literally absorb your **paint** right into it if you don’t prime first. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One question we still get from homeowners, however, is if you need to prime your interior walls before **paint**ing. Years ago, many **paint**ing professionals recommended primer nearly every time you **paint**ed. But today, with these high-quality and effective **paint**s on the market, many homeowners may never need to crack open a can of primer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you prime over stains, however, it is extremely important in some cases that you fix any problems that led to the staining in the first place. For example, if you have old water stains, make sure that the leak is fully repai**red** before you **paint**. It will cause more problems later (with staining as the least of those problems!) if you don’t. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
