-   When I choose exterior trim and accent colors for my clients, 95% of the time I will work off of one **paint** color strip. Because the sunlight will pull out undertones that is impossible to see on a **paint** card, this is the safest way to guarantee that the undertones in the trim and accent colors play well and work together harmoniously. I will veer off the color strip if a client wants a completely different door color but for everything else, I stick with one color strip when it comes to exterior colors. You have everything you need color-wise on one strip; main body color, windows and trim and contrasting door color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Along with the white trim around the windows, a blue-gray fascia skirts the edge of the roof.

Who knows, maybe they’ll make it the trim color, too! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll also notice a pop of color in this picture: the blue door.

The palette here is shades like browns for shingle roofing and off-white for the exterior surface base blended with an equal base of the blue-**grey**.

-   It also becomes an all-around combination when it comes to the different shades of **grey** that are available in the market at this point. In traditional ways, this combination is best seen in sloped roof houses with front porches and multiple rooms. Given that, It sits well with the change in the architectural style of the building as well making it one of the modern **grey** house exterior color schemes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

For added protection we’d recommend a Rust-Oleum Chalked Clear Protective Topcoat brush-on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you can go much further in your color decision-making, you will need to consider the color of your roof. If you have a black or neutral gray, you don’t have to worry as much about color clashing. Unfortunately, I have a dark brown roof with slight red undertones, so colors like shades of green or blues wouldn’t work for me and would clash. For those of you that have a roof with red, tan, green or blue gray undertones in your shingles, you will for sure need to factor in your roof color as you choose your exterior **paint** color palette. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In recent times these modern **grey** house exterior color schemes have led **grey** to be one of the most chosen colors for a structure.

-   Though your immediate neighbors shouldn’t dictate what color you choose for your home, you should keep them in mind. If you plan to sell your home one day, you don’t want your home to stand out for all of the wrong reasons. A color that stands out, but that also complements the homes beside yours, will make your home seem more harmonious with your neighborhood. It’s also a good idea to check with your Homeowners Association as they could have rules about which colors you can **paint** your house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Once you have made a firm decision on the main exterior body **paint** color, you’re ready to move on and choose your exterior trim and accent colors. First, let me tell you when it comes to choosing trim and accent colors, less is more! I can’t tell you how often I work with clients who have a lot of architecture detail on the exterior of their home (shake, shutters, lots of changes in roof angles) who want to **paint** every detail a different color/shade because they think it will accentuate the architectural details. However, too much contrast and change of color/shades actually has the opposite effect and the eye stops at each color and the architectural details no longer stand out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Stepping out of the neutral zone is the addition of brighter and different colors onto the **grey** facade. The addition of a light blue door onto a similar undertone of light **grey**, adds in a contrast of color keeping the neutrality intact. This makes it one among modern **grey** house exterior color schemes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Starting strong with the classic combination of Grey exterior walls with white trimming. Now, just because it is a classic doesn’t mean it is boring. When it comes to **grey** exterior color schemes you need something extra to tie the facade and the addition of the clean white trim pairs perfectly with the not-so-overpowering **grey**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting your home is a big investment and there are a lot of exterior house colors to choose from. Because of this, it can be hard to choose what color to **paint** your home.

-   It’s impossible to deny the beauty of the perfect stain on just the right type of wood. Achieving the perfect look is more deliberate and frankly, difficult, than just choosing a color **paint** for the front door. You have to consider not only the stain but how it’ll look on the type of wood you have. That’s because the same stain on different wood types results in a completely different final color. It’s a little more complicated to work with stains than it is with **paint**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
