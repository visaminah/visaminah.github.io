## 59 Reference List: Do Brown And Gray Go Together In A Room | 14 Naturally Beautiful Grey and Brown Living Room Ideas
-   Aneta suggests, “Set the scene with a statement **brown** sofa in leather or velvet, and then introduce one or two contemporary storage pieces like a bookcase or TV stand finished in a dark **brown** lacquer or veneer. Slate walls and open-plan spaces are lovely, but sometimes they’re crying out for some colour. Dark wood has a natural warmth and stops your living room from feeling too cold.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is generally a warmer tone, whereas **gray** is generally a cooler tone. Under normal circumstances, these two shades are combined with more contrasting and sometimes also more vibrant shades, rather than with each other. There’s no reason why you can’t pair them together, though, especially because **brown** comes in so many different shades–all the way from a very light beige or tan, to dark chocolate **brown**, with medium tans and **brown**s in-between. The same is true for **gray**! Because both colors have so many shades, it’s very easy to find a combination that provides enough contrast. Even if the tones are rather similar, you can add a pattern to mix everything up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Accessories and light fixtures are key when decorating with **gray** and **brown** combination. They can use the warmth of brass and gold or the cooling influence of pewter and silver with equal success. You might also consider pieces that blend alternating layers of silver and gold for a stunning mixed-media interpretation of the established **gray** and **brown** color concept. Lighting, drapery hardware, shimmering tassels and trims, and even plumbing fixtures can all strengthen the influence of well-chosen metal accents within a room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown might not be the first color you think of when decorating your daughter’s bedroom, but you’d be surprised how well it can pair with shades of pink. Pairing **brown** with shades like rose or fuchsia creates a feminine space without overdoing it. If you’re going ahead with a pink room, the natural order would be to start with a **brown** base and **brown** or wooden furniture, using shades of pink as your accents in things like pillows, curtains, or artwork. You could choose a more subtle, subdued shade of pink for the wall as well, like this room with a pink-peach shade on the walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another idea could be choosing a wood floor (or a floor with a material that resembles wood). For the counters and bigger kitchen appliances, they’d also look great in **gray**. For more visual contrast, you could try hanging wooden decor, and the results would be even better if they matched the floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is a neutral and natural color that, when used in the right environment, can create a warm, stable feeling in any room. An excess of **brown** or wooden furniture can create a dark, heavy feel in your space. That’s why it’s important to integrate shades of **brown** into a color palette with colors and shades that complement it. When looking for a neutral shade to paint your home with **brown** is often passed over for whites or **gray**s, but you shouldn’t rule it out! It’s all about knowing the colors that go with **brown**—and the best ways to incorporate them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We're currently designing our new home. Our floors will be a mid to dark **brown** polished concrete. I'm finding I LOVE the look of the slate grey tiles for our bathroom (as per the attached photo I found on houzz), but I'm curious to know if they'd really "go" with our **brown** floor. I've seen some nice pairings of **brown** and grey, but I'm worried it would look bad, any suggestions? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A dark **brown** will always be greatly enhanced when combined with a crispy white shade. This simple and clean contrasting shade pairs wonderfully with a dark chocolaty **brown** to add an amazing air of traditional charm to every room. By blending these two colors correctly, your bedroom or bathroom décor will have a clean and luxurious ambiance that is highly welcoming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Simply put, there has to be a lot of it. The issue here is that if there isn’t enough contrast between your **brown** and your **gray**, it all looks muddy; close in color but not quite the same. A good combination would be to pair a softer **gray** with either a richer tan or a darker **brown**. Also, it’s okay to pair two lighter shades as long as there is enough contrast–and if your **brown** and **gray** are similar in color, you can still create contrast with a texture. So to come up with incredible outfits, keep in mind that the closer the **gray** and **brown** are together in color and the less contrast there is, the more you’ll need to augment with textures or different patterns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Beige can be described as one of the most apparent colors that go with **brown**. Beige is essentially a much lighter shade of **brown**, and the shades in between these two can be combined to create a satisfying and monochromatic color scheme. Beige accents look great with **brown** as the base color and vice versa. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moreover, the fabric is so durable that we can probably use fabric furniture for a very long time. They are easy to clean and repair. Combining a **brown** sofa with a **gray** table is a good choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown represents strength, quality, reliability, and safety. One look at a large oak tree can confirm this connection that has been drawn. High-end brands like Louis Vuitton make use of **brown** in their branding and their products for this exact reason. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turquoise blended with a rich shade of **brown** is one of the trendiest combinations that is going around right now. This incredibly modern and sleek look works wonderfully for both living and bedrooms. These two colors complement each other beautifully, allowing you to go for a wide range of versatile design appeals. The two colors can be blended with a variety of visions in mind to result in anything from contemporary to vintage styles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The color gold in itself has incredibly bold and magical characteristics. However, this bright and charming shade can be combined with a dark shade of **brown** to tone down the bright accents of gold and make your room look lively and charming. The look that can be achieved by combining the two colors is one that looks extremely luxurious and refined. The golden undertones in the table lamp and bright designs on the floor look expensive and glamorous against the chocolaty **brown** in the background. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a dining room, you can choose chairs that have wooden legs an a **gray** upholster. As for flooring, wood floors will look great, such as laminate flooring. You can also find them in **gray**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most colors look great with **brown**, in moderation, but always consider earthy, natural colors when making your **brown** color combination choice. Natural greens, ocean blues, and so forth. These colors look very natural next to **brown**, as we often see them in nature. Brown complementary colors like orange for a cool blue, works well when used in moderation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you pair **brown** and **gray**, make sure there is a match in both seasonality and formality. For example, you’ll want to combine an overcoat with flannel, not with fresco or seersucker. On the flip side, you wouldn’t want to wear **brown** loafers with a dark **gray** flannel suit without any socks. Traditionally, loafers were too informal for a double-breasted suit. In this day and age you can pull it off, but make sure you have a pair of socks (and maybe not a woven leather pair of loafers, but a plain leather pair). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark Chocolate Brown, when accented with a rich shade of copper, can give an incredibly trendy and hip look to your room. With this unique blend of colors, you can create an inviting and warm atmosphere that is booming with energy. The red undertones of copper will be enough to offset the silky hues of **brown** to give off an energetic and charming vibe to the overall look of your room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you’ve read, combining these two colors is quite easy. We recommend that you choose lighter **gray** and **brown** tones. Lighter tones will prevent dark spaces that make a room seem smaller than it actually is. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking to get a much more modern and sleek look that is incredibly relaxing and trendy, then consider pairing **brown** with blue. Brown and blue are made for each other as the cooler tones in blue harmonize perfectly with the warm **brown**s in the wooden furniture. You can dress up your living room, bedroom, and even your bathroom with this peaceful blend of colors to get a fine balance between a traditional and modern ambiance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you already have a lot of **gray** suits, an easy way to add **brown** into your wardrobe is by using ties. You can go with something like a grenadine tie which is great, but what’s even better is a knit tie because it has more texture and it just creates that lovely more casual effect and you can wear a **brown** knit tie with any other color too so it’s not just limited to your **gray** wardrobe. No matter if you get something, let’s say in **brown**, which is more of a medium **brown** or let’s say in a two-tone **brown**, it’s just a wonderful accessory to have into your wardrobe that you can pair with **gray** garments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   blue to make it visually more interesting. My jacket is a medium **brown** herringbone jacket, which is part of a suit. It’s very warm in its tone and so I’m pairing it with a white shirt and a **brown** two-tone tie because you see flecks of white and **brown**. From afar, it could be mistaken as **gray**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A beautiful shade of rose contrasts nicely with the warmth of **brown** to create an energetic and super-feminine atmosphere. The two colors blend with each other harmoniously to give you a beautiful and comfortable space that looks luxurious and cozy. These two colors are ideal for living spaces as well as bedrooms and can offer a versatile range of design options ranging from old-age vintage styles to the more modern styles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Referencing the earth symbolism of **brown**, teal is naturally one of the colors that go with **brown**, as it represents the ocean and completes the earth-ocean duo. Teal looks great with any shade of neutral **brown**. Defer from pairing teal with a very warm **brown** or an overly cool **brown**, as this will clash. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Don’t take this article as a fact; the colors that go with **brown** mentioned here are the humble opinion from our architectural experience. There are so many colors you can experiment with, keeping **brown** as background that it is nearly impossible to mention them all. However, we can certainly assure you that no matter which mix you choose, if you chose them, they’ll be splendid, your house, your rules. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   They just make the entire outfit softer especially if you decide to wear suede shoes rather than regular leather shoes. By doing so, you’ll still have a formal outfit that is slightly more casual and just great for fall/winter ensembles. I mean don’t get me wrong, a pair of black and white pants will always look great with black shoes but if you compare it, here we have a black pair of double monks and here is the same pair of pants with some chocolate **brown** boots. Also, a flannel is generally more casual than a worsted wool and so a slightly more casual shoe which is a dark **brown** works better versus black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another way to subtly introduce black into your **brown** interior is through fittings such as door handles, plumbing fixtures, and small furniture items like dining chairs. If the desired mood of the interior is of an industrial or more masculine manner, this color scheme is the way to go. If masculinity is not entirely what you are after, incorporating white furniture pieces or using white as the backdrop of the space will in turn soften everything and create balance in the space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Restful shades of mint will go a long way in prettying up a living room when combined with a good dose of **brown** and lend it an incredible air of sophistication. Blending this wonderful shade of minty green to a room with **brown** wooden furnishings will lend a fresh and organic vibe to the overall ambiance of your room. Dress up your front porch in this combination to give off a naturally masculine yet soft feel to the look of it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My cufflinks are **brown** tiger’s eye with gold from Fort Belvedere and you can find it in our shop. Just like the tie the pants are **gray** striped and have flecks of blue, which is also picked up by the dark **brown** and light **brown** paisley pocket square, which also has elements of blue. The socks are **brown** solid color with clocks that pick up the color of the pants and tie over elegantly to my medium **brown** shoes, which is a mix of the colors that I have in my tie and my jacket. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If we take a closer look at the pocket square, it has elements of **brown** that are very close to the jacket. So, in theory, it’s not a good fit. However, the blue tones and the dark tones create enough visual contrast so it all works together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A more unexpected pairing that you might not come up with yourself is pairing **brown**s with purple. Deeper shades of purples and **brown**s can make larger spaces feel cozy in a way that brighter colors can’t achieve. When pairing purple and **brown**, always focus on the opposites. Darker woods like walnut pair well with pastel purples, and lighter **brown** woods pair well with deep shades of purple like plum or bright shades like amethyst. Brown and purple work very well in a room with yellow accents as well, if you’re looking to add a third color to your color scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown has always been evident in interior design, but it is rarely recognized as a favorite color, which renders it difficult to sell if not understood. What most seem to underestimate is the ability of **brown** to stand firm on its own, without the additional help of bright colors that most seem to gravitate towards. Brown has always been evident in interiors throughout the centuries, no matter the style of that time. In comparison to other neutrals such as **gray** or black, which were missing during certain periods, **brown** can be seen as a timeless color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Metals should also be considered when deciding what colors go with **brown**. People tend to struggle with pairing different metals with **brown**. The reason for this is that the tone of **brown** is not taken into consideration when choosing metal fixtures throughout. The rule of thumb is to pair warm metals like copper and bronze with warm **brown**, and cold metals like chrome should be paired with cool **brown**s. If, for example, you have wooden floors throughout your house that have a very warm, orange undertone, copper fittings, and fixtures are a great option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally speaking, seating has a lot of visual importance in living rooms, especially if you have a chaise lounge. So, it’s really important to get the color just right. If you choose a **brown** sofa, one made of leather would be a great option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The warmth of Orange combines beautifully with the neutral **brown** to give an amazing contrasting effect which gleams of energy and fun. These two colors blended together has the ability to create trendy and hipster-inspired styles that are ultra-modern and sleek. The orange center tables contrast amazingly with the chocolate **brown** sofas and the wooden flooring. The orange undertones throughout the room also give off an air of sophisticated charm that look very artsy and modern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is a great color to use when you are aiming for a calm and natural environment. It serves great as a neutral backdrop to pops of color and can also stand firm on its own. More colors go with **brown** than colors that don’t. The most important factor to consider when choosing what colors go with **brown**, is whether the specific **brown** has a warm, cold or neutral undertone and take it from there. Also, keep in mind that colors that show up in nature are bound to match well with **brown** because of their sense of familiarity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown complementary colors can be determined through the assessment of the undertone of the specific **brown**. The complementary color of warm/red-**brown** is green, which makes green one of the best colors that go with **brown**. Using greenery in the form of plants is a great way to bring color into a space as well as accentuate your wooden furniture, without it being too thematic. This is a great natural and earthy color combination that you can never go wrong with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You won’t find **brown** on the traditional color wheel, but since its closest shade is orange, many use blue as a complementary color for **brown**. Combining blue and **brown** tones can make a relaxing environment out of an ordinary bedroom. Brown leather paired with navy blue makes a room feel rustic and refined, whereas pale blue paired with beige or a lighter wood creates a more serene environment. The cool tones in shades of blue mix well with the warm **brown**s of darker wooden furniture without leaving the room feeling too dark or heavy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grey and **brown** can look lovely in any room of your home. So, below we’d like to give you some examples and ideas for each room of the house. We hope that you like them and remember that making sure your rooms are illuminated is very important. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As for your walls, the simplest option would be to paint them **gray**. You can paint one a darker shade than the others, creating some dimension. If you opt for **brown**, consider painting just one wall **brown** and the rest a very light **brown** (like beige), or even white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is a color perceived as natural and neutral; pairing it with green plays into the grounding feeling of nature, bringing it into your home. Lighter shades of green like mint soften the darker furniture in a room. Using darker shades of green paired with dark **brown** accents or wooden furniture creates a darker, moody vibe that would work for a den or office space, as seen in the photo below. There are few combinations of green and **brown** that wouldn’t complement each other thanks to the two colors being natural foils in nature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yellow is a color that complements **brown** beautifully to make any room look incredibly aesthetic. Bright shades of yellow look lively and fun and when blended correctly with **brown** adds a splash of energetic charm to your living space. The yellow undertones in the bookshelf and the bright furniture in the room pop wonderfully against the neutral background bringing together the best of both traditional and modern looks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As with the above example, if you are faced with a very light **brown** that doesn’t seem warmer than it is cool or vice versa, it can be considered a neutral light **brown**. A light **brown** is a great neutral to work with, as it is very modern and goes with any color, whether it be very bright pops of color or toned-down pastels. Light **brown**s also work well as monotones, as it creates a very calming atmosphere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let us show you some advice on how to make your living room closer to nature and resemble a forest. Our secret ingredients here are natural woods and stones. As we know, wooden materials are inherently natural **brown** so don’t worry about its colors fading over time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It may not sound like two of the most appealing color choices, but hear us out! There’s a time and a place for using mustard yellow in your home. It’s not a color that you want to overdose on, but it’s a great stabilizing color. Mustard yellow can bring contrast to a room primarily built around **brown**s and other earth tones without being too vibrant or overwhelming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Neutrals are beige, ivory, **brown**, black, taupe, grey and varying shades of white. Neutrals bring warmth, depth, and anchor a room pending on there hue and undertones. For this blog we are going to focus on greys and **brown**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What do we mean by this? For example, look at this houndstooth suit pictured above. The individual colors are actually beige/off-white and dark **brown**–but when you take a step back, it looks like a **gray** suit from afar. So if you combine it with a **brown** turtleneck and suede boots, as well as a pocket square in **brown**, you’ll have a pleasing mix between **gray** and **brown**; very harmonious for the fall/winter season, elegant, but not over-the-top. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now that you know the basics of pairing **brown** with **gray**, let’s look at some specific outfits and how you can learn from them. If you don’t know where to start, having a **gray** suit with **brown** shoes is the easiest and simplest way and chances are you already have both of them in your wardrobe. A **brown** and off white houndstooth suit looks like **gray** paired with a reddish-**brown** shoes or I always like to pair my light **gray** fresco suit with dark **brown** suede shoes, I might wear boots or just regular derbys. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another color I like to add is petrol. For example, a petrol blue fresco jacket paired with a white shirt, a **gray** mottled knit tie from Fort Belvedere, a light **brown** seersucker pair of pants, and dark **brown** woven penny loafers to underscore the summery character. Now, in this outfit, if I would have swapped the jacket for a light **gray** fresco one, I would have a perfect summery combination of just **brown** and **gray**. Another very easy color to incorporate with **brown** and **gray** is blue. If you have a **brown** corduroy jacket and a **gray** tie, try combining them with a blue and white striped shirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since **brown** and orange are such similar colors you might shy away from pairing them together, but we’re here to save you from that mistake. When placed in a primarily **brown** space, orange accents will serve as the perfect energizer for the room. A pop of orange in a **brown** room comes across as trendy or artsy, especially against darker woods. For a more warm, sophisticated color scheme, you can try pairing a dark chocolate background with orange and cream accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When considering the best colors to go with **brown** in your home, yellow should be at the top of your list. You could opt for a lively shade of yellow to give you a needed pop of color, or consider a rich shade of golden yellow. Pairing **brown** with yellow creates a contemporary vibe in a bedroom or sitting room. Using the 60-30-10 rule would work well when pairing yellow and **brown**. 60% of the room should be a neutral shade such as white, with 30% of the room decorated in various shades of **brown**, and the last 10% is reserved for yellow accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ve heard before that white goes with just about every color, and **brown** is no exception to that rule. Pairing any shade of **brown** with a crisp white will give you a clean contrast that works well in a room like a formal dining room or living room. If white and **brown** are your two main colors in any room, make sure you vary the shades to keep it interesting. Shades of dark **brown** or woods such as teak pop well against white too. For this living room they chose to use white as the main color, with **brown** furniture and wood accents providing the contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also decorate the living room with natural **gray** and **brown** leather. This material helps highlight the room and makes it brighter. Trust me, combining this with the **gray** wall can give you some sort of luxurious feeling in your seat. Leather always has a classic touch which makes your home more classy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cool **brown** means that there is a visible undertone of blue. This **brown** hue is usually associated with good quality and masculinity. The complementary color of blue is orange, which makes orange a great combination with cool **brown**. An earthy orange, like terracotta, works best with a cool **brown**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark shades of wooden cabinetry paired with quirky shades of Fuchsia on the walls, heighten the drama in every room. Any room with a **brown** foundation can be transformed into a feminine and energetic setting by adding fuchsia accents to it. The depth of these two colors combines and enriches the space by adding a sophisticated vibe to the room. The bright and vivacious shade of the color pink adds personality to the more neutral **brown** and brightens up the whole atmosphere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pair **gray** gloves with **brown** outfits and overcoats or **brown** gloves with **gray** overcoats and suits. Traditionally, well-dressed men would not wear black gloves. They would have a chamois yellow tone, maybe something in cognac or in a **brown** or of course, with other suits, they would wear a pair of **gray** gloves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What color goes with **brown**? This color often gets labeled as boring and lackluster in a variety of different fields from interior design to fashion. However, the color **brown** when combined correctly with the right shades can be highly inspiring, cozy and super sleek. Brown possesses rich earthly qualities that are warm, dramatic and enveloping. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Much like a **brown** and white pairing, **brown** pairs well with black to create a classic color palette in any room. When using black as one of your main colors, you must make sure to balance it well. Lighter shades of **brown** or light woods work better so the room doesn’t appear too dark. In spaces with black furniture, **brown** accents can add depth and interest to the room, whereas black can create drama against **brown** furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are looking at a dark **brown** color and there is no visible warm or cold undertone, it can be considered a neutral **brown** that can be combined and look great with almost any color, as it is a true neutral in every sense of the word. This type of **brown** works well with other neutral colors such as white and black, as it is very contrasting and makes a contemporary statement. Black and **brown** work great together as textile patterns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
