## 70 Shocking Facts About Is A Cellar The Same As A Basement | Cellar vs. Basement vs. Crawl Space – How Are Each Different?
-   A **cellar** is usually tiny. Some **cellar**s are only slightly bigger than a large walk-in closet. The size of **basement**s is similar to that of a small apartment, which is why many homeowners choose to have their **basement** finished to use it as a livable space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A serious con of root **cellar**s is critters. Mesh over the intake and outtake vents helps along with poisons placed far away from the food. Sealing the foods in tightly lidded contatiners will help. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re building a home and you’re considering your options, then a **basement** probably seems a lot more practical. A **cellar** area does have its uses so it might be worthwhile to include a **cellar** area that is connected to your **basement**. In order to decide whether or not this is a good idea, you should take the time to consider what you would use the **cellar** for. If you’re someone who is into canning fruits or vegetables, then having a **cellar** to store your goods is very sensible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes it does if the spaces are in other locations. A dark **basement** in Amsterdam Centre will of course be able to yield much per square meter than a square meter of normal living space in Almere. It could also be that something does lie on the same street and a **basement**/sub-**basement** is worth more than a normal residential meter at the neighbor’s house. Think of a newly built house in Castricum with a **basement** that is completely finished in accordance with the latest requirements of the building regulations and according to the latest modern wishes with expensive details and the highest attainable level of sustainability. It will score better in value than a house a little further down the road built in the 1960s with infamous Kwaaitaal floors (floors known to contain concrete rot), a much lower level of finishing and preservation that lags behind today’s requirements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For me, **basement** is the general purpose word for the part of the building below ground level. I think I say **cellar** is the space was used for storage purposes. (It could be food, but it could be other things too - in the past there might be coal **cellar**s, for example.) So if the **basement** was a games room or a dance studio that wouldn't be a **cellar** for me. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a long time, people have just assumed that **cellar**s and **basement**s are close enough to be considered the same thing. This isn’t true for some important reasons that we’re going to go over later in this article. Now that you know a bit more about why this confusion exists, you’ll be ready to dig into the differences between **cellar**s and **basement**s. There are several distinguishing features that will set the two apart from one another. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not only vegetables and fruits are stored in **cellar**s. If you buy a side of beef, bring home venison, or know a farmer selling whole hams, then that **cellar** will keep them fresh. If you churn your own butter or make your own cheese, **cellar**s are good storage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For example, homeowners can convert a **basement** into a legal living space, such as a mother-in-law suite. However, because **cellar**s are so far underground, they generally aren’t safe for a habitable space. This difference also impacts the - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even though **cellar** and **basement**, both, are underneath the main house, they are quite different. Some people think that they are the same and this is why they often end up making a mistake when they are building their home. When you are planning to build a home, you must know the difference between **cellar** and **basement**. This would help you decide which room you want to have in your house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A large and modish **basement** with white walls and ceiling. It also has a large area rug and a TV stand with multiple shelving. There’s a widescreen TV as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And there you have it! You’re now an expert on all things related to **basement**s, **cellar**s, and crawl spaces. All three are essential areas of the house, and form the foundation on which the house rests. Choose the one that best suits your needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As its name suggests, a **basement** forms the base of a house. It is best constructed using concrete blocks, poured concrete forms, stone tiles, and precast panels. Usually, a **basement** contains a water heater, the HVAC unit, and even the washing machine in some houses. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **basement** is present below the house’s ground floor. It may be partially below the house or completely below it, depending on how it was built. It is actually a room in the house which can be used for anything. Some people use their **basement** for keeping their washing machine, for laundry while others might use it as a storage unit. In some houses, **basement** is also used as a bed room or study room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **cellar** is, essentially, an underground room that has a steady, cold temperature. The design of **cellar**s doesn’t allow any sunlight to enter the place. What’s more, modern **cellar**s use artificial temperature control to ensure a stable atmosphere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because of their location, there is minimal lighting in both **basement**s and **cellar**s. However, **basement**s do have a window that allows a little bit of natural lighting. The only light that comes into a **cellar** is when the door is left open. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are even **cellar**s that are modified in order to provide shelter for the occupants of a home during severe storms. People sometimes need to seek refuge when there is a tornado warning in the area. Cellars can be very convenient when extreme weather events occur. Stocking a **cellar** with some supplies and fitting it with a secure door can provide people with a safe spot to ride out a storm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main purpose of any space is storage. Unfinished **basement**s are often found with shelving for storing boxes away from any moisture, the chest freezer, or stacks of tires. Some unfinished **basement**s are used as workshops complete with pegboards holding tools and jars of nails and screws. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll also want to know that it’s possible for a home to have both a **cellar** and a **basement**. This might seem a bit unusual but there are situations where homes will have two separate sub-level rooms. A home might have a **basement** area under one section of the house and then have a **cellar** that is underneath another part of the home. It’s also plausible for a **cellar** to be attached to a **basement** so there is a lot to consider. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘Old building’ **basement**s (of traditionally built houses) will always be damp. Groundwater will always press against the walls even if those walls are treated with special moisture-resistant plaster. If there is no very good ventilation there to keep the moisture out, then there cannot be official living space there. In newly constructed **basement**s this problem with moisture should not occur. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some might remember your great-grandparents referring to the “**cellar**.” They stored their fresh fruits and vegetables, their wines and liquors, and various other things there. Most grew up thinking a **cellar** and **basement** were interchangeable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Or, you can also keep things in your **basement** that are not of daily use. Basements are normally made in houses that are in a temperature climate. During the free thaw cycle, the foundation of a house might get unstable and **basement**s tend to maintain the stability of the house. If made in wet climates, it can be hard to maintain a **basement** because the room will always be cold. Every house can have a **basement** but not every house needs a **cellar**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some homes consist only of a **basement** where the minimum height of 2 meters is not met (for example, in Amsterdam). If this dwelling is reasonably habitable, then the area of this **basement** dwelling may exceptionally count as living area. But please note: if the house does not consist entirely of this **basement**, this tolerance rule does not apply. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is a **basement** if more than half of that floor is below street level (‘ground level’). So suppose the height of the **basement** is 2 meters high. If the **basement** is 101 cm or more deeper than the street level, then it is a **basement**. A **basement** is said to exist if more than half of the height of that floor is above street level. So if that first floor is 200 cm high and of that 99 cm or less is below street level, then it is a **basement**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Basements can also be used as workshop areas for DIY enthusiasts. They can also be fully furnished as rooms for living in, dens, and even a home office or a gym. There’s no limit to what a **basement** can be; only your imagination limits you! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While the **basement** is often used as bedrooms by people, **cellar**s are not. Since they are smaller in size, they can be heated easily. Also, **cellar**s can be dehumidified using the right equipment if concrete walls are present. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the biggest differences between **basement**s and **cellar**s has to do with height. You see, **basement**s are usually going to be halfway above curb level or a bit more. Cellars are going to be at least halfway below the curb. There are actually several reasons why this is an important distinction to make. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **cellar** is not going to be able to be rented out under any circumstances. The laws in most places would prevent this from being a possibility. Knowing this, it’s clear that there is a lot more potential use for a **basement** than there is for a **cellar**. A **basement** can be a very useful addition to the home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Today’s **cellar**s are wine **cellar**s. Involved in this are refrigeration systems, racks, construction materials, and temperature/humidity controls. Experts report the cost of constructing a wine **cellar**, depending on the size of the room, is around $300 to $600 per square foot. Homeowners pay an average price of $40,000 for a wine **cellar**, but larger **cellar**s housing up to 3,000 bottles can go up to $100,000. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These windows won’t be possible to use as entry or exit points, making the room more dangerous than a **basement**. In the event of a fire, a **cellar** would be a very dangerous room indeed. This is one of the reasons why you can’t really use a **cellar** as a true livable space. There are more reasons than this but it’s one of the most important. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Basements also have a long history behind them and can be traced back to life before the industrial revolution. Back then, **basement**s were not only used as storage areas but also living quarters for servants. Some people even used them as laundry rooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s definitely true that a **basement** is going to be a more versatile room than a **cellar**. You can do many different things with a **basement** and it can wind up being used as an extension of your home. The **cellar** is going to be more practical as a storage space or a storm shelter. As long as you can keep these differences clear in your head, you shouldn’t ever mix these two types of rooms up again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The ceiling height of a **cellar** tends to be no more than seven feet. It’s common for the ceilings to be less than six feet in height, making it challenging to move around in them. Unlike **cellar**s, **basement**s often have very high ceilings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Basements are more flexible due to being able to be used as true livable spaces. Depending on whether certain criteria are met, a **basement** might even be able to be rented out. It depends on whether things are up to code but you should know that finished **basement**s can be used as rental properties. The **basement** needs to meet the minimum safety requirements in order for you to rent it out to tenants legally. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now that you’ve taken the time to read all about the differences between **basement**s and **cellar**s, you should feel as though you understand things better. The topic may have seemed confusing at first but it’s actually more straightforward than you likely realized. Both **basement**s and **cellar**s have their own uses and they’re quite distinct from each other despite having some similarities. You should be able to know which type of room you have in your home after reading about the differences. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An unfinished **basement** will contain the water heater, the air exchange for the HVAC unit, and perhaps a washer and dryer. Finished **basement**s could offer bedrooms, bathrooms, perhaps a small kitchen and laundry room, a living area and perhaps a home gym or home office. Some offer extra doors and windows cut out for more natural light and as extra methods of egress. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you look on the Internet, you’ll find no discernible history of the crawl space. However, common sense tells us that sub-floor areas have been used since housing was developed. Crawl spaces and root **cellar**s were dug out for storage and continues to this day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even when they do have windows, they are very high up and are at the same level as the curb. Those things are stored in the **cellar** that is sensitive to moisture. Cellars offer protection from harsh temperatures because they are even below the ground than **basement**s. These are too small and cannot be normally given as rent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Basements are located at floor level, and **cellar**s can be at least 10 feet below ground level. As a result, **cellar**s often only have dirt floors. Basements can have dirt floors, but many homeowners wind up putting concrete over them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s pretty rare for a **cellar** to have any heating or ventilation. However, homeowners often have heating installed in their **basement**. Also, a **basement** has more ventilation than a **cellar** because a window can be left open. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main difference between the **cellar** and **basement** is that **basement** has windows while the **cellar** has no windows in it. The **cellar** is used to store things that are sensitive to moisture that’s why it is built lower than the ground level. Every house has a **basement** but does not contain a **cellar**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A lack of windows is another big difference between a **cellar** and a **basement**. It’s possible that a **cellar** could have windows but they’re going to be very small. As mentioned above, a **cellar** is going to be at least halfway below curb level. This is going to make it so that the only windows that could appear in a **cellar** would be very tiny. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, **cellar**s do come with their share of cons as well. One of the most important of these is the storage of foodstuff that gives off gas. Items such as plums, apples, tomatoes, and cabbage emit gases, which can cause other vegetables, such as potatoes, to rot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cellar areas are generally going to be quite dank. This means that they often have issues with mildew and you might even need to run dehumidifiers if you plan on using the space for anything important. This alone is often enough to tell you that your room is a **cellar** rather than a **basement**. The height of the room does make a difference and **cellar**s simply aren’t going to be good livable spaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A crawl space is another method of constructing the bottom of the house with the first two being **cellar**s and **basement**s. A crawl space is an empty area about one to three feet above the ground, replacing a poured concrete slab. The insulation between the rafters overhead in the crawl space represent the first floor of the house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes in principle. Because again, the more daylight the nicer this space is to use as living space. So if a space is more pleasant to use as living space because of this better quality, the more it is worth. So you could say that a **basement** (where a larger portion of that building layer is above ground) adds more value than a **basement** (where more than half of that building layer is below ground). Of course, this assumes that both spaces are equivalent in quality on the inside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since **cellar**s began their lives as root **cellar**s, most people used to just toss in that year’s crop. Today’s **cellar**s have shelves for filled Mason and Ball jars, fresh fruits and vegetables, and containers for rooting new vegetables. Gravel on the floor helps with moisture and humidity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many homes have either a **basement** or a **cellar**. It’s actually pretty common for people to mix these two types of rooms up. You might be one of the many people who wonder what the difference between a **basement** and a **cellar** is. It can be somewhat confusing if you don’t know the particulars but it isn’t that hard to understand once you dig into the details. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The lack of normal-sized windows creates a lighting problem as well. Cellars are going to have insufficient lighting and will need to be illuminated using lamps or installed lighting. If your sub-level room has tiny windows such as this and is mostly below ground, then it’s an indicator that you actually have a **cellar** and not a **basement**. Your uses for this space are going to be more limited than what you could use a **basement** for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the most common reasons why people confuse **cellar**s and **basement**s is that they’re quite similar. There are actually many differences but an average person might not be aware of these differences. To add to this, people use the term **cellar** interchangeably with the word **basement**. This makes it much more confusing than it needs to be and it’s one of the reasons why I’m writing this article today. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For most homeowners, the first and foremost consideration is the money. Crawl spaces are cheaper to construct than **basement**s. Encapsulating a crawl space protects against moisture and critters better and cheaper than protecting a **basement**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finished **basement**s generally run $25 to $50 per square foot. If homeowners use better quality materials, the cost can run $90 per square foot. Most finished **basement**s cost around $30,000. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It turns out we’ve mistaken three subterranean areas for something else. The **cellar**, **basement**, and crawl space all represent the bottom of a house. They’re traditionally dank, dark, and spider-y. We use inventive excuses not to go down there. What are each of them, and how are they different and alike? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Americans define a **basement** as a **cellar**. It’s a room partially or completely below street level or the ground. Most businesses don’t have one which makes **basement**s residential in nature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ideally, **cellar**s should be constructed when the house is being built, though they can be added later. In case a **cellar** is being added to the house later, it’s best to build them under the porch, or off a **basement** wall. They can also be built in the yard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are worried about moisture in your **basement**, you should get a dehumidifier to regulate moisture levels. It can keep humidity levels at a safe range. Unless the size of your **basement** is enormous, one dehumidifier should be sufficient. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What’s more, **cellar**s are fantastic for storing wine. The term, “wine **cellar**,” has gained widespread popularity simply because these rooms are mostly used to store wines. This helps to preserve that flavor of the wine in the long term. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The building code proposes a minimum mandatory rooflight access. However, this is not relevant when it comes to being allowed to count living area in the case of **basement**s/souterrains. If there is no daylight (window) in a **basement** / **cellar**, then the space (provided the other rules are met) may just count as living area. The requirement for the presence and size of daylighting, by the way, does apply to attics. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are actually a number of ventilation issues that will pop up when a room is too far below ground. The lowest points of a home are going to be somewhat musty. It can wind up smelling and it might be different from a typical room. A **basement** can be made to be very similar to a normal room but a **cellar** is not going to resemble this. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **basement** or **cellar** must be structurally suitable as living space. There should be good ventilation, heating and enough finishing to use that as a pleasant living space. A cold unfinished concrete floor and moisture makes it not structurally suitable as a living area. Also, for example, if a **basement** is really intended and built as a bicycle storage or installation space (with WTW system, heat pump, etc.), then the term “living area” does not apply. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, it must be remembered that all locations around the country aren’t enough for building a **basement**. Locations near large water bodies, frigid regions, or even earthquake-prone areas will not be able to hold a **basement**. This is due to a risk of foundational damage to the house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Having both a **cellar** and a **basement** allows for the **basement** to be used in practical ways. You can set the **basement** up as a normal room and use the **cellar** for storage. The **cellar** can even be used as your refuge spot when a storm comes too close for comfort. Just consider your options and make the choice that is best for your new home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now that you’re all up to speed with what a **cellar** is, let’s take a look at **basement**s and find out how they differ. Put simply, a **basement** is a room that’s wholly or partially below the ground level. This makes them similar to a **cellar** in terms of location. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, to come to the disadvantages. Despite all the great things that **basement**s have to offer, there are quite a few of these. For starters, since a **basement** is a room that’s wholly or partially underground, water from beneath the ground can seep into the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This doesn’t necessarily mean that **cellar**s are completely without value, though. It’s simply important to know what each room is going to be capable of. Many people use **basement**s in order to create game rooms or they might even use a finished **basement** as an exercise area. They’re a lot more comfortable and usable than a **cellar** for normal purposes so you’ll likely enjoy having a **basement** more than you would a simple **cellar**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cellars are used for food and wine storage. With no sunlight hitting the food and liquids, the use by date is extended. Modern **cellar**s have temperature control measures to ensure this. “Store in a cool, dry place” was invented by **cellar**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The space must be at least 2 meters high without the need to chop or break. If you are in an architecturally suitable **basement**/cave, then you should measure at least 2 meters in height with a measuring device. So you measure on the applied finish floor(carpet, laminate, or the like) to the ceiling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cellars are useful to have and many people wind up using them for storage purposes. If you consider yourself to be a wine aficionado, then you likely already know that wine **cellar**s are very popular. Storing items such as wine in a **cellar** is a common use for this type of space. People also use **cellar**s as storage areas for canned goods and other items. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **cellar** is an underground room. No sunlight enters a **cellar**. Temperatures remain steady and cool. Humidity can be adjusted. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What you decide to use your **cellar** for is completely up to you. There are not going to be quite as many practical uses for a **cellar** as there are for a true **basement**. Regardless, you’re going to find your **cellar** to be a helpful part of your home if you can make use of it in a way that makes sense for you. It might come in handy for storage or you might simply use it as a place to hide when storms are bad in your area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **cellar** is also an underground room but it is not present in all houses. It is used for storage of certain foods such as wine. Wine **cellar**s are common in houses where wine enthusiasts live. Cellars do have windows and they can be made into restaurants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
