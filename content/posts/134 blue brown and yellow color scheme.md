The key is to think “soft” – you don’t want your walls to pop so much as envelope you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **color** purple has long been associated with royalty, nobility, and power. For centuries, purple dye was so rare and expensive that only the wealthiest members of society could afford it.

-   Analogous Colors: The analogous **color** scheme is made up of three **color**s that are next to one another on the **color** wheel.

If you want your logo to feel like a specific natural setting, grab a photo of that setting and choose its most prominent **color**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whimsical + **color**ful = fun. If you’re not sure if your **color** scheme screams “fun,” ask yourself if you’d find those **color**s in a candy shop. Bright, warm, contrasting **color**s are loads of fun, as are neon and “unnatural” **color**s like pink and purple and lime green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
