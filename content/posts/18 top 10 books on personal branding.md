## 18 Reference List: Top 10 Books On Personal Branding | 12 Best Marketing Books To Grow Your Personal Brand
-   Let’s talk about book number four, Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World. This is by Kevin Kelly, whose work comes up regularly in our discussions at Five Books. Why this book, and why in the context of personal **branding**? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No. We just have to know that we already are extraordinary. The idea of **branding** is to be unique enough to stand out among the things that are just like you. As people, we tend to fall into the ‘everybody else’ syndrome because we forget who we are. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Personal **branding**, from my perspective, is essentially just the evolution of our resumes. It’s everything people can find out about us online. It’s the story that’s being told when we’re not around, and it’s a thing that either hinders or helps our future opportunities. If we’re not in control of it, or if we don’t understand what it is or where it is, then it’s hindering us a lot more than it’s helping. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s just fascinating. You asked if personal **branding** is just digital marketing. No. It’s a lot of things, and I think when it comes to the story she tells, there’s very little that she did that wasn’t personal, in a good way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s important for people to realise that a personal brand is unavoidable. At this point, having nothing about you online is oftentimes worse than having bad things about you. So that is the basis of personal **branding**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Interesting. Because I think that’s another issue people have with personal **branding**: it can feel limiting to commit to a single, unified version of yourself. We all contain multitudes. But you’re saying, don’t think of it as forever. Your image can evolve with you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’m sorry for anyone that disagrees, but I think that if we don’t think of it as propaganda, then we’re basically just tools for it and not really looking at what our marketing, **branding**, and even social media posting is doing to the world. It is so easy to believe that we cannot or are not impacting our world, but we are, every single one of us. As a marketer more generally, ethics is really important, but something for us all to consider. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Growing your personal brand continues to be a popular trend, especially among millennials. According to Business Insider, a staggering 1.8 billion photos are uploaded every day via social media. Inc.com points out that personal **branding** allows you to establish a reputation and an identity while still maintaining a personal level of trust and interaction, usually through social media. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Right. The algorithms themselves reflect what people are interested in, and exaggerate those tendencies further. Book number two is Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg’s How Google Works. Why do you recommend this book in the context of personal **branding**? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Interesting. A new take on ‘dress for the job you want.’ You mentioned earlier that you have a background in digital marketing. Is personal **branding** a form of digital marketing? Or does it extend beyond social media? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This list of **books** includes work from the 1960s up through 2015, and amazingly, all of the concepts and principles will still hold true across generations. No matter how much business evolves or expands, human nature will always care about compelling stories – the personal brand that you give in your elevator pitch. These time-tested philosophies hold strong, proving that a successful personal brand is everything. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Well, that leads us naturally to the first book that you’d like to discuss in the context of personal **branding**: Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man, by Marshall McLuhan. This was first published in 1964, decades before the advent of social media. Can we still learn from it? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So I think we have to switch the way we’re think about personal **branding**—from a self-promotion and vanity tool to: if you’re the right person, you need to speak up because otherwise all the people speaking up are seen as the experts, when they’re not. We’re getting a lot of bad information. Information without any basis of knowledge. That is something I think people can really take into consideration. If they did, we would have a more fulfilled, more educated world. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let’s move onto your final personal **branding** book. This is another classic text, this time published back in 1928. So tell me about Propaganda by Edward Bernays. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “As owner of a small company trying to figure out **branding**, this book was an invaluable read in helping me got going in the right direction. Branding is still a very large boondoggle of a neverending project, but now I at least feel like I have a better understanding of what it is I’m after. I see good **branding** everywhere, this book explains, as much as is possible, how to get there.” – Mark - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Okay, that makes sense. But I wonder if this is one of the things that makes personal **branding** into a fraught subject for so many people. It gets caught up in existential questions about people’s sense of who they really are, how they want to be seen, and whether those two things align. Put like that, devising a personal **branding** strategy sounds like an emotional deep-dive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “For knowing nothing about sales, this was a great launching pad for me to get more interested and read other sales **books**. Pretty motivational with great bits of information to redefine how you see the world. This book has definitely shifted my approach to “getting out there” making myself more visible.” – Scott - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “This book is a fantastic resource for anyone who desires to get to the next level. This is a smorgasbord of personal development, psychology, and business and financial **books** wrapped in one burrito. Are you hungry? This book will satisfy your appetite for success.” – Thomas - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
