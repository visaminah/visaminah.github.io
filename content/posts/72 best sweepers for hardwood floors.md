## 72 Unexpected Facts About Best Sweepers For Hardwood Floors | Vacuum That Won'T Scratch Hardwood Floors
-   Our team of experts has selected the best vacuums for **hardwood** floors out of hundreds of models. Based on our research, we’ve narrowed down the list to models from Shark, Eufy, and Tineco. We named Dyson as the Best of the Best in our Best Vacuums for Hardwood Floors category because of its superior quality and great consumer experience. We chose the Shark as our Best Bang for the Buck because of its overall quality and value. Read our full review for our pros, cons, and bottom line on each of the models we chose for our top five. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For example, homes with limited square footage may do well with a cordless stick vacuum. A home with a lot of square footage, or a mix of rugs and **hardwood**, might be better suited for an upright vacuum. Since **hardwood** floors do benefit from damp cleaning as well, some **hardwood**-friendly vacuums feature a wet-dry design. Having this type of vacuum can save you time, storage space (no more mop and bucket!), and increase cleaning efficiency. Our testers were very impressed by our "best wet-dry" pick, the Shark VacMop Pro Cordless Hard Floor Vacuum Mop, because it not only effectively sucked up hair and small debris, but also left hard flooring shiny and clean with its easy-to-apply mopping solution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The TINECO Floor One S3 claims to elevate your vacuum experience with user-friendly AI. We put this wet-dry vacuum to the test in The Lab and found that it does deliver an intuitive and effective clean on any **hardwood** floor. We gave this vacuum a 4-star rating for ease of assembling, as the process took us about three minutes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best Robot Vacuum for Hardwood Floors with Mopping function: with **hardwood** floors it is important to choose a robot vacuum cleaner with rubber wheels and good obstacle detection. In addition, it is important that the robot vacuum cleaner has good suction power on hard floor types and is easy to maintain.Best Robot Vacuum for Hardwood Floors: iRobot Roomba J7+ Best Robot Vacuum for Hardwood Floors and Carpet: Neato D8 Best Robot Vacuum for Hardwood Floors with Mopping function: Eufy Robovac L70 - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best Robot Vacuum for Hardwood Floors with Mopping function: a good robot vacuum cleaner for **hardwood** floors protects your floor against scratches and streaks. It is therefore important that it is equipped with larger rubber wheels and floor brushes with soft bristles. Of course, there must also be good suction power on hard floor types.Best Robot Vacuum for Hardwood Floors: iRobot Roomba J7+ Best Robot Vacuum for Hardwood Floors and Carpet: Neato D8 Best Robot Vacuum for Hardwood Floors with Mopping function: Eufy Robovac L70 - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The list above consists of all the best rated vacuum cleaners that you can currently get on the market. Depending on your personal preferences, you can easily choose the right one. But to make better use of them, especially when cleaning **hardwood** floors or dealing with pet hair, the following tips should be quite useful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Canister vacuums are the most versatile type of vacuum and, in my opinion, and the opinion of many others, the best option for both **hardwood** floors and rugs. Like the name states, they are made up of a canister that sits on the floor. The canister houses the motor and the bag or compartment that collects the debris. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With multiple suction speeds, all our picks allow you to clean different floor types, including **hardwood**. They also clean different types of stains without damaging your surface. While some of our picks are bagless, others have a dirtbag. The dirtbags are large enough to handle large amounts of dirt, allowing you to clean large areas before they fill up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Power For most **hardwood** floors, strong power isn’t necessarily better. Low-to-medium power will usually suffice. On hard and flat surfaces, it drives dirt to the air source. If your floor contains deep cracks, particles can get stuck. Therefore, select a vacuum with more power. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It has an attachment called the Power Punch Nozzle, which vibrates and helps loosen hairs that are embedded in your upholstery. The second advantage is a super-soft brush roll for cleaning **hardwood** floors without scratching them. That’s a must for when your cat tracks kitty litter all over your teak floors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cordless picks are growing in popularity, thanks to longer battery run times and increased cleaning power, too. (Note, our "best overall" pick, the Shark Vertex DuoClean PowerFins Cordless Stick Vacuum, has a battery life of 60 minutes.) Many households enjoy this type of vacuum for daily maintenance of **hardwood** floors and picking up smaller messes, since using and storing these models is less of a hassle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This stick vacuum cleaner is not only capable of handling **hardwood** and carpet flooring, but it can also be transformed into a stair or handheld vacuum. This allows you to use it anywhere in your home. It also comes with a capture nozzle, which helps suction debris with ease. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Accessories can amplify the cleaning power of your **hardwood** vacuum. Like other vacuum cleaners, most **hardwood** floor-friendly vacuums include a crevice tool for reaching narrow areas—like behind your sofa or next to appliances. Some also include attachments for dusting, or an upholstery tool for keeping pet hair off your furniture. Our "best for pet hair" pick, the Shark Canister Pet Bagless Corded Vacuum, has a multi-flex wand for removing debris from all the nooks and crannies in your home. This wand greatly improves the versatility and maneuverability of the vacuum. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Despite the Shark SV1106 Navigator Vacuum Cleaner coming with a large dust tank, it weighs only seven and a half pounds. As a result, it glides gracefully on top of every surface for deep cleaning. Its brush heads also have three different sensitivity levels for both **hardwood** and soft carpet flooring materials, and even for bare concrete floors. However, it feels pretty cheap in hand, mostly due to its glossy plastic body that regularly attracts scratches and scuff marks, even if you try to use it carefully. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you charge the Tineco Floor One Vacuum Cleaner fully, it offers up to 22 minutes of continuous runtime, even on the “MAX” and the smart “AUTO” modes. It works the best for **hardwood** flooring and also does a stellar job on laminated, linoleum, sealed wood, and marbled flooring. But for tile, you’ll probably need a top vacuum for tile floors. However, both of Tineco’s dust tanks aren’t very large. As a result, you might have to empty both of those dust tanks multiple times while cleaning a large home, which can become a huge hassle for the user. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cordless vacuums, on the other hand, can be used anywhere. However, you have to recharge their battery. If you want to be able to clean all of the **hardwood** floors in your home without pausing to charge the battery, look for a vacuum that has a runtime of at least 30 minutes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Eureka Lightweight Cordless Vacuum Cleaner is an easy-to-use and effective choice for a **hardwood** floor vacuum, especially if you don't want to spend too much on your latest cleaning tool. Our tester gave it 5 stars for its super simple assembly and intuitive design. It also earned a 5-star rating for maneuverability, proving to be easy to handle and light at just 7.15 pounds, as its name promises. Our tester said this would be an easy unit to carry up and down stairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It has a high-quality LCD display on its head, which conveniently reports all vital stats in real-time mode, and even shows maintenance alerts which is a lifesaver. It also sports the brand’s patented DLS (Dynamic Load Sensor), which automatically adjusts the suction rate between **hardwood** flooring and soft carpet flooring without requiring any manual intervention. Best of all, its long-lasting battery life does not equate to a heavy body, thanks to its advanced seven-cell light lithium-ion system. And it includes a wall-mountable charging dock for easy storage. Though it’s good to know how to maintain your vacuum, it never hurts to make use of a vacuum warranty or even the best insurance for homeowners. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A cordless vacuum for cleaning **hardwood** floors is a device made specifically to clean debris from **hardwood** without damaging it. These vacuums can easily pick up dust bunnies, dirt, human hair, pet hair, pet dander, and other dry messes, thanks to their powerful suction. Depending on the model you purchase, the best cordless vacuum for hard floors may also offer mop functionality. This way, you can also clean up wet messes that might otherwise spoil your floors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Then, we challenged the vacuums' maneuverability by navigating them through a living room–inspired obstacle course. The course included a rug, low-sitting couch, and low-sitting coffee table. We evaluated how well each vacuum transitioned from smooth floors to the carpeting, before noting the ease of emptying each and whether it had a bin or a bag. Our testers also collected insights on the noise level of each product and how long cordless models stayed charged, and rated the product's overall value based on their entire experience. To conclude, our editors took all of this consistently applied testing data and boiled it down to the best **hardwood** floor vacuums for your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The iLife V3S Pro does a great job removing pet hair and cat litter from **hardwood** floor and low carpet. It uses bump-and-run navigation, rather than mapping, and it can’t avoid cords or poop like the Roomba j7+ can, but it’ll clean your whole space eventually. It can’t empty itself, unlike more expensive robots, and it doesn’t have a bin fill indicator. But if you make it a habit to empty the dust bin every day, it’ll drastically cut down on pet hair in your space for very little effort on your part. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   FAQ When is it better to vacuum, rather than sweep, **hardwood** floors? Sweeping is an excellent way to clean up large debris, but if your **hardwood** floors are particularly dusty or covered in small debris, you should opt for a vacuum instead. Thanks to its suction power, a vacuum can pick up the fine dirt and dust particles that a broom might not be able to. Nicholas Burks, CEO of Atlanta-based cleaning company Neet Home, says that you should look for a vacuum with high suction power so that it picks up more dust and allergens around your house. "Plainly put, the more suction power a vacuum cleaner has, the better its performance," he says. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It can be difficult to find a robot vacuum that's effective on **hardwood** floors, but the eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 30C MAX impressed our tester with its powerful and efficient performance.

-   Will a robotic vacuum clean **hardwood** floors? Using a robotic vacuum—like our "best robot" pick, the eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 30C MAX—is one of the least labor-intensive ways to keep your home clean. As long as your robotic vacuum can adjust its height and suction settings (Some models can do this automatically, and others may require you to change the settings remotely or via an app.), you can count on it to clean **hardwood** and tile as effectively as it cleans carpeted areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It also comes with a modular body, and its removable 1-liter dust tank is extremely easy to clean and maintain, even for a novice user.

-   While weight and maneuverability are important when shopping for any type of vacuum, these factors are especially important for homeowners searching for the best vacuums for **hardwood** floors.

-   And that’s why Diana Rodriguez-Zaba, president of ServiceMaster Restoration by Zaba in Chicago, Illinois, recommends vacuums with HEPA filters. “They’re best for **hardwood** floors because floors tend to accumulate a ton of dust, pollen, and other allergens that can easily become airborne once disturbed,” she explains. “HEPA filters effectively eliminate these pollutants from your floors without spreading them in the air and contaminating your home.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **hardwood** floor vacuums have a floor head designed for use on hard surface floors as well, but some also include an additional floor head for use on carpeting in their box.

-   For heavier cleaning, John recommends stick vacuums above all. “Make sure your stick vacuum can go on both **hardwood** and carpet and that it is padded in some way, so that it glides over your flooring without risk of scratches.” In addition, he suggests looking at very flexible vacuums with attachments that can fit into every area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Additionally, devices designed to clean **hardwood** floors don’t typically come with strong power. Middle-to-low suction power will suffice. Compared to carpeted floorings, it doesn’t require as much force to pick up dirt on hard floors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our testers were immediately impressed by how sturdy and powerful this mid-priced vacuum cleaner was. It was able to suck up all of the kibble and pet hair from every surface in just two passes on the highest setting, and it removed almost all of the hair and kibble on the quiet setting, too. There are different settings for **hardwood** and carpet, and the vacuum comes with a few attachments, including a motorized pet tool that breaks up hair within the brush to prevent tangles and clogs. It also has a HEPA filter to trap allergens and prevent them from releasing back into the air. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

During our multiple vacuum tests in The Lab, we unboxed and assembled each model, timing how long the process took, noting how clear the instructions were, and rating the ease of setup. We then evaluated each vacuum's effectiveness by spilling measured amounts of hair, popcorn kernels, and Cheerios on a **hardwood** floor sample and a low, medium, and high-pile carpet. We rated each on its portability and how many passes were needed to clean up the spilled materials. We also noted if hair got tangled in the beater bar. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Other options include handheld vacuums, which are smaller and often better for tough-to-reach areas or tight corners, and robot vacuums, which do all the work for you after proper programming. There are also wet/dry vacuums for **hardwood** floors that use water or a cleaning solution to get the tougher spots but can also be used as a simple dry vacuum. Within these types are options such as corded or cordless, different styles of dustbins, and more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

They provide a cushion between the metallic or plastic parts of the device and the ground. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your **hardwood** floors should be the last place that you work your vacuum on, if you’re planning to do a deep cleaning session of the entire house. By dusting off all the shelves and collecting hairs on your furniture first, you’ll allow all the remaining to land on the floors. Hence, your final hard floor vacuuming sessions will really finish things up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How often should you vacuum a **hardwood** floor? How often you should vacuum a **hardwood** floor depends on how much foot traffic your home has on a daily basis. Pets, children, and the weather may also contribute to your vacuum schedule. If you have a no-shoes-in-the-house policy, you may not need to vacuum as often, because your tracking in less dirt from outside. However, if you don't take your shoes off when you enter your home, you may want to pull out your vacuum at least once a week, if not more, to ensure that the floor stays free of large clumps of dirt and dust. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes time to make a buying decision on which cordless vacuum for **hardwood** floors you need, there are a few key factors to consider. For starters, you’ll need to decide which specific type of vacuum to buy. Then, you’ll also need to consider what kind of strong suction power and battery life you should purchase.

While some vacuums scatter debris on hard floors, this Shark vacuum did not and earned a 5-star rating for its stellar performance. A bright LED light on the floor head ensures that you can spot dirt and crumbs, and when the rechargeable battery runs low, this LED light flashes to alert you that it’s time to recharge. However, the fact that this cordless vac operates for up to 60 minutes on a single charge is impressive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Marisa Casciano is the senior commerce editor for appliances, cleaning, and organization for The Spruce and has been in The Lab for our vacuum tests. She has firsthand knowledge of how our tests were developed and performed, as well as where each product excelled or fell short.

The quiet operation of this vacuum is a bonus—it was easy to carry a conversation while using it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a battery-operated model, and it easily lasted through the 17-minute testing process, and still had half of its power remaining when all was said and done. We found that the vac works great on **hardwood** floors and upholstery alike, though it was less efficient on carpet, leaving some hair behind after multiple passes. When it comes to clearing out collected dust and debris, a button allows you to remove the entire dust bin for easy emptying over your trash can. When it comes to noise level, the vacuum could be quieter as well, but is not as loud as some other picks we've tested that are an absolute nuisance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing the right type of vacuum for **hardwood** floors can be tough. The most common type is the upright vacuum, which stands up straight when not in use and tilts back when you press a button or switch on the handle, allowing for easy movement across the floor.
