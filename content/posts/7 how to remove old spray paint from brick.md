-   However, if the project gets the green light, there are a few things you’re going to want to avoid. First, while it seems like it might make sense to sandblast or pressure wash the **paint**ed brick, don’t. This treatment can weaken or damage older, brittle brick. That might be the reason it was **paint**ed in the first place. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’re also going to want to avoid caustic chemicals when removing **paint** from brick. These solutions tend to have the same adverse effects on older brick surfaces as sandblasting does. It can also make old brick more brittle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That brick wall probably looked good at some point, but then someone covered it with **paint**. Why? Who knows. We could sit around questioning the aesthetic preferences of someone else till we’re blue in the face. But at the end of the day, that classic brick surface still has a layer of old, rubbery garbage smeared across it, and we still want to restore the original look. It’s a challenge, so we wrote this article on how to remove **paint** from brick without ruining it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That being the case, if you have clients that have requested a quote, it’s wise to inspect the job thoroughly first.

If you follow some of these tips for removing **paint** from brick surfaces, you might just save some time and mitigate some frustration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Basically, you’ll scrape off any peeling **paint** that might be present, and then apply the remover. Fiber or paper strips are applied next. As the remover cures, usually in 24 hours or less, a chemical reaction occurs. The **paint** bonds with the fiber and you gently peel it away, taking the **paint** with it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, you’ll need to determine if the brick will look nice enough to be un**paint**ed. Ask your client if you can inspect and even test a removal process in an inconspicuous area. How many layers of **paint** are there? What is the brick’s condition? It’ll be much easier to quote (or not quote) using a test area. After testing, you and your client might decide that the cost of **paint** removal outweighs the benefits, and they’ll just learn to live with the **paint**ed brick. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
