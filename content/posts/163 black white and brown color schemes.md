-   You’ve heard before that white goes with just about every **color**, and brown is no exception to that rule. Pairing any shade of brown with a crisp white will give you a clean contrast that works well in a room like a formal dining room or living room. If white and brown are your two main **color**s in any room, make sure you vary the shades to keep it interesting. Shades of dark brown or woods such as teak pop well against white too. For this living room they chose to use white as the main **color**, with brown furniture and wood accents providing the contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

But feel free to have more or fewer **color**s in your own **schemes**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is a **color** perceived as natural and neutral; pairing it with green plays into the grounding feeling of nature, bringing it into your home. Lighter shades of green like mint soften the darker furniture in a room. Using darker shades of green paired with dark brown accents or wooden furniture creates a darker, moody vibe that would work for a den or office space, as seen in the photo below. There are few combinations of green and brown that wouldn’t complement each other thanks to the two **color**s being natural foils in nature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The RG or red–green **color** space is a **color** space that uses only two primary **color**s: red and green. It was used on early **color** processes for films.[2][3] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 4-bit RGBI palette is similar to the 3-bit RGB palette but adds one bit for intensity. This allows each of the **color**s of the 3-bit palette to have a dark and bright variant, potentially giving a total of 23×2 = 16 **color**s. However, some implementations had only 15 effective **color**s due to the "dark" and "bright" variations of black being displayed identically. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A powerful **color** generator is also provided via the ipolate() option. The procedure is to select a start **color** and an end **color**, and perhaps some intermediate **color**s, and then apply interpolation to generate a **color** scale. Several suboptions to select the interpolation space, to set the positions of the origin **color**s, or to affect the shape of the transition between the **color**s are available; see the help file of **color**palette for details. Some examples are as follow: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you can see from the **color** **schemes** above, using tints, tones, and shades in your **color** **schemes** is vital. Pure hues all have similar values and saturation levels.

-   Although both the background and foreground objects are teal, the different shades make them distinguishable.

-   When considering the best **color**s to go with brown in your home, yellow should be at the top of your list. You could opt for a lively shade of yellow to give you a needed pop of **color**, or consider a rich shade of golden yellow. Pairing brown with yellow creates a contemporary vibe in a bedroom or sitting room. Using the 60-30-10 rule would work well when pairing yellow and brown. 60% of the room should be a neutral shade such as white, with 30% of the room decorated in various shades of brown, and the last 10% is reserved for yellow accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   A sanctuary from bustling city life, this urban living area is a perfect example of how monochromatic **color**s bring harmony to a room. The **color** palette is very simple: an ivory carpet and couch, taupe tables and walls, and purple accessories. However, the three different shades of purple shown in the throw pillows, art, drapes, and lamps “finish” the room, turning it into a more complex and harmonious space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You won’t find brown on the traditional **color** wheel, but since its closest shade is orange, many use blue as a complementary **color** for brown. Combining blue and brown tones can make a relaxing environment out of an ordinary bedroom. Brown leather paired with navy blue makes a room feel rustic and refined, whereas pale blue paired with beige or a lighter wood creates a more serene environment. The cool tones in shades of blue mix well with the warm browns of darker wooden furniture without leaving the room feeling too dark or heavy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Brown is a neutral and natural **color** that, when used in the right environment, can create a warm, stable feeling in any room. An excess of brown or wooden furniture can create a dark, heavy feel in your space. That’s why it’s important to integrate shades of brown into a **color** palette with **color**s and shades that complement it. When looking for a neutral shade to paint your home with brown is often passed over for whites or grays, but you shouldn’t rule it out! It’s all about knowing the **color**s that go with brown—and the best ways to incorporate them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Otherwise, their attention will shift to the **color**ful background instead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you mix in tones, shades, and tints, you expand the basic 12-spoke **color** wheel into an infinite number of **color**s for use in your designs. One of the simplest ways to create a professional looking **color** scheme is to take a few tones, tints, and shades of a given **color** (avoiding the pure hue), and then add in another pure hue (or close to pure) that’s at least three spaces away on the **color** wheel (part of a tetradic, triatic, or split-complementary **color** scheme) as an accent **color**. This adds visual interest to your **color** scheme while still retaining a sense of balance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

This is what we call complementary **color**s . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But what are harmonious **color**s? They can be different tones and shades of the same **color**, known as a monochromatic **color** scheme. Many people think that only black, gray, and white are monochromatics, but in truth, any **color** can be used in a monochromatic **color** palette. Analogous **color** is another type of harmonious **color** combination. These are **color**s which are next to each other on the **color** wheel. Some examples are blue and green, red and orange, and purple and blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   It must be noticed that not all systems using 16-bit **color** depth employ the 16-bit, 32-64-32 level RGB palette. Platforms like the Sharp X68000 home computer or the Neo Geo video game console employs the 15-bit RGB palette (5 bits are used for red, green, and blue), but the last bit specifies a less significant intensity or luminance. The 16-bit mode of the Truevision TARGA/AT-Vista/NU-Vista graphic cards and its associated TGA file format also uses 15-bit RGB, but it devotes its remaining bit as a simple alpha channel for video overlay. The Atari Falcon can also be switched into a matching mode by setting of an "overlay" bit in the graphics processor mode register when in 16-bit mode, meaning it can actually display in either 15- or 16-bit **color** depth depending on application. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
