## 52 Unexpected Facts About What To Draw With Copic Markers | Markers Review for Artists
-   Ciao **markers** were released in 1998 and are available in 180 colors. They have a round barrel, are also dual tipped, and have the same nibs as the Sketch. They hold the least amount of ink and are less expensive than the other 3 styles so they make an excellent beginner or student choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As mentioned above, Copic **markers** are refillable. Copic ink has a new design. I like to drip on the chisel nib, when a marker starts to get dry (20+ drops). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Standout colors: Shock Pink (neon, bordering on fluorescent), Chrome Orange (melted orange popsicle), Lilac, (a bright, true purple), Blue Green (a deep, rich teal), Yellow Green (an almost neon spring green), Ultramarine Blue (a true, rich, intense ultramarine), and probably my favorite color of the set Cool Shadow (a beautiful, very pale aqua). One color I might miss when working with Set A would be a very pale violet. Because Copic **markers** are transparent, you can get some gorgeous layering effects and color mixes. The sky’s the limit once you start mixing and laying. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before inking, I make some tweaks and add details with pencil, and then put down a thin line mostly with the Sepia Copic Multiliner. Sepia is a safe choice because almost all other colours can cover it in the second stage of inking. Note that ink fades when used with **markers**, so there’s no need to overwork the line art at this stage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I recommend using water-based **markers** for coloring books. My reasoning is that they’re a dryer marker so you’ll see less bleed-through and less feathering (where the ink travels out farther than you intended). Plus, the coloring spaces tend to be small. Small spaces are easier to keep wet so you can usually get a nice look from water-based **markers**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Alcohol **markers** tend to pick up ink that’s already on the paper, so it’s best to start from the lightest parts of the composition and build up darker colours gradually. The tip will always find a chance to pick up dark ink and create smudges. Bearing this in mind, I start colouring the skin first. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Liquitex Paint Marker are made from acrylic, water-based ink, which is lightfast due to the pigments it is made from. Color range: 50. Nibs: Flat, stiff nib. The Liquitex **markers** come in two sizes: 2mm by 4mm and 8mm by 15mm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’m using the same colours for both the hair and the blouse tied around her waist. I use the side with a brush nib for her hair, which enables me to blend softly. For the blouse I use the broad nib of the **markers** to create a realistic material look. Using **markers** with different tips makes it possible to create a range of textures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And the price point for a half marker – which has as much ink as most other alcohol **markers** – is much less. You need to get two to make a marker, which makes a “full” pen more expensive, but for twice the ink, well – you see how that math goes. They are definitely less expensive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I love using vibrant gradient colours to paint hair! Copic **markers** can blend seamlessly and to achieve this I regularly switch between **markers**, using a lighter colour to create smooth blends. It takes some patience, but it’s worth it. I would recommend blending your **markers** while the ink is still wet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After much research I found this sketchbook that got good reviews both for alcohol **markers** and water based — and it’s not that slick marker paper that I don’t like working on. Due to the world we live in now, it took a while for my sketchbook to arrive, but I jammed on it right away when I got it. Class didn’t get finished but…..I’m well on the way! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spectrum Noir Illustrator are alcohol-based **markers** for drawing and painting. Color range: 216. Nibs: One brush and one fine bullet nib. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Copic Ciao is the most economical of all Copic **markers**. They deliver the same quality but at a more attractive price. They come in 180 colors. On the Copic Ciao, there is no caption on the cap, and its cylindrical structure causes it to roll on the work surface: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Uni POSCA are opaque, water-based **markers**. Color range: 55. Nibs: Bullet, they come in many sizes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Winsor & Newton Promarker Watercolour are water-based **markers** that can be used for drawing and painting. Color range: 36. Nibs: Two nibs, one brush and one bullet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **markers** are designed for drawing on non-absorbent paper. Many **markers** have a high level of transparency, so they are quite light. Adding more layers of the same color will make it more opaque and therefore darker. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Copic **markers** are used by professional artists, designers, illustrators, students, crafters, hobbyists, and anyone who enjoys working with high quality permanent **markers**. You can safely rely on these **markers** for their consistency of color, the color system, and the manufacturing quality. Not only are Copic **markers** used to create highly detailed, finished marker drawings/paintings, they are also perfect for quick sketches and drawing on location. You can easily grab a handful of Copics, a sketchbook, and head out into the world to get inspired. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is an ultra-thin nib that can be purchased, unique to Promarker, which is great for precise details, a bit like a technical pen. Cons: A cylindrical structure that causes rolling of the marker pen on the work surface. Conclusion: I prefer a brush tip, but these are quality, affordable **markers**, with a hard tip for accuracy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you notice the color waning or the marker isn’t as juicy as it once was it’s time to refill the ink. A “Various Ink” refill bottle will get you 8-10 refills for Sketch **markers**. Refill inks can also be mixed to create custom colors and put into a Sketch Original empty marker. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A cylindrical structure that causes rolling of the marker pen on the work surface. Conclusion: I love these **markers**. They are fun to use and work well with other alcohol-based **markers**. See on Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Zig Clean Color Real Brush are water-based **markers** and can be used together with water and a brush, like painting with watercolors. Color range: 90. Nibs: One real brush from synthetic bristles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Small nib sizes are great for details. Cons: These paint **markers** are intended for covering and not blending. My favorite covering marker pens are Uni POSCA: See on Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Winsor & Newton Pigment Marker are alcohol-based (ethanol) **markers** with quality ink that is made of quality pigments. Color range: 100. Nibs: One side bullet nib, other side flat nib (chisel). There are two types of blender: a transparent blender, as in other brands, and a unique white blender. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can use **markers** for almost any drawing or painting style. I use them for drawing cartoon characters for my daughter. Here is my guide on how to draw accurately from photos (and draw your favorite comics). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Coloring Books: Coloring books are usually printed on manila style paper which frankly doesn’t work well for alcohol OR water-based **markers**. Because manila is a low quality, wood pulp paper which degrades easily when wetted with alcohol or water. Quality varies from book to book which leaves coloring book fans constantly disappointed when the images they love are printed on terrible paper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It can be helpful to introduce an intermediate marker to create color blends. It’s easier to blend from yellow to red using a yellow, an orange, and a red Copic than it is to just use a yellow and a red. If it’s easier using 3 **markers** to mix analogous colors (colors next to each other on the color wheel) you may want to use 4 or 5 when mixing complementary colors on opposite sides of the color wheel. So to transition from say blue to orange you may want to use 4 or even 5 **markers** to move through the more neutral colors you’ll get in the middle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   F = fluorescent. There are 8 fluorescent **markers**. If the last digit is a 1, the ink contains pigments; if the last digit is a 2, the ink contains dyes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As noted above, painting with **markers** is done on suitable paper that is smooth, does not absorb paint, and allows for smooth mixing between shades. Most marker brands provide paper sheets suitable for the same brand, but can be used with other marker brands. Thin sheets of paper are convenient for training and testing different combinations of colors, and their price is low. For paintings intended for sale or display, it is recommended to use thick sheets of paper that do not bend easily. Paper sheets for pencil drawing and sketching can also be used, especially with alcohol-based **markers**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Copic Markers appeared on my radar almost two years ago and I haven’t looked back since. It was around the time I started my Instagram page, and my followers could see how the collection of five **markers** was growing slowly and how much could be achieved with just a few pens. For my ink drawings (opens in new tab), I often limit my usage of **markers**; a few colours can create refreshing works, while using too many can have the opposite effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Markers are great tools for field sketching. They lay down an even area of tone. With a small set of shades of gray, you can produce fast value studies. The **markers** will quickly bleed through thin paper so either put a blotter sheet behind the page you are working on or sketch on heavyweight paper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most marker brands provide a blender marker that is actually a marker with colorless liquid for mixing colors. A liquid layer for blending can be applied before or after coloring with **markers**. In addition: Blender **markers** can be used to create unique textures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Winsor & Newton Promarker Brush (formerly known as Brushmarker) are alcohol-based **markers**. They are great for painting, and they blend with other brands of alcohol-based **markers**. Color range: 72. Nibs: One flexible brush nib and one broad chisel. Note: Carefully close the cap in order to avoid damaging the brush nib. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Winsor & Newton Promarker are alcohol-based **markers**. Color range: 173. Nibs: Twin-tipped, with a broad chisel nib and fine bullet nib. Due to their bullet nib, they are great for drawing. The chisel nib can be used to fill large areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re truly unfamiliar with **markers** I’d just experiment a bit at first. Try out the different techniques mentioned here in a sketchbook. See which ones you like. Are there any that you have a natural affinity for? Practice for awhile before you start a full on drawing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   MICRONS ARE NOT SAFE FOR USE WITH ALCOHOL MARKERS. Read my article here about the danger of using Microns with Copic Markers. Stick with water-based **markers** if using a Micron pen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To create a simple one hue gradation, let’s say from light blue to dark blue, choose 3 blue **markers**: a light blue, a midtone blue, and a dark blue. Moving from left to right, lay down a patch of color with the light blue marker then quickly to the right of it lay down some of the midtone blue overlapping the outer third of the light blue. Then quickly lay some of the dark blue to the right of the midtone blue, again overlapping and layering about a third of the midtone blue. Work the edges of the colors together and go back and forth between the **markers** as needed until you get the effect you want. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re using water-based **markers**, you’ll likely want to add a paintbrush and clear water to get smoother blends or create watercolor like effects. Water-based **markers** are at a clear disadvantage when coloring large. You’ll also need to switch to water friendly paper which can resist buckling, warping, and pilling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For this workshop I challenged myself to come up with a simple character design (opens in new tab), mostly to focus on and demonstrate how I use Copic Markers (see this Black Friday Copic marker post if you need your own **markers**), but don’t be deceived! The character and the pose may be simple, but I equipped this girl with accessories and details that add to her personality. At the first glance she may look innocent and harmless, but then you notice a faint smile and one lifted eyebrow complemented by a little patch on her jaw, a sabre cat skull design on her top and claw-like earrings. Then you realise that she’s up to no good. Blue colours calm the painting and pink glasses add to a dreamlike atmosphere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The synthetic bristles, allows for the coloring of especially narrow areas, but also large areas, depending on the degree of pressure applied. Cons: Small caption makes it difficult to find the desired marker. Conclusion: My favorite water-based **markers**. See on Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the Faber-Castell PITT Series, there are also technical pens, big brush **markers**, and calligraphy marker pens. Cons: A limited number of shades. Good to know: If you like drawing trees, make sure you visit my guide for drawing realistic trees with pens. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Copics are wet but not overly so. If you are using appropriate paper (designated marker paper) there is little to no marker bleed. Out of 72 **markers** maybe 2 or 3 produced a very slightly fuzzy edge. The vast majority produce edges that are crisp or ever so slightly velvety. If you end up working an area over and over you may get some bleed through to the back of the paper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lightfastness is the durability of paint (pigment or dye) to resist fading when exposed to light. All marker pens in this review are of high quality and by well-known brands. I had no issue with any of them when it comes to fading, as long as they are kept away from direct sunlight. Direct Sunlight Test: Paints from most **markers** in this article were exposed to direct sunlight for 10 days. The results: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Faber-Castell PITT artist pen are water-based **markers**. Color range: 60, including 11 gray shades that are equipped with a soft brush. Nibs: One brush nib. Markers with durable ink that contain pigments, and can be purchased individually or as part of a set. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Refillable ink and replaceable nibs (4 nib types). Cons: Not as lightfast as some other brands (more on that later). Conclusion: High-grade **markers** with comfortable structure. An affordable substitute to Copic **markers**, though not as lightfast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The aesthetic of Copic Sketch **markers** overall? As if Apple decided to make an iMarker. They’re minimalistic and modern and feel good in your hand. The light gray barrel is oval shaped with a darker gray band around one end that indicates the end with the brush nib. This tells you which end has which nib quickly without having to look too closely. There are icons of the nibs on each end also, but they are rather tiny and are only on one side of the barrel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   BUST THE MYTH: Micron Pens are NEVER safe for use with alcohol **markers**. There is no amount of cure time, no amount of heat setting, no prohibitive paper, and no magic pixie dust which can prevent smearing. Microns use alcohol soluble ink, they will smear and drag color when they come in contact with alcohol ink. They also ruin alcohol marker nibs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Copic **markers** are refillable. Copic nibs are of the highest quality, and are replaceable. Cons: Copic **markers** are quite expensive. However, when using the refill bottles, they are worth the investment. Conclusion: These are my absolute favorite **markers**! See on Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Marker pens can be stored in plastic bags or plastic boxes that can be left slightly open for ventilation. There are designated cases for **markers**, but they are less effective for a large amount of **markers**. Markers can be stored as color groups in order to quickly find the desired marker. I store my **markers** in a horizontal position. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   They are fun to work with on paper designed for water-based **markers**. Cons: A limited number of colors. Conclusion: Affordable **markers** for the art hobbyist. See on Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A cylindrical structure that causes rolling of the marker on the work surface. Conclusion: Although limited in color range, I love working with these **markers**. Super fun brush. See on Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Koi Coloring Brush Pen are water-based **markers**. Color range: 48. Nibs: One brush nib. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   TOUCH Twin brush **markers** are excellent alcohol-based **markers**. Color range: 204. Nibs: Fine brush nib on one end and a medium-wide chisel nib on the other. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
