-   iPad and Apple Pencil: this is my go-to for digital art. I bought a Like Paper screen protector for my iPad, which gives my iPad a textured surface that feels a lot like paper. Given how precise and quick Apple Pencils are, they really do feel like traditional **pen**cils. I’ve tried all of the other options on this list, but my iPad and Apple Pencil is what felt the most natural to me. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Personally, I don’t mess with the opacity bar very much. I use **pen**cils with Procreate a lot, so I do find the brush size slider useful. It can get confusing when I switch over to paints or markers though. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You have the option to draw free-hand with your **pen** or you can use the shape tools to get a just-right look to your **drawing**s. The Boolean operations make it easy to convert selected objects in the file to “paths” using simple directions like “exclusion, combine, or break apart.” You can render as you draw, too, and watch your **drawing**s come alive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hands are the ideal subject for beginners, with different gestures providing perfect practice for perspective, scale, curves and lines. Use with either a photo or a wooden artist’s model of a hand that can be moved into different positions. Beginners should try **drawing** the basic outline of an o**pen** hand, starting with the palm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   GIMP is a freeware and o**pen**-source digital painting software. The full form of GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is used for image editing and retouching, free-form **drawing**, convert images into different formats, and more specialized work. This program is released under GPLv3+ licenses and is available for macOS, Microsoft Windows, and Linux. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to do digital art on your phone PaperColor gives you everything you need to get started. Instead of a minimal UI, this app lays the **pen**s and brushes out in front of you. It's as close to an easel and canvas as you can get from an Android paint app. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sketch Club also has an integrated community, which is great for getting motivation and inspiration. The community has daily challenges, weekly competitions, monthly group events, annual awards, and more. The tutorials are also fantastic if you're trying to improve your **drawing** skills. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re wondering whether Wacom tablets work with Macs then the good news is that they do. The Wacom Cintiq 22 is our top rated **drawing** tablet for Mac Wacom are still the industry leaders in **drawing** tablets. Wacom was the first company to come up with tablets that accurately represented **drawing** on paper such as the incredibly realistic Wacom Intuos Pro Paper Edition and the Wacom range easily remain the best **drawing** tablets on the market. In recent years, it has faced competition from Chinese brand Huion which offer many of the same features for half the price, although with more technical headaches and quality issues. Wacom tend to be some of the most ex**pen**sive graphics tablets on the market but in our experience, they’re definitely worth it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   : Take the wire and measure it with the body of the **pen**. You need to take the length of the wire more than the body of the **pen**. Step 3 : Now remove the plastic coating from the wire with the help of scissor and pull out a string of copper wire from it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re serious about **drawing**, we recommend paying more for a better tablet than starting with a cheap one and then upgrading later. Tablets like the Wacom Cintiq 22 and iPad Pro certainly cost more but also offer more features and therefore room to grow. Changing tablets later on also requires adapting again to a new feel and often re-configuring your device to work with **drawing** applications again, buying new accessories, changing software etc. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . Does the software collect personal data when making digital art? If it does, does the app ask for user consent before doing so? Does it allow third-party cookies? Check the security and privacy features before settling on an app. Price . You can choose free or paid software. However, you might want to start with a free option and upgrade to paid **drawing** software as you learn, to access advanced features. When upgrading, check for: Free trials Whether the upgrade is a one-time purchase or subscription-based - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, it offers you the freedom to draw on a computer with a stylus. You can draw on a computer as you’d have done with paper and **pen**cil—the tablet is your paper, and the stylus is your **pen**cil. This solves the problem of **drawing** with a mouse (which is usually a pain in artistry life). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Corel Painter is another digital art tool for professional artists. It allows you to paint and draw with tools as you’d do with a typical **drawing**. Digital watercolours flow, mix, absorb and evaporate just like the real thing. It’s excellent if you are used to traditional painting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Plus, it’s common to have colour sparkles on display tablets due to applying excess pressure on the monitor. Screen degradation over time can also cause this. Colour sparkle is an unpleasant experience when **drawing** with a tablet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Digital art platforms like Procreate are absolutely incredible given how realistic their brushes, **pen**cils, and **pen**s are. I’ve done tons of digital artwork that looks like it could have been done traditionally. Experimenting with all of the different tools and seeing what they can do is one of my favorite pastimes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can do this in Illustrator using a feature called Live Trace, which is located in the Control panel. Once you apply this to your **drawing**, you will see that most lines are now smooth and sharp. You may still see some small irregularities (which you can fix using the **pen**cil tool), but nothing like the original pixelation of your **drawing**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I love shading with paper and **pen**cil and wanted to figure out how to do that digitally. With a little trial and error, I was able to replicate the same effect and feeling I get from traditional shading with my digital shading. I do experiment with Procreate’s more advanced features, but I’m a happy camper with my digital shading. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Instead of banging your head against your tablet trying to figure out why the paint doesn’t function exactly like real world paint, you’ll be o**pen** to the idea that things work differently in this digital world. Basically, you’ll be more willing and able to learn. But how, exactly? Let’s talk about that next. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes, buying a stylus **pen** would cost a little more, which is why most of us take a step back from it. However, you can easily create your stylus **pen** at home, which works like the regular **pen**. The best part about this stylus **pen** is that it is wholly made of recyclable material. However, it does not have any extra features as the brand-new stylus **pen** has, but if you want it for everyday use, then it would work especially. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remember that the stylus tool you use matters, too. While some computers come with a stylus, others require a separate purchase. Stylus **pen**s can have any number of their own features, too, including shortcut buttons and extra-comfy grips. Do your research to make sure that your stylus is compatible with your PC or laptop so you can achieve the level of detail you want. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whichever method you use, save the image as the highest possible quality and email or AirDrop it to yourself. Then, o**pen** it up in your software of choice, like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. At this point, it’s helpful to create a duplicate copy to work from. That way, you can always access the original if you need to go back to it at any point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. GIMP, or GNU Image Manipulation Program, is another free image editing option. Because GIMP is an o**pen**-source program, anyone—including you—can make changes to it and distribute those changes to others. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike physical mediums, **drawing** tablets work along with software to create different effects—which means that you can switch from something like digital watercolours to digital calligraphy in an instant. You can draw, sketch, edit photos, and more with the natural comfort of holding a **pen**. Whether you're a beginner or pro, a graphics tablet can be your artistic conduit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Graphics Tablet: a graphics tablet connects to your computer. You draw on the tablet’s small surface with its included **pen** and your **drawing** shows up on your computer. I used a graphics tablet when I first dove into digital art. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   From here, you simply choose a color, and then click the shape you’d like to fill with that color. When you’ve finished adding color to your **drawing**, click on the image and select Expand in the toolbar. This will turn off the Live Paint feature and convert your **drawing** back to a static image. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Really popular and cheap for its capabilities. Has a free trial. It has a pretty good **drawing** engine overall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Besides its physical aspects, a tablet's screen is critical to its performance. If you're trying to create photorealistic works of art, a high resolution is probably worth the price. On the other hand, if you just want to practice your **drawing** skills without fear of losing your work, a run-of-the-mill tablet with lower resolution is going to be more cost-effective. Plus, the thickness of a screen will affect parallax — the shifting of a line or object based on a person's perspective, caused by the distance (however minute) between **pen** and interface, separated by the screen. You'll want to minimize parallax to keep your perspective consistent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First let's talk about the ones you can get for free “as in gratis.” It's said that there is no such thing as a “free meal.” But this is an exception as most of these were done by talented people that believe in freedom of software (o**pen** source) . Neat uh? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Then, you need to start by adding plain colors to all shapes available in the **drawing**. The sketches are only used throughout the process as references. Once plain colors are added, you can start to create a few shadows and volume to the character by adding different tones gradually. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This de**pen**ds heavily on how you plan to use a **drawing** tablet. If you’re a digital artist, illustrator, photo editor, to architect, for example, a **drawing** tablet offers a huge advantage compared to creating your content on paper or canvas, since the tablet lets you take your creations direct to digital. Plus, when used with an appropriate stylus, you gain much more accuracy than when using a mouse. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Medibang Paint Pro is free software that comes with many features for **drawing** manga. All you need is to register and log in when you download the software. The tool is excellent if you want to try many features for free, like multi-layer **drawing**, comic panel creation and pre-made tones and backgrounds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   FireAlpaca is a very easy-to-use **drawing** tool that’s free forever for Windows and Mac users, or you can pay to remove the ads on Steam . This app is best for vector art and doesn’t include the same textures ability as its competitors. However, its perks include a very simple design that anyone can learn with time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are two main ways to create digital art without a tablet by using a mouse. You may create art traditionally first then scan or photograph it to proceed to the digital stage. Or you may create art digitally from the start. The first method can require you to edit or learn how to draw using a mouse, similar to the second method. This de**pen**ds on the results you seek. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Clip Studio Paint has such an outstanding reputation in the comic industry that art schools use it to teach comic **drawing**. It has a line-up of features for manga and comic arts. It can also record a timelapse of your work, which is great if you want to refine your creative process or promote your work online (people love time-lapses). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   SketchBook is available on iPad, Android , Windows and Mac OS. This is a very good software as replacement for **pen**cil sketches. it's the perfect tool for those just getting started with stylus **pen** art. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Apple introduced the next generation Apple Silicon M1 chip in 2021 which will eventually replace the Intel chip on all Macs. All of the **drawing** tablets reviewed here are compatible with M1 Macs as most manufacturers have released M1 chip drivers for them. However, by far the best **drawing** pad for M1 Macs is the 2021 iPad Pro as it already has the M1 chip inside it. In fact, we think that even though the iPad Pro isn’t strictly a **drawing** tablet, it’s one of the best **drawing** tablets on the market for Mac users. You can read more about why in our look at using the iPad as an Apple **drawing** tablet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can start with **pen**cil sketches. Then you can move to real-to-life pain simulation modes. The oil paint mixing is particularly sophisticated. And it helps you create a personal colour pallet you can save. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Affinity Designer is a vector graphics app that helps you to improve your workflow and creativity. This application provides a real-time preview. You can use it to make complex **drawing**s. The program enables you to link symbols. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dani Blázquez will teach you how to create a high-impact illustration from a previous **drawing** in **pen**cil. You will learn to color and adjust your original with a few layers and effects of Photoshop. In addition, you will create a hand-made typography absolutely groundbreaking with a few simple steps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To start, o**pen** up the camera and take a picture of the **drawing**. Aim to get as close to the **drawing** as possible while still capturing the entire sketch within the screen. If you are capturing several different **drawing**s or taking multiple photos, try to keep the phone the same distance away from each **drawing**. This helps ensure that all lines have similar weights. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It takes some time to get used to the sensitivity of the **pen**. If you had a tablet before and used applications such as Adobe Illustrator or Lightroom with it, you’ll also need to re calibrate things like pressure curve settings to use the new **pen**. In fact, any pressure levels or setting you’ve ever setup with any program will have to be reset to use with the Wacom Intuos Pro but it’s worth it in the long run. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In Paper, you'll get six basic tools that are great for **drawing**, outlining, and even writing. If you opt for the optional Pro subscription, which is $8 for six months or $12 for a year, you'll get access to more tools like diagrams, collages, and cut-and-fill. There is also plenty of room for creativity in Paper, as you're able to add multiple photos to a journal and cut, stick, and fix without the need for complicated layers. Paper also lets you customize your sketch journals as you'd like, and your work gets synced across devices, as long as you have a Pro subscription. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The world is becoming digital, and almost everything is on our electronic devices now. So why designers let them behind?! Technology gives them lots of Drawing tools in their smart appliances, so besides the traditional paper-**pen**cil, today’s artists also accept stylus for their digital canvas. Not only artist or designer, people from every profession are now using digital **pen**s as devices become digital notebooks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Apple enthusiasts who want a handy, powerful, and portable **drawing** option will enjoy this easy-to-master **drawing** option. It even allows you to create and sell your own brushes to others. You can buy Procreate for a one-time fee of $9.99. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can use the Apple Pencil to draw on Maps, within Notes and in many other iPad apps. However, to really make the most of the Apple Pencil, you'll need to find the best **drawing** apps for iPad. In our guide below, we've selected the best **drawing** apps for iPad, whether you're a pro or a complete beginner. And there's way more than **drawing** here, too. Most of the apps in this list allow you to sketch, take notes, paint and use all kinds of other virtual art tools from your iPad screen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Astropad isn't just another one of the best **drawing** apps for iPad. Instead, it turns your iPad into a **drawing** tablet for your Mac. That's right — if you prefer to use your image editors on your Mac, but prefer to use your iPad for the actual **drawing**, Astropad lets you do just that! Think of it like turning your iPad into a Wacom **pen** display. To get Astropad to work properly, you'll need to get the free Mac companion app. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Obviously, you won’t be using paper, **pen**cils, **pen**s, and brushes for your digital art. Not in the traditional way, at least. Before you dive into digital art, it’s important to understand which tools you want to use and how to use them. If you’re like me, you love any excuse to buy new technology and play around with it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first step in learning how to digitize a **drawing** is to scan it. You can do this using a traditional scanner, scanning at a minimum of 300 dots per inch (DPI). Or, if you don’t have a scanner, you can use a smartphone to take a picture of the **drawing**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A lot de**pen**ds on the type of work the artist does–such as freehand illustration, digital painting, photo editing or animation, as well as the personal workflow of the artist. A professional artist will choose a **drawing** tablet which works well with the apps they already use; has the highest possible level of pressure sensitivity; a large **drawing** area; and replicates working with an actual **pen**, **pen**cil or brush. For many years, higher-end Wacom devices were a top pick amongst professional artists, but these days, a broader range of powerful options are available from a variety of companies. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   SAI is absolutely amazing for digital painting. It is so responsive to the pressure and movement of the **pen** and it's great. Once you get the hang of it, it isn't hard to use at all and you make amazing paintings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Then scan the **drawing** with a high quality (e.g. 300 DPI) and load it into your **drawing** software (e.g. Procreate or Krita). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most graphics tablets connect to your Mac via Bluetooth but we’ve found that some definitely work better than others with Macs. Most require drivers to setup and we’ve found that Wacom tablets are the most reliable and easy to connect to Bluetooth on Mac. We’ve found that Huion’s can be more troublesome to setup with drivers sometimes not working or failing to reconnect to your tablet after your Mac has been asleep. Note that some tablets will only work via USB cable which eliminates connectivity problems but can get in the way of your **drawing**. Unsurprisingly, the Apple iPad Pro offers by far the best connectivity with a Mac allowing you to connect easily in various forms via Bluetooth, AirDrop or iCloud. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another important feature to shop for is tracking speed, which basically means lag time between stroke of your **pen** and the corresponding line showing up on screen. The higher the tracking speed (measured in PPS, points per second), the less the lag, and the more instant the result. And while lag is annoying at the best of times even just in things like loading our email inboxes, it can make finer work like **drawing** simply impossible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   It’s a native wireless device which means the **pen** connects to your Mac via Bluetooth and there’s no noticeable lag when you draw. You can also use it connected by wire to a USB port too. Setup is easy and connectivity with Macs is very reliable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The tricky thing is that you can use them both at the same time. This isn’t a problem for **pen**cils that don’t balloon when you push on them, but they can be confusing for markers. You set your brush to a certain size, but then you push too hard and the brush size expands. You then go for a thin line, but because you aren’t pushing very hard, it comes out very light. Goodness gracious. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Inkscape is an entirely vector-based **drawing** program that lets you draw and manipulate objects. It’s also perfect for creating shapes and designing logos. It’s o**pen**-source and completely free, too, and has become popular for both nonprofit and commercial uses. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   : Remove the ink refill from the **pen** and o**pen** it from the upper part and the lower part. Step 2 : Take the wire and measure it with the body of the **pen**. You need to take the length of the wire more than the body of the **pen**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Inspire Pro is a painting app for iPad. This application helps you to blend colors with brush strokes. It is one of the best free **drawing** software which enables you to browse through the gallery. The software allows you to add the title of your artwork. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Linea Sketch features a simple and intuitive interface while providing users with a variety of powerful tools that work great with Apple Pencil. Plus, it easily helps you make perfect circles and shapes to create the best **drawing**s. It also shows you colors that complement your selected hue perfectly, so you don't need to figure that out yourself. It can also do layers, split-screen, and much more. Linea Sketch exports your projects as PSD, JPG, or PNG files so that they can be easily accessed from other devices, like your Mac. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The feel of a tablet is also crucial. Obviously, it won't feel the same as **drawing** on paper, but the material and make of the tablet can determine how much give, friction, and glide it has. A tablet's tactile aspect is very important to consider, especially if you're someone who is very particular about your setup. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is just a short list. As someone who hates stray **pen**cil lines and making mistakes, these things are really cool. The ability to erase things alone would keep me using Procreate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Create a new file on Photoshop and set the proper settings. Instead of **drawing** in the **drawing** space as before, create a new layer. Head over to the bottom of the right-side panel and click the + button to add a new layer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With over 100 brushes, which are designed by fellow artists mind you, the possibilities are pretty much endless in Pixelmator when it comes to **drawing** and painting. These tools are also specifically designed for various painting techniques, so chances are high that you'll find what you need. They also replicate the wetness effects quite well, especially for watercolors and crayon brushes. Double-texture brush technology also means you will get the best detail as you paint, and the Pixel brush is quite fun to use too. Pixelmator also supports layers, has an eyedropper color picker, and is fully optimized for Apple Pencil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   People love Pain Tool SAI because of its excellent stabilisation and its overall feel when **drawing**. It’s intuitive and simple software. It has fewer features but operates smoothly even on a computer with low specifications. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Think back to the first time you held a **pen**cil or a paintbrush and how far you’ve come since then. Digital art is the same way. After s**pen**ding some time getting a strong foundation in digital art, you’ll be well on your way to enjoying this medium. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The top graphics tablets allow you to set keyboard shortcuts to make it quicker and easier to perform certain functions. Most of the better **drawing** **pen**s also have buttons on them which saves valuable time looking for features on the tablet screen and speeds-up your workflow. You’ll find that cheap tablets often don’t include shortcut buttons on the **pen**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Are you still wondering about making some detailed paintings on your mobile phone? Then, this is the time to switch for a stylus **pen**. Sometimes your finger size stops you from making some linear figures on your phone.

-   The bigger the better but just because a tablet is bigger doesn’t mean it’s better. That’s because what’s important is the active **drawing** area – the space on the tablet you can actually draw on. More screen estate means more space to draw. Bigger tablets also usually have more features and keyboard shortcuts to help speed-up your workflow. Some tablets like the Wacom Intuos Pro allow you to map your MacBook or iMac screen to your tablet so you can configure how much Mac screen estate you want to use as an extension of your tablet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you buy a tablet, keep in mind that you're also buying the **pen** that comes with it, unless you already have one (that you've checked is compatible with your new tablet) or you plan on buying one separately. Be sure to choose a stylus with a grip you like and features you need.

Furthermore, some tablets come with a stylus, while others make it a separate purchase. For example, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra comes with a stylus, while the Apple iPad and Microsoft Surface Pro tablets do not. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

In general, you should go for the **drawing** tablet with the maximum pressure level you can afford. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not to mention, the size of a tablet typically corresponds to the dimensions of its active area (i.e. the part of the tablet you can actually draw on), so in addition to portability, have a think about the size and detail of the work you intend to do. It's never fun to run out of **drawing** space; while this is another area in which digital art has advantages over traditional mediums (most software will let you zoom into a **drawing** and reorient your tablet to the boundaries of the specified area), if you want to keep the whole piece on screen while working, a tablet that will fit your whole **drawing** within its active area is preferable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a lot of complicated things that you can do with digital art platforms. At the end of the day though, it’s just another canvas that’s o**pen** to your imagination. Learn some complicated techniques, or don’t. It’s your choice. Just make art you like. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Especially for artists and illustrators, the pressure sensitivity of the stylus determines how authentic the writing, **drawing** or painting experience is when working with the tablet. How much pressure you use when interacting with the stylus on the tablet’s active area accurately simulates the force applied when using a **pen**cil, **pen** or paintbrush, for example, on paper or a canvas.

-   Like the iPad option, you can draw right onto the tablet and see your art come to life right there. A lot of professional artists use them, but I don’t suggest them until you’re really committed to digital art. At least you can use your iPad for emails or Candy Crush if you want to.

No matter which software you choose, you probably need some kind of a tablet and a digital **pen**. Have you ever tried signing your name on a trackpad with your finger? If you find it difficult even to just replicate a signature you've written hundreds of times with a mouse or laptop trackpad, think of the pain it would be to attempt to do fine line work in the exact shapes and places you want.

That’s a HUGE benefit of digital art over traditional art, but it does come with a learning curve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

However, this is in contrast to the physical world, where even if you were to be more economical with paints or paper, the various drafts and ruined works that a simple mistake can result in really add up. And that's just with one medium — investing in oil paints, acrylic paints, watercolors, pastels, graphite **pen**cils, charcoal... those all cost money, and can quickly be used up. So when you weigh a one-off investment that provides access to virtually any kind of creative medium (as well as the panacea that is the undo button) against the more exacting, prep-heavy work of physical **drawing**, there can be a real payoff. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
