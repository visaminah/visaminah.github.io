## 6 Interesting Facts How To Care For Seedlings In Rockwool | How Often to Water Rockwool Seedlings
-   Much like growing seeds in other mediums, you must maintain soil moisture by misting and using a humidity dome. You can also adjust the temperature in the greenhouse and wait for **seedlings** to develop. At this point, wait for the plants to reach an ideal height for transplanting, and you should have vigorous plants from Rockwool. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In addition, beginners find it challenging to take care of their **seedlings** because they are fragile. Seedlings struggle to establish themselves in hard soils that offer no aeration. On the other hand, Rockwool encourages **seedlings** to establish their roots, thanks to large gaps or pockets within the cubes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can never go wrong when it comes to using Rockwool for **seedlings** to grow. It is efficient and reliable, although not suited to every type of farmer. Rockwool requires special care and demands strict compliance in terms of irrigation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   7. If you see a dominant seedling, do not remove the smaller shoot as it can damage the shoots of larger **seedlings**. It is better to trim the shoot of smaller ones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Last but not least, beginners struggle to transplant **seedlings** from one pot to another and often end up killing them. Typically, the roots are damaged when the grower digs the **seedlings** out of the soil. However, if you use Rockwool, you can move the seedling directly along with the cube into the soil, so there is no chance of damaging the roots. In addition, Rockwool cubes will not interfere with the growth of the roots even as the plant grows bigger. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After an hour, you can use the cubes and plant the seeds at their top and pinch the hole close. You should find the hole and place two seeds inside or use an object to comfortably press the seeds down to the bottom of this hole. After planting, add more moisture using a hydroponic nutrient solution to encourage germination and transplant once you have 3-inch tall **seedlings**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
