-   Quote from: TrMama on October 04, 2018, 12:41:28 PM Quote from: jeromedawg on October 04, 2018, 11:54:08 AM So I had a local handyman come out to check things out and he pointed out that the frame isn't square due to either subpar construction of it or shifting foundation. He said he could maybe replace the current one I have for $200 labor costs. Cost of the **door** would be whatever I decide on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Because of the fact that it would require shimming and filling (and my dad actually tried shimming it already), I'm kinda of veering away from trying to DIY this. $200 for labor/installation seems like a pretty reasonable price for not having to deal with trying to hang and re-hang it till it's straight, etc. Seems most decent **door**s are around $130ish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Are you looking for the best magnetic **screen** **door** for dogs, or simply for yourself? If so, you’ve come to the right place.

-   The security **screen** **door** is the bomb, but cost a fortune and took 2 different handymen to install. Just like your **door**, ours was way out of square in all 3 dimensions. The first handyman tried to squeeze it in and the result looked like crap. The 2nd, much more competent, handyman removed both the exterior and the **screen** **door**, rebuilt the frame to be square and then reinstalled both **door**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The magnetic **screen** **door** fits most standard **door** sizes but does max out at 34 x 82 inches, so be sure to measure your entryway before purchasing.

Luckily, this opening won’t have that same problem and when they are made of long-lasting materials, then they will outlast even the most expensive **screen** **door**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Around what did you end up spending if you don't mind me asking? The first handyman brought a friend along and both were saying how it's not square but they could "try some things" to make it fit. It would suck if it ended up being like the first contractor/handyman you had come out where they do a hack-job and it ends up looking awful... I found this handyman through local recommendations from neighbors on Next**door** though, so he sounds pretty legit - one neighbor had their windows recently installed/upgraded and the company that did them installed them crooked and told them there was nothing they could do. They had this guy take a look and he fixed it, so that's a bit reassuring. I think he's a general contractor but seems to be willing to take these small jobs as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The material used to make the mesh will determine the price, durability, flammability, and action of chemicals on the **screen**. Some **screen**s have magnets sewn into them, gravity sticks, magnetic cubes, push pins, and Velcro strips that hold them into place. The mesh should be able to hold even when you close the **door**. Some curtains are washable, while others, like polyester or fiberglass, can only be wiped using a damp cloth. d) Price - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   There is only one size available here, and it isn’t quite universal, fitting **door**ways up to 36 x 82 inches. Additionally, this magnetic **screen** **door** is not lockable, so children can wander in and out at will. We’d advise caution.
