## 35 Unexpected Facts About What Paint Sticks To Aluminum Foil | Painting On Aluminium Foil
-   Sheen – Although it may be tempting to use very shiny **paint** when covering aluminum, that is not going to be the best choice, especially for an exterior project. Flat **paint** is going to be the best because it will adhere better. In addition, aluminum is not very forgiving when it comes to showing brush lines and other mistakes you may make while **paint**ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing the right type of pain can also make a difference in the results. If at all possible, choose one that is rated for use on metal. Beware of the one-step types of **paint** that promise to prime, prepare, and **paint** all at the same time. They rarely work as stated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take a sheet of aluminum **foil** and wrap it around your star base. We tried a couple different methods, and no one was really better than the other. Wrap until all the craft sticks are covered, including the back, paying special attention to forming the aluminum **foil** around your star points and crevices. Take spare strips of aluminum **foil** and glue where there happens to be spare spaces. None of this has to be perfect, though, and that’s the fun of it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can add a new look to an aluminum door by giving it a coat of **paint**. Properly preparing the surface with self-etching primer will allow the **paint** to stick to the surface for a long time. You can choose a spray **paint** that is well-suited for exterior door use or you can use acrylic **paint**, which will give it a nice sheen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You might also be wondering if the **paint** will last once you **paint** the aluminum. As long as you prepare the area well, you can expect it to last for up to 10 years. Paint adheres very nicely to aluminum and it will last a long time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most important factor for **paint**ing aluminum is preparing it. This would include sanding the surface or using a self-etching primer.

-   Remove the paper and using tempera and a brush, have kids **paint** drawings using bright colors. Apply a fairly heavy application and then add a second or third coat as the **paint** dries. Adding a bit of liquid soap, may also help the **paint** stick better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Likewise, print primers are coatings we apply to substrates before printing on **foil**.

-   Trace the drawing with a dull pencil pressing down hard enough to etch the drawing into the **foil**.

-   Have students outline their pictures and add details with the permanent markers. Be careful not to rub **paint** off with markers. Mount on construction paper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
