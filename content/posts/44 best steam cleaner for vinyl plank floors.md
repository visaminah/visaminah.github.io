Window **cleaner**: some steam mops have a handy attachment that lets you steam the windows, while the cleaning mood has taken hold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Steam mops shouldn’t damage a sealed hardwood floor unless this flooring has been weakened by constant contact to direct sunlight. If your floor is in sunlight, try the steam mop on an inconspicuous spot before using it to clean the entire surface. You shouldn’t use steam mops on unsealed hardwood **floors** at all because moisture can seep into their cracks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "Most hardwood **floors** are not waterproof, and excessive use of water or heat can cause warping, discoloration, or encourage the growth of mold and mildew," says Guy Peters, owner and founder of Mop Stars Cleaning Service. "But using a steam **cleaner** as part of your monthly or quarterly deep-cleaning projects should be just fine." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tasks that vacuum **cleaner**s would normally perform, like picking up dirt and debris. This is because a steam mop has no suction function. Make sure to vacuum your space before steam-mopping it, otherwise you could have lots of stray wet hairs and bits of dirt decorating your **floors** afterwards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many manufacturers list out which types of flooring each specific steam mop can clean safely. You can also keep an eye out for steam mops that allow you to change settings depending on the floor type.
