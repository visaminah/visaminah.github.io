## 7 Tips for Best Epson Paper For Fine Art Printing | Epson Fine Art Paper Sample Pack
-   The good news is that while the texture is visible, it doesn’t impinge on the image. In other words, it doesn’t impose itself on the subject of the image. This is one of the best fine art papers that I’ve yet seen for ink jet **printing**, and the fact that it’s optimized for Epson’s Ultrachrome inks is a bonus. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For best results, you'll want an art printer capable of better colour reproduction and clarity than the average office printer. Ideally, it will use pigment-based inks, because dye-based inks don't look as good. You'll also want the option of **printing** in larger formats, and on heavier, fine art media. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The only real downside to this printer is the cost – while it's a well-priced printer for the quality it offers, the Epson Expression Photo XP-970 only supports Epson ink cartridges, which are expensive. It will also churn through ink too, so beware running costs are a little high. However, if you're **printing** 10-30 photos a month you'll be fine, anything above this and you may need to look at a more costly printer with lower running costs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This printer uses dye sublimation for quality prints and each only takes less than a minute to print. The small LCD screen enables you to set prints from the machine itself or use the Cannon app, which works with Apple devices. The app can be a little temperamental and the printer has a tendency to auto-crop areas of the image, which could be frustrating when **printing** art from a tablet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a relatively speedy printer, too. It goes up to A3+ and even larger; it'll also do panoramic prints up to 990cm wide. It delivers lovely sharp prints that are dry almost straight away. And it's versatile; working with set of eight inks, it's capable of **printing** on anything from standard paper to heavier fine art media. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The results are excellent, its six-colour **printing** process offers deep and rich colour pigments and while not the fastest it does print at a decent pace – black and white photos have a 8.5 ppm speed. It's compact but a little heavy for a smaller machine, but once set up and in place you won't mind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What paper is best for **printing** art? First you will ideally be using Fine Art Paper, which will be called Giclee Printing, Rag Paper, Cotton Paper and so forth (but some will be trial and error and check your printer's depth of paper restrictions). With a good art printer this paper will work. One tip, always print as matt as a glossy print can hide any paint strokes and leave detail looking flat. Matt prints offer the same impression as a real watercolour or oil canvas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
