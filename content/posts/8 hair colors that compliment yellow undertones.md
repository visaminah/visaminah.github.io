## 8 Unexpected Facts About Hair Colors That Compliment Yellow Undertones | hair colors that compliment yellow undertones
-   Medium Skin With Warm Undertones go extremely well with dark chocolate, chestnut, dark auburn, mocha. It's pretty hard to go wrong with brown in general, since it's almost universally flattering. But a cooler brown tone can look particularly striking on those with warm skin, as it helps make **yellow** **undertones** look creamier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally, your hair color should complement your skin **undertones**. Undertone is the subtle hue (color) beneath the surface of your skin; this is the key to finding out your ideal colour palette. There are three types of **undertones**: cool, warm and neutral. If you have warm **undertones** your skin will appear peachy, **yellow** or golden; cool skin **undertones** have a blue, pink or red tinge, whilst neutral skin **undertones** are usually balanced between blue and **yellow**, and are generally closer in appearance to the skin’s surface tone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Have you ever tried out a hair color and found it completely didn't suit you after the stylist was done? (Sadly I can relate) The reason for this may be because of your skin; or more specifically your skin's tone and **undertones**. Most people can generally tell whether they have a fair, medium or dark skin tone, but when it comes to the colours that you’ll find are the most flattering, it gets a little more complicated. Beyond the basic choices of brown, blonde, red, or black, the infinite number of sub-colors and shades available can make picking a hair color next to impossible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

If they appear blue or purple, it’s likely that you have cool **undertones**, whilst greenish veins indicate a warm undertone. If you’re not sure whether they’re green or blue, or if your veins aren’t that clear and seem to match the colour of your skin, then you’ve probably got a neutral undertone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Striking the right contrast between your complexion and hair color is key. What you don’t want is your hair color to perfectly match your skin—your features will disappear. If your skin is warm or golden, beautiful shades of mahogany or copper bring out the sunniness in your skin. For cooler skin tones, accent your pinky-blue **undertones** with cool red browns or icy dark browns, and rich blacks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Much like lipstick colors and foundation, your skin **undertones** can play an important role in helping you determine your ideal hair color. If you have a naturally warm skin tone, you'll want to keep your hair in the same color family so the tones can work together to give your complexion a natural glow. Rich, warm colors, like deep browns, reds, and even golden and honey blondes, will work best to complement your skin tone, while cooler shades, like an icy platinum blonde, may clash with your natural color palette and wash you out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re ready for a fresh start, why not begin with a trendy, new hair color? Ideas about your best, new hair color depend on your natural skin tone. And that means matching up the color to your cool, neutral or warm skin **undertones**. But you can wear almost any color you fancy, as long as you choose the correct - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Talk about a sun-kissed look! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
