To enhance the cosy vibes, make sure you layer plenty of blankets and cushions - the more texture the better! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Art Deco living **room**s are so on trend right now, and luckily for lovers of **teal**, it's a colour that combines perfectly with the iconic 1930s design style. For a striking yet sophisticated look, try using geometric **teal** wallpaper to create a dramatic living **room** feature wall. Finish the look with statement lighting and wall art - anything that features glamorous global-inspired motifs or sunbursts, chevrons or sky scraper zig zags will do the trick! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Want to dip your toe into the **teal** trend without using it on your walls? Start by painting your space with a light blush tone (see our favourite pink living **room** shades here!) and opt for light wood flooring to keep the **room** feeling open and airy.

Don't forget to add plenty of gold metallic accents - your living **room** will be the perfect balance of relaxed Scandi and glam! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your living **room** is lacking in personality, wood panelling is your best friend - and it'll fill your space with even more period charm when finished in a luxurious **teal** tone. To add instant character to a new-build or spruce up a tired old space, try installing MDF panelling half or three quarters of the way up your walls before painting from floor to ceiling with a deep **teal** tone. To complete the look, add a light **teal** sofa and an opulent blue rug to create a grounding focal point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Teal is a super versatile colour - it looks great with pure white, but it also works well with neutrals such as taupe, cream and ecru.

-   Teal and turquoise are a match made in heaven, and if you're looking for a colour palette that'll fill your living **room** with cheery spring vibes all year round, you won't want to miss this combo. For a sleek, contemporary look, use **teal** and turquoise shades on the larger features in the **room** - think walls, radiators and large furniture items - and opt for bright bold accessories in pink, yellow and orange. Neon decor works particularly well in this sort of scheme - use it sparingly on open shelving and on coffee tables for a punchy yet stylish edge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
