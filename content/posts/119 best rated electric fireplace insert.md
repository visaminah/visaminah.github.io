## 119 Things You Should Know About Best Rated Electric Fireplace Insert | Best Electric Fireplace Insert For Large Room
-   There are several extra features that an **electric** **fireplace** might have. With every **electric** **fireplace** in the reviews below, you will see the models’ extra features listed. Overall, these include: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The PuraFlame Klaus Electric Fireplace Insert is about 35 inches wide and 27 inches high, which means it can fit easily within a standard **fireplace** with a little room to spare. It consists of wood, resin, and glass. And it is powder coated, making it durable, antique looking, and highly resistant to scratches and wear and tear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The common misconception about **electric** **fireplace**s is that the ones with more color and brightness options are more realistic. This is not true at all. It’s very easy to install additional LED lights to add more color options, but those are only options. An addition of a pink or blue LED bulb won’t really do much to recreate a realistic flame. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In recent years, the importance of brand reputation has steadily increased. That’s because the US market has been flooded with lower-quality **electric** **fireplace**s that are not US-made. These new brands might offer **electric** **fireplace**s at ridiculously low prices (below $300 even), they might even have similar specs that Dimplex units, for example, but the quality and, even more importantly, reliability is often missing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Classic stonework **fireplace**s may look great, but they have added disadvantages. Pollutants, harmful gasses, and regular ash cleaning are all drawbacks of owning a classic **fireplace**. Luckily, there is a solution! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes. It’s safe to turn on the **fireplace** overnight as it does not generate carbon monoxide fumes. However, it’s recommended to turn the **fireplace** off if you plan on leaving it alone for a long period. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As is the case with most art pieces, the Dimplex Opti-V Solo is not without its controversies. Case and point: this is a **fireplace** that doesn’t heat. A **fireplace** without a heating function is, according to some options, just for show. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Electric **fireplace**s are the safest kind of **fireplace**s. All other **fireplace**s – including gas, oil, wood, coal, even ethanol **fireplace**s – are associated with more risks. That’s primarily because they do burn solid or liquid fuels, and those can generate smoke and, even riskier, carbon monoxide that can be deadly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before buying an **electric** **fireplace**, there are factors to consider, like your budget, your heating needs, and if you’ll be willing to replace the **fireplace** in a year or two. Of course you don’t want to replace it so soon! That’s why each **fireplace** in our collection has been vetted for durability, quality, and heating technology. The same can’t always be said for our competitors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In that case, the heating input wattage is switched from 1,500W to 750W (in an average unit). That setting burns through 50% less **electric**ity; ie. an **electric** **fireplace** running on 750W will burn 0.75 kWh per hour (about $0.10 worth of **electric**ity). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like all the best Touchstone **electric** **fireplace**s, Sideline Elite also has a 1,500W **electric** power input. That’s enough to produce 5,118 BTU of heating output. Heating-wise, it can provide supplemental heat to places up to 500 sq ft (10 BTU per sq ft) or heat 170 sq ft places on its own (30 BTU per sq ft). The built-in thermostat enables you to set the temperature between 68°F and 88°F. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A 1,500W **electric** **fireplace** with a thermostat will run on 1,500W or less. That ‘or less’ is an important distinction. When the set temperature on the thermostat is reached, the **electric** **fireplace** equipped with a thermostat will lower the heating output. That’s because all additional heating would be unnecessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brand reputation. Touchstone and Dimplex are considered to be top **electric** **fireplace** brands, and they can command top-dollar prices. All things considered, despite the higher costs, the Touchstone and Dimplex **electric** **fireplace**s are worth every penny. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nothing ties the room together like a **fireplace**. In the past, the **fireplace** was the primary source of heat for cooking, hot water, and comfort. You had to deal with solid fuels like wood and coal, and the chimney was absolutely necessary. Without a doubt, **electric** **fireplace**s changed the game completely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Safe Around Kids & Pets This **fireplace** is extremely easy to use around pets and small children. Unlike a traditional **fireplace** that burns wood or gas that gets very hot, this **electric** **fireplace** stays cool to the touch. Meaning that a child or a pet will not get burned when operating the **fireplace** as directed and used with common sense. Being as there is no real fire, the surfaces do not get hot and burn in the same way a traditional **fireplace** would. This **fireplace** is extremely safe to use around small children and pets and is a great addition to a safe family home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want your **fireplace** insert to have a range of features, this model from R.W.FlAME is the one for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best of all, you won't have to drag wood into your house, fret about stray sparks setting your home ablaze, or clean up ashes. With an **electric** **fireplace**, all you have to do is flick a switch and you're safely enjoying realistic flames and, if you choose, added warmth. In fact, the most complicated thing about **electric** **fireplace**s is deciding which one you want to purchase. With that in mind, we've decided to share not only our favorite models, but what you should keep in mind when choosing one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **electric** **fireplace**s run on 1,500W and are connected to a 120V outlet. To power that **fireplace**, you need to send more than 10 amps of **electric** current through the nichrome heating coils. That amount of current heating up metal wires does produce some residual (but very low on a decibel scale) sounds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The VIVOHOE **fireplace** heater controls the humidity and temperature. And even when you shut it off, the fan will continue to work for an additional minute, so it distributes the remaining heat into the room. You don’t have to worry about it disturbing your sleep or concentration because it is silent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Touchstone and Dimplex are considered to be top **electric** **fireplace** brands, and they can command top-dollar prices. All things considered, despite the higher costs, the Touchstone and Dimplex **electric** **fireplace**s are worth every penny. Width of the unit. Shorter 24″ units are cheaper than the longest 100″ units; that’s pretty much self-explanatory. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is an especially important feature of wall-mounting **electric** **fireplace**s. Wi-Fi enabled **electric** **fireplace**s. This is what the best **fireplace** overall – #1 Touchstone Sideline Elite – has. You can change the temperature (68°F to 88°F) on the built-in thermostat or play around with flame options via iPhone or Android smartphone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is what the best **fireplace** overall – #1 Touchstone Sideline Elite – has. You can change the temperature (68°F to 88°F) on the built-in thermostat or play around with flame options via iPhone or Android smartphone. Hybrid-FX™ flame technology. This is a patented flame technology by Modern Flames included in the #3 Modern Flames Slimline unit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Example: One of the most important factors – the most important one, in fact – is the brand reputation of an **electric** **fireplace** manufacturer (covered under #4 factor). This is not exactly a specification per se but it is a vital factor if you want to buy a top-rated **electric** **fireplace**; hence it’s designated as a primary factor. You can’t really go wrong with Touchstone or Dimplex, for example. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Arguably the best ones are made by Dimplex, of course. The Dimplex V series has the reputation of being the artistic series of **electric** **fireplace**s. The Dimplex Opti-V Solo is the best high-end **electric** **fireplace** money can buy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nobody really likes to be bothered with extensive installations, especially when it comes to **electric** **fireplace** mantels. Just a quick plug-in into a 120-volt outlet and the **fireplace** should start glowing. And the glow should give a realistic feel with realistic-looking flames. GMHome EF-30AKF has both of those. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The unit allows plenty of customization. You can change color themes according to your taste. Using the prism mode, the **fireplace** freezes on your preferred hue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With wall-mounted **electric** **fireplace**s, the slimmer is usually better. The Modern Flames Spectrum Slimline is the slimmest **electric** **fireplace** with the Hybrid-FX™ flame tech. Its depth dimension is less than 5 inches (4.6 inches, to be exact). That doesn’t only make it more visually appealing; it also makes the installation (either wall-mounting or recessed installation) much easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And that’s exactly what Dimplex Opti-V Solo aspires to be. This is not a heating unit. If you can afford several thousand dollars for an **electric** **fireplace**, you probably already have adequate heating. The lack of heating is just to show ‘hey, this is not a robust heating device; it’s an art piece’. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can choose between 4 models; namely 50″, 60″, 74″, and 100″. Modern Flames has enough brand recognition and a good reputation to price their **fireplace**s on the same level as Touchstone and even Dimplex. This is also the case with Modern Flames Spectrum Slimline; the Hybrid-FX™ and the slim design do add to the cost, however. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing an **electric** **fireplace** with adequate dimensions is a key consideration. Depending on your situation (ie. where do you intend to install a **fireplace**), you have to tally up those inches before you choose a model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, for your convenience, you can use the power, flame, or heat control remote control. And there’s also a programmable thermostat at the side of the **fireplace** insert. It will enable you to determine the temperature settings, embers, and flame levels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best **electric** **fireplace** should incorporate everything just right; the heating power, the aesthetic appeal, width options, realistic flame, and so on. Touchstone’s flagship model – the Touchstone Sideline Elite – does just that. On top of everything else, the Touchstone Sideline Elite is one of the modern **electric** **fireplace**s with built-in Wi-Fi connectivity and smartphone control. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In short, all the reasons why R.W.Flame is one of the most popular and best-selling **electric** **fireplace**s are quite obvious. It has all the right specs, wide array of flame options, and it’s a lot cheaper than comparable big brand **electric** **fireplace**s: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Holographic Technology State-of-the-art theme park technology comes home in the world's first holographic **electric** **fireplace**. Utilizing cutting-edge technology that will simulate a burning fire with a degree of realism never-before-seen in an **electric** **fireplace**. Actual video of a real fire is projected onto a real physical log set making it look like it's actually burning. Enjoy the subtle details of wispy smoke and burning embers with a level of detail unheard-of for **electric** **fireplace**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All of that **electric** power input is meant for heating. The **electric** current heats up the nichrome heating coils, located below the flames, and fans blow up to warm air into the room. Because the energy efficiency of **electric**al heating is above 99% (almost all of the **electric**ity is directly transformed into heat), we can calculate that 1,500W of **electric** input can generate up to 5,118 BTU/hr of heating output (1 Watt = 3.412 BTU). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **electric** firebox utilizes a patented pulsating ember technology and LED inner glow. As a result, it creates an experience similar to what a real **fireplace** would produce because the logs and embers glow in concert. However, unlike a real **fireplace**, it doesn’t have any gas emissions or particulates, making it one of the best options if you prefer an eco-friendly **fireplace** insert. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can choose between ‘Herringbone Brick’ and ‘Weathered Concrete’ design; both further give a feeling of a real homely hearth. Width-wise, you can choose between 24″, 30″, 36″, and 42″ models. The 36″ model is especially popular and considered the best 36″ **electric** **fireplace** insert currently on the market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The important step here is making sure the measurements are correct. The right dimensions will ensure that the **fireplace** fits and looks good. If the dimensions are off then the insert may not fit or could leave gaps between the cabinets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, as we mentioned, modern **electric** **fireplace**s are a bit about heating, but a lot about interior design. The aesthetics are everything.

Along with the wall-hanging and insert types of **fireplace**s, Dimplex also manufactures the best freestanding **electric** **fireplace**. Case and point: Dimplex SMP-904-ST Fieldstone, arguable the most homely and realistic looking freestanding **electric** **fireplace** with a stone-like mantel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Little to No Burn Danger Unlike a traditional wood or gas burning **fireplace** that gets extremely hot when it's being operated, this **electric** **fireplace** stays cool to the touch. Being as there are no actual flames in this **fireplace** there is nothing to heat the glass or cause burns when touched. Of course the heater does generate some heat and common sense should be used when operating the unit, but it will not burn or scold like a traditional wood or gas burning **fireplace**. Enjoy the look of a realistic and beautiful fire without the risk associated with a traditional **fireplace**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Dimplex Revillusion Log Set is a freestanding **fireplace** insert consisting of metal and resin, making it elegant and durable. It is designed to fit in small unused **fireplace**s.

If you’re in a hurry, you can skip to the list, comparison table, and reviews here: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Log Sounds Beautiful vivid flames are nothing without sound. In order to sell the illusion of realistic flames we have added high quality stereo speakers to recreate the sound of crackling and popping logs. Even the flames make a hissing sound just like real fire. We have sampled the actual sounds of logs crackling and popping with high quality audio equipment for an experience as visceral as sitting in front of real fire. Most **electric** **fireplace**s do not include log sounds which greatly reduces the impact of the fire experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The inclusion of a thermostat, more importantly, is vital for the cost-efficiency of any **electric** **fireplace**.

-   This **fireplace** insert can radiate heat in rooms up to 400 square feet. It's safe to operate as the front glass panel remains cold, even when the **fireplace** is in use. This is great for parents or pet owners concerned about safety. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note: Freestanding **electric** **fireplace**s can be considered a subtype of **electric** **fireplace** mantels. However, most freestanding models are made by manufacturers who specialize in **electric** **fireplace**s. For example, you will see a superb freestanding **fireplace** made by Dimplex; you won’t see a respectable company like Dimplex to manufacture **electric** **fireplace** mantels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The insert design is also shorter and higher than the wall-mounted design. That gave Dimplex space to put in ambers and it also allowed for the generation of bigger flames. The combination of these ambers and bigger flames makes the flames in the Dimplex Revillusion RBF look much more realistic. In fact, due to these two factors, the Dimplex Revillusion RBF has arguably the most realistic flames among all **electric** **fireplace**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let’s start with the power. While most **electric** **fireplace**s can take only 1,500W input, the Dimplex Revillusion RBF is capable of handling 1,000W more than that (2,575W in total). That means the heating output is almost 9,000 BTU (8,794 BTU, to be exact). Such an **electric** **fireplace** insert can heat up rooms up to 300 sq ft on its own; just like a real wood fire. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The **electric** **fireplace** insert has front-facing heater vents, so it can be placed under a flatscreen TV if the design calls for it. If you don't have a recessed wall, the unit has included brackets that can be mounted on a wall. It's also completely cool to the touch, keeping parents and pet owners satisfied. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Buying a 3,000W **electric** **fireplace** (they are few of these on the market as it is) is overkill. Such a **fireplace** could potentially generate almost 10,000 BTU/hr. However, the fan system would hardly be capable of distributing the generated heat evenly enough across the room in which the **electric** **fireplace** is placed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Older **electric** **fireplace** models didn’t come with the heating off feature. That meant that every time you wanted to enjoy the flames, you also had to (sometimes unnecessarily) heat the rooms you’re in and pay for up to $0.20/hour for **electric**ity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
