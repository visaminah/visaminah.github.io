## 42 Reference List: How To Turn Down Water Heater Temperature | What Temperature Is B Setting On Water Heater
-   Turn the hot tap on and leave it running for about 20 seconds, then fill a large glass. A pint glass or measuring jug are good – anything that won’t lose heat quickly. Then, dip in a thermometer to get the **temperature**. Thermometers are easily available from cooking shops and baby & child shops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Changing your hot water **heater** **temperature** is easy. However, before adjusting your hot water **heater** **temperature**, you should read our article : Hot Water Temperature: The Danger of Setting Your Water Heater Too Hot because if it’s set too high, it can cause severe burns. It it’s set too low, you can have some legionnaires disease developing in the water **heater**. In addition, if you are not comfortable changing the **temperature** yourself, we recommend you call a qualified plumber. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adjusting the **temperature** of your hot water can be easy especially when you follow simple steps. If you have a faulty water **heater** **temperature** setting, please contact Mr. Rooter Plumbing, and a certified, experience water **heater** plumber will be dispatch to your location as soon as possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Issues such as water **heater** valves must be taken seriously to avoid explosions that can cause accidents. Contact Mr. Rooter Plumbing today! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Gas valve water **heater**s are quite easy to adjust when it comes to **temperature** settings. All you must do is to locate the knob located on the valve and then adjust the **temperature** to between 115 and 120 °F. with this lowered setting the water **heater** tank will be protected against overheating, which also means there will be less energy needed to heat up the water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turn the **temperature** of the tap control down a touch, then perform the thermometer test again. You should be able to do this straight away. Keep making small adjustments until you’re happy with the **temperature**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your first task should be finding out exactly how hot your hot water is. Many thermostat dials don’t indicate **temperature**. They generally indicate “low” and “high” settings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There could be a third control for your boiler, which is the **temperature** of the circulating water, or pre-heat. This will be higher than the other two. Adjusting this will not have much of an effect on the hot water, as the boiler will always try to match the tap **temperature** you set. Turning it down might make your boiler greener and cheaper to run, but if you have it too low it will limit the **temperature** you can get from your taps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As with many things around your home, there’s no right answer here. Instead, there’s a range: between 120 degrees and 140 degrees. This range exists for a reason: at **temperature**s lower than 120 degrees, there’s a risk of bacterial growth in the water **heater**. At **temperature**s higher than 140 degrees, there’s a greater risk of accidental scalding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best or optimal **temperature** for your hot water tank is 120 Fahrenheit or 48 Celsius. This is a **temperature** that is comfortable and sanitary, yet does not significantly increase your energy costs. While this is the best or optimal **temperature** for your water tank, it’s not the **temperature** that is set upon installation. Most hot water **heater**s are factory set at 140 Fahrenheit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Don’t confuse the **temperature** on your room thermostat with the water **temperature** – they are two different things. The room thermostat tells the boiler whether to pump water through the radiators or not. Hotter water might make the room heat up faster, but the eventual **temperature** will be the same. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re frustrated that you can’t get the shower as warm as you would like, or you worry because it feels like the water is at a painfully scalding **temperature**, you can do something about it. There’s no need to settle for a water **heater** that runs too hot or too cold. Achieve that just-right shower by learning how to set your water **heater** **temperature** safely and correctly—whether you have a gas water **heater** or an electric model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Right out-of-the-box, most manufacturers set their water **heater**s to 140 degrees. There are a few reasons for this. First, the manufacturer doesn’t know the size of your home, or how far hot water will have to travel to reach your furthest faucet or showerhead. As hot water travels, it loses some of its heat energy. It’s for this reason that many larger homes need the water **temperature** set a little higher, so that their hot water arrives at the right **temperature** when it reaches the showerhead on the second floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mr. Rooter Plumbing can troubleshoot common and uncommon complex problems that may cause water **heater**'s inefficiency. The earlier you schedule a maintenance service, the earlier you can detect these problems that can plague your water **heater**. In some instances, the thermometer may be working efficiently but other components like the heating element or the safety pressure and **temperature** valve may be faulty. Only a scheduled maintenance service can resolve these issues before they become more complicated or even cause the water **heater** to break down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are finding it difficult to adjust the thermostat of your water **heater** after taking all the steps mentioned above, you may have to contact a professional water **heater** plumber. In most cases, a faulty thermostat may be the reason why your water **heater** **temperature**s are ineffective. When your thermometer is faulty, your water **heater** may deliver too hot or lukewarm water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Every hot water tank has different panels that allow you to change set the **temperature** of your tank. Most of the panels are similar and even located in the same general areas no matter what type of water **heater** you have. Most electric water **heater**s have two thermostats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To test the valve simply lift up the lever part way (as seen in the picture to the right), let go and allow it to snap back. You should hear a gurgling sound as the valve is allowing some water to be released into the drain tub. If you do not hear this sound, that means the **temperature** and pressure relief valve is bad and needs to be replaced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s also possible that your water is running too hot because of a mechanical or electric failure in your boiler or system. Water flowing too slowly over the heat exchanger could cause it to overheat, as could a faulty thermostat. If manually turning down the **temperature** doesn’t work, it’s time to call out a Gas Safe engineer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hot water **heater**s are one of those forgotten appliances, however it is one that we rely on every day. Water **heater**s can last for 10+ years if it is properly maintained. By following a 3-step annual maintenance plan, it can help to significantly extend the life of your hot water **heater**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **temperature** setting on the cylinder might be visible, or it could be behind a panel. This may be a manual control (a knob, dial or a slot for a screwdriver) or digital. Check your manual for details, but you should be able to lower the **temperature** using one of these controls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although tankless units are gaining popularity, storage tank water **heater**s are still the most common type found in today’s homes. If that’s the type that you have, every time hot water is drawn out for use somewhere in your home, fresh water that’s at about 50 degrees is pulled into the tank to replace it. The cooler water dilutes the hot water that remains inside, and the entire tank must be heated again to meet the thermostat setting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another concern is that insufficiently hot water can cause bacterial growth in a typical water **heater**. From the energysavers.gov website: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, there are some disadvantages to consider. Tankless water **heater**s are not ideal for homeowners who often need to multitask to keep their home running. Generally, these tankless **heater**s do not have the capacity to supply hot water to two locations at the same time, such as the shower and the washing machine. In addition, while they save on energy, they can use more electricity. In some cases, the overall cost savings is nominal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you want to save money on your heating bill, you probably turn back the **temperature** inside your home at the thermostat. It’s simple and it makes sense. The same logic can be used to save money with your water **heater** by turning back your water **heater** **temperature**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You need to test your water before you ever change the settings on your water **heater**. You do this at a water faucet location by turning the hot water on and letting it run for a minute or two. Then use your meat thermometer to gauge what **temperature** your water is by holding it in hot water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your hot water **heater** accounts for nearly 20% of your entire energy bill. If your water **temperature** is set too high, you not only risk a significantly higher utility bill, but you run the risk of getting scalded when you use the hot water. If the **temperature** is too low, you run the risk of bacteria growing in your tank. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lowering your utility bill doesn’t necessarily require you to avoid using your air conditioner or limit the length of your showers each morning. While those measures will help, there also are simpler ways that you can save energy and money. One simple trick to lower your energy costs is to turn down the **temperature** on your hot water **heater**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You might need to remove a cover to access the thermostat, and it’s often one that you adjust with a screwdriver. Again, the effect will not be instant – you need to wait for the water to cool down, or you can empty the tank’s hot water by turning on a hot tap. Then test the **temperature** again with a thermometer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For most people, it’s actually safer to lower the **temperature** to 120 Fahrenheit rather than keep it at the factory settings. Parents with young children, in particular, have to be worried about their children being burned by water that is too hot. When the hot water tank remains at its factory settings, a child’s bath could easily be too hot and they could be seriously injured. When the **temperature** is lowered to the best or optimal **temperature** of 120 Fahrenheit or 48 Celsius, the risk of being accidentally burned while taking a bath is much lower. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Removing the sediment from the bottom of the tank is important. It helps to prevent rust, corrosion, and also improves efficiency. Doing a full tank draining and flush is best, however it is a lot of work and requires shutting down the water **heater**. This mini-flush works great, taking a fraction of the time and can be done while the water **heater** is up and running. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While there is a very slight risk of promoting legionellae bacteria when hot water tanks are maintained at 120 degrees, this level is still considered safe for the majority of the population. If you have a suppressed immune system or chronic respiratory disease, you may consider keeping your hot water tank at 140 degrees. However, this high **temperature** significantly increases the risk of scalding. To minimize this risk, you can install mixing valves or other **temperature**-regulating devices on any taps used for washing or bathing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you would rather let the professionals handle the task of setting the water **heater** **temperature** or require other plumbing services, you can count on the local team of experts at Mr. Rooter Plumbing. We will be there when you need us to ensure you water is at an ideal **temperature** to meet your family’s needs. Call (855) 982-2028 to schedule services or request an estimate online now. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tankless water **heater**s are certainly going to provide the most energy savings. They provide hot water directly where it is needed while eliminating the standby losses that are associated with traditional hot water tanks. The water gets to its desired **temperature** almost immediately, which helps to save on water usage as well. The homeowner does not have to stand by as the water runs and warms up to the desired **temperature**. Of course, homeowners also appreciate the fact that these innovative water tanks are smaller and can fit in a storage closet versus taking up a large amount of space in a basement or crawl space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you plan to be away from home for at least 3 days, turn the thermostat down to the lowest setting or completely turn off the water **heater**. To turn off an electric water **heater**, switch off the circuit breaker to it. For a gas water **heater**, make sure you know how to safely relight the pilot light before turning it off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What you are doing here is telling the cylinder to start or stop the flow of hot water through the heat exchanger from the boiler. Once the cylinder reaches your desired **temperature**, the flow will be switched off. If the **temperature** is lower than your setting, and there are no timers in the “off” position, the cylinder will start warming up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Homeowners will find that by turning down their hot water tank **temperature** by about 20 degrees to 120 Fahrenheit or 48 Celsius, they will see cost savings of about 6 to 10 percent. This is a significant drop, and it’s usually enough to get homeowners motivated to head down to their hot water tank and see what the **temperature** is set at. It only takes a couple of moments to lower the **temperature** to 120 Fahrenheit, but the homeowner will continue to enjoy the cost savings for the months and years to come. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a lot of reasons, actually. For one, the manufacturer isn’t really concerned about your home energy use. Sure, they want to sell you an energy efficient appliance because you’re more likely to buy it, but in terms of settings you can adjust at home, it’s honestly not a big concern for them. At the same time, there’s not much better of a way to show that your hot water **heater** is working than to have your faucet or your shower pour out very hot water. Would you rather have a customer think, “Wow! That water **heater** sure puts out somehot water!” or “The water from my new **heater** isn’t too hot… can I turn it up?” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can’t use your thermostat to measure the hot water **heater** **temperature** right away. You have to give it at least three hours, and then you can test for your hot water **temperature**. If you are unsure of the ideal **temperature** for your hot water, we invite you to visit our article on this topic: Hot Water Temperature: The Danger of Setting Your Water Heater Too Hot - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Can something as simple as a water **heater** be dangerous? Yes, it can! There are risks involved in both the process of adjusting the water **heater** and the problem of water **temperature** that isn’t right. Any time you are dealing with electricity and water there is inherent risk. To protect yourself, make sure to follow any instructions for adjusting the **temperature** carefully and call on plumbing professionals if you aren’t sure what to do. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before fiddling with the settings on the hot water tank, many homeowners want to make sure that they are making a safe and responsible choice. Some argue that the default **temperature** is set at 140 Fahrenheit for a reason and that it shouldn’t be adjusted. However, the reality of the matter is that hot water tank manufacturers are less concerned with energy savings and more concerned with performance. If they made the default setting 120 Fahrenheit, someone is likely to complain that their tank doesn’t get the water hot enough. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On electric water **heater**s most have thermostats on the top, and one is on the bottom. Some water **heater**s have their thermostats behind an insulated control board. Tankless water **heater**s give you readouts and controls for **temperature** through a display window. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On your hot water **heater** there will be a knob on the gas valve or a thermostat (if electric) behind an electric water **heater** panel. The recommended **temperature** setting is between 115 degrees and 120 degrees. Most hot water **heater**s have a A-B-C knob. Here is what **temperature** each letter stands for: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
