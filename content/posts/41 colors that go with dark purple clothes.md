## 41 Shocking Facts About Colors That Go With Dark Purple Clothes | what color goes with dark purple clothes

-   Several **colors** pair well with a **purple** dress. A lot depends on the type of event that you are attending. Is it an elegant affair? Or something more casual? There are color combinations to suit all occasions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First of all, when it comes to **purple**, I have a bit of a love/hate relationship. When I was younger I used to think it was great. All I ever wore was black back then so I thought wearing a hint of **purple** here and there made me super edgy and cool. However, with hindsight, the kinds of **purple** I was picking did not flatter my skin tone and often washed out my skin, leaving me looking a little bit dead. Which isn’t a great look, I’m sure we can all agree. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With medium skin tones, a deeper shade of blue **purple** can look good. With olive skin tone, pastel periwinkle adds contrast and dimension. Light brown skin tones can go for electric shades of periwinkle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, try and master the art of the **purple** shirt. For those with darker skin tones, try and stick to lighter shades such as lilac. At the other end of the spectrum, lighter skin tones will look much better when utilising a darker, richer **purple**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purple is a rebel among **colors** – the result of mixing two **colors** from the opposite sides of the color spectrum – Red and Blue. Red is a fiery, warm color, and blue is a calm, soothing cool color. When you mix these two **colors**, you get **purple**. Purple is not the most popular color on earth, but those who like this color are very, very loyal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The light **purple** color is associated with femininity and spirituality. It has a calming effect. This is one reason it’s often used in marketing beauty products. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A not too distant cousin of the classic red nail is the shade of bordeaux, or more commonly known as the colour burgundy.

-   Black, white, gray, beige, tan, and navy nails go well with a **purple** dress. You can also wear pastels like dusty rose, lemon, and sky blue. Most shades of yellow will give a nice contrast.

-   Right now, certain **colors** seem more popular than others (we're looking at you, hot pink), but one shade that never goes out of style is navy blue. It continues to be a mainstay in our wardrobe year-round, whether we're rocking a striped navy and white swimsuit by the beach or bundling up in a knit navy sweater. However, despite this neutral being such a classic, deciding what **colors** go with navy blue can sometimes feel tricky. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Culturally **purple** is often associated with wealth and royalty. This must have been because the Phoenician **purple** dye used in ancient days was very expensive and rare and only the rich could afford clothes colored **purple**. The great Roman emperors Julius Caesar and Augustus wore **purple** as a sign of their wealth and royal power. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The people who wear **purple** are self-assured confident people. They are independent people who care more about their self-satisfaction and the need to express individuality. Purple can be worn to express oneself or to attract attention. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   After you have decided what color and finish of nail polish is right for your manicure, you can think about other features of nail color products that might benefit you. If you don't like to use nail polish remover on your fingernails, you might prefer a water-based product that peels off after it is soaked in water; however, keep in mind that the color from a water-based formula will not last as long as that of an ordinary nail polish. Some dark **purple** nail polishes are single coat products, meaning that they are extra thick and can typically produce desired color results with just one coating of the polish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark **purple** nail polish comes in many different shades, ensuring that there is something for every taste. You can find products that have a pinkish-**purple** cast and are very bold and bright. Some deep **purple** nail polish is nearly black in color while others are a rich shade of eggplant or royal **purple**. You can also find dark **purple** nail polish that is slightly deeper than a pale lilac or lavender hue but not as dark as some other shades. Keep in mind that very dark **colors** are often considered more appropriate for nighttime wear or for special events. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purple nail polish can have warm or cool undertones just like clothing. It is this undertone that you need to match, more so than the exact shade of **purple**. In this way, you will achieve a look that is pleasing to the eye. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As usual, if you are new to colour, why not start off with something small. A pair of vibrant **purple** socks look great with dark denim and brogues. A **purple** patterned pocket square adds a shot of colour to a navy or grey suit jacket. Or if you were wondering what to wear with your khaki suit during the summer, why not pair a dark **purple** tie with a lilac shirt? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red can be paired with neutral **colors** like white or black quite easily. For classy outfits, go for grays, browns, or earthy tones. In summers, tangerines, blues, and mustards look vibrant. It depends on where you are headed and what your personal preference is, but here’s a list with a little bit of everything. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not only do dark **purple** nail polish products differ in their **colors** but they also feature different finishes that change their appearance. The finish of the nail polish refers to the quality of the color. Most nail polish products have a glossy finish, meaning that they still have a shiny, wet look when dry. Others have a matte finish with little to no shine, and semi-gloss or semi-matte products are in between with moderate shine. Some dark **purple** nail polishes have glitter finishes that sparkle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pastel **purple**s and light **purple**s suit fair skin tones. If you have very pale skin, go for an icy shade of Purple like the periwinkle. Very dark **purple**s may wash out very pale faces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A flawless manicure is something that people notice whether you're at work or out for a special night. Getting the right nail polish color to complete your manicure will help you ensure that your nail look truly wows.

-   Dubbed “millennial **purple**”, the powdery pastel palette of lilac and lavender had taken over the styles of many celebrities. They wore it monochrome or matched it with whites, creams, pinks, blues, and black. Valentino’s spring/summer collection saw a lilac frilled and feathered mini dress with an asymmetrical neckline. Prada came out with a lilac embroidered skirt paired with a soft and subtle grey shade. Alberta Ferretti and Gucci sent **purple** regal gowns down the catwalk. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purple pants and skirts are more difficult (but not impossible) to combine than black basics or blue jeans. When choosing your top, stick with plain white, grey, beige or black designs or printed tops that contain **purple**. For example, a blouse with a **purple** floral pattern can be combined with a **purple** skirt if the **purple**s are similar. Various pastels like mint, blush and pastel yellow also go well with lavender **purple**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes we forget how color can be incorporated in our accessories and jewelry. So, if you're unsure about **purple** in your clothes, you should know that **purple** shoes are stunning, especially with denim. Purple bags are also such a fun way to add color to your look.

-   I chose black because, to me, it seemed like a difficult neutral to wear with **purple**, I wanted a little challenge. Surprisingly, it looks great. There's a contrast but it's subtle and I found that it looks best with pastel tones of **purple** or **purple**s with a pinkish hue to them. You can stay safe with a black denim jacket or go big with a blazer and black leather skirt...Love it! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Or if you are wearing a **purple** dress try branching out with a gray, navy or even white polish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **purple** color goes well with all neutral shades. You can use **purple** accessories to style a neutral trouser suit or a shift dress for a pop of color.
