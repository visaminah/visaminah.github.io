-   The amount of light produced by these devices may be a very important purchasing factor for some people and might not matter at all for others, depending on the purpose and application intended for the **lights**.

-   Reliability was the primary factor we studied during our assessment. If the **lights** don't work, they're nothing more than a decoration, or in some cases, an eyesore. To test the reliability of the motion sensor/floodlight models, we left these devices in direct sunlight all day. After nightfall, we approached each light to gauge the range of the motion sensor and its reactivity to movement. For the stake versions, we again left each model in direct sunlight from sun up until sundown, then patiently watched to see when they came on at dusk and how close the timing was among the devices in each set. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   While designs can vary, fundamentally all **solar** **lights** work in a similar way, using a **solar** panel, rechargeable battery and, of course, a lamp. During the day the **solar** panel is used to charge up an internal rechargeable battery. Once the sun sets, the internal battery is then used to power the lamp. Some **lights** will turn on automatically when it gets dark, while others use a manual switch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Powerbee produces a wide range of great quality outdoor **solar** **lights** but we’re especially smitten with this string of 100 white fairy **lights**.

Once lit, you’ll notice a brilliant stardust pattern on the ground. It catches the eye, adds personality, all while serving its main function. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It can also be worth taking note of any advertised IP rating, as this will determine how well the **lights** are able to resist water and dust ingress. When comparing IP ratings, the first digit refers to dust protection and the second digit refers to water protection. For example, a light with an IP64 and a light with IP66 ratings should offer equal protection from dust, but the latter is more able to withstand water ingress. The higher the number, the better, and for year-round use you’ll likely want to look for IP64 or higher. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **solar**-powered LED **lights** from Signature Garden are ideal for illuminating paths, driveways, rockeries or just sticking into plant pots.

And secondly, go with our advice because we’ve already done the work for you! Below you will find 10 of the best **solar** garden **lights** from Amazon – and a bit more information you’ll need before you start shopping. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you start buying outdoor **solar** **lights**, you should consider a few things. First and foremost, it’s a good idea to inspect your landscape and pick the areas you might want to illuminate. Then, you can decide which type of **solar** light would be most suitable for that part of your property. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Simply find a clear spot to site the **solar** panel – it spikes into the ground – and string up your tree, fence or shed, or whatever you like. It also comes with a control box offering a range of different lighting functions, from static to flashing to chase. Don’t panic if your garden’s north facing or you just don’t have enough natural light because it also comes with a USB charging port to boost the internal battery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Each piece includes an auto sensor made of stainless steel and a diamond glass top. You don’t need a landscaper to install these either.

Construction includes rust-proof glass and steel as well as waterproofing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a **solar**-powered product, these four spots are exceptionally bright. This writer expected a feeble glow that illuminated a few leaves before dying out after an hour or so. Instead, they bathed the foliage in about 200 lumens of warm white light that is easily bright enough to illuminate most medium-sized trees and shrubs. The blurb says they have a reach of up to 25 metres which is possibly true in the complete blackness of Mongolia. However, in practice it’s more like five metres which is more than enough for most garden shrubbery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These four **solar** panel **lights** aren’t pretty to look at and the light they emit is harsh white but they work brilliantly well at illuminating the path ahead. The clever thing about them is that they use sensors to detect motion and don’t stay on for more than about 30 seconds at a time unless you remain within sensor distance. This saves battery power so they can work all night if necessary – and even in areas that don’t get much sunlight to charge the internal batteries during the day. Each module is equipped with 128 tiny LEDs that illuminate the immediate area at a maximum angle of 270°. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Bell + Howell Disk Lights are heavy-duty pathway **lights** that pack a 10+ hour punch. They don’t get much easier to assemble than this. The stakes are included for mounting, and they’re extremely stable with its four-corner design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lights** work fully independent of one another and with a dedicated **solar** panel and battery pack built into each unit, there are no wires to mess around with. The **lights** turn on automatically at night and offer the choice of two user-selectable brightness levels. The brighter setting offers up to six hours of illumination off of a full charge while the dimmer setting allows the **lights** to run for up to 12 hours. The units are also IP67 weatherproof, allowing them to stand up to year-round use in all weather conditions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Stake-style **solar** **lights** are an efficient and fuss-free way to gently illuminate a garden path or add ambience to a flower border and, for our money, this pair is one of the best we’ve ever come across. Unlike the popular static, single LED variety, each **solar**-powered TrueFlame is equipped with a battalion of LEDs that flicker independently to simulate a dancing flame. The result is remarkably realistic, even from up close. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s also nice that the **lights** can be manually switched off by a quick switch of a button – which is perfect for conserving the panel’s light when you’re out of town. The overall design is made with a metal casing making it rust-resistant as well as durable throughout the seasons. And finally, it includes moisture-proof insurance as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

This gives you sufficient leeway in mounting the **solar** panel in a spot that receives plenty of sunlight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Solar **lights** are powered by the sun and don’t require electricity.

-   Next, we carefully inspected each version of outdoor **solar** **lights** for differences in design and functionality. Some are simplistic and are up and running in a matter of seconds, and others require tools to mount to a wall or adjust the settings. Finally, we considered the style and appearance of each model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **solar** panel’s battery absorbs the sun’s energy during the day (even in winter) and as soon as its light sensor detects dusk, they switch on and stay on till well past bedtime.

It’s not a difficult process to uninstall the light to change the mode, but annoying nonetheless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For this review, we spent weeks using the **lights** at our own homes. We used the floodlight versions above a garage door to see how well they could illuminate a driveway and then mounted them on a wall above a staircase to see how they worked in a variety of settings. The stake versions were placed in yards and along walkways to check how well they could light up pathways at night. We took detailed notes on each model's various designs and styles, and we paid close attention to how well the controls worked and how difficult they were to access. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The ZOOKKI **lights** aren't exactly easy on the eyes. The bland look of this model isn't going to add much curb appeal to your property.

-   Christina shrugs. “I’m not too sure. I know a few of the differences between them, like **solar** gets power from the sun, which means it’s free.

For outdoor **solar** string **lights**, I would generally recommend going for IP65 or higher as one of the key features to look for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After choosing the type of light you want, its brightness comes into play. Most light manufacturers will mention the maximum brightness of a light in lumens.
