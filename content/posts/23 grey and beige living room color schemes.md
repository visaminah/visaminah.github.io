## 23 Fun Facts Grey And Beige Living Room Color Schemes | Living Room Color Schemes
-   Ground your living room with these neutral colors. Opt for a **grey** base for the walls and accent with brown window treatments, accessories with black finishes for an organic, elegant space. You can also introduce vibrant reds or crisp whites to balance out the energy in the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'There was a riot of color in the room from the art to the rug so the sofa, due to its size, needed to be a neutral **grey**. We opted for a sofa with a soft, rounded shape to it so that the children felt that they could play all around it and that it didn’t feel too imposing in the room.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One thing I’ve realized lately is that I’m totally in love with a **grey** color scheme. I’m sure this is probably because my house is basically tan everywhere you turn and I’m just over it and like to make things difficult for myself. I actually think that’s part of the reason why I wanted to try to sell our new couches a couple of months ago (which we never sold, by the way). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using neutral tone colors such as **beige** for the wall paint behind the gray couch can help create a soft and welcoming living room. The **beige** color will go beyond white, yet feel sweeter than the typical tan. This color also can help the living room feel brighter as it creates sunny and warming effects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – If you want to create a soothing vibe, try combining gray with a neutral color palette of white and off-white shades, **beige**s, tans, blacks, and browns. These are colors that go well with gray of all shades, both lighter shades and darker shades. Also, if you want to create a more monochromatic look, don’t forget that you can also pair gray with other gray shades. If you use multiple tones of gray together, you can still create depth and nuance. Pink – Blush pink and gray have been a winning combination in the current era, but there are also shades of darker pink that add warmth and depth to gray tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'The pinks warm timbers I have paired with this sofa tend to work well. Grey can often work as a particularly good canvas for other pops of stronger color without making a scheme feel overwhelming. I also like to combine mustard colors and blue tones with **grey**.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Olive green and sage green are very similar. Using these colors, you can enhance your **grey** couch or living room set with an earthy feel similar to brown. At the same time, using trim that is colored with light or dark browns can help give a very nice feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With a charcoal accent wall to create moody contrast in this living room, the **grey** accents seem a natural choice. We love the shimmering faux hide rug, which adds an attractive shape and texture to the space without demanding attention. The **grey** aesthetic continues with the accent chair and throw pillow arrangement on the couch. In addition, earthy shades of tan and **beige** go well with **grey**, adding visual warmth to make the area more inviting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Where do you begin when you design your living room? A good place to start is with the sofa. Choose one you love and create your room around it. In this new series, we share ideas on how to design your living space around some popular sofa styles. This time, it’s a Houzzers’ favourite – the wonderfully adaptable **grey** couch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Neutral paint colors for living room are always calm and elegant, so a palette of white, cream, taupe, **grey** and brown is a classic option for a living room that has to please everyone. Select any of paint color themes such as monochromatic, analogous, complementary, triad, split-complementary, warm, cool or neutral colors. You can apply paint colors that will highlight your living room color design.

-   Pink and **grey** living rooms can be either restful or impactful. Harris continues ‘Cushions with added details like the ever more popular trend of frills adds a touch of real depth and texture to an interior space. These sorts of textures add instant impact and drama to a room and the range of designs and fabrics are endless, it’s a real way to bring some fun into a scheme.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And if you want to keep everything neutral, that's where texture comes in. Layering up different fabrics in the form of cushions and throws can create just as much interest as bringing in a rainbow of color. Mix together **beige**s, creams, and whites in linen, boucle, velvet, any materials that have a tactile quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'We worked with neutral shades, whites and finely textured natural fibers which give depth and tone in the absence of stronger colors or patterns. The sharp tailored feel of this **grey** Donghia living room sectional sofa allowed us to introduce the comfort of an l-shape sofa into a smaller living room, we chose a warm but light **grey** Rubelli fabric in this instance to avoid overwhelming the space and to create a feeling of calm spaciousness.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'Whilst **grey** isn't a groundbreaking tone for furnishings, it will never go out of style if it works with the architecture of a space. As the living area was sunken and floors were a creamy polished concrete, we opted for a neutral fabric to feel tonal and complimentary, and wrapped it in an earthy walnut veneer.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Boucle is still going strong in the world of interior design trends and this lovely tactile fabric can give a **grey** sofa more interest, adding subtle texture and extra comfort. It's also a super durable fabric so a practical choice too. The key to making it work is to pair this very deep pile fabric with plenty of clean lines so you get that lovely contrast and the boucle really makes a statement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Neutrals – If you want to create a soothing vibe, try combining gray with a neutral color palette of white and off-white shades, **beige**s, tans, blacks, and browns. These are colors that go well with gray of all shades, both lighter shades and darker shades. Also, if you want to create a more monochromatic look, don’t forget that you can also pair gray with other gray shades. If you use multiple tones of gray together, you can still create depth and nuance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Loved this for an idea of some various accessories to add in. I’d love to be able to add a contrasting accent chair someday, in a darker **grey**. But the practical side of me would much rather prefer a nice big, comfy recliner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another advantage of using **beige** as wall paint is that it can blend easily with any other colors and elements of your room, not only the gray couch. If your living room had any different materials and colors then this color can help you to incorporate all of those different elements together. To get an even better result, use a throw pillow with similar **beige** shades of the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **grey** couch is the perfect base to get really creative with how you style it. Being a neutral hue, what you want to be looking to do is add interest. The most obvious way to do this is with color and pattern. Bold hues are really going to pop and you can bring in plenty of pattern too without worrying about it being overwhelming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are after a modern rustic living room vibe, linen is the perfect choice for a **grey** couch. It adds that instant slubby texture creating an undone, effortless feel that's so on-trend right now. Pair it with driftwood accents, woven natural fabrics like jute and seagrass for a laidback beachy feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'This dark living room features a beautiful, dark **grey** sofa with white oak shelves that frame the tiled linear fireplace front and float over white, plaster-like wallpaper offering texture and balance to the room. The soft-curved swivel chair was upholstered in Holly Hunt winter white wool as a juxtaposition to the masculine elements in the room.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our never-ending love of **grey** comes down to the fact it's so versatile. Grey can work with any style from uber-modern to rustic farmhouse. And the fact that this neutral can be used to create pretty much any look makes it the perfect hue for a couch that brings together multiple styles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There's something about a classic striped couch. And a **grey** and white is the perfect combo if you are after something neutral but want it to make a bit of a statement. An oversize sectional like this one also helps fill out a room, so you don’t end up with awkward, empty corners. When faced with a strange nook in one of the home’s main rooms, the Albion Nord (opens in new tab) team gave the spot purpose by swathing the walls in dark green fabric panels and adding a striped L-shaped sofa (the fabric is from Penny Morrison (opens in new tab)). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
