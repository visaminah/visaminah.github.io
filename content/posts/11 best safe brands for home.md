-   The Honeywell 1108 Fire/Water Large File Chest is a larger version of our top-pick **safe**, with the same one-hour fireproof rating. This 84-pound behemoth is designed to hold both letter- and legal-size hanging file folders, which is convenient if you have a lot of documents or simply want to keep your things organized. But it is a huge hassle to move. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Plus, according to a fire expert we spoke to, their two-hour-plus protection ratings offer diminishing returns since most house fires are out within about an hour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Remember that high-tech modern burglars could come to the **safe** with everything, from a blowtorch and high-tech encryption software.
