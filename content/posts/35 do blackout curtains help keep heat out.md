## 35 Reference List: Do Blackout Curtains Help Keep Heat Out | Best Blackout Curtains For Heat
-   Blackout **curtains** are also known as “thermal drapes” for a reason. They’re ideal for blocking light and heat from windows that get strong sun. And the best part is that contrary to popular belief, **blackout** **curtains** do not have to be black. They don’t even have to be **curtains**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This will make your homeowners’ association happy as well; many of them stipulate that only white window treatments should be visible from the street. (In fact, hanging **blackout** drapes outside would be the best way to reduce heat transfer; however, HOAs and neighbors might not be too enthusiastic about the look.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s a lot easier to come up with $40 for a set of **curtains**. And if money is tight, you can do one room at a time as you can afford it. If you only replace one window at a time, you’ll spend more per window. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In other words, when you're shopping for **blackout** **curtains** for heat-related purposes, you should consider lighter colors, as they will actually serve better than darker colors. But to get the best of both worlds, you'll want to find a **blackout** curtain that has white backing to reflect radiant heat but a darker main fabric to prevent light leaks. And to make things even more complicated, some **blackout** **curtains** even have special thermal insulation layers — there are a lot of variables for you to consider. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But not all **blackout** **curtains** are created equally. Window treatment company Classic Blinds & Shutters performed a study on the energy savings of different window coverings. "Our conclusion from this is that using **blackout** blinds is effective, but that color had an enormous impact," the company's owner, Beverly Fidler, tells Hunker. "White was much better at reflecting radiant heat — that is, heat generated from light — and black was much better at absorbing light rays." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How much insulating properties **blackout** **curtains** have depends both on the **curtains** and how you use them. Ideally, when you buy **curtains**, buy **curtains** that advertise thermal properties as well. If the curtain tells you its R rating, even better. Buy the highest R rating you can find. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No matter what style you choose, you should always read the fine print before making your final purchase to avoid potential disappointment. “Be sure that you see the word ‘**blackout**’ in the description as opposed to ‘room darkening’ or ‘light filtering,’” said Peters. “These other two options may not block as much of the light from your room.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   O’Brien recommended Pottery Barn's **blackout** **curtains** due to their array of styles and colors “that work well with most people's houses.” Sold as individual panels, the brand’s Emery Linen Blackout Curtain is made from a linen and cotton blend and includes curtain hooks to use with round or clip rings. You can select from two widths — 50 inches and 100 inches — as well as three lengths: 84 inches, 96 inches and 108 inches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Available in three different sizes ranging from 80 inches to 104 inches in length, these **curtains** with pole pockets can be a simple yet effective choice, explained Brown. “This selection accomplishes all of your needs for a beautifully designed **blackout** curtain that’s still reasonably priced,” she said. The curtain is offered individually or in a set of two and you can purchase separate ring clips for ease of use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . Blackout **curtains** can have a “muffling effect” that softens the noise from outside, according to Pamela O’Brien, principal interior designer at Pamela Hope Designs. Insulate the room from drafts or heat . Because there’s a thick liner attached to **blackout** drapery, O’Brien said they can help keep your room a little warmer by limiting the cold air seeping through the window (it’s even more effective if you choose a thermal curtain ). And by blocking direct sunlight, they can also make the room a little cooler during the warmer months. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By installing good thermal **curtains** and taking other measures, I’ve been able to decrease my energy costs most years over the last decade. Energy hasn’t gotten any cheaper, but by using less of it, I’ve been able to negate the increases. That’s good for the environment and good for my wallet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the sun sends your air conditioner into overdrive during the summer, then SFGate recommends **curtains** as a countermeasure. While **blackout** **curtains** perform a coat-like function in the winter, they almost act as sunscreen in the summer. As an added bonus, **blackout** **curtains** can also protect furniture from premature fading. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . Because there’s a thick liner attached to **blackout** drapery, O’Brien said they can help keep your room a little warmer by limiting the cold air seeping through the window (it’s even more effective if you choose a ). And by blocking direct sunlight, they can also make the room a little cooler during the warmer months. Protect furniture and decor from fading. Ultraviolet rays from the sun can cause interior surfaces like furniture, fabrics and carpeting to fade or become damaged. By blocking sunlight, **blackout** **curtains** create a decent barrier between the sun and your furnishing, said Jennifer Hunter, interior designer and owner of Jennifer Hunter Design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The term “**blackout** curtain” often refers to drapes made of a double-lined, tightly woven fabric designed to block out light completely, explained Beth Brown, an interior designer and owner of Beth Brown Interiors in Atlanta. There are also built-in **blackout** liners made to completely block out light, which is accomplished through “a coating that’s applied to the fabric [that] blocks the little pores in the weave,” said Brown. “This material is thick and offers thermal insulation benefits, blocks out noise and creates ultimate privacy.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Susan Peters, owner and interior designer for 9108 Designs, emphasized PBteen’s combination of quality and design details. “Don't let the ‘teen’ part fool you — this curtain is appropriate for all ages,” she added. “Pottery Barn across the board makes some amazing **blackout** **curtains**.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When the weather is cold outside, **blackout** **curtains** can reduce the amount of heat that escapes through your home’s windows. As Décor My Living puts it, these **curtains** keep “heat inside the room during winter months.” That means that your heating system won’t have to work to continually replenish heat as it leaves through your windows. You can think of **blackout** **curtains** as a coat for each room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Using draperies with rings is much more user-friendly, and if you want **blackout**-lined drapes, you will likely open and close them every day,” said O’Brien. She added that rings tend to glide along a rod easily, while rod pockets and grommets are “clunky, more difficult to open and close and don’t look as pretty and polished.” Ultimately, though, this decision comes down to personal preference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Daylight saving time is almost here — this year falling on Sunday, Nov. 6 — which means we'll gain an hour of sleep and, in the process, get sunlight earlier in the morning and lose some in the evening. If the time change means the sun is up before you are, **blackout**s **curtains** can be a worthwhile investment: Experts told us they look like typical **curtains** but feature a **blackout** lining that stops light from filtering into your room. They can also help regulate how well you sleep overall — studies have found that shifts in exposure to light before you rise can reduce your quality of sleep, disrupt circadian rhythm (the internal process that regulates sleep) and make you feel fatigued much earlier in the day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To get the full effect, you need to attach the **curtains** to the wall to seal out the window. The best thermal **curtains** come with Velcro strips for exactly this purpose. During the hottest and coldest months of the year, you seal the **curtains** to the strips to seal out airflow and improve the **curtains**’ insulating properties. During warmer months, and on unseasonably warm days, you can unseal the **curtains** so you can use them as normal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Depending on the length of your ceiling and where the window is located, Brown recommended measuring at least 8 to 10 inches from the sides of the window, if possible, so the **curtains** are wider than your actual windows. And as a rule of thumb for floor-length **curtains**, Brown suggested they “kiss the floor,” meaning **curtains** should be an inch or so above the ground. Our experts emphasized that hiring a professional to measure the right size curtain can help avoid mistakes and costly replacements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So, you can have the perfect pair of Thermal Curtains that match your décor. Thermal **curtains** work best when they are Made To Measure. This way they completely cover the window and ensure that there are no gaps for heat to escape or cool air to get in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re going for the real deal, you can purchase **blackout** drapes ready made in various lengths. However, DIY and frugal types take note: Curtains are one of the easiest sewing projects imaginable. Tailoring them yourself will let you get the precise dimensions and the look you like. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Regulate Room Temperature – It’s in the name. Just like thermal clothing keeps your body warm, Thermal Curtains keep your home warm. By keeping the heat in the room and blocking out any cool drafts; thermal **curtains** keep the temperature within your home comfortable and regulated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’ve seen the posts about foil on windows potentially cracking the glass if put up on the inside, but what about **blackout** **curtains**? Just bought a very large **blackout** sheet to go on our south-facing windows (double paned, dunno if that is double glazed) and the back side is a silvery colour. Can’t seem to find any advice about it online. Does anyone know if there’s a risk like there is with foil? We live high up so it’s not possible to put it on the outside. Thank you! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That's where **curtains** and drapes come in — they create a barrier between the sun's rays and the cool air inside a space, keeping the former out and the latter in. "[They] will reduce thermal transference, meaning [they] will keep the temperatures on either side of the curtain panel stable," Angela Boswell, co-founder of curtain company The Drape, tells Hunker. "The thicker the curtain or more dense the weave structure, the less transference will occur." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In addition to filtering out light, there are several other benefits to **blackout** **curtains** — as long as you choose the right one for your home. We spoke to experts about what to consider when shopping for **blackout** **curtains** and how you can get the most use out of them. We also highlighted their picks for the best **blackout** **curtains** to shop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   During warm months, **blackout** **curtains** can reduce energy bills by blocking sun-induced heat from entering the home. That trait can be particularly useful in sunny areas. For instance, take the Bay Area: Custom **blackout** **curtains** can be especially valuable there given that the region receives a lot of sunlight. According to BestPlaces, San Francisco enjoys 259 sunny days per year, while the average US city enjoys just 205. That means that San Francisco has nearly two extra months of sun compared to average American cities! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While, yes, thermal **curtains** can reduce light by up to 90% and insulate against heat, it’s important to note that not all thermal options are alike. For the best insulation, look for a thermal curtain that has at least two layers, triple-woven fabric, and **blackout** technology to eliminate light and even noise. And while it may initially seem like the bigger the price tag, the better the quality, that’s not actually the case. There are plenty of high-quality **curtains** that are totally budget-friendly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're looking at a specific curtain that’s not offered as a **blackout** option, or if you simply want to keep the **curtains** you already have in your home, placing a **blackout** curtain liner under your regular curtain can be an effective (and often more economical) way to get the **blackout** effect, according to Peters. “You can buy any **curtains** that fit your style and pair them with a **blackout** curtain or **blackout** curtain liner,” she said. Our experts recommended this **blackout** liner that comes with two panels and drapery rings, is machine washable and blocks out up to 99 percent of light, according to the brand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blackout **curtains** block light, which can also help block heat in the summertime. But the backing on **blackout** **curtains** has insulating properties too. This means they help to keep the cold out during the winter months too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For your bedroom, these thermal insulated drapes can block up to 99 percent of light, according to the brand. I previously highlighted these **curtains** as my favorite sleep aid during cold New York winters when I need complete darkness, and Brown agreed they can be a good option for the bedroom. Available in 24 fade-resistant colors and 10 sizes, the brand says they come with two panels per package to accommodate various types of windows and styles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   O’Brien also noted that **curtains** with **blackout** lining are heavier than typical **curtains**, so investing in a good quality drapery rod is important. “Don’t buy the thinnest, least expensive rod — you don’t want it to sag or break,” she said, adding that shoppers should look for a rod that has a larger diameter of about 1 inch that can hold more fabric. And while there’s a price jump, both O’Brien and Brown recommended a traverse rod, which features a baton or string that you pull to open and close the **curtains** for additional ease. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thermal Curtains and Blackout Curtains are similar but not exactly the same. Most Thermal Curtains will help with blocking out light pollution due to their thick lining. However, many **blackout** **curtains** don’t have the insulating lining that come with Thermal Curtains. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thermal Curtains and Blackout Curtains are both great. And both will go a long way in blocking unwanted light. However, Thermal Curtains are especially great at insulating a room and keeping your home warm. If you want **curtains** that block out light as well as they regular room temperature, opt for Blackout Curtains with an insulated, thermal lining. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether premade or home-crafted, your **blackout** **curtains** will be washable. For extra-easy care, hang them back up while still wet so they won’t wrinkle. You’ll also save electricity by not putting them in the dryer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
