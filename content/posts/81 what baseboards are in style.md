The color you buy upfront stays as painting plastic doesn’t tend to go well if you want to change the color. It’s durable, but it also needs to have holes drilled into it to avoid cracks and breaks.

-   Knowing how important crown moulding is, it can be intimidating to choose the correct size and **style**. There are some clear and simple rules that every architect, builder, and homeowner should keep in mind when choosing the perfect crown moulding for a space. To determine the correct size crown to use, we look to the Orders of classical architecture. The crown moulding, along with other trim, directly relate to the historic columns of antiquity. When comparing traditional mouldings to the Doric Order of ancient Greece, the base moulding relates to the pedestal base, the chair rail relates to the pedestal cap, and the crown moulding relates to the column’s entablature or cornice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I suggest the Dremel. If you don’t regularly uninstall trim as part of your profession, you’ll find it’s very easy to to crack it in the process. If you were able to take off the door trim without breaking it, then maybe you can give the **baseboards** a shot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also known as a baseboard with rounded corners, bullnose **baseboards** are designed with safety in mind. If you’re one of those people who finds themselves frequently stubbing their toe on the corners of the baseboard, having this type of baseboard can save you and your items when bumping into it. The rounded corners also give a softer look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want something more subtle, choose textured **baseboards**. These boards can range from very smooth to slightly uneven. They are often used in bedrooms or spaces that don’t receive a lot of foot traffic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This trim is known for being taller than standard **baseboards**, starting around at about four inches tall. The mid-height sculpted baseboard is about 4 to 5 ½ inches tall and about 5/8 inches thick. It has a decoratively shaped profile that can help your room stand apart from other more contemporary homes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally speaking, the higher the ceiling, the taller your baseboard must be. If not, you’ll end up minimizing your room. An exception to this general rule is if you’re trying a more contemporary **style**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Farmhouse **baseboards** make the space look informal. Modern farmhouse spaces are all about creating inviting spaces with bright and light minimal design. So, it only fits that the best baseboard molding **style**s for a modern farmhouse motif are flat, simple, and angular. Simple **baseboards** and crown molding are common in farmhouse design. You can’t go wrong with white or cream colors to accentuate the **style**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a number of baseboard profiles that you can choose, one of which is ranch baseboard. Ranch baseboard is one of the most widely-used **baseboards**. It has even been used for years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The height of sculpted taller baseboard moldings ranges from approximately 5 ½ to 7 inches or even taller with various width ranging from 5/8 inch to an inch. Since this beautiful baseboard come in various sizes and materials, the price is also varied. But these kinds of **baseboards** are the most pricey of all the four major **baseboards**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want a sleek and straightforward look, choose straight **baseboards**. These boards are typically uniform in width and run parallel to the flooring surface. Straight bases can be used in any room without drawing attention to themselves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you select your baseboard's height, **style**, and color, determine the correct baseboard material for your space. Though there are plenty of options—for example, PVC or vinyl are excellent moisture-resistant options for outdoor spaces and bathrooms, while medium-density fiberboards are cost-effective alternatives—many designers are partial to wood. "The most common baseboard material is paint-grade wood, but stain-grade wood, ranging from mahogany to pecky cypress, are also used frequently in custom projects," says Bohlert Smith. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The walls and floors in older buildings are often uneven due to settling over the years. Dixon has fond memories of his first apartment in New York: “There wasn’t a single 90-degree angle in the whole place,” he recalls, “but it did have wonderful moldings, even though the floors and walls and **baseboards** were all wonky.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If this is the same case for you, try to go with as modern as you can. Or if you are willing to live with different **style**s in different rooms, then that’s ok too! It is not ideal, but as with anything, there are phases of the design process. We all have to be patient with the journey of making a house our home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With the modern trend of shaker **style** doors and cabinets, even the paint finish has transitioned to much simpler look. Many paint companies have a matte finish but guaranteed durability and that is still easy to clean. You pay for what you get for, so I believe that the brand matters. For me I really enjoy using Sherwin Williams. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When **baseboards** are done right, they add beauty and sophistication to a room without overpowering it. The eye almost doesn’t even register them. But when they’re done wrong, or when they don’t even exist? Nothing could be more obvious. That’s why it’s important to get this detail of your home correct. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Did you know you can add accessories to your **baseboards**? Plinth blocks help to join moldings of different widths, like a wider baseboard meeting a narrow door casing. Divider blocks add a decorative touch when the walls meet at a 45-degree angle. While plinth blocks and divider blocks are functional, they also add sophistication to the space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Look at the overall design of the room. If the baseboard is a major feature of the space, select a **style** that will compliment it. Consider how often people will use this area of your home. If it’s an entrance or hallway, for example, textured boards may be more subtle and less noticeable than wavy bases would be. Try out different **style**s in person to see which one suits your needs best! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because it’s mildly decorative, it is simple enough to blend in almost any interior design **style**. Its relatively short profile and simple shape make it suitable for modern houses. It’s also a great profile to choose if you have a more elaborate crown molding or another feature that you’d like to stand out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Taller baseboard **style**s start at around five inches and go up from there. It usually runs about 5-7 inches tall and coordinates with the mid-height version at 5/8 inches thick. This trim profile can add a more drastic accent to the wallboard. The taller it is, the more material it uses, so it becomes more expensive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is the question I get every day for walls and trim. For walls, go ahead and read this post I wrote. For **baseboards**, here are some suggestions: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For example, if your door casing trim is 3.5” like ours, you’d want your **baseboards** to be at least 5.25” for the **baseboards** to look substantial enough. There’s nothing worse than undersized **baseboards**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Baseboards are installed partly for aesthetic reasons: Just as crown molding hides the area where walls meet the ceiling, **baseboards** hide the joint where walls meet the floor, which might otherwise be unsightly. But **baseboards** also serve a very necessary function in protecting plaster walls from getting kicked or scuffed by shoes, boots, and vacuum attachments. “A vacuum cleaner can do a nasty number on a wall,” says Dixon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vinyl **baseboards** are easy to install and replace. You only need to cut a vinyl baseboard based on the length of the wall and simply press onto the wall. It is merely a breeze, isn’t it? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Baseboards are installed partly for aesthetic reasons and mostly for covering the joints between the flooring and the walls. Just as crown moldings hide the area where the walls meet the ceiling, **baseboards** conceal the joint where the walls meet the floor, which can be unsightly. The baseboard adds extra visual interest to the house, but most importantly, it hides imperfections, contains any leaks, protects plaster walls from getting kicked or scuffed, and avoids getting things stuck into the cracks and crevices of the two materials butting up against each other can create. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Caulking: When working with **baseboards**, especially when layering or adding molding, you want to add a finishing touch of caulking. While this is not always necessary, it provides a complete look to the job. When choosing your caulk, you want to make sure it matches your baseboard color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Though **baseboards** give most homes a finished look, Zandy Gammons of Miretta Interiors points out that they're not a requirement. "We just completed a project that didn't have **baseboards** because our client wanted her home to feel like an art gallery," the North Carolina-based designer explains. "She wanted her walls to be the focus." So, how do you decide if your home actually needs this fixture? While personal preference plays a role, so does your home's overarching design. "It is always dependent on the home's **style**," Bohlert Smith affirms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And while this is the least expensive option, typically, I personally never choose to use anything other than real wood. I try my best to not sacrifice quality in my quest for the cheapest way to DIY a project. So, to build farmhouse-**style** trim I chose to use Common Lumber and Furring Strips which is real pine wood and is a comparable price to MDF sheets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Notice the 45° angle. Once it is filled with caulk or spackle you will never notice it there. It's so easy to build farmhouse-**style** trim. I'm so happy I started this project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vinyl **baseboards** are a lot similar to PVC. It’s strong and available in any color imaginable. It comes in long rolls while it’s adhered to the wall by a strong glue. It’s a cost-effective, easy-to-maintain, and durable material compared to rubber. It can even mimic wood grain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Baseboards are not just a pretty addition to a home (although, they certainly are that!). They also exist as a functional piece of material. Installed where the floor meets the wall, **baseboards** cover up uneven flooring and prevent furniture from being pushed too close to the wall. But besides their function, they help to complete the look of a room, making the room look sophisticated and more complete. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Colonial [the Mid 1700s to early 1800s]: Borrowed from European roots and relied heavily on Georgian design. Fireplaces were the focal point of rooms, whitewash finishes were popular, and wainscoting was frequently used. In some interpretations, this includes simple **baseboards**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are designing a home or looking to integrate your baseboard trim with an existing **style**, it helps to start with the period pieces. However, some extensive research on the **style**s or help from an experienced designer may ultimately be the best way to choose a **style**. For our purposes, period pieces are simply guidelines, and no exact rules need to be followed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Meanwhile, pine **baseboards** are among the most affordable wood **baseboards** you can get if you want a wooden trim. It’s great for both interior and exterior use, and it can resist moisture. Jointed pine is primed and pre-treated, so knots and warping are removed. It’s also easy to install due to the flexibility of the wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to pack more of a **style** punch or if your house has a slightly more formal appearance, choosing this type of baseboard is the best way to go. A mid-height baseboard can also keep your room feeling and looking balanced if you like to incorporate crown molding into a room that doesn’t have high ceilings. It pairs well with any type of crown molding, but it’s best to use as a focal trim when painted or stained in a contrasting color to the floor or wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wide **baseboards** (at least 5 inches tall) are my jam. In this case size does matter! But depending on the size of the room, my love affair for tall **baseboards** may or may not work. If you are wondering what it would take to replace yours, let’s delve into the world of trim so you can level up! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I've wanted to replace our builder-grade trim for a while now. But the cost was always a stumbling block to getting it done. I'm happy to say I've figured out how to build farmhouse-**style** trim cheap using common lumber. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Curved **baseboards**, which have an effortless and delicate appearance, can fit in just about any room. They can deliver a classy yet distressed look to your home. Often sold in cream colors, curved **baseboards** tend to work well in understated rooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to go for wood, hardwood for the baseboard is the best choice. It’s your most durable choice. Oakwood is the most popular hardwood baseboard material, as it can give a luxurious look to the home. It looks beautiful whether painted or stained, smooth or carved or placed in the interior or exterior. But since wood is a renewable resource, real oak **baseboards** come at a premium price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many things that you need to take into your consideration before deciding to make a home improvement. Something that you think unimportant can alter your house’ looks a lot. Installing baseboard, for instance. But you need to choose the baseboard **style** that suits your house and budget well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you prefer a more rustic look, choose wavy **baseboards** instead. These boards have a textured finish and may be irregular in width. They are typically used in rooms with a high-traffic area, such as an entryway or hallway. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Modern **style** moldings will have little to no profile. They are usually flat boards. Craftsman **style** isn’t much different. It’s mostly all flat, with usually some layering of smaller pieces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sculpted taller baseboard moldings will protect the lower part of your wall against scuff marks. But you are not suggested adding crown moldings and any other pieces of trim to avoid being too exaggerating. The built-in sculpted of these **baseboards** will be enough. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to **baseboards**, your **style** choices are limited to the **style** of your home. Baseboard that doesn’t match the **style** of the house will just look off and wrong, so you want to make sure you match your baseboard to your house’s character. For example, if you live in a Victorian home, you can choose elaborate molding, while a modern home is better suited to a plain plank. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are also other places to use moldings and trim such as decorative walls and ceilings. This type of addition can add **style** and character to any room. This always creates more of a custom look and feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I used a matte finish for the **baseboards** in my girls bathroom. And honestly I have been pleasantly surprised. No scuffs or touch ups needed so far! If you know your high traffic space will not withstand flat white paint, then I would recommend using no higher finish than semi-gloss. The last thing you want to do is ruin your modern look with a shiny 80s look. Well, unless you’re into that sort of look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Any other room, including the formal one, can be decorated with it. Cutting and styling vinyl baseboard is simple. The great news is that combining any other furnishings in your space with vinyl baseboard **style** is a great idea. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The answer to that question is simple, you buy the cheapest wood without sacrificing quality, which is common lumber and furring strips. I am using 1x6x8 for the header above windows and doors, 1x4x8 for the sides, bottom, and windowsill, and 1x2x8s between the other two to build all of my farmhouse-**style** trim in my home. The whole process starts in the hardware store, I actually go through the entire process of how to pick the best cheap wood in my post How to Make Cheap Wood Look Pretty which is a prerequisite to this post. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you bump the bottom of the wall, you run the risk of cracking the drywall. If you spill liquid on the floor, it could soak into the drywall. Because accidents like this can harm your wall, **baseboards** are an essential part of your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Baseboard trim is usually much less ornate than crown molding, though in modern houses both can be starkly simple. Remember that more streamlined molding will collect less dust and dirt. And since **baseboards** are adjacent to the floor, you need to make sure the two materials work together in terms of color and texture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So, if tall **baseboards** are a problem, what about short **baseboards**? Depending on the ceiling height, short **baseboards** may also be problematic. Remember, they are used to create a visual balance in the room. If they are too short, they may get lost in a room with high ceilings and will not provide any aesthetic purpose at all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to give your baseboard the perfect finishing touch, consider adding moulding into the mix. Lovingly nicknamed the "base shoe," this feature covers up any inconsistencies, gaps, or imperfections between your floor and **baseboards**. Typically, dwellers choose between one of two **style**s: shoe moulding or quarter round moulding. Though these terms are often used interchangeably, each **style** has subtle differences: quarter round iterations are always shaped like one quadrant of a circle, whereas shoe options can vary in size and shape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Farmhouse-**style** trim was installed on my back door in the dining room. It definitely makes a statement. You can see the spackling covering up any nail holes as I prep to paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For older houses, Dixon offers the same advice as he did with crown molding: “You don’t want to remove **baseboards** if at all possible. It can be a big job, and you have to put something in their place. Better to repair what’s already there.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are in the position of having **baseboards** that are too high for the room, there is not an easy fix. You will most likely need to remove the **baseboards** and replace them with a shorter option. When choosing the new **baseboards**, make sure you factor in the height of the flooring, as this will impact the overall height of the finished product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re installing new **baseboards** on wonky walls, it’s best to use molding made of a composite material like polystyrene, which is more flexible than wood. “You have to follow the contours of the walls,” says Dixon, “and use caulk or paint to hide the gaps.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   According to the experts, it all depends on personal preference. While some dwellers prefer a short piece that blends in nicely with your walls, others opt for a longer **style** that looks like substantial trim. But, for a happy medium, Bohlert Smith says it's important to measure up. "A good rule of thumb is for the overall base height to be approximately the same height in inches as the ceiling is in feet," she shares. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   PVC: Available in many **style**s, although in most cases not as durable as other options. Commonly used in rooms that could come in contact with water (e.g., Laundry or Mudroom) as PVC is non-water absorbent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A baseboard myth designers hope to debunk? Though they might be common, **baseboards** aren't a one-**style**-fits-all feature. (In fact, experts agree that not every space even needs a baseboard to begin with.) To help you navigate this important, but nuanced design element, two experts share important questions to consider when choosing **baseboards** for your space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to **baseboards**, height is a particularly important factor in the decision-making process. If you place **baseboards** that are too high into a room, it will not be aesthetically pleasing, and you will likely not be happy with the decision. On the flip side, if the **baseboards** are too low, they will also be unpleasing to the eye. (Source: Don Pedro Brooklyn) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is of course a victorian option of farmhouse trim, but this would typically involve much more decorative carved trim and rosettes. I love that look, but this house doesn't scream victorian. So, I'm saving that for my dream home. For now, I will simply build farmhouse-**style** trim in this house by using the Arts and Crafts Style as my inspiration! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bohemian is one of today’s more popular **style**s of **baseboards**. It’s a mixture of ornate Moroccan patterns with a funky, unconventional, and eclectic appearance. The design has curves that portray a lavish décor. It is suitable for people who want to achieve a certain unspoken elegance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Save some pieces: If possible, save a scrap from your baseboard project for possible repairs in the future. Baseboards contain subtle nuances, especially milled boards, from run to run. This is helpful if one of your **baseboards** is damaged and needs to be replaced. In some cases, even when the baseboard is the same model, the new board might not exactly match the existing one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is not only affordable, but also durable. Most wooden **baseboards** can absorb moisture very well but it does not mean that it can put up with getting soaked. If the water has damaged your wooden baseboard, you will need to replace it. However, vinyl baseboard is water-proof so that it is more durable than wooden **baseboards**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
