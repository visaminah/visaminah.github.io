What Are The Different Styles Of Art will be the topic of our conversation on this particular occasion. There is, without a doubt, a great deal of information pertaining to The Scream available on the internet. As a result of the rapid development of social media, it is now much simpler for us to acquire new information.

There is a connection between the pieces of information pertaining to Cartoon Art Styles, Art Styles, and Art History and Artists. Regarding the other items that need to be searched, one of those things is concerning what are the different types of articles, which will also have something to do with Surrealism.

## 77 Fun Facts What Are The Different Styles Of Art | Art History and Artists
-   Neighboring the country that invented the technique, many Austrian **art**ists st**art**ed using expressionism in their respective **art**works. The two main figures of the Austrian brand of expressionist **art** are Egon Schiele and Oskar Kokoschka. Playing off of the themes of moral hypocrisy when it comes to dense topics like death, sex, violence and longing, their works used distorted depictions of these to communicate intense emotions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the decade following the forming of Die Brücke, another early German expressionist group was formed. Der Blaue Reiter, or “The Blue Rider,” was a movement spearheaded by **art**ists that would later become legendary like Kandinsky. They were known for their varying subject matter, but interest in exploring spiritual themes with their **art**. As Europe and the world headed for war in the early 1900’s, the expressionist elements that these groups used would go on to influence **art**ists outside Germany in many ways. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We cannot talk about famous expressionist **art**ists and destinations without mentioning the Norwegian scene, and most notably, Edvard Munch. With his brooding colors, sinister usage of light and color, and his signature way of drawing, Munch has become an icon of expressionism. His works have a tendency to give a darker, melancholic and oftentimes unsettling effect. Take, for example, his most important and famous work, The Scream. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Painterly style appeared in Europe in the end of the 19th century as the Industrial Revolution swept the continent. The **art** painting style emphasises on the character of the brushwork and pigments. Painterly **art**ists don’t try to disguise what they use to create the painting by smoothing out the texture or marks left by brushes or any other tool in the paint. The works of Henri Matisse and Eugenie Baizerman are some of the great examples of the style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As an **art**istic movement, Surrealism began flourishing in Europe in the aftermath of World War I. Founded in 1924 by the Parisian poet André Breton, it was highly influenced by Dadaism. It aimed to liberate thought, language, and human experience beyond boundaries of reality and rationalism. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While realist **art** tries to put forward a depiction of actual reality, abstract **art** strives for the exact opposite. Early abstract **art**ists working during the late 19th and early 20th centuries used color, form, shape, and line to create paintings, sculptures, and drawings that purposefully felt independent from identifiable objects, landscapes, and people. Abstraction gave **art**ists a new level of freedom to experiment with **art**istic methods and allowed these **art**ists to reshape the traditional meaning of what “**art**” was. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting on sand can be quite messy and it's a temporary **art**. The sand painting can be captured on video using speed motion, to understand how the **art**ist works on them. It's normally done with minimal light, but has a focus light under the table where the sand painting is being created. Sand painting is created using coloured sands, which is moved around on a fixed surface using hands. It is practised in many countries and is known by several names, in India it's known as kolam or rangoli. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For instance, there is a painting that illustrates a hot air balloon flying high in the clouds. Offhand, you would think the balloon was just flying through the clouds but upon closer examination, you notice the balloon is a p**art** of the clouds. It is two natural objects blending together to become one. You really have to look to find these hidden details in the painting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Surrealist **art**ists painted illogical juxtapositions of images in daunting scenes, creating bizarre and perplexing creatures from everyday objects. The unconscious minds and dreams are greatly valued and favoured in Surrealism. After all, the definition of Surrealism, as Breton once declared in his Surrealist Manifesto, is “dictation of thought in the absence of all control exercised by reason, outside of all aesthetic and moral preoccupation”. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   During Ashoka’s reign and in the succeeding centuries, influenced by increasing contact with Western cultures and **art**istic **styles** that came with both friendly trade and aggressive military incursions by Greeks and Romans, many changes occurred in Indian **art**. A notable example is the Buddhist sculpture of Maitreya from Gandhara (today Pakistan), dating to the third or fourth century CE. (Figure 4.24) Maitreya, de- rived from the Sanskrit word for “friend,” is a bodhisattva —a person who is able to reach nirvana but compassionately chooses to help others out of their human suffering. Maitreya, a successor to the current Buddha, will appear in the future. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Watercolor painting is usually done on the paper. In this p**art**icuar type of painting, one uses water based solutions to mix the colors and hence the name water color painting. Compared to oil painting, watercolor painting is also similarly tough task. Nowadays you have plenty of **art**ists trying out realistic looking portraits using watercolors. The mixing of colors is very crucial in this, since too much of anything, changes the shade of the colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Secondly, abstract images are psychologically powerful. A number of studies have found that abstract **art** can have significant emotional effects on the viewer, perhaps in p**art** because abstraction frees the brain from the dominance of reality. A 2012 study made a direct connection between looking at abstract **art** and feelings of pleasure. With this in mind, savvy designers and brands can use abstract images to manipulate the mood of a viewer, and even increase the likelihood of a product being purchased. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This painting style was birthed in 1860 but it seemed to fade by 1970 as a widespread painting style. Over the decades, people tried to define the painting style but they were really never successful in their endeavors. Finally, the **art** critics came up with a definition which is ambiguous at best. It was defined as the foremost painting style lasting about 110 years. It was a radical style for its time because it took all the creative restrains off the **art**ist. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Artistic and stylistic change is generally a matter of evolution, and often rather reactionary. The **art**istic choices about style (and other matters) made at any p**art**icular point are influenced by what other works of **art** look like at that moment. So the **art**ist will likely try to create an expression that goes further in one direction, or changes directions in some way. Thus, **art** might become more naturalistic, as we have seen, or it might become less so, because the **art**ist thinks the **art** might express the idea better by using a slightly different style or a radically different idea. The divergence is related to current “thinking” within the culture and other more specific circumstances. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In later Greek culture, we can see changes in an expansive political spirit, the influx of foreign cultural forces, the development of drama in theater, increasing materialism, and other factors that change the **art**istic and aesthetic spirit, consequently requiring different modes of **art**istic expression. The Romans, although deeply admiring the classical Greek **art**, held different cultural ideas and ideals, so Roman **art**, unless directly copying the Greek, would express their different views of life and the world. These included especially Roman worldliness, their boundless interest in expansion (which brought in a great variety of additional influences), their great ingenuity and inventiveness in such arenas as engineering and architecture, and their stress on individualism. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Realism as an **art** movement firstly emerged in France in the 1840s circa the infamous 1848 Revolution. It was a direct response to Romanticism, which was dominating Europe in the early 19th century. As an **art** painting style, rather than the scrupulous attention to visual appearances, Realism is defined by the choice and treatment of the subject matter. It is an attempt to visually represent the subject and all its mundane merits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Digital painting is the **art** of creating **art**work on a computer, which makes it resemble a watercolor painting, oil painting or even an acrylic painting. A digitally prepared oil painting and manually done oil painting will have plenty of differences, since you have access to plenty of other textures and instruments which are easily available on the system. Yes, you don't have to worry about paint spills a standing for long hours. You can do the same **art** in a relaxed manner, at the comfort of your homes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Theater is an **art** form where the **art**ist combines both visual **art** and dramatic performance. Over time the definition of theatre has broadened to include performance **art**. Usually, it includes different **art** forms where the **art**ist or **art**ists present or perform their **art** on a stage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paintings are classified by both the subject matter, style, and genre. Painting subjects usually fall into still life, landscape, seascape, portraiture, or abstract. There are many painting **styles**, including modernist, expressionist, classical, surreal, cubist, Chinese style, abstract, impressionist, and many more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many of the world’s most famous architectural works can be easily seen in major cities worldwide. However, renowned modern architects like Frank Llyod Wright and Frank Gehry have also undertaken private residence projects. There could very well be some **art** on your very own street. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Abstract Expressionism itself is a new form of abstract **art** introduced by American painters such as Mark Rothko, Willem de Kooning , and Jackson Pollock post-World War II, while “pure” abstract painting was pioneered by Kazimir Malevich and Piet Mondrian circa 1910-20. Abstract Expressionism, characterised by mark mark-making and the sense of spontaneity, was further divided into two groups: Action painting and colour field painting. Action painting, led by Pollock and De Kooning, involves the impromptu application of vigorous, sweeping strokes of the brush and the impression of spilling paint onto the canvas. Rothko, as well as Barnett Newman and Clyfford Still, led the colour field painting style that is characterised by broad areas of a single or more, flat colour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Expressionism was a progressive **art** movement that originated in Germany and Austria during the early 20th century. The primary concern with Expressionism was the desire to convey experiences and emotion in their raw form, rather than any physical reality, as exemplified by the film sets of Fritz Lang’s Metropolis and Robert Wiene’s The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Shying away from any sense of realism and naturalism, Expressionist works were explosions of color and energy. Here are 12 **art**works you need to know. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After going through a boom in the first half of the 1900’s, expressionism as a concept fractured, and disseminated. The ideas put forth by the first expressionist **art**ists set the stage for a wide range of **art** **styles** that would come later in the era, up to this very day. This is when we stop thinking of expressionism as an era of **art**, but rather as a technique and way of portraying emotions. The values of spirituality, primitivism and abstraction would become themes explored in many different ways in other modernist and contemporary **art** movements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, the use of these unidealized depictions varied from one phase to another throughout ancient Roman history. It is especially noted that in the Early Imperial era (27 BCE-197 CE), with the rise of Augustus to Emperor, the practice of idealization in portraiture was again favored for the imperial likenesses, often seen clearly as p**art** of the political propaganda used to promote the positive perception of the emperor and the promotion of his political goals and programs. The portrayal of the man Augustus, regardless of his age at the time of the creation of a portrait, was made to be the image of a powerful young man, heroic in stature, fit and fine. (Figure 4.20) Ensuing emperors varied their choices in this regard, some opting for a return to the age prior to the Imperial Age and notions of Republican virtue and the value of age and experience, others using the idealizing and propagandistic approach, to some degree. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In many cultures, sculptures were the first and oldest forms of public **art**. Often too big for private homes, sculptures were commissioned by kings or religious and political leaders and displayed in public places – usually as expressions of wealth, power, religion, or politics. Many classical cities of the ancient world, such as Athens, Jerusalem, Istanbul, and Rome, are home to impressive public sculpture collections. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Designers can give layouts a retro flavor by using halftone backgrounds or overlays. Or, try experimenting with a varying halftone design to add texture and interest to a gradient design. Bright, eye-catching colors are a natural p**art**ner for this pop **art**-inspired effect, or opt for monochrome to play up its newspaper heritage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note: Any **art**work used that is not public domain is used under the U.S. fair use laws because this is an educational **art**icle about the painting or image. The images used are low resolution. If you own the copyright and have issues with us using the **art**work, please contact us and it will be removed promptly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Music is an **art** form that is culturally universal and present in all human societies across the world. Music also has strong associations with religion and is a standard p**art** of many religious practices. When sounds produced by vocal cords and various instruments are combined, they can express the beauty of emotion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We have just reviewed some of the most popular painting **styles** you will discover in the **art** world. In one form or another, they all branch off from the abstract painting style. Each style has its own unique abstract element. You need to observe each of these painting **styles** to find that abstract style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **art** painting style is associated p**art**icularly with Henri Matisse as its leading figure. The Fauves believed that colours and physical reality should be detached from one another. They wished to freely incorporate colours regardless of their descriptive qualities as a form of **art**istic freedom. To the Fauves, colours should express the **art**ists’ feelings, hence the experiment to use intense colour, p**art**icularly red, rejecting the soft portrayal of colours in Impressionist **art**works. Concurrently, they redefined the traditional purpose of colour as it became a dominant force in their paintings, in which they also simplify shapes into two-dimensionality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Strictly speaking, Greece and Rome were the classical civilizations of antiquity in the West, and some would even limit the use of the term “classical” in **art** to the High Classical period in Greece. The same principles and conventions of representation, however, include numerous works from other times and places. The revival of characteristics associated with the cultural **styles** associated with ancient Greece and Rome recur repeatedly throughout history in the West, and also appear sometimes in non-Western cultures. Becoming familiar with a few examples will make more apparent the variations of a naturalistic style, whether subtle or quite pronounced, that can be further investigated with regard for the cultural and individual values that are influential at the moment of the work’s creation and use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Theater often incorporates the other seven different forms of **art** in its total package, with music, set design, and literature often used as elements of theater production. Other forms of decorative **art**s such as costume making also contribute to the overall experience. Theater performances have also been hosted in some of history’s most spectacular architectural settings such as Pompei and other famous ancient Greek and Roman amphitheaters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tempera paintings are known as egg tempera **art**. They are fast drying and the paint longs laster than others. Egg yolks are used as a binding medium with paints and since it's highly glutenous, they tend to dry faster. This is one of the oldest known painting techniques. Instead of eggs, sometimes, gum, glycerin, casein are used as a binding agent to the mixture of water and colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ve definitely heard of an **art**work having been described as “expressionist,” but what exactly does that mean? Of the millions of **art** terms liberally tossed around by the “experts,” it is one the most enigmatic. There are so many subcategories of the genre, and it has evolved a great amount since the first **art**ists st**art**ed experimenting with the concept in the early 20th century. Many make the mistake of thinking expressionism as only a movement. On the contrary, it st**art**ed as a movement, but also refers to a certain approach to creating **art**works. We know,we know, this is already st**art**ing to get a bit confusing! In this edition of Art Decoded, we will make the complicated simple, and give you an effective explanation of all things expressionist **art**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since the beginning of civilisation, human and **art** have never p**art**ed ways. Over the millennia, the world has seen a plethora of beautiful **art** movements led by great **art**ists. Now in the 21st century, we can appreciate different **styles** of **art**, painting in p**art**icular, ranging from Western to Eastern style. Here are some of the major **art** painting **styles** throughout history. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Returning to Europe, Romanesque **art** of the eleventh and twelfth centuries is noteworthy with regard to the idea of expressing a prevalent preoccupation among Christians about the ends of their lives and the end of time. For spiritual purposes, they often made a choice for greater abstraction and distortion, rather than the emphasis on a naturalistic depiction of the human form as seen in ancient Greek and Roman **art**. Their forms are not only simplified with suppression of naturalistic features in some ways, but are also twisted and turned in space, while their garments have a lot of linear detail that does not correspond well to the physical forms of the bodies they adorn. The effect is to remove their meaning from a focus on worldly phenomena, redirecting it to a sense of spiritual agitation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although not strictly abstract, surrealist **art** aims to achieve a distorted version of reality by manipulating realist imagery. Artists such as Salvador Dalí, René Magritte, and Frida Kahlo were influenced by psychoanalysis, a growing field of study and practice in the early 20th century. Their paintings and sculptures sought to expand the creative potential of the mind, by juxtaposing images together that appeared irrational and unconventional. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The definition of **art** is diverse, covering many unique forms of expression. However, there are broadly seven forms of **art** that fall into the common collective definition of “the **art**s.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Theater has been a p**art** of culture since the Ancient Greeks in the 6th century BC. Theater has since become one of the most popular sources of entertainment. The broader performing **art**s include theater and dance, music, opera, circus **art**s, musicals, magic or illusion, mime, spoken word, puppetry, and performance **art**. The traditional Greek classifications of theatre: drama, tragedy, and comedy, still apply to many modern productions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Literature is an **art** form that shares stories. It is an **art** form of language and can be read or spoken. The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines literature as “writings whose value lies in the beauty of form or emotional effect.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the most vibrant and diverse scenes for expressionist **art** is in France. Some **art**ists, like Vincent Van Goh and Paul Gauguin were active before the many of the expressionists, but their emotive uses of color and distortion of reality in their subjects make many include them in with the rest. Other France-based **art**ists at the turn of the 20th century, like Henri Matisse, Marc Chagall, Georges Roualt and more impressed with their own signature **styles** that involved expressionism. Their uses of vivid colors, dramatic brushstrokes, and distortion of reality gave the French expressionists a high amount of regard that they still carry to this day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **art**ist would combine many different techniques into the modernism style so you would be unbridled in what to paint on the canvass. This way, you would not be defined by the confines of the traditional painting style. You will notice that the details of the painting will be abstract in nature. For instance, you may find trees blended with squares in such a manner that you do not know where the trees begin or the squares end. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When I first began learning about the history of Western **art**, I remember I wanted to understand one thing above all. I wanted to know the timeline. In other words, the grand story of one-style-followed-by-the next. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Halftone describes the dotted effect created through printing, by breaking images up into a series of dots. The effect was replicated by pop **art**ists such as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. During the 1960s and 1970s these **art**ists often strove to make their **art**works look like newspaper billboard ads. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let’s st**art** by defining exactly what expressionism is, in simplest terms. Regardless of the style of **art**work, expressionist **art** refers when the **art**ist seeks to distort reality in a manner that expresses an innate emotional feeling in an **art**work. This simple definition contrasts with the innumerably complex ways **art**ists can exude their emotions in their pieces. This is why we think of expressionism as having evolved into more of an **art**istic tendency than only a movement. However, the shift towards more and more **art**ists expressing their inner self is a relatively new phenomenon, only taking shape within the last 100 years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Architecture is the **art** form you pass every day without realizing or fully appreciating it as an **art** form. Architecture is the **art** of structures, and we could reasonably date architecture back to the point when man first created shelter. However, the more common perception of architecture as an **art** form relates to just a handful of buildings that are p**art**icularly beautiful or awe-inspiring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nowadays, modern musicians have a plethora of musical instruments at their disposal to create music alongside their voices. Music is defined by genre, with too many genres and **styles** to name. Popular western music genres include everything from classical to gospel, rock, pop, hip-hop, rap, electronic, blues, country, reggae, indie, trap, reggaeton, folk, metal, punk, soul, funk, techno, and many more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Abstract **art** is not an **art** painting style on its own, as it is embodied in multiple **styles** where accurate depiction of visual reality is not the purpose. An abstract **art** can be a total or p**art**ial abstraction. Geometric and lyrical abstraction style are usually total abstraction, which is almost mutually exclusive with figurative **art** style found in Realism, Renaissance, Mannerism, and the Baroque. Nevertheless, figurative **art**, or representational **art**, often incorporate p**art**ial abstraction, as shown in the untitled landscape by Jay Meuser, which reflects the Abstract Expressionism. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Realism is a dep**art**ure from any **art**istic approaches that make the painting look **art**ificial. It uses perspective to create a visual illusion of space and depth in such a way to make the subject appears real. Likewise, subjects in Realist paintings are mostly ordinary folks engaging daily activities in a non-dramatic surrounding. The style could be vividly seen in the works of Gustave Courbet, Honoré Daumier, Jean-François Millet, and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ink Wash Painting is also known as Literati Painting. Chinese black ink is used to create these **art**works. The chinese black ink is quite popular in the asian country since it's mostly used for calligraphy. Various shades of black are created by mixing water to the black ink to create the desired consistency. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With Impressionism, **art**ists worked en plein air, whereby they captured the transient and momentary effects of sunlight by painting outdoors. Impressionists tried to portray overall visual effects rather than details. To achieve an intense colour vibration effect, they used short “choppy” brush works of mixed and pure unblended colours. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Firstly, abstract **art** is incredibly versatile. Because actual objects or people are not featured in abstract imagery, designers can apply these **styles** of images to a wide range of projects. Abstraction places the focus on the visual mood and personality of the image rather than the realist content. So, the designer can give a design a certain look and feel through the manipulation of color, form, and pattern, while retaining a neutrality in the design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting is a form of expressing your **art**istic vision using paint as the primary medium. An **art**ist who worked predominantly in this medium is known as a painter and develops their work by applying different colored paints onto a solid surface, usually a canvas, to produce a work of **art**. Paints are generally oil, acrylic, or watercolor, but you can also paint with pigments, dyes, and inks or incorporate other materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No painting style expresses the deepest cries of the human he**art** as expressionism does. The focus of the expressionist **art**ist was to either express the inner workings of his he**art** or to elicit a deeply moving response from the viewer of the painting. Jackson Pollock had a very unique style of expressionist painting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gouache is an opaque watercolor medium used with other binding agents to create **art**. A white chalk or white color is added to the water color mixture to attain the opacity in the Gouache technique. The gouache cannot be applied directly onto a canvas, since it does not bind well, if you want to use it on canvas, then acrylic pigments have to be mixed. Take care not to dilute the acrylic colors, since the paintings may not have your desired look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paint is usually administered from a spray bottle to achieve the desired results. Mostly spray paints are used on streets(street **art**), graffiti, canvas, wood, metal, glass, ceramic and more. If a large are of canvas requires the same pigment, spray painting technique is used to cover the areas for a faster turnout. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are two **styles** in Chinese painting: Gongbi (工筆) and Xieyi (寫意). Gongbi, meaning “meticulous”, features the use of rich colours and details involving detailed brushstrokes that curtail details very precisely and mostly depicts portraits or narratives. Xieyi, or freehand style, often contains embellished and unreal forms, emphasising the **art**ist’s emotional expression and is mainly used in landscapes painting, which until now is still deemed as the highest form of Chinese painting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is very difficult to pinpoint only one answer when asking what is the most popular form of **art**. The answer is highly subjective and changes all the time. However, the seven forms of **art** that most clearly show us how history and society have changed over time are undoubtedly cinema, paintings, architecture, sculptures, literature, theatre, and music. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although he was not p**art** of the Expressionist movement, the beginnings of Expressionism can be found in the works of Edvard Munch, with The Scream often cited as a prime example. Painting four versions in various media between 1893 and 1910, Munch’s work can be regarded as a blueprint for Expressionist Art. The distorted and disturbed figures, the unrealistic colors and the painting’s swirling energy all add to the work’s sense of anxiety and isolation. Apocalyptic and wild, Munch’s painting signals the st**art** of a European (and perhaps worldwide) shift towards a more evocative and emotive style. Gone were the calming and soft forms of Impressionist works; now was the need to portray our inner primitive selves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No two other **styles** were so intensely scrutinized and contrasted during their time as were Impressionism and Expressionism. Attempts to distil the characteristic traits of the ‘**art** of impressions’ and the ‘**art** of expressions’ led to antithetical juxtapositions. Impressionism, suffused with a uniquely French joie de vivre, was placed in opposition to the existentialist German Expressionism. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cinema has quickly advanced to become the large industry we now know today. The movie industry employs **art**isans in special effects, animation, makeup, costumes, writing, set design, score, acting, directing, and more. Many of these **art**istic professionals fall under the other seven broad categories of **art** listed in this **art**icle. There is a wide range of creative vision and skill that goes into every cinematic production. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Graffiti **art** is mostly done on public buildings with/without permissions. Graffiti is not meant to be understood by the general public, it's a style of writing or drawing/scribbling which has no absolute meaning .The first graffiti **art**ist was a highschool student in 1967, who used to write on walls to get his lady love's attention. Graffiti became a full fledged known painting technique in 1980, were many **art**ists resorted to public walls to showcase their talent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Earlier cultural traditions—of tribes, religions, guilds, royal courts, and states—largely controlled the craft, form, imagery, and subject matter of painting and determined its function, whether ritualistic, devotional, decorative, entertaining, or educational. Painters were employed more as skilled **art**isans than as creative **art**ists. Later the notion of the “fine **art**ist” developed in Asia and Renaissance Europe. Prominent painters were afforded the social status of scholars and courtiers; they signed their work, decided its design and often its subject and imagery, and established a more personal—if not always amicable—relationship with their patrons. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The figures appear static, even when they are shown to be moving through space. They are shown in a composite view , that is, with portions of the body shown in profile and others in frontal view so the **art**ist can provide details that would not be visible in a strict profile. They turn the body in space so that the viewer sees the hips and shoulders, along with a twisted torso, turned slightly towards the viewer. For warriors and leaders, this is a heroic stance, showing power and command. The composite view is completed by giving a frontal view of the eye on the profile of the face and head shown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Art in any form is an expression or application of human creativity, skill, and imagination. Many of the **art**s are experienced visually but can also be audible or enjoyed through sensory touch. Arts were traditionally appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power but are now often used for political expression or social commentary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
