## 54 Tips for How To Decorate A Large Living Room Wall | How To Decorate A Living Room With Cathedral Ceilings
-   An oversized **wall** shouldn’t be thought of in isolation either. It should be the anchor that ties the room decor together. ‘When I see a room with one strong, dominant **wall**,’ agrees Bethan Harwood, Partner & Home Design Stylist at John Lewis & Partners (opens in new tab), ‘I’m itching to change up the other elements to balance it and bring the room together.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘Try textured or metallic paint,' suggests Justyna Korczynska, Crown (opens in new tab) Colour Consultant. 'They add interest by subtly catching the light. If you’ve architectural elements, work with them to create a feature, or think about panelling – the highlights and shadows created add another level to a painted feature **wall**.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No built-ins? No problem! Today I’m sharing my progress in our cozy modern living room. I recently styled our TV **wall** with affordable decor to create a pretty and functional space, without built-ins. While I would love to add shelving to this room someday, right now I am making this large **wall** work! If you have a similar setup, or are just looking for modern coastal design inspiration, I hope you find this post helpful. I’ll be sharing media consoles and budget friendly finds for decorating around your TV. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Instead of classic tongue and groove **wall** panelling ideas, vertical panelling is an excellent choice for large **wall**s as it adds instant depth, warmth and interest. It's easy to install, as it comes in wide sections that you just fix to the **wall** and it provides great acoustic warmth, too. Perfect if you don't want to disturb the neighbours (or don't want them to disturb you). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the left side, I wanted to include something to warm up the corner near our family photo gallery **wall**. I have been loving this bamboo blanket ladder for a while, but was concerned it would be too short. I ended up ordering it anyway, and solved that problem by placing stacked canned goods under the feet of the ladder. Easy fix! I love how the curved top breaks up all of the rectangles in this space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Great Rooms Great rooms are typically located on the first floor of the home and usually combine different living spaces such as living rooms, dining rooms and kitchens with open floor plans. Most have high ceilings in one section, creating at least one or two tall **wall**s and often feature balconies for overhead viewing from upper floors. Here are some great room solutions: Dividing the **wall** with a chair rail and using a two tone paint effect visually shortens the **wall** and makes it seem less imposing. Take the guesswork out of choosing harmonious paint colors by selecting two shades off the same paint chip. Use a darker shade on the bottom to keep the look balanced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Built-in shelving, like in this living space, can create a wonderful living room feature **wall** idea. It does require plenty of space to work well, which is why it's ideal for breaking up a large **wall**. It provides much needed extra space for storage and display, and looks extra effective especially if used to display a collection of house plants. And, as Bethan suggests, is a far easier take on the living **wall**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Smart lighting can help, too. Living room **wall** lights cleverly placed can help split the space up into cosier zones. From hanging a pair of matching **wall** lights above a sofa to an adjustable lamp above an armchair, you can leave the overhead light on and have pooled areas of light to brighten up the space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether it is exposed beams or beautiful **wall** paneling, wood seems to turn even the most sterile of spaces into an inviting, pleasant hub. Adding wooden textures with decor also has a similar effect and can give that little room with a slanted ceiling a relaxed, cozy ambiance. For those looking for more exciting options, **wall**paper, custom murals and even fabric canopies offer creative alternatives. No matter what material you choose to usher in textural contrast, remember that the room with slanted ceilings needs a distinct focal point as much as any other space in your house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Entertainment **wall**s have become an important living room feature, and now provide stiff competition for the traditional feature fireplace. TV lovers want their box in pride of place to achieve the optimum viewing angle, so increasingly the lounge fireplace is being bumped to a side **wall** or corner adornment. This interior reshuffle leaves space to imagine a new living room feature **wall** with the TV at its centre. It also presents extra requirements for storage of receiver and recorder equipment, plus movie media, consoles and games. So how do we achieve a modern vista beautiful enough to take the place of a mantelpiece, and on what do we now display our treasured items? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Already have panelling installed but want to give it a little more...oomph? Try your hard at colour drenching. While painting the entire **wall** and mouldings in one shade might look a little empty on a plain **wall**, it is a perfect match for a panelled **wall** as the shadows cast from the natural light add plenty of decorative beauty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, you might just want to focus on mounting your TV in front of a feature **wall** – **wall**paper, **wall** mural or clever paint effect – that will add interest to your room in a cohesive way. It's a more cost effective option too. In this case, invest in and to hide unsightly wires. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Staircases Some staircase **wall**s can stretch two to three stories high but almost always contain windows to keep the area from feeling dark and cavernous. Here are some solutions for staircases: As with the end **wall**s of vaulted ceilings, asymmetrical picture groupings hung on the diagonal also work well along staircases, making it easy to add to the grouping as you acquire more pictures. Oversized **wall** art is also an option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Clever living room paint ideas are becoming more popular, mainly because we're getting braver with our colour choices but also because they're super easy to achieve. Use architectural features wherever possible - existing arches, dado rails, picture rails - they can all be taken advantage of and painted in a contrasting shade to adjacent **wall**s. Don't have any rails or panelling? Try creating a visual version with a super neat horizontal line across your living room **wall** using FrogTape painting tape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Slanted ceilings are often difficult to work with, and most of us are flummoxed on how to **decorate** a room with sloped **wall**s. And no longer is this design conundrum relegated to attic rooms alone. Considering how every inch of space is invaluable, there are many modern homes and penthouses where the residents have to put up with slanted ceilings on a daily basis. But decorating a room with a slanted ceiling can be as much fun (if not more) as planning for a home with a ‘plain old ceiling’. The essential difference, though, is in the way you treat the ceiling and how you use the special contours of the room to your advantage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do not worry about filling a room that has a slanted ceiling with too many cabinets and shelves. But compensate for the lack of **wall**-mounted storage by filling the periphery of the room with smart bookshelves and cool storage units. This not only creates the perception of a ‘room within a room’, but also cuts down on the steep angle of the slanted **wall**s and makes the room far more appealing. The snug reading and relaxing window nook is another perennial favorite in rooms with a sloped ceiling (even if it is not the attic), and this classic never fails to impress. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Consider backlighting your driftwood for extra drama. The gnarled beauty of this piece casts shadows on the **wall**s because of the lights. Gorgeous. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use the full height of the room for curtains and avoid any patterns with horizontal stripes – horizontals again. Go for a long curtain pole and pull the curtains pulled right back to allow as much light into the space as possible. Try a tall bookcase or use art on the **wall**s to draw the eye upwards. A ‘gallery **wall**’ of smaller pictures will help to create height, rather than one larger piece in the centre of a long **wall**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When we talk about TV **wall** ideas, an obvious choice is a media **wall**, which instead of a TV stand enables homeowners to mount their flatscreen television onto the **wall** to display other media, which could include speakers, gaming consoles, record players etc. Typically nowadays, a media **wall** is fitted above a pre-existing fireplace or with a new inset fireplace. Seek professional advice on installation, stud **wall**s and electrics. Generally, media **wall**s provide good storage too. It's perfect for small living rooms, it helps to streamline and organise an area, and it's an ideal way to maximise on vertical **wall** space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Driftwood provides gorgeous colors and interesting shapes for a large living room **wall**. Here, three long pieces of driftwood hang in a pleasing arrangement in this coastal home. Each piece of driftwood is approximately 7' long. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A mirrored side table or console table will work just as well. Use round or oval furniture to soften edges, round light fixtures or a large round mirror on one of the longer **wall**s will increase the feeling of light. When choosing your furniture, try to pick items which have visible legs which raises the bulk of the furniture off the floor. The theory is that the more of the floor space the eye sees, the more space it perceives. An added bonus being that it’s easier to vacuum under! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A living room, more than any other space in a home, needs to feel warm and inviting. A space to relax and unwind, yet smart enough to entertain and socialise in. Start by researching the best living room **wall** decor ideas can help you discover the ideal decor solution for your space and then adapt any of the following ideas to suit your style, needs and space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a small room with low, slanted ceilings, going low with decor makes complete sense. Decorating a space with low ceilings, even if they are not slanted, presents a whole different set of challenges that can often be solved with this simple approach, along with even lighting. But for a giant loft with a slanted roof and a double-height ceiling, using decor that is a touch taller than usual is a trendy and smart choice. Oversized pendants and floor lights are quickly becoming a popular way to **decorate** such homes. Also, think of adding an extensive mezzanine level that allows you to tap into all that vertical space under the slanted roof. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Darker colors on **wall**s make the room seem smaller. In a vast room you can use warm, deeper tones of a color you love but would hesitate to try in a small space. Painting the ceiling a rich, deep tone will visually bring it lower. Wide and intricate moldings also draw down the eye from a high ceiling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As a general rule, light colours make a room feel spacious by reflecting light. Darker colours tend to feel as though they are closer (and cosier), it’s all to do with how your brain perceives colour. The short explanation is that we can use colour to trick the brain into seeing a space as bigger than it is. By painting the longer **wall**s in the room a slightly darker shade than the two shorter **wall**s, it will make the room feel wider or more square. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cove and Barrel Ceilings Cove and barrel ceilings have curved, concave surfaces, giving the room a very fluid feel. These types of ceilings can create taller than average end **wall**s. Here are some solutions for these ceilings: Add texture to a tall end **wall** with brick or stone veneer panels. Add faux texture with decorative painting techniques such as sponging or color washing, using warm earth tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a large **wall** in your living room that’s needing... well, a bit of love, you’ve come to the right place. Having a big empty **wall** is much like a blank canvas. Unless you have a clear idea on the look you’re planning to create, knowing how to break up a large **wall** in a living room can almost be harder to achieve than decorating in a far smaller space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take paint for instance. Painting a large **wall** in a living room in all one colour doesn’t do much to make the space look less huge, but using a variety of living room paint ideas in different ways can trick the eye into thinking it’s smaller than it is. The same goes for **wall**paper – one repetitive print on a large space can feel a little never ending. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No room is complete without a **wall** decoration or two, and when it comes to the living room, there are so many different options to choose from. If you're having trouble deciding the direction in which you'd like to go when it comes to living room **wall** decor, we're here to help. Read on to gather ideas from 30 inspiring living rooms that will suit every style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to the color scheme, it is best to stick to a simple and neutral color palette that is not too harsh on your eyes. But think of the size of the room and the scale of the slanted ceilings before making this call. Contrary to popular perception, a two-tone color scheme with a painted ceiling looks cool in small attics with slanted **wall**s. You can even induce some visual brilliance by painting the rest of the room in cool white and using a single black **wall** as an accent addition. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What is the best way to **decorate** a large **wall** in the living room? If you're fortunate enough to have a big space, it expands your options of what you can do. However, it might be a daunting prospect. We've dug around the Internet and come up with some fantastic ideas for showcasing a large living room **wall**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'What about a living **wall**?' asks Bethan Harwood from John Lewis. 'I love them in open-plan spaces that lead out to a balcony or garden. You can also work one into a shelving unit, which is slightly easier to upkeep. I’d keep the pots and background monochrome so the plants can be the feature.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Room Scenarios for Tall Walls Different types of ceilings create **wall**s that are taller than the average eight or nine foot **wall**s typical of a conventional ceiling. Walls along staircases and in great rooms can also be considerably taller than average **wall**s.

-   Cathedral Ceilings Cathedral ceilings have two equally sloping sides that come to a point in the middle of the room, creating the shape of an upside down V. While the side **wall**s are often a standard 8 feet tall, the end **wall**s can be 15 feet or more at the highest point, depending on the height of the ceiling. Here are some solutions for cathedral ceilings: Warm colors, dark colors and rich earth tones create a cozy, comfortable atmosphere in a room. Warm hues make **wall**s appear to advance or come closer visually. Paint one or both end **wall**s a deeper color than the side **wall**s such as deep crimson, burnt orange, chocolate brown, charcoal gray or yellow ocher for a dramatic effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have an open concept home with a large TV **wall** like ours, you probably share my priority of storage. We solved this problem a little over a year ago with our budget friendly media console! Previously we had a smaller cabinet and it looked so tiny against this **wall**. One of the most important things I have learned about interior design is the importance of scale, and generally: go big! If you are looking for a wide media console with lots of storage like ours, check out all of the details here. If you are shopping for a smaller space or prefer a different look, here are a few finds: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mirrors are a gorgeous way to reflect the room around you. This decadent, luxurious living room in sultry greys, silvers, and black utilizes a large-scale mirror above the mantel as decor. Matching trim on the **wall** repeats the mirror's pattern as a design element. This creates comfort in such a large room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We hope these ideas have given you food for thought. Whether you want to buy something off the shelf, or cast about for something uniquely you, decorating a large **wall** is lucky. There are fun options. Decide on the style or vibe you want, then pick the right choice for that, and your budget. But most of all, have fun on the journey. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vaulted Ceilings Vaulted ceilings are asymmetrical, with one **wall** in a room being much higher than the opposing **wall**. The end **wall**s are also asymmetrical, being standard height on one end and several feet taller on the other. Here are some solutions for vaulted ceilings: Hang a large painting, tapestry or mirror with a vertical orientation on the tall **wall**. Draw the eye upward by hanging vertical groupings of **wall** art, going above the standard eye level area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘An interior designer can draw out the sizing on a piece of paper to ensure the proportions of the proposed TV work in the space. If you are not working with an interior designer, it can be helpful to make a template in the dimensions and pin it up on the **wall** in order to visualise the proportions.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When decorating a a large **wall**, living room **wall**paper ideas are an easy first port of call. And because you have a lot of space to cover, you can afford to have more fun with the pattern than you would in a smaller space. Lisa Honiball, owner Honey Interior Design (opens in new tab) agrees. ‘Of course, there’s **wall**paper,' she says, 'but don’t use a large feature **wall** as an excuse to chicken out of a scheme or **decorate** half-heartedly. Maximalists should still be embracing their love of colour and pattern and taking a fabulous **wall**paper around all four **wall**s!' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Large scale metal farm equipment and cast-off vintage items can make incredible **wall** decor. Thinking outside the box to fill your large **wall**s leads to surprising design decisions. In this piece, a rustic windmill, cut in half, creates a unique **wall** piece. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Slanted ceilings often create interesting angular features and slanting additions that can be highlighted using bright colors and simple stripes. Just remember that white is not your only choice here and a tone-on-tone approach to **wall** color is equally pleasing. Just make sure, though, that you do not use too many colors in the same space, as this could lead to visual fragmentation and clutter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another option when considering design ideas for a large living room **wall** is an accent **wall**. Wallpaper is back in style, so why not highlight your favorite colors by adding a pop of pattern to one **wall**. Here a geometric pattern in grey and white matches the throw pillows on the sofa. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another sofa opposite with a rug in between will offer a cosy solution to squaring off the room. Fireplace or window in the centre of one of the longer **wall**s? Use the centre space in the same way with space at either end of the room, this will create a focal point and a functional space. If you have to place your sofa along the longer **wall** then choose a fabric a similar colour to the **wall** – that old eye-trickery thing again. Lighting can also be used effectively in the zoning of a space. The low light of a few smaller lamps will emphasise the zoning of that area and will add interest and balance to the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the first things you need to do to **decorate** a room with a slanted ceiling is accept the overall ambiance it already has and then accentuate it with design. Slanted ceilings vary from small attic rooms that are short on space to amazing vaulted ceilings that house the entire living area of your loft. The idea is to play off of the already existing proportions instead of trying too hard to introduce a different style that is alien to the room. Dramatic in their appearance, slanted ceilings present the perfect opportunity to turn the ceiling into the showstopper of the room! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Over Furniture When hanging art over furniture, use the length of the furniture to determine the proper proportion. The length of the framed art should be approximately 2/3 the length of the furniture. If your sofa is 6 feet long, a painting hung above it should be approximately 4 feet long. The bottom edge of the frame should be about 6 to 12 inches above the sofa. If other objects or architectural features occupy some of the **wall** space, measure only the blank area that will contain the art. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do not be afraid to explore varied and exotic themes (such as Moroccan or Mediterranean) for the room with sloped **wall**s. When done right, spaces with slanted ceilings can be playful, elegant and impressive while bringing forward a distinct flavor of their own. All you need to do is unlock this hidden potential! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When buying your furniture, think about how you’re going to place it first. A functional space needs to have a walkway through it but the last thing you want to do is create a ‘corridor effect’. Avoid pushing all of the furniture against the longer **wall**s or all on one side of the room. Organise your room into zones using the furniture. For example, create a cosy sofa area at one end of the room by placing a sofa across the width of the room as a divide with a console table or low shelves behind it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'Recessing a television within built-in cabinetry always makes for a more considered look,' suggests Natalie Murray-Hurst, Interior Designer at Murray Hurst interiors. 'Incorporating your TV within a unit allows the technology to blend into the room scheme, so that the TV is not the central focus of the room. If, however, you prefer the simplicity of a TV mounted onto a plain **wall**, ensure cables are chased into the **wall**.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this white living room scheme, 'the monochrome Chinoiserie-style TV stand balances out the plain black TV screen and white **wall** finishes,' says Andrew. 'These are then echoed around the room in the geometric rug, sofa and throw.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Quilts are another interesting idea for a **wall** feature. This selection of mini-quilts goes up a stairway but could easily be on the **wall** of a large living room. If you inherited quilts from a grandparent or love to quilt yourself, this is a great way to display your beautiful pieces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paint the skirting and any radiators the same colour as the **wall**s. You’re aiming for as little distraction for the eye as possible because you want to pull the viewer into the room using the zoning of the furniture. White skirting also acts as a horizontal line which has the effect of making an already long **wall** look even longer! I know it goes against everything your dad ever taught you about decorating but believe me it works! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘I love the combination of rose gold fixtures in the pendant lighting and spot lights, the tactile leather sofas and the moody blue paint colour used in this room. While the **wall**s are dark, the look is kept bright and positive with use of a light oak floorboards throughout.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘To mount your screen into a recess in the **wall**, you’ll need the right bracket. You must make sure you aren’t putting into an exterior or load bearing **wall** either, so it’s best to call upon the help of a professional first. Try CEDIA - the global association for the home technology industry - to find a home tech specialist in your area.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
