## 23 Tips for Decorating A Living Room With A Gray Couch | Grey Sofa Living Room Ideas Pinterest
-   One of our favourite aesthetics with a grey **couch** is an ultra-modern approach. Select furniture pieces with sharp edges and sleek frames, and lean on colours like black and white, as well as accents of silver and/or gold. Marble will be your best friend, as will glass. Try this style out in your home with pieces like the Pentagon Coffee Table and the Hertz Entertainment Unit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For the last few years, gray has gained the spotlight as the neutral of choice, with gray sofas enjoying particular popularity among designers and homeowners alike. However, setting on a lovely gray **couch**, some people struggle with choosing complementary and accent colors. So how do you keep the room from feeling flat while maintaining a coordinated look? Here are 30 excellent color scheme ideas that will help you style your gray **couch** living room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   17. Accent Chairs and Gold Color Decor. When accessorizing your gray **couch**, your natural inclination is probably to reach for silver or black finishes, but don’t count gold out. Gold accents such as picture frames, a lamp, or even your coffee table help warm up the space and create a cozy atmosphere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   9. Warm and Woodsy Tones. Wood tones are the way to go if you love the soft look of a light gray sofa but are also striving for a warm, homey feel in your living room. Wooden end tables and accents are an outstanding balance to the cooler gray of your **couch**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. Statement Oriental Area Rug. Rugs tie your living room together and help define the space. Your gray **couch** is just the right shade of neutral to compliment that bold area rug you’ve had your eye on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Worried grey alone might seem a bit dull? Then choose your accessories carefully. A blue sofa, yellow chair and tomato red lamp really sing out against a mid-grey backdrop. Pull everything together with a rug that features all the different shades that you are using, and voilà – **decorating** perfection! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your style borders between modern and boho, this is the perfect coffee table for you. This table comes in two colors: natural wood and black. The black works perfectly with gray **couch**es, especially if you have multiple pieces of gray furniture in your room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'Due to its incredibly versatile nature as a color, we love to think of a gray sofa as a blank canvas for the rest of the room. It can act as a fantastic neutral base with so much **decorating** potential; however, you must pay attention to the chosen shade,' says Rosie Ward, a designer at Ward & Co. (opens in new tab) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   20. White Walls and Dark Gray Sofa. This living room is a fantastic example of how to use a large sectional to create a moody, dramatic space, without it feeling stuffy. The white walls and Oriental rug help balance the imposing figure of the gray **couch**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1. Natural Wood. Painted furniture is on the way out, and natural wood is back. Choose accent tables that show off the wood’s grain for a beautiful contrast against your gray **couch**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use soft warm greys and mix them with pastel **decorating** ideas for a pretty grey living room. Prevent it from feeling too sweet and sugary by accenting with darker, moodier shades seen here with black and white cushions and dark wood table. The result is a calm living room suitable for the whole family. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grey **couch**es work well with minimal decor. So if you like that style, keep the surrounding furniture and accessories very simple. One way to do this is with a sleek table lamp like pictured above. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   27. Mixed and Matched Patterns. The right patterns can be used to build the illusion of having many textures, which creates interest in your space. Here, the patterns on the rug, pillows and wall art play to the softness of the velvet **couch** and add interest to the white living room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   10. Modern Monochrome Design. This living room is a dream with pure white walls allowing gray to take center stage. Instead of being the base, the different shades of gray, from the light gray **couch** to the darker pillows and rug, play the first fiddle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Allow the colour of natural stone to inspire your grey colour choices. Use your paint samples on a piece of card to hold against the original walls to determine the perfect pairing to complement the natural warmth on the walls. Offset the light grey **decorating** with darker accents on the furniture to add depth, as shown in this rustic living room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   23. Floral Rug. Gray **couch**es with rolled arms always seem comfortable but also regal with their soft lines and nail head accents. A floral rug does a great job supporting these rounded lines. The homeowner also used a traditional coffee table and light throw pillows to make the **couch**es seem cozier and less formal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   16. Dark Gray Living Room Wall. Gray is often a go-to color in light, neutral color schemes. However, it is just as valuable for more dramatic moody spaces. Here, the darker tones of the gray **couch** and walls set the mood while the plants and animal print throw pillows add a pop of color and life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   29. Beige Gray Living Room with Removable Color Accents. The same beige gray tone repeats throughout this space – in a **couch**, rug, and curtains – to keep the styling serene and cohesive. Now, it’s so easy to change the accent color with the help of a table centerpiece that can be further supported by a throw blanket and pillows. The accent yellow and deep orange set a distinct Thanksgiving mood here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a subtle, understated vibe, keep the rest of your living room neutral. White or light grey walls, brown wood floors, and cream throw pillows will all pair nicely with your grey **couch** and keep the space light and airy. Darker neutrals create a modern, sophisticated twist on that effect. Want a more vibrant aesthetic? Use your grey sofa to anchor brighter colors and funkier design elements. If a boho interior feels too chaotic for you — with its emphasis on maximalism and texture — opting for a grey sectional sofa instead of a velvety aquamarine chaise lounge might be just the thing to tone it down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   28. White Curtains and Plaid Pillows. This living space is a great example of mixing decor styles seamlessly. The matching light gray colors of the **couch** and the walls and clean contemporary lines create a perfect backdrop for the rustic accent pieces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our top choice for making your grey sofa feel at home in the living room is adding a textured, cosy rug underfoot. Select a neutral-toned rug that appears white or cream, but has lots of variation in its weave and includes some grey threads – this will help to tie your sofa selection into the space with ease. The pick of the moment is the gorgeous Jericho Fawn Ivory Plush Rug, the perfect complement to any grey **couch**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   30. White, Black and Pastel Pink. Space doesn’t need to be huge to feel luxurious. The large gray **couch**, the texture of the pillows, and the clean lines of the decor make this small living room feel sumptuous and full of character. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a gray **couch**, consider getting an ottoman in a medium shade of gray like this one. This ottoman from Arhaus is fairly large at 38”. So it would work well with sectionals or larger sofas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
