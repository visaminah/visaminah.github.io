-   "Allotment keepers have been planting marigolds next to vegetables for generations – and for good reason," Evie says. "Marigolds will repel nearly every small pest known, including spiders, snails and bugs. By placing fragrant **plants** throughout your home and investing in a cruelty-free spider catcher, your home will be pleasantly spider free this autumn." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "There's many old-wives' tales about how conkers can repel spiders – but many don't know that a lot of fragrant house**plants** can do just that," Evie Lane, Gardening Expert at , says. "Most spider-deterring **plants** have a strong odour since aromatic **plants** are generally more effective at repelling insects – but they still smell great in your home too." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The marigold is one of the most well-known insect-repelling **plants** and with good reason — they have a scent that will keep pests like mosquitoes, nematodes like cabbage worms, and other pests away. Plant marigolds to attract beneficial insects that attack and kill aphids. Ladybugs are especially fond of aphids. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mosquito Plant (citrosa geraniums or Pelargonium citrosum) is an attractive tropical plant with lacy green foliage and beautiful flowers and a member of the geranium family. It is prized for its citrus aroma that comes from the oils in the foliage. They’re certainly beautiful **plants** to grow in the backyard, but if you’re planting them because of the promise of fewer bugs flying around your yard, you’ll have to crush the leaves to obtain any bug-repelling properties. Unfortunately, the effects are not very long-lasting—only for about 30 minutes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use these flowers as a border planting around your home to keep out bedbugs, fleas, lice, roaches, ants, and more. These **plants** contain naturally-occurring pyrethrin, an insecticide. They repel ticks, spider mites, Japanese beetles, and other garden pests. Try making this DIY pest spray! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This bushy perennial, famous for its lemon-scented leaves and pale purple flowers in summer, is a member of the mint family. If you're struggling with spiders during the autumn season, consider placing a potted lemon balm on a sunny window sill (they need around six hours of sunlight each day). Easy to grow from seeds, they are excellent at driving away common insects, such as fruit **flies** and spiders. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Basil is great at repelling spiders, as well as other bugs such as ants, house**flies** and mosquitoes. It might be a popular culinary herb, but its fragrant scent will keep the creepy crawlies at bay. Simply get your hands on a few basil pots and place them around entry points in the home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Known for being an effective bug repellent, citronella **plants** can grow happily in many types of different soil. If you want to keep these sweet-smelling **plants** indoors, make sure you give them as much sunlight as possible to keep them bushy and more sturdy. Much like lavender, it's a good idea to give these **plants** artificial light during the dark winter months. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
