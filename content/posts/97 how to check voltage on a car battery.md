## 97 Shocking Facts About How To Check Voltage On A Car Battery | Multimeter 9V Battery Test
-   A car **battery** is the most important part of the car. Because of Batteries car gets the power to run and helps the car start when you start the vehicle with the key or self-start. All the electric features work because of this **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Charge may also be lost in the circuit through bad **battery** connections. As car batteries are low **voltage**, the connection needs to be that much better. As is the case with many cars, over time connections are prone to becoming loose, dirty and open to corrosion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another thing to remember with newer cars is that if an electrical source causes the power to be drained from the **battery**, this is called “parasitic loss.” This can happen when your engine and all the vehicle’s lights are turned off too. Why? Because there are certain electronic systems and features in your car which are still consuming power after your car is turned off, such as the clock and computer. These things won’t normally drain too much power from your **battery** but if you suspect they are, then either remove the **battery** completely or simply disconnect it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A. Assuming there is nothing wrong with the **battery**, it should start. However, during a time when a **battery** is not used, there are all sorts of issues that could arise, including corrosion that could damage the **battery** and cause it to short. If you have a bad **battery**, you wont be able to jump it, but if it’s just low on charge, it should work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’ll be a quick **voltage** drop as the engine is cranking, and then it will rise again. The **voltage** drop shouldn’t go under 9.6V. If it does, it means the **battery** doesn’t have enough turnover strength, and you’ll likely need a new **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can check for **voltage** drop between the **battery** terminals and cables by first testing on the terminal and then on the wire crimps going out. Anything over around 0.1V less than what is coming out of the terminals suggests high resistance/bad connection. Clean the terminals/connections with sandpaper and tighten them up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The current supply of a regular car should be 12.6 volts. Always test/check your car **battery** if your vehicle does not start for at least 2 to 3 days to know the **voltage** rate in the rest position. It is called the resting **voltage**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your car uses a 12-volt **battery**, and a multimeter should read between 12.5 and 12.8 for a healthy **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you suspect your **battery** is failing, stop by your local Advance Auto Parts. Advance offers quick curbside testing without you needing to leave your vehicle. If you need a new **battery**, a knowledgeable Team Member will help you select the right one for your vehicle and install it for you while you wait*. Advance will even recycle your old **battery** for you. Learn more about free services here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, you will need to connect the positive lead of the multimeter to the positive terminal of the **battery**. Next, you will need to connect the negative lead of the multimeter to the negative terminal of the **battery**. Finally, you will need to turn on the multimeter and set it to the amperage setting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What is special about this mode? The most important thing is that absolutely no load is placed on the **battery**. After all, when the **battery** is connected to the on-board network, the latter consumes a small current necessary for the operation of some devices in standby mode. In addition, there may be a large leakage current in the machine, which is also a load. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As for the display meters that are inserted into the cigarette lighter socket, they cannot be calibrated without barbaric intervention in the design. Accordingly, they show, as a rule, an underestimated **voltage**. Its fall occurs because there are wires on the way from the **battery** to the cigarette lighter socket. This drawdown can be compensated only with a calibration screw. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Partially it should already be clear how this mode affects the **voltage** of the car's **battery**. Therefore, if your goal is to assess the state of charge of the **battery** connected to the on-board network, make allowance for the leakage current and devices operating in standby mode. To do this, you must first measure this correction by comparing the **voltage** before and after removing the terminal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **battery** test can be carried out at home with the use of a multimeter. A multimeter is an electronic instrument that measures **voltage**, current and resistance. To get an accurate picture of the health of your **battery** it is advised that it is tested when cold, preferably in the morning after the car has been left overnight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are different types of automotive **battery** chargers, from basic 2A trickle chargers to more expensive 10A general purpose devices. So-called smart chargers adjust their **voltage** output depending on the status of the **battery** and can charge faster and more efficiently. There is also less chance of overcharging and they can detect whether the batter is 6V or 12V, as well as the type (such as wet or gel cell) and adjust the output accordingly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Select the DC volts position on your multimeter (or the 12V setting if you have a dedicated car **battery** test range). DC **voltage** is usually marked as a V followed by a short line with a dotted line beneath it. The wavy line after a V is AC (alternating current) **voltage** and is for checking the mains **voltage** in your house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To charge the **battery** of a car’s engine, you need to generate about 1000 RPM. At high speed, car engines affect more RPM, so the vehicle’s **battery** recharges faster than at a low rate. Most vehicles need 30 to 40 minutes to recharge the car’s **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Plates are flooded in sulphuric acid, which reacts as a catalyst and makes chemical reactions between them. Because of this reaction, electrons produce and generate electricity. This electricity, after the response, flows from the **battery** to the electric components of the car to the car engines. This engine cycle recharges your engines as you run your car’s engine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tip: if you are a beginner looking how to use a multimeter to test a car **battery** to ascertain its **voltage**, consider getting one that has a dedicated **battery** tester range on it. The INNOVA 3320 is good for this. Other popular automotive multimeters include the INNOVA 3340 and the top of the line Fluke 88V. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The standard **battery** that is used in vehicles is about 12 volts. Voltage has an important role in the performance of the car **battery**. The life span of the car **battery** is typically about three to 6 years. The driving habits and their exposure affects the life of the storm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   CAUTION: car batteries should never be overcharged. Once they reach full charge, it is time to unplug the charger. This is where smart units are advantageous, preventing damage and thus extra cost. Also, avoid running a known bad **battery** as you could end up ruining the alternator. They are built to maintain charge as opposed to keeping dead ones alive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, you’ll have to need to be able to identify the signs that your **battery** is in bad shape. Then you’ll have to test it. Below, I outline the signals that your **battery** might be bad. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   4. Finally, read the number that appears on the multimeter display. This is the **voltage** of your **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It can be difficult sometimes to pinpoint the nature of an electrical problem in your car. The first step is to test a car **battery**. Most importantly, this is the best way to figure out if it is the problem or whether you should be focusing perhaps on the alternator. If you’re not comfortable you can go to a mechanic to get this job done. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Testing a car **battery** is a valuable skill that one save their time and money. You can test it with or without the use of a multimeter- A simple **battery** tester that measures the Volts, Amps and resistance from an electrical source. It simply tests the strength of the car **battery**. Here are few steps on how to measure a car **battery**’s life with or without a multimeter: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   5. If your **battery** is 12 volts or higher, it is considered healthy. If it is below 12 volts, it may need to be replaced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In simple language, the **battery** is the heart of the car, which provides energy to run the vehicle or its electric components. All the electricity to the car is supplied from the **battery**, so we can say that the **battery** is the power station of the car. The **battery** is the cubical box set at one corner of the engine. That cubical box holds the chemical mixture, which is then converted into electricity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once correctly connected, the **voltage** of a rested **battery** should be above 12.6V. A **battery** that is only 50% charged would display a reading of 12.2V and a reading below 12V is discharged. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Anything under the 75% charge rate, or about 12.45V, generally indicates the **battery** is undercharged and will need recharging. It does not, however, indicate that it is bad. If after recharging it doesn’t hold the charge, then it is probably on its way out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Voltage has an important role in the performance of the **battery**. A Car **battery** converts the chemical energy into electric energy and provides power or energy to start the car. That’s why an in-car **battery** is the most critical device, or we can say that batteries are the heart of a vehicle that supplies power to every electric component. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The multimeter will highlight your car **battery**’s **voltage** as being between 12.5V to 12.6V, the outside temperature and the type of **battery** will affect the **battery** **voltage**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it is clear you need a new **battery**, then luckily there are many places you can pick up a new one. As with most parts of a car, a new **battery** for your vehicle comes with a range of prices and **battery** brands. You can pick up a brand new **battery** for anywhere between $50 and $150. There are also some premium batteries that may cost you as much as $300 or more. This is not necessarily something you need for your car and certainly not standard or required by any means. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fifth - whether the **battery** is charging correctly from the charger. The vast majority of memory devices are not equipped with voltmeters. But the **voltage** is a very important parameter of the charge. You can read more about this in the article about why the **battery** boils. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A car **battery** doesn’t just go bad completely. There will likely be one or more **battery** cells which are bad in it. You will know if this is the case when you start your car because it will take more time to crank up the engine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most meters today are auto ranging, meaning after setting it to DC **voltage**, you won’t need to do anything else. The other, older type is a manual ranging multimeter, where you need to select the correct range regards the projected value of the circuit you are going to test. Most of the manual ranging meters have a 20V range, which is what you need to test a car **battery**. The 20V range means it will measure between 0V and 20V. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turn the headlights on for five to 10 minutes without turning the car on. Turn the car on. If you notice your lights significantly dim down when the car is turned on, your **battery** doesn’t have the right charge and might be on the way out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Checking the **battery** of a car with a multimeter. Connect the multimeter leads to the car **battery** terminals. Sequentially perform the following steps to check the car **battery** **voltage** when the car is off: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you test your car **battery** with a gauge, a good reading would be around 12.6 volts. The best way to get an accurate reading is to leave your car **battery** off for over an hour, or just test it in the morning after it’s been idle all-night long. Then you will get what is known as the “resting **voltage**,” which will truly tell you whether your **battery** is still good or not. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Load test: a load is applied to the **battery** while its **voltage** is monitored. You can do this by starting the engine and monitoring the **voltage** with a multimeter that has a Min/Max mode. This will automatically store the high and low **voltage**s it picks up. The high **voltage** will likely be in the 14V area and is perfectly normal, while a drop under 9.6V during the process would indicate it can no longer effectively hold charge and needs changing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have less than 13.8 volts or higher than 14.4 volts, then your alternator is undercharging or overcharging. Either one of these situations could mean that your **battery** life is running short and that you need to investigate the problem further. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The resting **voltage** (when the engine is off) measures around 12.6 volts. Car batteries typically provide these 12.6 volts through six cells, each supplying around 2.1V. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you go to test the alternator with the multimeter, you will do it the same way as you did the **battery** test. Be sure to keep your engine running this time as you do the test. Your alternator will be good if you get a reading of at least 13.8 volts, but preferably up to 14.4 volts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **battery** is commonly located under the bonnet, to the side of the engine. To test the **battery**, you need to ensure you have access to the two terminals on the top. Some batteries have a plastic covering which can be lifted off to expose the (+) positive terminal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The coldest days of winter are one of your car **battery**’s worst enemies. In general, extreme temperatures of any kind are not good for batteries. One of the worst winter weather experiences for vehicle owners is when you head out to commute to work or run an errand and your car won’t start. Is it because of a dead **battery**? There is a way to test a car **battery** and access if it is having problems before this happens. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of the manual ranging meters have a 20V range, which is what you would need to test a car **battery**. The 20V range means it will measure between 0V and 20V. See below: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The multimeter will then display the current amperage of the **battery**. If the **battery** is able to provide enough power to start your vehicle, the amperage should be around 12 volts. If the amperage is lower than 12 volts, it may not be able to provide enough power to start your vehicle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now it’s worthwhile to figure out in what modes the car **battery** works, and what **voltage** it can give out. It's the most important. Many miss the moment, misleading themselves and others. To understand what we are talking about, we list the main 7 modes of **battery** operation: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note: If you’re curious as to whether 8 x 1.5V AA batteries are the same as the 12 volts in a car **battery**, the answer is no. AA batteries have too much internal resistance to kick-start a car. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   4. Check Engine light is on: In some cars, the Check Engine light will come on if the **battery** **voltage** is low. So if you see this light illuminated on your dash, it's a good idea to get your **battery** checked out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the **voltage** of the car is lower than 11.8 V, it is challenging to start the car engine, and when the **voltage** is lower than 10.8 V, it is impossible to start the car’s engine and consider that your **battery** is dead and needs replacement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Other than trying to start the engine to see if there’s charge, the best way to decipher a car **battery**’s status is to test it using a multimeter. Digital multimeters are the best option for this since they give a more accurate reading, although you could also use an analog one. And even a cheap, category I (CAT-I) multimeter is fine as you are merely testing **voltage**, not amperage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the left is a **battery** load tester. On the right is an old-school analog multimeter., Amazon / Depositphotos - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you identify the corrosion you need to clean that off with a **battery** cleaning solution such as sandpaper, baking soda and water etc. while you are checking the **battery** then double-check the **battery** cable are correctly fastened. If the whole **battery** is corroded, then it is better to replace the car **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the **battery** **voltage** is below 12.2V, it needs to be recharged. Try driving your vehicle for at least 15 minutes to bring the low **voltage** back up. Alternatively, you can buy car **battery** chargers to charge the **battery** back to its minimum **voltage**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The third is whether the **battery** is charging normally from the generator. In order for the **battery** to fully recover during the ride, two things are needed - a **voltage** in the region of 14.4 V, as well as a sufficient amount of time. If the **voltage** is less than the specified, then we can drive a car for at least a day and a half, but the **battery** will never fully recover. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Accordingly, if you have just turned off the engine, let the **battery** sit at least overnight. Then measure and evaluate. The same if you recharged the **battery** from a stationary charger. How well you charged it, evaluate the **voltage** the next day. It's pointless to measure before. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you find that your **battery** is below 12.2V this means the **battery** is in a state of discharge and a replacement will soon be required. Here at National we have a range of Napa batteries suitable for all types of vehicles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After charging, perform the same test as above to see if the **battery** now registers in the 12.6V range. If not, consider getting it checked out fully prior to a replacement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The second thing that the **voltage** at the **battery** terminals can “tell” about is whether the engine start system is working normally. That is, the starter. For example, if the **voltage** during its operation sags heavily or disappears altogether, then there are problems. Most likely, the starter "takes over". A slight **voltage** drop, on the contrary, indicates the health of the starting system, as well as the good condition of the **battery** itself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Few things can ruin an adventurous road trip as quickly as a dead **battery** in a small town in the middle of nowhere -- and with no mechanic. A car’s **battery** is essential to giving the starter motor the energy required to turn the flywheel until the engine reaches self-sustaining combustion. A few minutes of pre-departure preparation can determine if your **battery** is healthy enough to make the trip. Testing the **battery** can also help determine if slow-starting is caused by the **battery** or another issue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is worth keeping on top of a **battery** that continually loses its charge as one that keeps dropping below 75 percent will eventually lead to damage. Most automotive batteries can last four or five years, but one under constant strain from a defective alternator or parasitic draw may fail earlier. On the other hand, if it is four years old and starting to flatten, it may need changing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The newer batteries in cars don’t give you access to the cells because they are meant to be “maintenance free.” But if you have an older **battery**, you will be able to view each cell. There may be a plastic cover over the cells or a separate cap for each one. Be careful if you decide to investigate the **battery** cells because they contain sulfuric acid mixed with water. If you were to get this mixture onto your skin, it could become very painful and lead to an injury. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The car **battery** contains six separate cells, and every cell has 2.1 V power. If any of these cells are dead, In such a case, the **battery** can’t work correctly. Once any car **battery** cell is over, the **battery** needs replacement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here, we check the charge, or **voltage**, of your car **battery**. This is achieved by measuring the DC **voltage** of the **battery** in parallel with the multimeter. If you are looking to test for amperage draw (parasitic draw) – testing amps in series – we cover that process in this guide. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you use your multimeter to conduct the first test, you will be measuring the direct current **voltage**. Where you see the letter “V,” look above it and you will notice dashed and solid lines that indicate the **voltage**. Turn the dial so that it is set to 20. This will give you the ability to measure from 0 to 20 volts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to test the cells individually, then a hydrometer-type of **battery** tester is needed because it can measure the **battery** acid’s gravity. You will know if the cell is bad or good based on how many balls are floating. Even if you know that you have dead cells, it would be like knowing that your **battery** can’t hold a charge that is 12.6 volts. Therefore, you might as well do the resting **voltage** test because it is faster, easier, and just as effective. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are maintaining your car **battery** properly, but it doesn’t matter one day, it also needs to be replaced. Some cases tell you that your **battery** is dying if your **battery** is giving a problem while starting the car or your **battery** is struggling while startup your car’s engine. It’s the right time to replace the car’s **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can expect to see the **battery** **voltage** measure around 13.7-14.7V. If the **voltage** reading is significantly lower or higher, it could mean issues with the **battery** or alternator. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You must check your car’s **battery** after the interval every six months. Test your car **battery** after every six months. A quick **voltage** reading by multimeter will let you know whether your **battery** is strong and runs smoothly or needs service or replacement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The rate of resting **voltage** should not be lower than 12.6 V. A **battery** with a reading of only 12.2V is 50% charged and discharges below 12V. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dimming lights is a potentially good indicator of the strength of your **battery**. Not just your headlights but the interior lights of your vehicle as well. You will notice issues with your other electrical mechanisms such as power windows or anything you plug in, like a phone charger. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note: For a more accurate reading, it’s best to do a **battery** test 12 hours after turning off your vehicle. This allows any surface charge to dissipate. Otherwise, your readings could be higher than they should be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can use a multimeter to test the **voltage** of your car **battery** at home. This is a simple and easy way to check if your **battery** is healthy or needs to be replaced. Follow the steps above to get an accurate reading of your **battery**'s **voltage**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the reading is less than 12.4V, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have a bad lead acid **battery**, just low **voltage**. Some electrical system might have drained it, or your alternator has trouble charging. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, a repeatedly low charge doesn’t mean your **battery** is dead. It could be good and several scenarios might lead it to lose its charge: such as lights being left on, undriven for long periods, dodgy alternator, or even parasitic draw through any number of electrical circuits in the car going awry. Even an errant radio or internal light connection can repeatedly flatten a good one. But a positive outcome of the tests outlined above should prove the **battery** itself can hold a charge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nowadays, cars have more electric components than Mechanical. Most of the features in cars work on electricity. For example, electric seat, tailgate, electric handle, power window, navigation, power sunroof, stereos, sensors, auto headlamps, anti-lock system, traction control, ADAs, etc., makes it hard for the **battery** of the car to keep working. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In humans, the heart circulates the blood all over the body, just like that **battery** circulates electrical power to drive your car. On the average, the car **battery** lasts up to 3 to 5 years. Your driving habits can affect a lot of your car **battery**. Several factors can affect the car **battery**’s life such as excessive cold, vibrations, the alternator etc. before starting a car it is better to test the **battery** first. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A good **battery** will be able to maintain 9.6V for 15 seconds with this load. If the load tester dips below 9.6V during the load test, it might be time for a **battery** replacement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some multimeters – usually the cheaper ones – tend to have both the AC and DC **voltage** ranges sharing the same position on the dial selector. Unless your multimeter is specifically made for the automotive market, it will likely default to AC **voltage**. Don’t fret as you can easily switch between the two, usually via a ‘select’ switch either below the display or in the center of the dial. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Immediately, and within a few hours after charging, it is generally pointless to measure the **voltage** of a car **battery**. It will simply be overestimated, and no useful information can be obtained from it. Just because of a misunderstanding of this simple truth, there are often statements on the Internet that the table presented above is not for all types of batteries, and others. And all because the **voltage** in such cases is measured immediately after the engine is stopped or the charger is turned off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are testing your **battery** in the first place, you are already wondering if there is a problem. And it is true there are several signs you can be on the lookout for what will indicate you are having an issue with your **battery**. We have already touched on corrosion. In the same vein, let us take a look at what else can tip you off it might be time to test your **battery** to see if it’s working okay. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Car **battery** **voltage** is a parameter by which you can learn a lot. For example, how it is charged or discharged. But this is only the simplest, as judged by the **voltage** at the terminals. Another correctly measured **voltage** allows you to assess the state of the vehicle's on-board network, identify malfunctions of the generator or relay-regulator, **voltage** drops and other problems. How it works is described in detail in the article in question. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first thing you can find out from the **voltage** of a car **battery** is charge level. That is, how many percent it is charged or, conversely, discharged. For example, if your new **battery** is running low, a control **voltage** measurement will allow you to detect this in a timely manner. In addition, by the degree of **battery** charge, you can evaluate the chances of a successful engine start on a winter morning. And a weakly charged **battery** should be recharged to avoid sulfation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Indicator lights on your dashboard can often be vague. However, when your **battery** is failing to hold a charge, you will likely get a warning light that pops up on your dashboard. Some cars may just throw up a check engine light first, while others will give you the **battery** light to let you know there is a problem. If you get these along with other symptoms, it is a good bet your **battery** has a problem, and you may need to replace it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A Car **battery** provides the electricity necessary for electric components that work on electricity. The **battery** also converts the chemical energy into electric energy to power your car and provide **voltage** to start it. Stable the current flow in the car, which keeps the engine running. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should also check the Reserve Capacity rating (RC), which is the time (in minutes) a **battery** will deliver 25A and maintain 10.5V. You are looking for a higher reserve capacity should the charging system fail. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are few things more frustrating than discovering that your car won’t start because the **battery** is dead. A mechanic can measure the **voltage** in the **battery**, in order to determine whether it needs to be replaced. There are two ways to do this. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also use a 12 volt test light to check the amperage of your **battery**. To do this, you will need to connect the positive lead of the test light to the positive terminal of the **battery**. Next, you will need to touch the negative lead of the test light to the negative terminal of the **battery**. If the test light lights up, it means that the **battery** has enough power to start your vehicle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Correct measurement of the car **battery** **voltage** - allows you to diagnose it. By **voltage**, you can determine the **battery** charge level, evaluate the operation of the starter, generator and relay-regulator. The main thing is to measure the **voltage** correctly, taking into account the specifics of the batteries themselves, their inertia, as well as different operating modes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Measuring the **battery** **voltage** with the engine running allows you to determine several points at once. Firstly, if without additional load in this mode the voltmeter shows less than 14.4 V, there are problems with the generator or relay-regulator. Secondly, if the **voltage** sags by more than half a volt when the load is on (headlights, stove, music, air conditioning), then there are also problems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the **battery**s **voltage** is over 12.9V, then your car **battery** has excessive **voltage**. Turn on your high beam to drain it. This could mean your alternator had overcharging issues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is often the first sign people get when there is a problem with their **battery**. Without the charge, your starter motor isn’t going to come on right away to get your engine to turn over. If this is a constant issue every time you try to start your car, chances are you are having a **battery** issue. This is good to watch out for before you need a jump start. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The right time for **battery** replacement is while the car engine noise is like it is struggling to start.If you notice something like this, check the car’s **battery** by turning on its headlamps while the engine is off. If the throw of the headlight is dim, then there is a possibility that the **battery** is going to die. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the reading is below 12.2V, you should consider using a trickle charger which charges at a much slower rate. Using a trickle charger helps avoid the risk of **battery** overheating and overcharging. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A multimeter is one of the common ways that people test their car **battery**. There are many testers such as Voltmeter or power probe. However, a multimeter is best since a voltmeter or power probe has its limitations. Before testing your car **battery** with the multimeter here are few things to keep in mind: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Why is this important to understand? Firstly, knowledge of this simple principle allows one to indirectly determine the presence of a harmful leakage current. Secondly, this is important if you want to determine by the **battery** **voltage** how many percent it is charged or to what extent it is discharged. To do this, just measure the **voltage**, and find it in this table. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
