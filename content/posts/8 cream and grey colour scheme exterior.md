## 8 Reference List: Cream And Grey Colour Scheme Exterior | Grey And Cream Colour Scheme Kitchen
-   Harper is also seeing a demand for soft **grey**-greens, such as Dulux Ohai or Lyttelton Double. "Subtle sage greens and **grey**-greens are becoming more and more popular – they work well on a lot of different styles of Kiwi homes and can be paired with brown and **grey**. They are easy to live with and blend in well with the landscape." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ngatai says there's a growing demand for shades of **cream** and tea, such as Resene Rice Cake, Thorndon Cream, Tea and Napa variations. "People are mixing up these families of colours for one exterior, ideally keeping it light, but with a dark roof, which is a Hamptons vibe." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grey and navy look clean and crisp, and brings to mind quaint seaside cottages. The navy brings out the blue of the **grey** and results in a refined combination that’s perfect all year round. We love Gallery Grey with Oxford Blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "Another colourway we are seeing is Resene Duck Egg Blue used as a coastal 'classic' alternative to **grey**. Hues such as this one are perennially popular, and while they are more traditionally used indoors, we are seeing them more outdoors, usually teamed with crisp whites." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Resene colour consultant Brenda Ngatai says she is not really seeing a definite new colour trend coming through. "But the **grey**s have been so strong they have saturated the landscape, and now people are over that look." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ireland is also known as the Emerald Isle, and shades of green always look good against our lush outdoor landscape. A sage green is a workable, neutralised green that will complement your home’s natural setting. As a classic neutral, **cream** doesn’t take away from the green and instead blends in for a seamless look. Try our shades Olive and Cornish Cream. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ﻿Dulux colour specialist Davina Harper is seeing a move towards warmer, earthier exterior shades. "We see a move away from cool **grey**s to warm neutrals and **grey** beiges (greiges), such as Dulux Te Kaha. Grey falls on the cooler side of the colour spectrum, while beige is considered warm – greige is really a warm-toned **grey**." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Resene's Brooke Calvert agrees light shades, especially very soft greens, are in demand, along with the Hamptons approach – all white with a light-**grey** roof. But dark colours remain popular. These are the deep charcoals, such as Resene Grey Friars, Fuscous Grey and Double Foundry. And dark navy, such as Resene Indian Ink, is also in favour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
