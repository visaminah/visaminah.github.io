## 8 Tips to Pictures Of Kitchens With White Cabinets And Granite Countertops | Blue Granite Countertops With White Cabinets
-   Because Sapphire Blue doesn’t have any white in it, it’s a tough sell to introduce it on such a large scale as **cabinets**. You CAN, but I’ve found that with the particular colours in Sapphire Blue, white **cabinets** can make it look more dated. If you REEEEAALLLY want white **cabinets**, DON’T choose a warm white and be cautious with your wall colour choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this next kitchen, while this isn’t as warm as St. Cecelia or New Venetian, it has a similar look. The reduced warmth and simple subway tile leave room for a fantastic green hue on the **cabinets**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, you CAN paint your **cabinets** a soft warm off-white, as long as it doesn’t lean into yellow/cream. Baltic Brown favours an orange undertone and one that leans slightly into red (pink) rather than yellow. Some of the more modern off-white beige paint colours can be interesting partners to Baltic Brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With WOOD OR WHITE CABINETS, try a soft white subway tile, but NOT a stark one (if you have white **cabinets**, the two whites should match). Partner it with a soft beige grout to pick up on the gold tones in the countertop. You can also look at some travertine tile backsplashes. Doing this in a more MODERN subway tile pattern can update the look of this black granite. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   White marble countertops with gray veining complement the gray **cabinets** with clean and sleek look. The gray and white theme continues throughout the space with **cabinets** in white-gray tile backsplash. You can create this spacious and relaxing kitchen in your own home and always enjoy it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the above example, my client was looking for a paint colour for her **cabinets**. I had to break it to her that paint wasn’t going to fix things, and could in fact, further the disconnect between her backsplash and countertop – she needed a new backsplash. And of course, I can’t FIND the after photos to show you, but maybe my client is reading this and will resend them (wink wink nudge nudge…). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   BUT (a great big one…), there are more things at play in a kitchen, such as backsplash tiles and flooring. In this next example, while the countertop here isn’t Peacock Green, it has similar colours in it (gray-green). And while we could easily do white **cabinets**, we have to take the backsplash and floor into consideration, both of which won’t be happy if we go white! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Depending on the surrounding space, furnishings and backsplash, some **kitchens** can pull off a darker greige/taupe or green hue. If you paint your main **cabinets** a soft warm white or off-white , you could paint your island a darker neutral with a reasonably strong green undertone. This way, rather than competing with the countertop, it will act like an ACCENT. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
