-   D (Full size, NOT D minus) - I really hoped I would love this **mouse** but the thumb grip area is way too recessed and the pinky area is ultra cramped.

I tried the matte finish and it was very slippery, making me have to grasp the **mouse** harder. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So, my Deathadder V2 Pro has shit the bed (randomly started disconnecting/reconnecting every 2 seconds). I can’t update the firmware on it (I tried). I got this **mouse** to replace my G502 because my hands have gotten big over the years and I’ve recently really gotten into FPS games, so aim training with my G502 started causing wrist pains from the way I was gripping it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Anyway, looking for a Deathadder V2 Pro alternative that can supplement my big hands. I do want a **wireless** **mouse**. Or, if anyone knows how to fix the Deathadder that’d be cool too. Thanks in advanced (: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   g502 - used this for years because it was a gift from my girlfriend at the time, and i have no idea how. this thing was WAY too thin for me, it always felt like I was pinching it at all times. I ended up causing right clicks in error every time I had to pick the **mouse** up, and it had a tendency to want to spin counter-clockdwise in my hand when gripping. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hey guys I need help finding a **mouse** for my big hands. My bugdet is 60-70$. The weight of the **mouse** should medium, not **wireless** and right handed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hello! I'm looking for a gaming **mouse** (mainly twitchy action games) that's both **wireless** and white. I've been using the g305 for a year and while it is great, I tried the g502 and instantly fell in love. However, it's not white. Are there other great options I can look at? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
