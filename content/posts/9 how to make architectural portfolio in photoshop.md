## 9 Tips for How To Make Architectural Portfolio In Photoshop | How To Make Architecture Portfolio
-   File size is another important consideration. Keep it around 5MB - 10MB to ensure it reaches your potential employer, and that if it does get there, it can be easily opened. Alternatively, of course you can put your architect **portfolio** online. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A stylish **portfolio** is critical for any designer. Other professions have the luxury of describing their skills and accolades in words, but designers can’t just describe their work; they have to show it. Designers are most often compared, chosen, and hired based on the impression that their **portfolio** makes. Even if your work samples are stellar, the **portfolio** itself is arguably your most important design work, and it should be just as impressive as the work within it. Below, we’ll use some straightforward techniques to help you create a stylish, professional **portfolio** layout. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For this longer version of your **architectural** **portfolio**, it is not necessary to try to outline every job you have ever done. The best bet is to highlight nine or ten of the jobs you are most proud of. Don’t be afraid of blank space and remember that you only need to outline things like design, process, and final solutions. In terms of text, less is usually more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Jason Wu, a Masters student from Canada, has created an architecture **portfolio** that faithfully presents all his design work with a depth and clarity that is likely to impress any potential employer. Cleverly, he uses multiple representations to present different sections within a single structure. Then, to this he adds side model photos for another fresh perspective. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, it is important to remember who you are talking to. Consider who is viewing your architect **portfolio** and be prepared to adjust it accordingly to present yourself in the best light for that particular role or project. In other words, remember that your architect **portfolio** should grow and change as you grow and evolve through your career. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Within most professions, CVs or resumes are accepted as the best way to set out your qualifications and work experience for the benefit of potential employees. However, this doesn’t hold true for all industries. Professional sportspeople and actors go further than simple CVs and put together video presentations of their work, while others like artists are more likely to benefit from **portfolio**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Looking for an **architectural** role isn’t all about proving you’re good at what you do. Of course, that’s a critically important part of the equation, but it’s also about matching your style and inspiration with those of the people you will be working with. In other words, it’s not just about being a good architect, but being the type of good architect that fits that particular role or project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use attractive graphics and clear presentation, and ensure that your **architectural** **portfolio** is not too text heavy. Use a range of visuals including photos, technical detail drawings, and photorealistic renders. Even use sketches if that is one of your talents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On top of that, there is a pleasing consistency to her architect **portfolio**. Throughout the document, where possible, she divides her account of each project into three clear parts, complete with photo images, renders, and plans. In this way she is able to provide clear, compelling accounts of her chosen projects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
