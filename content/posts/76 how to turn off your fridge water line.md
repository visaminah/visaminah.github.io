Allow a few minutes for the water to force out any air left in the lines, then turn the faucet **off** again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Water filters are made to remove contaminants like lead, mercury, chlorine and more from your drinking water and ice. Most Samsung **fridge**s can still function without a water filter installed. While rotary valves in the **fridge** can bypass the water filter and give you water without one installed, this does not mean you should continue to use your Samsung refrigerator without a water filter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
