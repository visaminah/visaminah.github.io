-   Earlier, we mentioned a combination of light **blue** and navy. If you like the **blue**-on-**blue** look but want something a little brighter, you might want to try out royal **blue** and sky **blue**. This is a great look for beachwear and casual summer outfits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black does not always work well with light purple **colors**, however. It can sometimes make light purple **colors** look washed out or make them appear gray. Use caution when pairing such light and dark shades together, and consider adding an element of white to the look to help keep the light purple from looking dull. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light purple clothes go with many different **colors**, depending on your mood. White, beige, and gray neutrals are all good color options as long as they have similar undertones to the purple you are wearing. For a pop of color, pair your light purple clothing with light yellow, light **blue**, or dark purple options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To make things simple, we’re categorizing the ‘reds’ into a single category including salmon, brown and coral.

You wear pride in your sleeve in the workplace; however, if you are looking for a touch more laidback and discreet, then my recommendation includes brown, burgundy or pink. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your body type is slim or skinny, boost it with extra confidence. Don’t hesitate to choose the **blue** suit. It will make you appear sharp, calm, and luxurious – all at the same time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The advantage of neutral shades is that they can be perfectly combined with other **colors**. But don’t get carried away with one hue or a shade.

An ideal outfit consists of 2-3 shades, and keep in mind any more than that can lead to the opposite result. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red and **blue** can be a classy combination if you have the eye for it. You can throw on a **blue** chambray blazer over a muted red dress for formal meetings or a powder **blue** leather jacket if you are headed out.

-   Shades of purple vary widely, and some are more appropriate than others for the changing seasons.

-   This combination might be the most difficult but, at the same time, the most effective. Combining these **colors** in men’s clothing, you need to tread subtly. The same rule applies here as for the combination of red and **blue**, and you can limit yellow or red to small accent pieces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Once the weather turns cooler, more people turn to darker, cooler **colors**. And for a more understated combination, gray and green are a good choice.

For higher contrast, try pairing lighter gray with dark green as shown in the picture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll want to stick to a pure white color, however. Off-white shades can have yellowish tones, which won’t always work with all shades of purple. If you stray into the off-white range, try to pair it with purple **colors** with warmer tones – like plum, mauve, or shades with a reddish hue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best thing about choosing a **blue** jeans outfit for men is that you can club it with almost anything.

Only remember to match the look according to the occasion and the **blue** jeans combination. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

So what are the **colors** to go best with navy **blue**? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like some other combinations on the list, this one works well when there’s a color gradient involved. Coral looks nice in an outfit that incorporates **blue**, green, and the spectrum of **colors** between. And of course, incorporating white is a fairly simple way to lighten up the look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The chaotic combination of light & dark is alluring. Similarly, there is no better fit for light **blue** jeans than a black shirt.

Go for a turtleneck black t-shirt and brown belt for a unique touch to the combination. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A pale **blue** monochromatic ensemble will create both a soft and striking look. The key to keep it from being too soft (or Easter like), is to add contrasting accessories that add a little edge. Slight variations in shade (such as with the top and trouser pairing below) create the same elongating look but keep it from looking too much like a uniform. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The **blue** hue is associated with calm, intelligence, sincerity, and confidence. Blue is the color of the sky and ocean in nature. These create a sense of calm and security. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The easiest way is to combine monochrome **colors**, i.e., shades of the same color. You can also easily combine a base color with analogous **colors** on the sides of the base color since they’re so similar. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this post, I’ll show you how to wear light **blue** in the fall. The key to wearing unconventional seasonal shades is to pair them with dark neutrals like taupes, deep browns, greys, and blacks.

-   Did I tell you that real men wear pink? And rightly so, the pink color favors the bold who likes to make a daring statement every time. But there is a caveat here: Too much bright a **blue** suit or pink shirt can be too showy. Give a complete look with a **blue** or purple tie. If you feel you don’t need a pinkish pocket square, be a little creative by opting for a **blue** color. Black Shirt + Blue Suit: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can wear any shirts based on the situation. For formal events, going with a button-down, flannel, or oxford shirt would be the smarter choice. As for casual, you can go with **blue** jeans and white t-shirt combination, printed shirts or a turtleneck. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s imperative to combine **colors** that complements your natural complexion.

By nature, men don’t really think about how a particular color of clothing suits their faces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here are a few **blue** suit/shirt/tie combinations worth playing around with until you find what works for you. Remember, it’s not just the color of the tie that counts. The shape and texture play important roles too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Navy **blue** and charcoal gray are staples in the fashion world. And if you can’t choose between the two, you can always go for the happy medium: slate **blue**. This gray-tinged **blue** looks outstanding alongside warm, vintage-inspired whites. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want a color combination that evokes memories of spring, a combination of periwinkle and rose pink is an excellent choice.

Of course, you can always incorporate these soft **colors** into an outfit while sticking to more neutral-colored shoes and other accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next time when you worry about what to wear with **blue** jeans, the answer should be obvious. The most fitting t-shirt color that goes well with any shade of **blue** jeans, a sage green t-shirt is a must-have. Bring out some color to your wardrobe by adding a full-sleeved and half-sleeved sage green t-shirt. Go with sneakers for casual days & choose oxford shoes by pairing it with a jacket. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black or brown shoes? Honestly, there can be no one right answer to this. I prefer brown over black if the suit you choose features a lighter color. If your suit is navy **blue** or dark, then going for a pair of black or dark brown shoes is advisable. Monk straps, brogues, loafers or oxford are the choicest of styles. Make sure they are polished to shine, and features a well-rounded shape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purple clothes go well with **colors** like white, gray, beige, **blue**, or yellow. Purple is not limited to these **colors**, however, and can be paired in seemingly endless combinations. The key is to always match the undertones of your purple to those of the **colors** you pair it with, keeping warm tones and cool tones separate from one another. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you like the energy of yellow but prefer something closer to a jewel tone, a golden shade of yellow like the one pictured is a great way to go. It pairs well with medium **blue** and even denim **blue**, so this look works well for casual outfits. And of course, if you like patterns, shirts or dresses that use this combination are a nice way to stand out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here’s a winning suit and shirt combo: **blue** shirt plus **blue** suit. It maintains the tones cool and harmonizing, and allows you to be playful with your pocket square. ‘Go wild’, should I say. The rule is pretty much simple: choose cufflinks for events that are more formal in nature and buttons for the workplace. If it’s for a formal event, then choose a dark navy **blue** shirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Most **colors** blend well with the primary **colors** that make them up. In the case of purple, which is made from a combination of **blue** and red dyes, **blue** is a natural pairing to make. In particular, the color **blue** emphasizes the cool tones of purple clothing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also wear light **blue** jeans with a white, black, or dark **blue** denim jacket. Go with a neutral black, white, or grey shirt or hoodie underneath when doubling up on denim. Avoid a brightly coloured shirt, otherwise the outfit can go from trendy to tacky. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to take this intriguing combination out of the office, try pairing yellow-orange accessories (belts, shoes, purses, etc.) with a pastel-**blue** dress or top. And since this yellow-orange shade essentially works as a neutral, it looks nice alongside various shades of brown or tan, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As we’ve seen so far, **blue** and brown seem to pair well together regardless of shade. Chocolate brown and lighter **blue** form a dignified pairing that works well with formal looks. As you can see in the photo, a medium-**blue** tie looks great with a chocolate brown blazer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It shows the relationship between **colors** and can be broadly split into “warm” **colors** and “cool” **colors**. Warm **colors** include oranges, yellows, and reds. They’re vibrant, summery, and striking. Cool **colors** include purples, **blue**s, and greens. They’re soothing, relaxing, and more winter/fall-appropriate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red can be paired with neutral **colors** like white or black quite easily. For classy outfits, go for grays, browns, or earthy tones. In summers, tangerines, **blue**s, and mustards look vibrant. It depends on where you are headed and what your personal preference is, but here’s a list with a little bit of everything. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The art of combining **colors** is a crucial nuance. After all, even the most expensive things can look ridiculous together and spoil the impression it’s meant to have, just like flashy, tasteless outfits. To avoid these mistakes, you need to master the basic rules of color combinations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another reason for purple’s popularity has been its flexibility. Purple is made through a combination of red and **blue** and can be created in various tones and intensities. This makes it a color that can be tailored to fit many different styles, skin tones, and seasons – making it a go-to choice for designers all year long. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And if you’re currently shopping for new looks, this is a fairly easy one to create. Navy **blue** is a common color for just about every clothing item, and you can also find tan leather accessories quite easily. Plus, navy and tan is a versatile combination that works well with casual outfits and formal wear alike. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This striking combination often looks almost regal. But it’s also at home in more casual contexts. As you can see in the picture, these two **colors** make quite a statement when combined in a pattern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you like the look of very bright **colors** but want to pair them with something a little quieter, the combination of bright **blue** and soft gray is ideal. And as you can see in the picture, this is an ideal combination for activewear or athleisure: it’s easy to pair a bright **blue** hoodie with gray sweatpants. If you’re going for a look that is lighter and brighter overall, you can incorporate white accents or accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Try using intense sunny yellow for a bold contrast or soft yellow for an airier look. It also works to combine various shades of sky **blue** with a single shade of yellow. If you like to get creative with combining **colors**, this is a great place to start! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll also want to pay attention to the undertones of the greens and purples you mix. Pairing a warm-tone green like an olive green won’t work with a **blue**-toned purple like periwinkle. Stick to **colors** that are both cool or both warm to make good combinations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Coral is a great color for spring and summer looks, and a paler shade of coral is a great choice if you want to tone down the intensity a bit. Like many summery **colors**, coral pairs nicely with tan. Combining it with a tan blazer as shown in the photo is a great way to go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red and **blue** are always striking. But if bright red and cerulean form a combination that’s a little loud for your taste, the muted nature of clay red just might work. Since clay red is close to being a neutral, you might be able to find clay-red coats like the one in the picture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the dead of winter, it’s pretty easy to get tired of your wardrobe. Winter is dragging on, outside it’s cloudy and grey, and you’ve been wearing your cold weather clothes for months. But spring is still weeks away, so how can you inject some life into what you’re wearing every day? With color! And I’m not just talking about adding one dramatic pop of color to your look today – how you pair **colors** also has a big impact on the liveliness, effervescence and joy you find in your outfits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Almost any color will complement your **blue** foundation. White shirts are always a winner. But black, pink, and red all work well, to name just a few. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purple is made up of red and **blue** and therefore comes in many different shades with both warm and cool undertones. Your best chance of matching purple clothing is to choose **colors** that share the same undertones as the purple you have. Stick to warm **colors** with red-toned purples, and use cool **colors** with **blue**-toned purples. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But **blue** projects confidence and daring. And I’m not talking about navy here. I’m talking about true **blue** as a clear sky. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to keep these two high-contrast **colors** separate, you can still create a memorable outfit: try combining a green top with white pants or vice versa. You can dress up this look with jewelry, too. Choose silver jewelry for a modern look, or go with gold if you’d prefer a classic aesthetic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One color combination we haven’t talked about yet is purple and black, which can also make a striking combination. Black works well with dark **colors** of purple since it can make these dark shades pop. This can make dark purple **colors** look more intense than they normally would against other color shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **colors** seem to work with purple clothes, as long as you match undertones and shade intensities between the **colors** you pair. However, several **colors** are difficult to match with purple clothes and tend to clash. These **colors** include brown, orange, and certain shades of green and red. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This combo spells elegance and class. Blue on **blue** is always a ‘champion’ look. I recommend that you choose a tie having heavy texture as it will differentiate the **blue** tie and **blue** suit, providing you an exciting look. There can be no count of the people who’d have either commented or loved the texture of the tie! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At any rate, these **colors** look nice together, and you can use accessories to shift the mood of the outfit. If you’re going for a more energetic look, try adding a bright green hat (or other accessory) as shown in the picture. If you’re after a more understated look, black or dark gray accessories also go well with lilac and lavender. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing a jacket to wear with light **blue** jeans doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Stick with neutral color tones, or denim, and keep the look minimal and uncomplicated. Try any of the following: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a truly eye-catching combo and is suitable for both formal and casual occasions. The warm red tie against the cool white shirt backdrop really pops. Your **blue** suit adds an attractive frame to the ensemble. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
