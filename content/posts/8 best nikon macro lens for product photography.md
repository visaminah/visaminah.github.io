## 8 Things You Should Know About Best Nikon Macro Lens For Product Photography | Best Lens For Detail Shots
-   You don’t need the features: Higher-end cameras have features that you rarely need for any product or jewelry photography. For example, if you’re shooting sports or wildlife or shooting in dim lighting conditions, higher-priced cameras will help. For product photos, where lighting is abundant and controlled, a basic DSLR is all you need. Image quality is not very different: For example, I have couple images below shot with a Nikon Z6 (costing about US $2000 for camera and **lens**) vs a Nikon D5500 (currently discontinued but it retailed for about $600 for camera and **lens**) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to print a full page ad of small products like a ring or studs in a glossy magazine, then a macro **lens** will help you capture the image in a better quality for print. For images for your website or even to print in thumbnail sizes (e.g. 3 inch square) for your line sheets, you can use a regular **lens** and you won’t be able to tell the difference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When to buy a prime **lens**? Consider a prime **lens** if the products you’re shooting are of a similar size – otherwise you’ll be moving back and forth a lot trying to get your product to fit well into your frame. Portrait photographers typically use prime **lens**es because they photograph different people from the same distance i.e. they don’t have to move back and forth between shots and the image quality is better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s easy to get caught up in the details of all the **lens**es available. Sure, some **lens**es are technically superior to others. However, for jewelry photography, since your camera is so close to the product, the important metric you need to pay attention to the “macro focus range” or “minimal focus distance” number mentioned with each **lens**. Here is a screenshot from Amazon showing this number for the 18-55mm **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note: without getting technical, the number on the **lens** e.g. 105mm, indicates the zoom on the **lens**. For example, the 105mm has close to double the zoom of 55mm or triple the zoom of a 35mm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For web images, the 18-55mm **lens** that is included with your DSLR or mirrorless camera kit is sufficient for almost all products. In most cases, you don’t need a macro **lens** or any additional **lens**es. For smaller pieces like rings or small studs, a macro **lens** will give you a better quality picture in a bigger size. However, images used on the web don’t need to be too big so the 18-55 is good enough for small items too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is no such thing as the best **lens** or best camera for jewelry photography. Why? Because you can get the same quality jewelry product photos using so many cameras and **lens**es. The question should be what is the best camera and **lens** that you need and can afford. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "Another benefit is the Hybrid IS," Oliver continues. "I often do my macro work handheld because a lot of the time I'm photographing subjects that move. A tripod just isn't going to work. With this RF macro **lens** and the Canon EOS R5, because you have stabilisation in both the **lens** and the camera body, I can get away with using quite ridiculously slow shutter speeds." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
