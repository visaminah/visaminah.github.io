-   Here at Bushbuddy, we live what we do. We live off-grid deep in one of the harshest wilderness on earth. We're passionate about handcrafting our **stove**s to have character and be completely dependable. There are faster methods but not better methods. Adventurers aren't soulless and neither should their gear be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Cocoon Fan is equipped with a safety strip in the **fan** base to prevent it from overheating. However, if the **stove** reaches excessive temperatures (over 660°F), it may overheat the **fan** and damage the motor. To prevent this, you can get yourself a magnetic **stove** thermometer to check on the temperature and know when it is getting too hot for your **fan**. If it gets too hot, move the **fan** to a cooler part of the **stove**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   However, there has been controversy about whether **stove** **fan**s are conversation piece or really good value for the money. Some people still prefer box **fan**s, others who are looking to buy one may also have questions like: which is the right model for me? Is there a model for **stove** that doesn’t have a flat surface? Which **stove** **fan** would suit the size of my room? In this article, we will first explain the characteristics of wood **stove** **fan**s. We will then list some of the products we think are among the best as well as their pros and cons, and offer a conclusion at the end. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Physics! This **fan** uses an innovative thermoelectric device to generate electricity directly from the heat of the wood **stove** to run the **fan**. The electrical energy is generated from the thermal energy flowing through the device from the bottom (hot) portion of the **fan** stand to the top (**fan**-cooled) portion of the stand. But most of all—regardless of how it works—it is effective! For more info, click here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Design is a broad field, and OCROUKI’s wood **stove** top **fan**s remind us of the importance of efficient power, aesthetics and safety, and user-friendliness. Kudos to OCROUKI for making a good first impression with their products and their design makes a statement. The furnace **fan** is another terrific invention that will save money for anyone with a furnace. Very useful for those who want a warm home for those harsh winter days! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Steelhead **stove** **fan** is an excellent performer across a wide range of temperatures from 110°C to 450°C (230°F to 842°F). It works on any wood burner, multi-fuel or coal **stove** and circulates in excess of 320 CFM of air. It is a small precision engineered Stirling engine with no electrical components, and runs quietly and uses only heat as fuel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Free standing heat powered wood **stove** **fan** + heat insulation bracket (for ST-145 plus). With a bracket, it's very suitable to use our heat powered **fan** on the top of outdoor heaters when you are traveling in winter. It will help you expand the warm range more efficiently. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The only issue is that CFM rate seems a bit lower than other models when the **fan** is attached to the pipe, because it is not far enough from the heat source (the pipe). When the **stove** **fan** is attached to the pipe, the hot air can become trapped which means there is not such a wide difference in temperature across the peltier module. The **fan** does not spin as fast because less electricity is generated when the difference in temperature is less. However there are also other reviews said that it DOES move a decent amount of air, and that the heat can be felt on the complete opposite corner of a medium sized room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In winter, When people want to sit for a while in front of the cooker, they will feel the heat unbearable. And if they go too far away, they will be cold. This is an annoying thing for most people. Fortunately, this problem can be well solved by fireplace **fan**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   MOST DURABLE- Thicker stainless steel and engineered expansion management make the Firebox the strongest **stove** on the market with the least amount of warpage. Barrel type hinges are stronger and don't flex or slide like other hinge designs. See video here: https://youtu.be/mlxfaeK403Y. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Place the Cocoon Fan at least 4" away from the flue, so that it does not pick up the radiant heat from the flue. This will cause it to run faster, and for a longer time when the fire is low. If you wish to distribute the heat from the flue across the room, point the **fan** slightly towards the flue so that the moving air picks up the flue heat as well. In our experience, placing the **stove** **fan** towards the back of the wood **stove**, and pointing into the room, works best. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ECO-FRIENDLY-andThis eco-friendly **fan** is powered by the heat produced by your fireplace or wood burning **stove**; the blades spin faster as the fire gets hotter, dispersing the heat throughout the room, no electricity needed!STOKING INDICATOR-andThe blades will slow as the fire goes down, you a built-in indicator of when to stoke and add more wood.QUIET-andThe blades are the only moving parts on this **stove** **fan** soandunlike noisy forced air **fan**s, it is whisper quiet.LOW MAINTENANCE-andThe **fan** requires very little attention to keep it running well, simply dust it off occasionally, and put some light oil on the blade shaft to keep it spinning smoothly and quietly!PRODUCT DETAILS-and170-190 CFM Above 900 RPM and MAX Temperature of 644 F (340 C). For safety, Fan should be placed on the back of the **stove** (not in front) 6 inches away from the **stove** pipe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our **stove** **fan**s work by using heat from wood **stove**s to drive **fan** blades. On free standing wood ovens, the thermodynamic wood **stove** **fan** is designed to withstand normal surface temperatures between 205 °C and 345 °C (400 °F and 650 °F). The heat of the wood **stove** **fan** blower comes from these fireplaces or wood-burning **stove**s, which don't require extra batteries or electricity, so it's environmentally friendly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wood **stove** **fan**s can greatly improves the efficiency through moving a large volume of air slowly. However the “thrust” of the **fan** isn’t anything crazy but given the fact it’s running solely off the power from the **stove** and it’s such a small **fan**, it’s sufficient. Don't expect a blast of hot air but do expect the room to warm quicker and get warmer with these **fan**s who gently circulate the air. Keep in mind that this is a small **fan** so it’s not going to push the same air as a large **fan**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Heating your home with a freestanding **stove** or fireplace insert is a way of life. Make the most of that warmth with IronStrike, where quality and comfort are our standard. With our industry-leading workmanship, you’ll be enjoying convenient and dependable heat for life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A common drawback of heating a room with a wood **stove** is that the heated air accumulates around the ceiling or disperses from the exhaust ducts instead of spreading out to fill the entire room. Roof **fan**s solve this problem by blowing the hot air next to the **stove** to the rest of the room. They can reduce fuel consumption by 20% and warm up the air in the room 30% faster. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Usually, wall-hung **stove** heating uses natural gas, artificial gas or liquefied gas as fuel. The fuel is output by the burner, burned in the combustion chamber, and then the heat is absorbed by the heat exchanger, and the circulating water in the heating system is heated reciprocally, thus constantly outputting heat to the building as it passes through the heat exchanger, providing a heat source for the building. The working principle of fireplace heating is heat radiation, the form of heat transfer is just like the sun, with the fireplace as the point of outward radiation, after actual measurement, the temperature of the microcrystalline ceramic surface of the fireplace can reach 350 ~ 400 ℃, the temperature presents a **fan**-shaped outward diffusion, through the air medium conduction heat and gradually weakened, after using the actual measurement, the indoor ambient temperature can be maintained in the range of 22 ~ 28 ℃. The unevenness of the space temperature can effectively form the convection of indoor air and adjust the indoor dryness and humidity, to provide a comfortable living environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The motor of this wood fireplace blower **stove** **fan** is imported from Japan. It runs more smoothly than normal motor and makes almost no sound. It also has a long life and is easy to use, effectively distributing warm air evenly throughout the room and reducing the amount of fuel you burn on cold days. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wood **stove** **fan** became popular in recent years and is searched for most often in Canada, United Kingdom, and United States. The search interest starts rising from every July and peaks at its highest level every December. There are some major reasons for its popularity: increase of fuel efficiency, self-powered mechanism, saving on electricity bills, low noise, automatic controls, and sometimes even its simple and fashionable design. Therefore it brings an almost perfect solution to families who have wood **stove**s to warm the house but still have cold spots, since the heat stays around the **stove** and is not circulating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Will the **fan**’s blade spin automatically when a certain temperature is reached? Some **stove** **fan**s have higher start-up temperature, while others are more temperature sensitive and require lower temperature to start. For example if you have the latest cool-topped **stove**s, remember to choose a **stove** **fan** with ultra low starting temperature. The commonly seen start-up temperatures are between 45°C(113°F) and 55°C(131°F). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. Do not bring the base of the **stove**top. Do not place the **stove** on a designated protected surface when it is hot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This model is a good solution for the **stove**s that are designed with a decoration on top, or are simply not perfectly horizontal for a **stove** **fan** to sit on. The **stove** **fan** can be attached to the pipe with a clamp which will fit 5-6 inch (12-15 cm) diameter. If you ever need it for bigger pipes, you can go to a farm store or irrigation supplier and get bigger bands. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Automatic control means an inbuilt safety system that protects the motor from damage. It is basically a heat sensitive bimetallic strip that’s featured on its base and tilts the **fan** to protect the Peltier module from overheating when the temperature gets too high. Overheating is a common problem with all **stove** **fan**s. Thus a good automatic control system is essential. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It starts turning minutes after the fire is lit, which is at 45℃ (113℃) according to user instruction. The heat powered **stove** **fan** can automatically start when the surface temperature reaches 45°C(113°F). The higher temperature is, the faster the blades spin, and the more warm air is moved. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is also the largest model at 10” tall x 5.5” wide x 3.3” long and comes with your choice of gold, nickel or black blade colour. The AirMax operates at a **stove** surface temperature range of 185° F to 650° F (85° C to 345° C). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
