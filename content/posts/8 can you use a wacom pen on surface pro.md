## 8 Interesting Facts Can You Use A Wacom Pen On Surface Pro | can i use wacom pen on surface pro
-   Yes. Some Wacom **pen**s, like the Bamboo Ink, work on the Surface Pro. This makes it possible to get a better **pen** than the Surface Pen when you purchase a Surface Pro 7. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Wacom MobileStudio Pro comes in two options: 13” and 16”. This gives you the option to decide how large you want your tablet to be, de**pen**ding on your needs. Unfortunately, you don’t get that same level of choice with the Microsoft Surface Pro 7, as it only comes in one size: 12.3”. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All these tablets are pretty ex**pen**sive. An entry level Surface Pro costs $1800+, while the 13” MobileStudio Pro costs $1400. The Cintiq costs multiple thousands of dollars. That said, they both offer excellent quality and, de**pen**ding on what you want to do, will do the job well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Wacom Cintiq 16 does not come with a **pen** holder or stand. Instead, it has a fabric loop on the side of the tablet to which you can attach the stylus. This puts it at a tie against the Surface Pro 7, since that one lets you magnetically attach the **pen** to the tablet and lacks a **pen** holder as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As far as surface texture goes, the Wacom MobileStudio Pro comes with etched glass, which gives it a matte texture. It has very minimal reflection, which makes it significantly easier to see images. Moreover, it offers just the right amount of friction to the **pen** so that drawing on the MobileStudio Pro feels like writing on normal paper. This makes the drawing experience more natural. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The pressure feels much better on this **pen**, and tilt recognition works significantly better. The latency issues have also been solved. It feels like a good stylus, and it’s fun to write with, with the rear side doubling as an eraser. The Surface Pro 7 also has good palm rejection so it’s a joy to work with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Surface Pro 7, on the other hand, has a glossy screen. The **pen** also has a default soft tip, so you get the distinct feeling of writing on glass when you use this tablet. It gives you less control over the **pen** and takes a while getting used to. Some artists don’t mind this, while others can’t stand it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Wacom Mobile Studio Pro 16 sits at the very top of the drawing tablet price pyramid, but for a very good reason. Purposely targeting serious professionals, this tablet is a compact computer designed for creatives who require ultimate portable performance for demanding workloads. Despite the ex**pen**se of what is really a powerful performing computer, the 4k display lets you view and work with full versions of your favorite applications in vivid and rich colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
