## 4 Reference List: How To Test A 6V Battery With A Digital Multimeter | How To Tell If A 6 Volt Battery Is Bad
-   The first digit on many **multimeter**s is only able to display a '1' so the ranges are limited to 19.99 instead of 99.99. Hence the 20V max range instead of 99V max range. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What happens if you select a voltage setting that is too low for the voltage you're trying to measure? Nothing bad. The meter will simply display a 1. This is the meter trying to tell you that it is overloaded or out-of-range. Whatever you're trying to read is too much for that particular setting. Try changing the **multimeter** knob to a the next highest setting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're measuring DC voltage (such as a battery or a sensor hooked up to an Arduino) you want to set the knob where the V has a straight line. AC voltage (like what comes out of the wall) can be dangerous, so we rarely need to use the AC voltage setting (the V with a wavy line next to it). If you're messing with AC, we recommend you get a non-contact tester rather than use a digital **multimeter**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In short, you will need to set the **multimeter** to the 20-volt DC setting. Next, turn off the ignition and lights. Connect the red cable to the battery’s positive (+) terminal and the black cable to the battery’s negative (-) terminal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
