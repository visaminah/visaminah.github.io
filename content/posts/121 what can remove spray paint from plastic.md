This holds true whether dealing with over**spray** from your own **paint**ing project or when removing graffiti from an exterior surface.

-   Spray **paint**ing like a pro takes some time to learn. Even then, there will be times when removing unwanted **paint** is necessary.

-   Another very important step is the testing process before application. Now plastic can be of different types, and thinner ones can corrode and get discolored easily. Hence, it is best to test your **paint** thinner solution on one corner of the plastic to check if it reacts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, carefully wipe the **paint** off the mirror using the area of the cloth soaked in thinner. The **paint** should come off the mirror onto the cloth fairly quickly. For stubborn spots, you may need to repeat this step a few times to work the **paint** off one layer at a time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Denatured alcohol is used as a strong **paint** thinner and it is great for removing **paint** from plastic surfaces. However, this is a very strong solution so when you use it you need to be protected. Make sure there is enough fresh air in the room or if you can do the cleaning outside. Always use gloves when handling the alcohol and it would be good if you could use a protective mask as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also use ammonia, which works more on acrylic and latex **paint**s. Mineral spirits will work better on oil-based **paint**s. Solvents should always be tested out first in an unobtrusive area. The different plastic will react differently, so take a Q-tip and place a drop on the plastic surface, and wait to see what happens. If you do not notice any difference, it should be okay to use the solvents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is said that those who work make mistakes, so no matter if you are doing some kind of DIY project or if part of your job is working with different materials, it is normal to make some mistakes.

-   When dealing with unwanted **paint** on plastic, the first removal method you try should be soapy water. This is the safest way to get the **paint** off plastic, and it works best if the **paint** hasn't set on the surface for too long. Dampen a rag in warm, soapy water and use it to rub until the **paint** is no longer visible. If you find that soapy water doesn't do the trick, move on to another method. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 4: Take a putty knife in the other hand and look out for **paint** bubbles and wrinkles. This lets you know the heated **paint** is ready to come off.

-   Household items might not possess the strength you need for some of the seriously stubborn **paint** stains. If you want to know how to remove **spray** **paint** from plastic, or maybe even how to remove enamel **paint** from plastic you might need some stronger chemicals which you can find in solvents or acetone.

-   Step 2: Use it to wipe away the **paint** from your wooden surface. The **paint** should come off quickly. If it doesn’t, apply some mineral spirits on the **paint** and scrub with a cotton rag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our first and foremost suggestion, which is a recommendation that should not be taken lightly, is to always make sure you have read the label of the product and the **paint** in question. That way you know what **paint** you are dealing with and you’ll also understand how to see the product you have chosen. Some of the products can easily melt the surfaces you are trying to clean so do not skip that step. Below are some more suggestions that will make removing the **paint** an easier task. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spray **paint** dries within minutes, so cleaning it up is seldom as simple as wiping it before it sets. Water-based **spray** **paint** usually cleans up with soap and water, but it’s less common. Most **spray** **paint**s are oil-based and require stronger methods of removal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If nothing else works, then you will need some extra tools that will get the job done. Actually, it is recommended to start with this. A **paint** scraper or a plastic puffy knife should be the first thing you use to get rid of all the excess layers of **paint** so that the other things you use (like the oil, alcohol or nail polish remover) will get all the **paint** off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are some situations where you will have to use a 90% isopropyl alcohol though due to the pigment used in some oil based **paint**s being considerably stronger than others. This tends to be the reds and browns and although a 70% isopropyl alcohol is able to get the job done, it really does take a ton of time and effort where a 90% solution would get the job done in minutes. If you do use a 90% isopropyl alcohol to remove oil **paint** from plastic try to remember to wash the plastic down with water afterwards to prevent the alcohol from potentially damaging it over time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After you see the **paint** changing to liquid form again, you will need to wipe it off well. This can be done with a piece of cloth, which is preferably semi-rough. You can use one of your old hand towels for the purpose. The slightly rough surface will help in scrubbing the **paint**, and it can be then removed easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If paper towels do not work well, you will require brushes for the job. These will help you in cleaning more intensively and will let you scrub the surface well while working. You can replace it with a **paint** scraper or a putty knife; they will help you in the same way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paint remover for plastic products may contain harmful ingredients that could affect the plastic surface. So, always read the label and make sure what you are buying is correct and follow the instructions for use. Even some of the household items can also cause damage to plastic surfaces. Nail polish remover, for instance, can melt plastic, so it is best not to use too much of it. Following are a few more tips, so you can remove **paint** from plastic carefully. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll need a soft cloth, a bit of vegetable oil and a scraper. Apply the vegetable oil onto a cloth, not too much, and dab this onto the **spray**-**paint**ed area. Coat well, but don’t let the oil run all over. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can often get away with using a 70% isopropyl alcohol or acetone on some card or a cotton bud though. In some cases, we would actually recommend that you try to water down the isopropyl or acetone prior to using it though. This will make the **paint** removal process slower but reduce the chances of damaging your plastic models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Acetone will help you remove dried **spray** **paint** from wood. This is especially true if the **paint** has an oil-based base. Use this method on bare or unfinished wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
