## 108 Things You Should Know About Best Home Use Wood Chipper | best rated home wood chippers
-   It can shred branches up to 1½ inches thick with minimal effort and has a no-load speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute (RPM). It has a safety hopper with a locking knob, which will make the motor inoperable when opened — an outstanding feature for homes with curious kids. Its large wheels for transport and 2-year warranty are the icing on the very affordable cake. This is truly one of the best **wood** **chipper** shredders for the money. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We’ve looked at 5 of the best electric **wood** **chipper**s on the market. Some of them are more suited for heavy-duty jobs, while others can handle small leaves and twigs better. Hopefully, these reviews have helped you in your quest to find the perfect tool for your backyard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is where a **wood** **chipper**/shredder comes in. It can reduce your yard waste down to a fraction of its original size. Imagine taking all your leaves, brush, sticks, twigs, decorative grasses, branches, etc. and turning it into mulch or compost. You could use the compost in your garden or lay mulch in your flowerbeds or you could just make it all fit in the yard waste container better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the filter is clogged, if the air is too cold, or even if the unit is faulty in its combustion mix, it will not fire. Pull the crank rope all you wish; you will just give yourself a sore arm. The best recourse is to install a push-button starter, but the same rules apply. Environments must be perfect for these to start correctly. Still, it is the better choice for **chipper** shredders, generally speaking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're looking to buy a petrol **chipper**/garden shredder online, then you've come to the right place. Our range offers something for everyone, for gardens of all sizes, from the 7HP **chipper** mulcher all the way up to the 15HP Beaver **chipper** . These petrol models enable you to work in areas where access to mains power is restricted, so you can tow the machine when moving between locations in the grounds of your garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The hopper size determines how many branches you can safely feed into a machine at one time. The larger the hopper is, the quicker you can get through large piles of branches. Like with diameter, gas-powered models tend to have larger hoppers than electric **wood** **chipper**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even the best **wood** **chipper** shredder tools can eject materials backward, which may result in safety hazards for the person operating the machine. To prevent this from happening, users should wear protective gear, including safety glasses and helmets. Furthermore, it is recommended to wear safety boots in case they drop a larger piece of **wood** on their feet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a powerful **chipper** with a 15-amp motor. It could shred branches up to 1.75 inches thick. Imagine what it can do with leaves and other fine organic debris. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To get the most efficient use out of your **wood** **chipper**, you need the ability to move it to wherever you are, cutting down the majority of the branches. This means portability should be a priority. Various factors should be looked at when considering how easily portable a particular **wood** **chipper** is, including the type and size of the wheels, the handles and the overall weight and size of the machine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike other gas-powered **chipper**s, it does not produce an unbearably loud sound. It runs on 87+ ethanol-free gasoline fuel and has a maximum capacity of 0. 7 gallons. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gas **chipper**/shredders are also much heavier. So even though you have the luxury of them not being tethered to an outlet, they can be a bear to move any great distance. Especially, if the terrain is rutted, boggy, or hilly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Electric **wood** **chipper**s are the better choice for most homeowners because they are smaller, more easily portable, more affordable, cleaner and quieter. They also require very little maintenance. They aren’t as powerful as gas models, though, and cannot process as thick of branches. You also can’t use them in locations where you don’t have access to a power outlet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Earthwise GS70015 15-Amp Garden Corded Electric Chipper, Collection Bin Powerful mulcher **wood** **chipper** with a 15-amp electric motor to shred branches up to 1.75" thick. Works best with dry/aged branches - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A heavy-duty **chipper**/Shredder that outshines your expectations is right here. Yes, you have heard it right. This land works **wood** **chipper**/Shredder tool is an ideal buy for all sorts of commercial purposes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Three of the most popular electric **chipper** shredders currently on the market include the Durostar Eco-Shredder ES1600, the Patriot Products CSV-2515, and the Sun Joe CJ601E. All three models have a 14-Amp motor and can be plugged into a standard 110-120V electrical outlet. They also have a set of wheels that allow for easier transportation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Electric motors are measured in amps. Typically, all-electric **chipper** shredders are around 15A. They start with a simple push of a button, they have no combustion, so there is no need for a filter or exhaust, and the lack of gas or oil makes them very green-friendly across the board. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The product has some kick back. When you feed it really dry and small **wood** like twigs and the like, chances are it will be thrown back at your face. Make sure you wear protection when you are operating this **chipper**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Again electric-powered **wood** **chipper**s are less powerful and their range is from 14amps to 15amps. While gas-powered ones range from 4 horsepower to 10 horsepower. It all depends on the size of your property so pick one according to your needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the other hand, the side-mounted chutes allow owners to insert larger branches directly onto the chipping blades. The **wood** is therefore immediately processed, without having to go through flails located on the top of the machine. The length and width of the chute determine the dimensions of the branches that the machine can process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some gardeners don’t just want to get rid of the waste. On the contrary, they want to recycle it and find good use for it in their gardens. The best electric **wood** **chipper** models can break up organic waste into smaller pieces, thus allowing gardeners to create compost in a quick and easy way and treat old soil to increase its fertility. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Chipper Joe is a capable electric **chipper**/shredder that is very affordable yet outperforms some that cost much more. The 14-amp motor reaches up to 4300 RPM allowing it to shred most any yard waste and chip limbs and branches up to a maximum of 1.5 inches in diameter. It’s reduction ratio is a very respectable 16 to 1. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since the machine produces considerable noise, wearing some form of ear protection is highly recommended. Finally, users should always wear tight-fitting clothes and remove any jewelry before turning the machine on. This is because loose clothes might accidentally get caught in the machine, even when operating the best electric **wood** **chipper** out there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gas **chipper**s are known for their tremendous ability to break down thick branches. At the same time, electric **chipper**s are unparalleled in terms of the convenience that these bring. These are quieter and do not require maintenance of any sort. Unlike gas-powered **wood** **chipper**s, these do not even emit fumes at all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can easily shred **wood** up to 0.5 inches thick and chip branches maximum of 3 inches in diameter. On attaching the vacuum kit and tow bar kit, you may even use it for mulching. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With a corded power supply and a 15 amp motor, this **chipper** is designed for easy use. Simply plug it in and start chipping away at those pesky branches and leaves. The large hopper opening makes it easy to feed in material, and the **chipper** blades make quick work of branches up to 1.75" in diameter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Budget constraints are sometimes a blessing in disguise. Especially when it is about choosing a competitive tool. The right tactic to avail of its advantage is to specify a reasonable price bracket first. The next step is certainly to look for a **wood** **chipper** that falls into that price range. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All processed material will discharge out the side of the machine into the... Price & Details Best of the best. If you want an electric **wood** **chipper** that runs quietly and smoothly, but don’t want to sacrifice chipping power or build quality, then the CSV-2515 is the machine for you. It will be heavier and pricier than most electric models, but this is hands down the best electric **wood** **chipper** and leaf shredder. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pruning trees and shrubs is all great fun, until you look at the pile of branches. Take care of them with an electric **wood** **chipper** shredder. These machines reduce the branches to useful **wood** chips that can be used for composting and a range of other purposes. We reviewed the five best electric **wood** **chipper**s right here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is no point in making the investment in a monster like the Patriot Products CSV-3100B if you have a small lot with no trees and little landscaping. Similarly, the Chipper Joe isn’t going to handle the demands of a **wood**ed acreage. It’s important to not only get the best tool you can afford, but the right tool for the job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Roller shredders, on the other hand, are pricier, heavier (ensure you can handle the weight and adjust the gap between the plate and the roller) but a lot quieter. The ridged roller with a vertical rotating wheel against a flat plate crushes bigger **wood**y pieces of waste by drawing the material in and can do a lot of it in no time. One disadvantage is that they do get blocked by loose pieces that seem to creep in from time to time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A commercial-grade **chipper** is a machine that in essence is used to continuously provide service on a constant basis, so every component is outfitted to perform throughout the different weather conditions, and is designed to receive a good amount of wear and prolonged maintenance intervals. These units are sought after by tree care companies, municipalities, and such. Our commercial-grade **chipper**s lineup comprises the 4521 and the 6525 models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The CSV-2515 has a large 14” x 16” hopper. This makes dumping armfuls of leaves and brush easier and you’ll be hard pressed to jam the CSV-2515. It’s somewhat heavy at 96 lbs but with its large wheels you’ll still be able to move it well enough. By all accounts the CSV-2515 is the top performing electric **chipper**/shredder available. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Picking the right **wood** **chipper** shredder will always come down to the features, and those features will be championed by the people who use them the most. The model with all the features we loved was the Landworks Wood Chipper Shredder. It had plenty of muscle for the job, had the vacuum attachment standard, and had plenty of extra perks to send it over the top. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When looking for the best **wood** **chipper** shredder, customers can choose between an electric model and a gas-powered one. While the gas models tend to be more powerful, they might not be the best solution for gardening enthusiasts who don’t really need a machine with such strength. Plus, with the additional expense of gas, they are certainly not the most economical solution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a brand that certainly knows what a homeowner needs. When you have a **chipper** shredder, it is a given that you will be working with twigs, branches and possibly tree limbs. A flimsy collection bag just won’t do. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best Chainsaw On A Budget If you need to cut down trees or cut up fire**wood**, then a pole saw is not the best option. A Chainsaw is better for these tasks. Check out my review of the best chainsaws under $300 here: Best Chainsaw Reviews - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The motors power a system of blades that have the sole purpose of shredding, chipping, and in no uncertain terms, eating any **wood** that comes in their gaping teeth. Typically, there are either one or two blades, but some units use more. The other possibility is a roller, but they are less efficient and bog down much easier than the bladed models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s not without its issues though and they are relatively minor. For one, the reduction ratio is just 8:1. That’s not as high as I would expect for its high price but maybe that’s the secret to getting an electric **chipper**/shredder to compete with the speed of gas ones. As an electric, it’s tied to an extension cord and for the CSV-2515 you’re going to need a 10-gauge one to get the most out of it. The manufacturer also stresses a maximum length of 100 ft on the extension cord and recommends nothing else be running on the same circuit as the CSV-2515. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The shredder is typically a separate apparatus from the **chipper**. Plant material is loaded via a hopper which ends in a chute. Below this chute, the shredder rapidly spins a series of flails, J-hammers, Y-hammers, or tri-tip hammers that rip, shred, and pulverize things like leaves, small diameter branches, and bark into a fine mulch then removes it using the discharge chute. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Tazz K32 **chipper**/shredder is an intersection of a fantastic product being found at a modest price. When compared to similarly priced gas **chipper**/shredders it leads in performance. When compared by performance, it’s a wonder they don’t charge double for it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **chipper** is definitely an easy answer to come to when you think about the alternatives to getting rid of the untamed and ugly sight of that huge pile of dead branches sitting across your backyard. However, which **chipper** you will need depends on a variety of factors that you have to take into account. Before letting you in into the most common features you need to consider before committing to purchase a **chipper**, we believe it is important to first understand how a **chipper** works. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Different types of **wood** **chipper** shredders use different mechanisms to achieve optimum results. The majority of the electric **wood** **chipper** shredders use the fairly simple disk design. This is because they are highly adaptable and can tackle a variety of organic materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are more benefits to using the best electric **wood** **chipper** shredders over gasoline-powered ones. They are designed to take up less space, which makes them ideal for home use. Furthermore, their size and weight makes it much easier to move them from one place in the garden to another. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Picking a **wood** **chipper** shredder is somewhat more complicated than other landscaping tools because of the various features that combine to make a quality model. First and foremost is the power source. Chipper shredders can be either electric with a motor or gas-powered with an engine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When choosing your **wood** **chipper** shredder, a few factors make a difference, but they all dictate the machine’s efficiency. If it doesn’t do its job and do it in a timely fashion, it isn’t worth having. Not many people enjoy landscaping, but a high-quality **chipper** shredder can undoubtedly speed up the work and give you back your day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **chipper**/shredder is a niche tool you might end up finding more useful than you anticipated. It’s also a tool that requires quite a bit of money as well as floorspace for storage. For these reasons, it’s very important to consider what kind of property you have and how you intend to use your **chipper**/shredder. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is evident just from looking at it that this is a monolith of a **chipper**/shredder and that Powerhorse is the right name for it. See the tow point on the back, just above the 13-inch tires that are perfect for rolling over every conceivable terrain. And it is designed with an eye on balance with a low center of gravity for improved stability. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An electric **chipper**/shredder is probably going to be sufficient for the majority of homeowners but they have limitations. The most obvious one being a need for electricity. This means you’ll be restricted as to how far from an outlet you can venture and also means you’ll need a long 10 to 12-gauge extension cord. If you don’t have one laying around already, that’s another expense to be figured in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, if you are able to invest more money into a unit that not only can deliver what is promised but is a unit that will last a long time, then you might as well consider a professional **chipper**. A professional **chipper** is generally fitted with premium engines, heavier steel gauges, and more robust and quality components such as tool steel blades that in general, will make the **chipper** perform as expected throughout the years. The Yardbeast 2510, 3514, and 2090 are professional-grade **chipper**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The roller feature is seen as an ineffective way to chip the **wood** or even dissolve dead leaves. It seems it just spits everything out roughly the same as it went in. Users reported that this complaint, as well as others, were not met with any real support from the company’s service team. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In choosing the best electric **wood** **chipper** for home use, their other individual features were considered. At 16:1, the Sun Joe model has the highest reduction ratio of the three. The Durostar comes with a still sizable 10:1 ratio, whereas the Patriot Products one has a surprisingly small 8:1 reduction ratio. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Chippers powered by internal combustion engines are the most common type of **chipper**s and range from 1 inch up to whole tree **chipper**s (in excess of 2 feet in diameter). Gas engines are more common in residential and commercial applications up to 37HP. Higher than that and diesel power sources will be more common than gas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The weight of the wheel affects how powerful the machine is. As a rule, heavier wheels will result in more cutting power. Similarly, **wood** **chipper** shredders with a lighter wheel won’t be as powerful as those with a heavier one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But an electric **chipper**/shredder typically comes at a fraction of the cost of a gas one and it’s just simpler. Simpler to use, simpler to maintain. Starting an electric **chipper**/shredder is as easy as flipping a switch. They’re lighter and easier to move around the yard. Generally, they are smaller and require less of a footprint of your cherished garage or shed floorspace and you won’t need to change the oil, fill it with gas, or take it in for tune-ups. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The ultimate goal of having a **chipper**/shredder is to make your yard waste more manageable and the reduction ratio gives a glimpse as to how well a **chipper**/shredder performs this job. Reduction ratio is the extent to which a **chipper**/shredder will reduce the plant matter fed to the machine. For example, a reduction ratio of 10:1 means the **chipper**/shredder can take what would be 10 bags of unprocessed material and turn it into 1 bag. 20:1 means it will turn 20 bags into 1. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remember, you’ll need to connect it to a power outlet and it won’t have the power of a gas-powered unit. However, this type of **chipper** is portable, easy to store and pretty quiet, which means there will be no complaints from the neighbors. Without further ado, let’s have a look at 5 of the best electric **wood** **chipper**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A. Like all blades, **wood** **chipper** blades also get dull from use. Most manufacturers recommend resharpening the blades after every six to eight hours of use. While this might not sound like a lot, the actual cutting process of a **wood** **chipper** is very short, so six to eight hours of use is often more than a year or two for the average user. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most common types of powered **chipper**s are either through internal combustion engines (gas or Diesel) or electric-powered. Electric powered **chipper**s are normally small **chipper**s with a chipping capacity up to 1.5 inches approximately that are powered through the standard rated power capacity for home use. Normally, these electric **chipper**s are 110V and can handle an amp rating up to 14A (please consult with a certified electrician before connecting such a machine to your house outlet). Some industrial **chipper**s are electrically powered when operated indoors for industrial purposes and usually have big engines (30+ electric horsepower). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   They allow owners to clean up their gardens with ease and reuse organic waste for composting and mulching purposes. Electric **wood** **chipper** shredders are more portable and less noisy than the gasoline-powered models. On top of that, they don’t produce any gases or fumes that can harm the environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In order to perform well, many of the best electric **wood** **chipper** shredders work at very high speeds. As such, some materials may discharge backward in the process, especially if the machine is overloaded. Because of this, it is better to divide garden waste into several smaller loads than attempt to jam it all in at once. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   SAFETY HOPPER: Locking knob prevents the... Price & Details For lighter electric **chipper**s, both in price and in operation, the Sun Joe is one of the best offers you can find. It handles branches of regular sizes very well and is easy to operate in a safe manner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While most **chipper** shredders are pretty pricey, we chose the Sun Joe CJ602E Electric Wood Chipper Shredder for its value and its style. Yes, it is an electric model, so that it will lack a little of the punch of its gas-powered competitors. But it will start in the cold, every time, and its motor will make those shredder blades do their job with speed and intensity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When considering the capacity of a **wood** **chipper**, you need to look at two factors: the hopper size and the maximum diameter of branches it can accept. Most electric **wood** **chipper**s can accept branches between 1.5 and 2 inches in diameter. Gas models may accept branches up to 3 inches in diameter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It can handle branches up to 2.5 inches in diameter, almost twice the size of other electric **chipper**s. Bellow this size, it shreds pretty much all types of branches and leaves, provided you properly feed it. You can also attach the included collection bag to it to make debris disposal easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should also make sure that a **chipper** is easily portable, whether you’re hauling it with compact pickup truck, utility vehicle, small tractor … or by hand. In pretty much all instances, you’re going to want to be able to take the **chipper** to the **wood**, not haul the **wood** to the **chipper**. This will help immensely with any cleanup, landscaping, or site development work you’re doing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As their names suggest, they are intended to handle different types of organic materials. While **wood** **chipper**s are used to cut up **wood**, leaf mulchers are used to do the same for leaves. Which of these two one goes for will depend on the type of landscape they have to maintain and the materials they need to dispose of. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The biggest barrier to purchasing a **wood** **chipper** for most people is the associated cost. You’ll be happy to know, though, that there are plenty of cheap **wood** **chipper**s that don’t dig too deeply into your wallet. The Sun Joe CJ603E is one such model. It can quickly handle branches up to 1.7 inches in diameter and comes with a collection bag that makes it easy to keep all the waste contained. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I would not recommend making your own electric **wood** **chipper**. These machines rely on a lot of shredding power, and with improper use, they can seriously harm you. Always buy certified machines and wear proper PPE whilst using **wood** **chipper**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wood **chipper**s are very useful tools, but they can also be very dangerous if not used with proper care and caution. Before using any **wood** **chipper**, carefully read the entire instruction manual to ensure you know how to operate the machine and what to do if you encounter any jams. Always wear safety glasses when using a **wood** **chipper**, and it is a good idea also to consider wearing gloves, ear protection and a face shield. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gone are the days when you had to deal with traditional **chipper**s. EarthQuake Wood **chipper** has a design of a new era. Its compact body has robust wheels that make it easy to transport. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Patriot CSV-2515 is easily one of the most heavy duty electric **wood** **chipper**s out there. In fact, it is so powerful that it can even compete with some gas **chipper**s. However, this means that it is also noisier and heavier than most electric models. It feels very solid, but at 95 pounds, it is quite a bulky machine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sun Joe CJ601E does not handle leaves and small branches so well, as these tend to go through the blades almost without being cut. However, for dry larger branches, about 1 inch in diameter, it boasts one of the best performances we found in an electric unit. It can even reduce pieces of **wood** to 1/16th of their original size. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Again it is a Patriot, but this time it is the CSV3100B. The 10hp engine is commercial size and deals with even the hardest of **wood** effortlessly. It is a beast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My land is bordered by a lot of **wood**ed areas — which my livestock seem to prefer when compared with the pastures. But having so many **wood**s means that I love to talk about taking care of trees that need some TLC, as well as cleaning up branches and other dead**wood**. So we’ve written about things like axes and log splitters in the past, and for good reason: Almost all of our winter heat is supplied by fire**wood**. But to help take care of the land, we also appreciate a good **wood** **chipper**, and the mulch that it produces is perfect for weed suppression and erosion control in some of our most threatened areas. The best **wood** **chipper** for our situation is vital. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Getting rid of yard waste without the proper equipment can be very difficult. If not taken care of every so often, the waste will pile up, turning even the most beautiful garden into an unsightly mess. The best electric **wood** **chipper** shredders are designed to handle this problem in an efficient and convenient way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The consensus on this item is excellent, but a few buyers have had trouble with their engines. They found it stalled after limited use, and the instructions lacked certain specifics, like the quantity of oil to put into the oil tank. Overall, we think this is the best **chipper** shredder you can buy this year. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A garden shredder is a clever piece of machinery, usually housed in a shed, that converts bulky waste into shreds and **wood**chip in an effortless manner. Some have a blade mechanism to slice twigs and branches, others (more robust ones) use a ridge roller to pull through the waste and crush it. But we'll go into this in more detail later. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This compact Sun Joe **wood** **chipper** comes with a 14-amp motor and a pair of 6-inch wheels that allow you to carry it around effortlessly. In fact, you’ll have no portability issues, since it only weighs about 26 pounds. On the downside, it is a bit noisier than other small electric **chipper**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wood **chipper**s get rid of that hassle. They cut branches down to a fraction of their original size, which means you get a lot more into a yard waste bin without any wasted space. You can also use the cut-up pieces of **wood** as decorative mulch for your garden beds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The reduction ratio refers to how small the material will be after passing through your **chipper** compared to its original size. For example, a 12 to one reduction ratio will reduce yard waste to one-twelfth its original size.

-   Well, if you have a small one then you most probably need an electric-powered **wood** **chipper**. This kind is quiet, light but they are 100% able to clean the mess.

-   The main goal of a **chipper** is to reduce in size the **wood**en material that is being fed. The way this happens is the branch once it enters the feeding chute, is met by a single or a set of rotating blades that impact the branch against an anvil or a counter knife, exerting a scissor-type cutting force and shaving off a piece of the **wood** on every turn. Sometimes this blade is accompanied by a set of hammers or flails positioned across the length of the shaft that reduces the material being cut by the blade or some other material that is being fed through another chute (called the shredding chute). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At first blush, the Earthwise GS70015 doesn’t look like your garden variety **wood** **chipper** shredder. But flip on the power switch, drop a few branches in, and see what this exciting unit can do. The people at Earthwise wanted to design an efficient **chipper**, and they knocked it out of the park with this model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As the motor or engine’s ripple effect carries to the shredder **chipper** blades, this creates the dynamic of the size of branches and quantity of leaves that can be handled in short succession. As you can see, everything stems from the power source. Everything works in concert, and nothing can function without a heavy-duty motor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Usually ranging from 10:1 to 20:1, this number details the machine’s ability to cut large chunks of material into smaller pieces. For example, a **chipper** shredder with a 20:1 ratio can turn one large branch into 20 small-sized pieces. This means that each chunk will be just 5 percent the size of the original piece of **wood**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Gas-powered **chipper**/shredders are much more brutish. They’re dirty, greasy, and noisy ogres capable of chewing up and spitting out thick branches as easily as they munch up leaves and twigs. Gas-powered **chipper**/shredders are easily the most expensive versions but they are capable of tearing even the ugliest pile of waste to, well, shreds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Wood **chipper**s come in both gas and electric models, each offering its own set of pros and cons. If you need the ability to process a lot of branches quickly, gas models are the way to go. They tend to have larger hoppers, produce more cuts per minute and can handle larger diameter branches. The cons are that they are large, heavy, loud and expensive. They also require regular maintenance and release carbon monoxide into the air, which is bad for the environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   They are easy to access when maintaining or cleaning the cutting area, and their power makes short work of most **wood** sent to them via the chute. The ease of accessing the blades has one drawback, and that is safety. It is not difficult to open the blade port on some models while the machine is running, which is a tremendous safety hazard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally, electric **wood** **chipper**s can cut branches up to 1.5 inches in diameter. On the other hand, gas-powered models can handle branches of up to 4 inches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Commercial **wood** **chipper**s are sometimes difficult to handle. There is a high risk of getting caught in the machine while inserting the limbs and branches into it. The only solution to avoid it is to stay focused on what you are doing and handle it wisely. Domestic **wood** **chipper**s are relatively safe to use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
