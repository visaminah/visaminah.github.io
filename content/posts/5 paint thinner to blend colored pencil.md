Turpenoid does have a slight odor associated with it and some may be sensitive to this. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

The tip of the marker acts as a brush to move the dissolved pigment. This results in smoother transitions of color and blending. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

By applying additional applications of wax over the colored **pencil** applications, blending occurs. The colorless blender allows the artist to have a bit more control and since the **pencil** can be sharpened to a point, a bit more precision as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

The tip of this marker is less flexible and fairly small. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
