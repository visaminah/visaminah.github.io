## 6 Tips for Do I Need A Jointer And Planer | Wood Planer Machine
-   This is why if you’re a serious woodworker, you’ll need both a **jointer** and a Planer. However, you don’t have to break the bank to do so. What a Planer Can't Do for You If you are trying to use your Planer as a **jointer**, you will find that this feat is virtually impossible. Planers just aren't capable of doing everything that **jointer**s can do. This is especially true when it comes to the edges of the board you are working with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The variable 6,000 to 11,000 RPM speed lets you select the right hardness and size for the wood being cut, and the center fence gives you much needed support throughout the cut for accurate edge jointing. Take Shakespeare’s advice and get the PORTER-CABLE PC160JT **jointer**. Of course, you’re going to need a good Planer to keep the **jointer** company. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   DeWalt is an excellent company with a great reputation --with good reason. They consistently provide top-quality power tools, and their **planer**s are no different. The DW735X has a powerful 15 AMP and 20,000 RPM motor, with a 10,000 RPM cutter head speed, allowing you to handle larger cuts on wider materials easily. The three-knife cutter head delivers a 30% longer life-span on your knife. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, if you’re a normal DIYer, you may not need to get these tools. You’ll probably buy the lumber you need as-is from hardware stores and probably not alter the boards too badly. But if you’re a perfectionist or a craftsman and want to have greater control over the lumber you use, you’ll need a **jointer** and **planer**. But what the hell do **planer**s and **jointer**s do? And why should you get one? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As Shakespeare once said, “Though she be but little, she is fierce.” Well, the same goes for this little **jointer**. Though it’s little, it’s two knife cutter head with jackscrew leveling allows you to easily stabilize a piece of wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For example, the JET JJP-12 12-Inch Jointer Planer is an excellent, sturdy 2-in-1 machine. One side has the **jointer**; the other side has the Planer. You can easily sculpt wood anyway you want it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
