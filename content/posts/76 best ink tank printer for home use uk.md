## 76 Facts Best Ink Tank Printer For Home Use Uk | Epson Et-2800
-   These wireless **printer** features are impressive, with copy, scan, and fax capabilities and an automatic document feeder. The unit has a large 225-sheet input tray and a 60-sheet output tray for its compact size. Its 500 MHz processor is responsive to print requests and can reach speeds of 30 ppm when printing in monochrome draft mode, which is comparable to laser **printer**s designed for speed. Compare this to the best laser **printer** on the market today. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   8. Epson Expression Photo XP-970 It’s not quite the full nine yards, but it comes pretty close Specifications Print resolution: 5760 x 1440 dpi Print speed (6x4; std quality): 26 seconds Interfaces: USB 2.0, Wi-Fi, BT Scanner: Yes Dimensions: 479 x 356 x 148 mm Weight: 8.7kg Today's Best Deals View at Dell (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Newegg (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Vibrant A3 glossy photo output + Individually replaceable **ink** cartridges + Built-in scanner Reasons to avoid - Even ‘XL’ **ink** cartridges lack capacity - Lacks colour range of most rivals - Maximum output size smaller than A3+ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   WHY WE LIKE IT: With only a 17.3 x 13.8” footprint, the Canon PIXMA TR8520 delivers outstanding print quality and efficiency in a sleek, compact package, with the capability to integrate with XXL **ink** cartridges. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   04. Canon PIXMA PRO-200 The best art **printer** for A3+ Specifications Maximum paper size: A3+ Print resolution: 4800 x 2400 dpi Interface: USB, Ethernet, Wi-Fi Size: 63.9 x 37.9 x 20cm Weight: 14.1 kg Today's Best Deals View at John Lewis (opens in new tab) View at Wex Photo Video (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Print larger than A3 + Print on range of media Reasons to avoid - Small **ink** cartridges - Dye-based **ink**s - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the past, laser printing was the only option available- but **ink**jet **printer**s have been covering a lot of ground over the past few years and they’re now generally considered to be a more cost-effective option than lasers. But **ink**jets can be more temperamental; the **ink** can get blocked unless you flush them regularly, but of course if you have nothing to print then flushing will waste your precious **ink**. If you’re not an everyday printing pro, you’re probably better off with a laser model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nobody wants to give up 50% of their desk to a **printer**. Not even us. Canon's versatile all in one has the smallest footprint a decent **printer** could realistically muster, and crams a huge number fo features into that space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Laser **printer**s are more high-tech; they work by negatively charging a light-sensitive surface called an optical photoconductor (OPC) drum. The laser then draws an image onto the surface of the drum and negatively charged toner is released onto the surface of the drum. This process needs to take place on all four colour drums – for cyan, magenta, yellow and black – to make up the final colour image. The paper is then heated to melt the toner onto the page itself, and voila- you have your finished result. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s also a reason that Canon has branded the tanks as MegaTanks, as you can print up to an astounding 6,600 black print pages and 7,700 color print pages per tank. The **printer** initially comes with four **ink** bottles with specialized nozzles that make it easy to fill the tanks without spilling. This **printer** is designed for high-volume printing without having to constantly replace **ink** and maintains one of the lowest running costs of any **printer**. The large 350-sheet paper feeding tray is also great for that purpose. Another option is the best large format **printer** that features two 250-sheet high-capacity paper feeding trays as well as a rear input tray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're sick of the time, inconvenience, and considerable expense of having to replace your **printer**'s **ink** cartridges, then Canon might just have a solution with its latest Pixma Megatank **printer**. It's a cartridge-free **printer**, which uses refillable bottles for its **ink**, and unlike other models, actually comes with a full set of 60ml **ink** supplies. Refills are also cheaper than XXL cartridges, meaning the **printer** represents a long-term saving. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best way to avoid this? Look at the pages per month or the duty cycle figure. As we mentioned above, it’s a good indicator of how much your **printer** can handle without being overtaxed. Printer mechanics can be temperamental sometimes, even with the most reputable brands and manufacturers; so be sure you know how much your **printer** can handle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Printers come in many shapes and sizes, from pocket photo **printer**s to large-format professional models. We check the suitability for wide-ranging tasks from printing office documents to high-end photographic output and, consequently, the type and quantity of dye/pigment **ink**s. Additional features can include a built-in scanner, a standalone control panel, a touchscreen interface, Wi-Fi connectivity, direct fax functions, and a card reader slot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What paper is best for printing art? First you will ideally be using Fine Art Paper, which will be called Giclee Printing, Rag Paper, Cotton Paper and so forth (but some will be trial and error and check your **printer**'s depth of paper restrictions). With a good art **printer** this paper will work. One tip, always print as matt as a glossy print can hide any paint strokes and leave detail looking flat. Matt prints offer the same impression as a real watercolour or oil canvas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To help you out, I've gathered together the best art **printer**s for home and studio use today. These cover a range of budgets, and include everything from premium machines to cheaper models and even a fun portable **printer** for immediate results. If you need to compare or need a **printer** for other uses, then read our guides to the best **printer**s for photos and the best black and white **printer**s. Also, scroll down for an FAQ on all you need to know when considering buying one of the best art **printer**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   More and more, our homes run on WiFi connectivity, and your **printer** should be no different. Why? With a Bluetooth or wireless **printer**, you can have photo prints, documents, labels and more ready to go without fussing with cords. It also means that every computer in your house can be synced with your **printer** at any given moment. While a hard-wired option is still handy, we recommend checking if your new **printer** is compatible with WiFi. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The title of best photo **printer** is essentially a dogfight between two names: Canon and Epson. While there are other manufacturers in the portable **printer** space, these two are really the only game in town when it comes to desktop **printer**s for photos of top quality. If you're looking to frame, mount or display your photos, this is where you want to be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, all this wouldn't mean much if the prints didn't look any good. Fortunately, the Canon PIXMA G650 MegaTank (G620 in the US) puts out images of great quality, with good color rendition and tonal range. It makes the most of its six-**ink** setup, and can put out high volumes of prints: a full tank-load can produce up to 3,800 6x4-inch photos, 3,700 mono documents, or 8,000 color documents. It's not the fastest **printer**, but it is extremely efficient. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **printer**’s HP Thermal Inkjet print technology delivers impressive color printouts up to 600 x 1200 dpi resolution. The printhead utilizes four cartridges, one black, and the rest color. It’s especially efficient if you print a lot in color when you opt for HP’s Instant Ink subscription. The program delivers **ink** automatically as needed based on your usage and results in lower running costs for color printing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   10. Canon SELPHY CP1300 The best art **printer** for mobility Specifications Maximum paper size: 4x6 inches (postcard size) Resolution: 300 x 300 dpi Interface: Wi-Fi via App, SD, USB Size: ‎13.59 x 6.33 x 18.06 cm Weight: 860g Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at John Lewis (opens in new tab) View at Canon (UK) (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Tiny and portable **printer** + Print from iPad and tablets + Dye-sublimation tech for quality prints Reasons to avoid - Too small to be a main **printer** - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The option to use Canon’s XXL cartridges allows you to replace your cartridges less often and keep your running costs lower. You can also opt for Canon’s auto-replenishment service that monitors your **ink** levels and usage, and automatically delivers **ink** only when needed. You can also control your print settings and monitor your **ink** usage from the large, intuitive 4.3” LCD touchscreen on the front of the unit. Compare this to the best **printer** for heat transfers, which features six **ink** cartridges that produce unparalleled color quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Windows and Mac compatible: Yes Striking a good balance between affordability and features, the HP Plus DeskJet 2710e is a stellar option for a reliable and reasonably cheap work-from-home **printer** with a built-in scanner. You also get six months Instant Ink bundled in when you opt in to HP+ during setup, so the value for money is exceptional with this model. The A4 print speed is around 7.5ppm (pages per minute) and it offers up to 1200 x 1200dpi print resolution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For best results, you'll want an art **printer** capable of better colour reproduction and clarity than the average office **printer**. Ideally, it will use pigment-based **ink**s, because dye-based **ink**s don't look as good. You'll also want the option of printing in larger formats, and on heavier, fine art media. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Traditional cartridge **printer**s are not ideal for occasional printing. The **ink** in the cartridges can dry up rendering the cartridge useless. In such cases, you have to replace the entire cartridge which is an expensive thing to do. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Connecting to this **printer** is a breeze, whether you do it through Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Direct, Apple AirPrint, Mopria, or the HP Smart App. Setup is easy enough to print up to 32 ppm within minutes, which is pretty fast. You can also use voice-activated commands through Alexa or Google Assistant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What do I need to achieve art prints at home? Aside from one of the best art **printer**s on my list, I'd also suggest you need a couple of things. First, either a separate flatbed scanner or an art **printer** with a built-in scanner; you will also need a good DSLR camera and computer or tablet. Take a look at our guides to the best photo scanners and the best cameras for artists for more choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   From there, we examined **printer** efficiency, **ink** monitoring, and **ink** controls. This was a process of looking at a **printer**’s **ink** monitoring features and how easy they are to access and use. We also considered how much manual control the **printer** gives you over **ink** usage. We only included **printer**s that offered easy monitoring, as that gives you more control of a **printer**’s running cost. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **printer** was designed to produce stunning, vibrant colors, especially in photos. Of the six **ink** tanks used, one is a specialized blue photo **ink** cartridge that achieves a depth and range of color that other **printer**s can’t. Ink is applied by an advanced print head using a total of 6,656 nozzles. This is a fantastic photo **printer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To find the best **ink**-efficient **printer**, we researched over 20 different **ink**jet color **printer**s for four days. We examined the **ink** systems of each **printer** in detail, including the type of **ink** it used, the print head technology, processing speed, and efficiency over time. We narrowed it down to the ones with the lowest running costs and longest-lasting **ink**. This is it if you have been looking for a guide to the best **printer**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   06. Epson Expression Photo HD XP-15000 The best all-rounder for occasional art prints Specifications Maximum paper size: A3+ Print resolution: 5760 x 1440 dpi Interface: Ethernet, Wi-Fi Size: 47.9 x 37 x 15.9cm Weight: 8.5kg Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Wex Photo Video (opens in new tab) View at Scan (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Good price + Low running costs + Pay-as-you-go **ink**s Reasons to avoid - Dye-based **ink**s - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a relatively speedy **printer**, too. It goes up to A3+ and even larger; it'll also do panoramic prints up to 990cm wide. It delivers lovely sharp prints that are dry almost straight away. And it's versatile; working with set of eight **ink**s, it's capable of printing on anything from standard paper to heavier fine art media. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although, **ink** tank **printer**s are a bit more expensive to purchase, you save big on the cost of printing since the refill **ink** bottles are inexpensive. Ink tank **printer**s have an inbuilt mechanism of supplying continuous **ink**, which helps lower the cost of printing. Filling up the tanks with **ink** is really simple too. Most models have the tanks built outside the **printer**’s chassis. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Very broadly, pigment **ink**s last longer without fading, but dye **ink**s tend to give richer, denser colors and s**ink** deeper into the paper surface. They're both '**ink**s', but they have different pros and cons, and **printer** makers will choose one or the other (or combine them) according to what the **printer**'s designed for. The best photo **printer** doesn't necessarily use one or the other – it's up to you how you want to balance immediate print quality against long-term stability. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What makes the Brother INKvestment MFC-J985DW our top pick is its outstanding running cost achieved by its super-efficient, high-capacity **ink** cartridges. Even better, though, the unit also has a low cost of entry, making it a very cost-efficient option for printing. The **printer** comes with four high-yield cartridges included. You can print up to 2,400 pages from the black cartridge and 1,200 pages from each of the color cartridges. In this case, having three separate color cartridges is super efficient, as you can replace them as needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For the price – sub $200 / £200 – the Epson Expression Photo XP-970 represents excellent value for money. It can print up to A3, features scan and copy functions and comes with an excellent app to control all of your prints and **ink** orders. As well as standard paper formats it features a rear tray for special or heavier paper stock. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So it's best to th**ink** about exactly what you need. The key factors to consider are the size of photos you want to print, and the type of **ink** you want to use. If this all seems a little overwhelming, you can scroll to the bottom of this page for our top tips on how to choose a photo **printer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In identifying the most **ink**-efficient **printer**s, we looked at several aspects of the **printer**, the first being the **ink**. All **ink** cartridges are labeled with an estimated page yield under normal use. We looked at the standard yield for the standard cartridge of each **printer**. We then took the cartridge’s price and made a price comparison based on the cost per page (calculated by the cost of a cartridge divided by that cartridge’s page yield). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The print results speak for themselves – photos and art prints are deep and colours rich and vibrant, as this **printer** uses an UltraChrome 10 **ink** system to deliver a vast array of tones – these **ink**s are: Cyan, Light Cyan, Vivid Magenta, Vivid Light Magenta, Yellow, Gray, Light Gray, Violet, Photo Black, and Matte Black. (This does make the Epson SureColor SC-P900 a little more expensive to run than some on this list.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also easily monitor **ink** levels directly from the **printer**’s LCD screen. It indicates the levels of each of its four cartridges at all times on the screen. That provides users with great control of their **ink** consumption and, ultimately, very competitive running costs. Considering the **printer**’s lower initial cost, the Brother MFC-J805 is the most efficient and best-value **printer** for a home office. Compare this to the best **printer** for the home, which comes with a 35-sheet auto-loading feature and a clear, responsive touch screen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most models these days come with a built-in scanner. These models are called as all-in-one **printer**s so look for an **ink** jet variant. Memory card readers and support for connecting a camera directly to the **printer** are other enhanced features on more premium models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But, as a mobile **printer** the Canon Selphy CP1300 is a fun way to take your digital art on the go; it's also a great way to paint and collect references when out and about so digital plein air painters will love it. I'd suggest this is used in tandem with one of the larger home **printer**s on my list. (Take a look at our buying guide to the best portable **printer**s for more like this.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Inkjet **printer**s work by shooting out thousands of tiny dots across the entire page. These dots compose the image or text that you’re printing. The resolution of **ink**jet **printer**s is measured in dots per inch (dpi); the higher the dpi, the higher the resolution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best **ink**-efficient **printer** is the Brother INKvestment MFC-J985DW. This super-efficient **printer** yields thousands of pages from its high-capacity **ink** cartridges before needing to replace them. It also proved to be very reliable and still produces at a high level while being so cost-efficient. Keep reading about this, and our other top picks to learn more about the best **printer**s available for purchase. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Naturally, photo paper isn't cheap. Neither is the copious volumes of **ink** required to print on it. And while it takes a little while to get set up, switching modes and sources is quick and easy when you're up and running. You don't even need a PC or Mac to get it done - plug your phone or camera in, or insert an SD card, and you can print directly from there. This very well could be the best home **printer** for photos. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Combined prices for manufacturers’ own-brand **ink**s and high-quality papers generally average out to around £1.40 per Letter-size print, and up to £4.80 for a larger format 13-inch wide print. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The model recommended here is the ET-8550 which prints wide format 13" x 19 inch photos, though there is a slightly cheaper model, the ET-8500, which only prints 8.5 x 11 inch pictures. The ET-8550 supports A3 prints, too. If the price puts you off, consider the savings on **ink**, and this art **printer** also includes a built-in scanner and copier. I particularly like the compact design, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Windows and Mac compatible: Yes This budget-friendly Epson **printer** is your new best friend for working from home. It’s marginally slower than the HP **printer** above, with an A4 print speed of 8ppm; but it holds more paper and the 5760 x 1440dpi print resolution means the quality is slightly sharper, too. Reviewers mention it’s slightly tricker to connect this **printer** to Wi-Fi, so be aware of this if you’re considering purchasing for someone a little older or less tech-savvy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Traditional **ink**jet **printer**s use **ink** cartridges for printing. They print smooth and detailed text and images on all types of printing papers, glossy, matte, fabric and others. Most colour **printer**s come with one larger black cartridge along with three colour cartridges (cyan, magenta and yellow). These cartridges need to be replaced once they run out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Onboarding is a little mixed; the Epson SureColor SC-P900 is easily setup and comes with connectivity to Mac and PC, as well an on-**printer** LCD touchscreen to help you manage our prints. The only downside is the **ink** supplied with the **printer** won't last long. This is the only downside to a professional art **printer** that's actually nicely sized and suitable for home use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike traditional **ink** cartridge **printer**s, **ink** tank **printer**s have individual colour **ink** tanks. These tanks are capable of holding large capacity (70 ml in most **printer**s) of **ink**, which is great for printing jobs and never having to worry about running out of **ink**. One good thing about **ink** tank **printer**s is that there is little fear of **ink** drying up or wastage. You can fill the tank with **ink** based on your printing requirements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Windows and Mac compatible: Yes Ideal for small home offices which are short on space, this compact Canon **printer** has a small footprint that allows it to be stored neatly on your desk or **printer** stand. It’s ideal if you need to print a lot of images as it can be connected directly to a camera and it offers vivid, borderless prints up to 5x7cm. Despite its modest pricetag, this wireless **printer** packs some serious punch in terms of its connectivity options- smart home enthusiasts will appreciate this model. Read more: Step into the future with these top smart home devices - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The range you can achieve from this **printer** is pretty outstanding, as you can produce high-resolution color prints when quality is paramount or reach up to 20 ppm speed for higher volume printing jobs. This unit also has a myriad of connection options useful for small businesses, including those offered by iPad, iPhone, Android tablet, and smartphone. It also has Wi-Fi Direct and NFC capabilities. Another quality model is the best **printer** for crafting that uses Claria Photo HD Ink that is vibrant and long-lasting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, the thing about **printer**s is that it isn't just the initial cost. Ink refills are infamous for being eye-wateringly expensive. However, if you are planning on doing a lot of printing, it is still more cost-efficient than using even the best photo printing services (opens in new tab). All of the **printer**s on our list use individually replaceable **ink**s, so you only need to replace cartridges that have run dry. Also, both Canon and Epson have introduced **printer**s that run on bottles rather than cartridges, which is both more efficient and less wasteful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Short on cash? Then the best art **printer** for you is the Canon Pixma iP8750. This affordable device can print a bordered sheet of A3+ in full colour in around two minutes. And with five dye-based **ink**s, plus a pigment black, the results are worth waiting for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We've divided this guide into two sections. First, we run through regular A4 **printer**s, and then we look at larger A3+ (13-inch) **printer**s. As you might expect, the smaller **printer**s tend to be more affordable, while A3+ **printer**s usually produce prints of higher quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both, traditional and **ink** tank **printer**s can do decent quality printing. As mentioned earlier, traditional **printer**s have good precision and can print on different types of printing papers and even on some fabrics without any issue. Ink tank **printer**s use liquid **ink** that may not be ideal for purely photo printing although the results are quite decent. They are better suited for mixed purposes where you might be printing documents, projects as well as photographers and posters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most original **ink** cartridges from big-name manufacturers don’t come cheap — but if you shop around, you should be able to find dupes from reputable retailers. As long as the cartridges are the same size and are totally compatible with your **printer** of choice, you can save a lot of money by steering clear of the big name brands and looking for the low-cost alternatives. In fact, it’s estimated that you can save up to 50% by using third party **printer** cartridges. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally speaking, you can expect a sharper print from a higher resolution- but there are some factors at play when determining the ‘best quality print’. When it comes to **ink**jets, the smaller the droplet sizes, the less grainy the finished result will be. Grain won’t spoil your picture entirely, but it is noticeable up close; you usually see it in patches of all one-colour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our test procedure begins with installing the latest software drivers and running nozzle check and print head alignment routines. We then create test prints from mono documents, mixed text and graphics color documents, and a wide range of digital photos that include landscapes, portraits, and black & white images. We use the various available quality modes, including optional image enhancement features. We also create prints from our own specially created test chart, to test the **printer**'s accuracy in terms of color reproduction, tonal range, retention of detail in bright highlights and dark shadows, and the ability to deliver smooth gradations in subtle color variations. The **printer** manufacturer’s own-brand **ink**s and papers are used throughout the entire testing procedure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **printer** uses dye sublimation for quality prints and each only takes less than a minute to print. The small LCD screen enables you to set prints from the machine itself or use the Cannon app, which works with Apple devices. The app can be a little temperamental and the **printer** has a tendency to auto-crop areas of the image, which could be frustrating when printing art from a tablet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With six dye-based **ink**s, you'll get decent colour reproduction and contrast, although not at such high quality as other **printer**s on this list. On the plus side, this **printer** is compatible with Epson's XL cartridges, which helps keep running cost low. We'd also suggest signing up for Amazon Dash Replenishment, which means **printer** will automatically order new cartridges for you when **ink** is running low. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It offers superb colour reproduction and sharpness via a set of 12 pigment-based Lucia Pro **ink** cartridges, with an additional chroma optimiser for giving work on glossy paper a smooth top coat. It'll produce an A2 print in around six minutes. And thanks to the high-quality **ink**s the results are stunning, especially when using matte and fine art media. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   4. Epson EcoTank ET-7700 Great for long-term value, this comes supplied with nearly a pint of **ink**! Specifications Max Print Size: A4 Print resolution: 4800 x 1200 dpi Print speed (6x4; std quality): 42 seconds Interfaces: USB 2.0, Ethernet, Wi-Fi Scanner: Yes Dimensions: 390 x 341 x 138 mm Weight: 8kg Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Accurate colour rendition + Good range of connectivity Reasons to avoid - Pedestrian photo print speeds - Highlights/lowlights could be better - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Canon Selphy CP1300 is the portable **printer** that makes digital art on the move a little more fun. You can use this tiny **printer** – it's small enough to slip into a shoulder bag – as it's primary to print lab-quality photos directly from your camera, which is great for scrapbooking and collecting reference photos. But, the Canon Selphy CP1300 can also be used to print-off art directly from your iPad or other tablet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The only real downside to this **printer** is the cost – while it's a well-priced **printer** for the quality it offers, the Epson Expression Photo XP-970 only supports Epson **ink** cartridges, which are expensive. It will also churn through **ink** too, so beware running costs are a little high. However, if you're printing 10-30 photos a month you'll be fine, anything above this and you may need to look at a more costly **printer** with lower running costs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The unit uses four cartridges applied with HP Thermal Inkjet printing technology with a 1.2 GHz processing speed that enables you to print up to 29 ppm. It also allows you to scan, copy, and fax documents quickly and easily. HP’s intuitive, energy-efficient design and included software offer the best starter package with low running costs. And for quality printing, it is important to invest in the best **printer** paper on the market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Canon PIXMA G650 MegaTank Running on bottled **ink**, this model is great for high-volume photo printing Specifications Max Print Size: 8.5 x 11in Print resolution: 4800 x 1200 dpi Print speed (6x4; std quality): 46 seconds Interfaces: Hi-speed USB, Wi-Fi Scanner: Yes Dimensions: 445 x 340 x 167 mm Weight: 6.6kg Today's Best Deals View at Newegg (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Best Buy (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Huge **ink** cost saving + Photo prints look great Reasons to avoid - Higher initial cost - Slow print speeds - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Windows and Mac compatible: Yes This pricier **printer** from HP creeps slightly over our £50 budget; but we th**ink** it’s worth it given the addition of 'mobile and wireless printing and mobile fax for 24 months'. Also, it prints faster than many other **printer**s at 20 pages per minute. Now, that's what you need when printing last-minute assignments in a hurry! Another plus about this **printer** is that it comes with a six-month supply of instant **ink**, so won't have to worry about restocking for at least half a year. Finally, we like this **printer** because it's designed to be easy to install — and with the HP Smart App, you can print, scan and copy from anywhere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1. Canon PIXMA TS6350 This Canon workhorse is an excellent dual-purpose choice for photo and document printing Specifications Max Print Size: A4/8.5 x 11in Print resolution: 4800 x 1200 dpi Print speed (6x4; std quality): 19 seconds Interfaces: USB 2.0, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Scanner: Yes Dimensions: 376 x 359 x 141mm Weight: 6.3kg Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Fast print speeds + Standard, XL and XXL cartridge options Reasons to avoid - Relatively limited ‘photo’ **ink** range - No memory card slot - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Canon PRO-300 is the successor to the highly-regarded PRO-10 and again its distinguishing feature is that it uses ten pigment **ink**s rather than dye-based **ink**. One of the cartridges is a ‘Chroma Optimizer’, which provides a smooth finish on glossy paper. Of the other nine newly-formulated Lucia Pro **ink**s, you get the standard six colours for photo printing, plus red and grey **ink**s, and both ‘photo’ black and matte black, for printing on glossy and matte media respectively. There are individual channels in the print head for both photo and matte black **ink**s saving time and **ink** when swapping between media types. Excellent output quality combines superb accuracy for colour prints and fabulous definition for black & white photo prints, without any unwanted colour casts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   08. Epson SureColor SC-P5000 The best art **printer** if money's no object Specifications Maximum paper size: A2 Print resolution: 2880 x 1440 dpi Interface: USB Size: 86.3 x 76.6 x 40.6cm Weight: 52kg Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Stunning print quality + Outstanding colour accuracy Reasons to avoid - Huge and hefty - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s a lot to love about this new Epson **printer**, although it’s incredibly similar to the previous XP-960 model. It works very well as a standalone **printer** and photocopier, with intuitive touchscreen controls. Going large to A3/wide format printing makes your photos look much more imposing, and the print quality itself is very good. Even so, for glossy color and black & white photo output, the XP-970 loses out to the more specialist Canon PIXMA Pro-100S A3+ **printer**. The Epson is smaller, lighter, and less expensive to buy, but has dearer **ink** costs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In addition to being able to print directly from your mobile device via Wi-Fi, AirPrint, and Google Cloud Print, you can also easily monitor your **ink** levels and usage from the Brother iPrint&Scan mobile app. The unit also has an Ink Save Mode you can switch on to ration your **ink** use and automatic duplex printing. And with the best duplex **printer**, you can also conveniently scan double-sided pages directly to your cloud services, like Google Drive, Dropbox, OneNote, and more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Can canvas art make good prints? Yes, of course. There are two ways to turn a canvas painting into an art print. You can either take a high resolution digital photo and print from this – you'll need to ideally take this on a white wall with direct lighting – or use a large flatbed scanner. A handheld scanner could be used but this can result in errors. In either case you'll need to open the digital file in Photoshop or a similar app and t**ink**er with the levels to ensure none of the detail is lost. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Windows and Mac compatible: Yes This HP **printer** is a cheap, yet high-performing model from a brand you know you can rely on. Given that this model has a print, copy and scan capabilities, it will complete your at-home office. When it comes to speed, this **printer** is not the fastest we've ever seen, but it can still produce a quick eight pages per minute. As a cool bonus feature, this **printer** offers document and photo printing straight from your Apple or Android mobile device. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The battle of considering traditional cartridge **printer**s or **ink** tank **printer**s, depends on your usage and priorities. Traditional **printer**s, specifically high-end photo **printer**s are still great for purely photo-perfect quality. If it’s a mix of printing needs, from decorating your home with posters, or having your children print their school and college projects or if it’s for you printing forms and an occasional article, you will find an **ink** tank **printer** adds a lot of value. For most of us, the lack of fear over printing costs means we’re likely to print freely rather than as an expensive novelty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **printer** cost-per-page comparison helped us identify the cartridges that offer the lowest cost per page. We also considered if the unit has high-yield cartridges available and did the same calculation with those. Often, we found that although the high-yield toner cartridge may have a higher sticker price, the printing costs per page were lower than when using the standard size. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. Epson Expression Photo XP-8600 It’s the most conventional A4 ‘photo **printer**’ in the group Specifications Max Print Size: A4/letter Print resolution: 5700 x 1400 dpi Print speed (6x4; std quality): 10 seconds Interfaces: USB 2.0, Wi-Fi Scanner: Yes Dimensions: 394 x 340 x 142 mm Weight: 6.7kg Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Walmart (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Fast, high-quality photo output + Full line-up of six individual **ink**s + Compact and clever Reasons to avoid - ‘Photo paper’ tray has limited size - Auto corrections can be too vivid - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
