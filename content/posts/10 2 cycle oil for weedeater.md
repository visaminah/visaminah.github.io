## 10 Fun Facts 2 Cycle Oil For Weedeater | Two-stroke oil
-   Many string trimmers, chain saws, polesaws, brushcutters and leaf blowers run with a 2-stroke engine. Two-stroke (or 2-**cycle**) engines require a mixture of fuel and oil be added to the fuel tank. This mixture results in both engine combustion and lubrication. Operating a 2-Stroke engine on gasoline alone will result in engine failure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The differences between 2-stroke and 4-stroke oil funnel back to the specifics of 2-stroke and 4-stroke engines. On a 4-stroke engine, four strokes complete one **cycle**. For 2-stroke engines, they do more work per piston movement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   STIHL 2-**cycle** oils are formulated to meet the high temperatures and lean running conditions of todayâ€™s innovative and technically advanced STIHL engines. All STIHL 2-**cycle** oils contain a fuel stabilizer for longer storage life and to prevent fuel varnishing. STIHL recommends a mix of 50:1 high-quality 89 octane unleaded gasoline to STIHL engine oil. This same mix ratio should be used during break-in. Oil is packaged in 100 ml, 200 ml, 500 ml and 1 litre bottles (100 & 200 ml also available as a six-pack). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since the 1980s, different types of two-stroke oil have been developed for specialized uses, such as outboard motor two-strokes, as well as the more standard auto lube (motor**cycle**) two-stroke oil. As a rule of thumb, it will be stated somewhere on the printed label of most containers of oil available commercially, that it is compatible with "Autolube" or injector pumps. Those oils tend to have the consistency of liquid dish soap if shaken. A more viscous oil cannot reliably be passed through an injection system, although a premix can be used on either type. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use a 32:1 gasoline to oil ratio. One gallon of gasoline combined with 4 oz of two-**cycle** engine oil. If you are in the state of California, use a 2-**cycle** oil mix ratio of 40:1. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note: Never use gasoline with an ethanol content higher than 10%. Ethanol attracts moisture when exposed to air. After absorbing less than an ounce of water, the 2-**cycle** gasoline and oil mixture will start to separate and if used, result in damage to your engine's carburetor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   with a minimum octane rating of 89 (mid-grade) and maximum ethanol content of 10%. Never use a fuel with a higher content than this. The lower the ethanol content the better. 2-**cycle** premium oil that is ISO-L-EGD and JASO M345 FD certified. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   String trimmers that run 4-**cycle** (4-stage) engines have a fill port for engine oil and a fill port for gasoline. Never mix oil and fuel together for a 4-**cycle** engine. Also, never use 2-**cycle** oil in a 4-**cycle** string trimmer. Good engine oil is required. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use a 40:1 two-**cycle** oil mix ratio. One gallon of gasoline combined with 3.2 oz of two-**cycle** engine oil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This engine is certified to operate on unleaded gasoline. Before operation, gasoline must be mixed with a good quality synthetic 2 **cycle** air cooled engine oil designed to be mixed at a ratio of 40:1. Poulan/Weed Eater brand synthetic oil is recommended. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
