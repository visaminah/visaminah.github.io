## 6 Reference List: How To Make Regular Curtains Into Blackout Curtains | Attaching Blackout Linings
-   Measure from the curtain rod down to about 1″ above the floor to get an idea of what the finished length of the **curtains** will be. I had the fabric clipped on and hanging from the curtain rod since I got it (one side of it anyway, since I didn’t cut it until now!) but you can just measure from the curtain rod to get the height. The length of mine was about 90″. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take your fabric and lay it on the floor, right side down. Then take your **blackout** lining and place it inside the fabric, right side up. The **blackout** lining should fit right where the folds of the hem are ironed in: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since we want this piece to “tuck inside” of the main fabric, I also had to trim the width of the **blackout** lining. Both my main fabric and lining were 55″, so I took off 3.5″ for the right side of the **curtains** and 1.5″ for the left side of the **curtains** and cut the lining to be 50″ wide: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’m not going to tell you I did it myself, because I really felt like I needed help with this project. And when I go to make the **curtains** for Leah’s room, I will definitely need help again. It’s just way too hard to lay everything out and measure it perfectly all by yourself, so I definitely recommend getting a helper if at all possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, at this point, we were getting tired, so we stopped taking pictures. But all you have left to do is check the length of the **curtains**, and pin them to the proper length. If you want, you can hand hem it, but it’s way easier to just take it down and run it through the sewing machine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have to admit, I have been really intimidated to make my own **curtains**. Remember when I bought the fabric for Kate’s **curtains** and I posted my review for Fabric.com? That was two months ago already! But better late than never, I suppose! Finally, here is my tutorial for how to make **blackout** **curtains**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
