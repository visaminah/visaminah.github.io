## 13 Facts How Much Land Does Australia Have | What Does Arable Mean
-   To properly understand and engage with the South Pacific first of all requires to listen to Pacific Is**land**ers themselves. Such efforts cannot be replaced, but they can be complemented by closer cooperation and more in-depth exchanges – including Track 1.5/Track 2 dialogues – both in the EU and with partners in Australia and NZ. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Key findings show foreign ownership of Australian agricultural **land** is 14.1%, compared with 10.9% the previous year. The majority continues to be in the form of leasehold interests. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   According to the FAO, the world’s arable **land** amounted to 1.38 billion hectares (5.34 million square miles) in 2019. Arable **land** worldwide has decreased by nearly a third since 1961. This reduction is due largely to reforestation, soil erosion, and desertification caused by global climate change. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   More than 1 million hectares of agricultural **land** in the south-west of Western Australia (WA) is severely affected by salt. The lost agricultural productivity from salinity damage is estimated to be worth at least $519 million per year. Even though climate change has resulted in reduced annual rainfall, saline watertables have risen in many areas, meaning that dry**land** salinisation is a threat to an additional 2.8 to 4.5 million hectares of low-lying or valley floor soils. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since the coming into force of the UN Convention on the Law of the Seas ­(UNCLOS) in 1994, the PICs have also called some of the world’s largest Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) their own (see Figure 1). For example, Kiribati (pronounced Kiribas) with its 120,000 inhabitants has an EEZ of more than 3.5 million square kilometres. To sum up: While the South Pacific is a sparsely populated world region composed of is**land** states and self-governing territories scattered over vast expanses it is also a world region that matters globally in terms of climate issues, political representation, and economic resources. What is more, geopolitical competition has entered the picture (again) in recent years, especially with China’s growing regional presence and the reaction thereto of Australia and NZ. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The PRC has by now a fairly extensive diplomatic presence in the region. Since 1989 it is an official dialogue partner of the PIF. The PRC has thrice convened the China-Pacific Is**land** Countries Economic Development and Cooperation Forum, a “multi-bilateral grouping” (Taylor 2019) in which China engages with its diplomatic partners and announces aid packages. China’s rising regional profile has also been marked by two visits in recent years by President Xi Jinping. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Arable **land** (% of **land** area) in Australia was 4.03 as of 2018. Its highest value over the past 57 years was 4.16 in 2014, while its lowest value was 1.77 in 1975. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your yard can support three hens then only get three hens – do not buy 10 and hope for the best. If you really do not have the space then talk to locals. See if they would be willing to rent you a small portion of **land** where you can place a coop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In April 2018, front-page newspaper articles in Australia reported – being later vehemently denied by the governments in Beijing and Port Vila – that China had approached Vanuatu, one of the countries most heavily indebted to it, with a view to setting up a naval base there. Other PICs, including PNG, have also been mooted as possible locations for dual-use bases. Regardless of whether these were just rumours, they led the Australian government to take action. At the 2018 APEC summit, PM Scott Morrison announced that his country (together with the PNG and the US) would re-develop a naval base on Manus Is**land**. This announcement formed part of an Australian policy initiative towards the region which became known as the “Pacific Step-up,” evolving into a full-fledged foreign policy programme under Morrison. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You must lodge a vacancy fee return even if you do not receive a reminder from us. If you have not registered your property on the **land** and water register and haven't received your vacancy fee reminder, submit a **land** and water registration form. It does not cost you anything. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Non-arable **land** can sometimes be made arable, for example by removing forests or tilling pasture **land**. On the other hand, non-arable **land** such as mountains, tundra, or desert is often permanently non-arable. The word “arable” comes from the Latin word arabilis, meaning “able to be plowed.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The emerging marketplace for diplomatic recognition saw Beijing and Taipei engage in chequebook diplomacy, offering development aid – presented in the case of the PRC as “South-South cooperation” – in exchange for diplomatic recognition (Atkinson 2010). By 2008, when a truce was instituted, the PRC was entertaining diplomatic relations with eight countries and Taiwan with six. The rivalry picked up steam again when the main**land**-friendly KMT lost the presidency in Taiwan in 2016. By that time it had become clear that this was a race that Taiwan could not ultimately win. In 2019, the Solomon Is**land**s and Kiribati cut ties with Taiwan, leaving it only with four small diplomatic allies in the region – the Marshall Is**land**s, Nauru, Palau, and Tuvalu. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The current COVID-19 pandemic has seen both China and the Australasian partners provide the PICs with medical supplies and other humanitarian assistance. What might be even more important in the medium term, given that PICs (with the exception of resource-rich PNG) are heavily dependent on tourism and remittances and thus hard-hit by the pandemic, would be an extension of the planned trans-Tasman COVID-safe travel zone. Australians and New Zea**land**ers account for nearly two-thirds of the tourists visiting PICs annually, while seasonal worker programmes have seen thousands of Pacific Is**land**ers employed in agri- and horticultural jobs in both countries, sending much needed remittances home. If the comparatively low number of infections in all countries concerned can be reduced to around zero and stringent health and travel protocols established, an extension of the planned COVID-safe travel zone could help cushion the economic effects of the pandemic on the region and become an exemplar of Australian and NZ regional leadership. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
