## 107 Tips to Best Printer For Sublimation Prints | Best Sublimation Printer For Heat Transfer
-   The Epson EcoTank ET-2800 **printer** is perfect for a simple home printing setup. Plain paper can be used to print borderless photos and documents. Furthermore, the two-sided printing feature saves paper while providing a professional appearance to your **prints**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, it offers enhanced printing quality thanks to its ability to produce **prints** with fine detail and high Dpi resolution. Unlike standard **printer**s, sublimation **printer**s produce **prints** with high color saturation and sharpness. You can achieve a high-quality glossy print with sublimation printing that is hard to achieve using traditional inkjet technology. Also, your **prints** do not have that faded or washed-out look when printed on a sublimation **printer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Canon usually **prints** slow, but their quality is worth waiting for. We tested business documents, and all of them showed a legible text quality. There was no streak. Gradient and dark fills were near accurate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The rear tray of a sublimation **printer** contains the heat transfer ribbon that is coated with a layer of sublimation ink. The heat transfer ribbons are mounted on rollers exposed to below heat, allowing them to fuse with your chosen material. When you use multiple colors in your design, they will be fused simultaneously during the process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Final Verdict This is the best heat transfer sublimation **printer**. It has a plethora of features that will make your life much easier. Its colour display makes scanning and copying documents a breeze. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note: Printers like the Epson Workforce WF-7710 can also be converted to sublimation printing, but these **printer**s are phased out now and hard to find new. And they need empty refillable cartridges which are also hard to find. For these reasons, and the fact that you have to add sublimation ink with a syringe, I do not recommend Workforce **printer**s be converted. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Final Verdict For tumbler sublimation printing, the Epson Expression Premium ET-7700 is an excellent choice. The built-in memory card slot allows you to edit your photos while on the go, and the wireless capability allows you to print from virtually any location. The high-quality, vibrant **prints** are unbeatable at this price point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The speed of this **printer** is entry-level. It recorded 10 ppm for blank and 6 ppm for color. We tested the speed with bulk pages. The speed was satisfying. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Replacing regular to sublimation ink is complicated. We recommend you pick the easy one. In that case, Epson will be the best pick. Why? Epson offers their inkjet **printer** for both Heat and Sublimation ink. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is another factor that you should consider before purchasing a particular model. The toner size and the maximum paper size will help determine just how much space you need for your **printer** to function effectively. If you are working with limited room, then getting a smaller or more compact design is essential. Other options include buying separate dye-sublimation **printer**s for paper and another type of **printer** for fabric. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No, only certain **printer**s can be converted to sublimation printing, such as the Epson EcoTank. Other lesser known **printer**s you can use are theBrother MFC-J995DW, as well as the the Mitsubishi CP-K60DW (previous the CP-D70DW) which is a small format photo **printer** — while it **prints** high-quality photos, its small print size means I don’t recommend it. If a small size doesn’t bother you, however, the Canon Selphy CP1300 wireless is quite affordable and can also be converted to sublimation ink. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you purchase an Epson EcoTank inkjet **printer**, you will need to purchase refillable ink cartridges compatible with your **printer** as well as sublimation ink compatible with your machine. Be SURE that what you are ordering and using is sublimation ink before your put it into your **printer**. Two brands we’ve tried are Hiipoo Sublimation Ink and Cosmos Sublimation Ink. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   I recently got one of the sawgrass **printer**s, the SG500. This **printer** **prints** high-resolution **prints** at a high speed. The first time I used it, however, I was a little upset that the **prints** were not borderless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I got started in sublimation many years ago, before it became widely accessible. My first sublimation **printer** was A LOT of money, and the replacement ink cost as much as the **printer** itself.

With so many things that can be personalized with sublimation, it’s no wonder it’s one of the most popular printing methods. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

The special paper is mounted on the feeder paper tray, and then it passes through the **printer**’s print head.

The heat and pressure activate the transfer process that transfers the ink’s pigments to your chosen colored surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
