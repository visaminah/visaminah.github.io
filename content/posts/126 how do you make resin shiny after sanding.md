## 126 Tips to How Do You Make Resin Shiny After Sanding | How To Polish Resin
-   For a matte finish, you simply sand the surface with 3,000-grit sandpaper. Most oil-based finishes should adhere to the epoxy or at least form a film overtop, which can clear it out after **sanding**. The optimal grit for most finishes is 320 or higher. Proven brands like Osmo, Rubio, and Odie’s oils/waxes have been used with great success by many customers. This will help to resist moisture while retaining a natural matte look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Epoxy **resin** is rugged and durable, but it does not mean you can handle it roughly. You may want to fix your scratched or faded patio but do not have experience polishing epoxy before. Instead of taking a risk in polishing the epoxy on your own, it is better to hire professional polishers to do the job. They have all the machines and compounds to fix different problems, - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to polish your surface by hand, you will again need the sandpaper, **sanding** block, polishing paste, water and a cotton or linen cloth. Then put some polishing paste on the cloth and moisten it with some water. Then place the cloth over the **sanding** block. Rub the cloth over the surface in slow, circular movements with little pressure. Your polish is finished when the desired degree of gloss is achieved. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moreover, we understand that sometimes you might be in a hurry and want to start the painting process right after you are done **sanding**. In that case, make sure that you use an electrostatic cloth that will wipe the smallest of the dust particles off the surface. Once you are done with that, the surface will be completely ready to be painted on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Make sure the surface is even. Fill any cracks or lines with a **resin** coating to smooth out the surface. Apply the **resin** liquid with a dropper or dip the material in the **resin** liquid and leave it to harden. For faster results, use UV light to harden the **resin**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the **resin** has been sanded down, the finish will appear dull and scratched. Use lighter and lighter grit sandpaper until the finish is very smooth. However, It will still be cloudy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For polishing an epoxy **resin**, first, you need the surface to be smooth and even. For that, use sandpapers of different grits. If the epoxy surface has too many imperfections, start polishing with low grit sandpapers. But if it is comparatively smooth and has fewer imperfections, use high grit sandpapers to clean the surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In principle, it is possible to carefully polish the surface of almost any type of work-piece or **resin** sealant for a great shine. Of course, this works easier with a corresponding size of the work-piece or a larger area of the sealant than it might be the case with very small work-pieces with many edges. Epoxy polishing usually works without any problems for the following applications: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For polishing larger epoxy **resin** surfaces, such as sealed floor surfaces or extravagantly designed tabletops, you should use a suitable polishing machine if possible. The difference between a drill and a polishing machine is easy to explain (apart from the possibility of controlling the rotational speed): While the drilling machine rotates only rigidly around an axis, the polishing attachment on a polishing machine moves in elliptical or eccentric movements. This has a positive effect on the result of the polishing process. Especially as a beginner, you can achieve particularly brilliant results when polishing epoxy with a polishing machine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s best to apply at least three coats of spray for a smooth, shiny finish. Let the **resin** spray dry after each coat and keep it away from dust and dirt until it dries completely. Once the spray is dry, wipe it with a clean cloth, and the surface will be shiny. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best way to make your **resin** clear after **sanding** is to polish it with a polishing wheel. There are different types of polishing wheels available, and you can use a rotary tool or Dremel for this as well. A polishing compound is also helpful in removing scratches from the surface of your **resin** piece, and you can clean it with alcohol afterward. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Try using a high gloss finish. There are several products available that you can use to coat and polish your **resin** after it has dried. Some like Envirotex High Gloss Finish, have very good reviews from crafters and artists who have used them before. This can be trickier than other methods as you will need to ensure the surface is completely flat and clean before applying the coating, but it has been known to help with scratches too! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To obtain a really perfect and shiny surface, polishing is essential. Here, however, it is important that above all the previous **sanding** with different grit sizes was carried out carefully. If this is not done carefully, polishing is of no use and ugly **sanding** marks are left behind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Working in **resin** lets us create beautiful pieces of artwork. With **resin** work, we can create pieces for our own pleasure, or this can be the basis of a small business based on our art skills. Creating something beautiful can be immensely rewarding, either to give as a gift or as the foundation of a successful enterprise. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In some cases, your work-piece may already have largely smooth surfaces after casting. This is a huge benefit when using silicone molds in particular. In such a case, you can shorten the **sanding** process easily and sometimes you only need to use a relatively fine grain of **sanding** paper for wet **sanding**. Sometimes you can even dispense with wet **sanding** altogether and continue your work directly with the epoxy **resin** polish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tip 1: After a few minutes of patient polishing, doubts often arise as to whether the surface will ever have the desired shine. It is not uncommon, however, that the matt appearance of an epoxy **resin** surface is actually only due to residues of the polishing paste on the epoxy **resin**. If, on the other hand, you regularly wipe off these polishing residues with a soft, clean cloth, you will always be able to keep a close eye on the progress of polishing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you’ve sanded your **resin**, you’ll need to polish it. Your best option is clear nail polish because you can easily find it and it works perfectly. But if you don’t have any, use a gloss medium or sealer instead. If those aren’t available either, try a gloss spray paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While you are working, at no time forget to dip the tip of the sandpaper in the water in frequent intervals. Also, remember to use a circular motion to do the **sanding**. In case you make horizontal or vertical strokes, the chances are that your surface will get damaged. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moreover, when you are wet **sanding**, stay very cautious about the material that you are **sanding**. Even if it has a partial wood composition, it will start to swell within no time, causing permanent damage to the surface. And not just wood, other similar materials will also face the same problem. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Shake the can for 1 minute. Remove the lid and hold about 6-8 inches away from the project while spraying. Then spray the **resin** lightly with the Resin Spray. Do several light coats of Resin Spray, not a heavy coat. Let the **resin** dry about 10 minutes and then add another coat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can polish all sorts of epoxy **resin** crafts such as tabletops, countertops, bar tops, jewellery, and coaster. Apply this polishing compound right after **sanding** an epoxy craft and see how it makes them shine. Besides, the 3 In 1 Advanced Formula of the polisher can nicely take care of surface scratches of your epoxy crafts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Make sure that you only use colorless polishing paste to avoid any coloring effects on your piece. Further, make sure that after every application you use a separate clean cloth to wash off the polishing paste. Until removed, polishing paste can give an epoxy **resin** object a matte appearance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wood and **resin** projects require dry **sanding**. The main reason for this is water may cause the wood to swell. As a result, your project could have uneven surfaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Apart from that, dry **sanding** can end up producing a lot of heat. And if that happens, then the **resin** surface will lose its shine. It may also become impossible to fix, meaning nothing will be able to bring back the shine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While crafting with epoxy **resin**, you apply layers of **resin**. However, bugs, hair, dirt, or any other imperfections can get into the epoxy during the process. It is better to get rid of these impurities before applying another layer of epoxy **resin**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now that you have your **resin** jewelry clean and looking beautiful again, you don’t want to risk anything else happening to it. You should store it in a protected and airtight place. Using a small ziplock jewelry bag combined with a dark jewelry box is a great solution. If you want to display your **resin** keepsakes out in the open, do so in an airtight and UV protected glass case. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rub with the cloth in careful circular movements over the surfaces of your **resin** work-piece to be polished. You should apply light pressure. But don’t be surprised if you notice a visible effect only after some time. It may take a little longer until the surface you are working on finally reaches the desired gloss. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Polishing epoxy **resin** can make your craft look amazing. To have the best glossy effect, you must choose the exemplary polishing compounds, tools, and techniques. The process is affordable and accessible. You can simply polish your epoxy crafts and small objects with a microfiber cloth with your hand or a power drill with a polishing attachment for quick work. You can also hire a large buff machine from a company. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s much easier (and quicker) to use a buffing machine, although you can’t use all buffing machines on complex **resin** prints. I would recommend either the Torq Chemical Guys Polishing Kit or the DEWALT Variable Speed Buffer (both available on Amazon.com) for **resin**, which you can also use for polishing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you are dry **sanding**, the most important thing to remember is to clean the residual dust properly. In most cases, the dust is toxic and can severely affect your lungs. Apart from that, if not removed, the paint will not stick well to the surface, and your entire effort will go down the drain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Epoxy is an excellent choice for making floors both indoors and outdoors. The versatility of epoxy **resin** surfaces makes them suitable for any landscape. Epoxy tiles come in various colours and are incredibly durable. Therefore, they have become famous for outdoor uses. You may use epoxy flooring or tiles for building porches, steps, sidewalks, pool decks, entrances, and driveways. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you are working with **resin**, it is essential that you follow some steps diligently to ensure the perfect end result. And **sanding** is an essential step to achieve that. You need to sand the **resin** surface well to make sure that there are no unwanted scratches or dents left. Otherwise, the paint will not adhere to the surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Any synthetic **resin** surface, once hardened, can be polished. Wooden boards, artistic creations, floors, repaired objects, or furniture refurbished with epoxy **resin** are suitable for this process as long as it is done with care and precision. In general, polishing requires three phases; flattening, progressive honing, and buffing/polishing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do you love crafting with epoxy **resin**? Then look no further. The Premium Polishing Compound and Cleaner Kit from the Incredible Solution is an excellent choice for you. This multipurpose polishing compound kit has a cleaner, polishing compound, and a spray attachment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The movements during wet **sanding**, by hand or with an orbital sander, must be precise and circular. The goal of the first step must be a flat surface. You cannot achieve flatness after the initial step. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We know that many people are allergic to dust. And if you are one of them, rest assured that wet **sanding** won’t give you a hard time. There’s hardly any dust that gets generated in this process, saving you from the trouble of inhaling any when executing this process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When choosing a suitable polishing compound, you may be spoilt for choice given the wide range of different products on the market. The number of different product variants reflects the multitude of possible areas of application. However, there are also polishing pastes with very different coarse or fine polishing grains. In most cases, the simple rule of thumb applies: With polishing pastes for use on wooden surfaces, you can also make epoxy **resin** shine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gloss Resin spray can improve the gloss and shine of the **resin** print. It can also reduce any blemishes on the object’s surface. However, if the print has more visible defects, you’ll have to apply a **resin** liquid coat instead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Micromesh **sanding** pads are a great way to polish **resin**. Though they may look like little sponges, they’re actually made out of firm cloth-like material that you can use over and over again. They come in different colors that each represents a different level of thickness—the lower the number, the finer the grit. In fact, I’ve never had to go higher than a 1500 grit **sanding** pad! These pads can be used on flat surfaces as well as curved ones (like rings). You can find them online or at craft stores like Michaels or Hobby Lobby. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even wet-**sanding** comes with its fair share of disadvantages. Because the **sanding** material is already moist, it absorbs a good amount of dust itself and makes the water muddy. And if you keep using the contaminated water on the **resin** surface, you will end up doing more harm than good. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moreover, when you are **sanding**, make sure that you are not too hard on the surface and applying too much pressure. Sanding the same area over and over again with extra pressure will cause irreparable damage on the surface and diminish the shine considerably. When you put paint after **sanding**, the depression on the surface will become more and more visible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you don’t have any Resin Spray (which I highly recommend), you can mix a small amount of the **resin** you used to cast your project. Then use a paintbrush (that you will throw away after using) and paint a light layer over the top of your project. This will add that shine back. Then let it dry again for 24-48 hours in a covered box. You can also pour a thin “flood coat” over the completed, cloudy project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you polish epoxy **resin**, it is crucial to determine the type of **resin**. There are mainly two types of epoxy **resin**: hard and soft **resin**. Polishing different types of **resin** will require other polishing techniques and polishes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   - then use the 1200 - 1500 - 3000 Trizact clear coat **sanding** disc abrasives. Wet on the same random orbital. Only water, no soap needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If only smaller objects or shapes made of **resin** are to be polished, it is sufficient to use an ordinary power drill with a polishing attachment suitable for this purpose. Usually, you can choose between polishing discs and polishing sponges in different sizes in the corresponding assortment. With a small polishing ball head, you can even polish very small workpieces mechanically. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   - If your piece has wood, and you're trying to keep the wood dry (which you don't have to), or keep the wood from too fine **sanding**, tape it off. That way, a little water under the tape isn't a concern, but you can sand the epoxy to a really fine grit, and keep the wood closer to 320-400 for a finishing product. You can always dry the wood quickly after **sanding** with a blowdryer or heat gun on low (and keep it moving). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **sanding** process when polishing the **resin** is quite different from the **sanding** methods for sprays. You can apply the spray in several coats to cover any blemishes, but the same isn’t possible with polishing. To achieve a smooth and shiny surface with polish, you’ll need to ensure that the surface is 100% smooth and free from imperfections. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now that you have some **sanding** techniques at your disposal, it’s time to figure out how to polish **resin** after **sanding**. The key is to use low grit sandpaper for initial stages of **sanding** and higher grits as you move through the process. As soon as you get a smooth texture, you can polish the piece of **resin**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here’s an example… I poured perfectly mixed **resin** into this half dome silicone mold. I dripped alcohol inks into them and waited. A day later, I popped them out only to be severely disappointed. They were all foggy. The finish was dull and hard to see the alcohol ink drips inside the orb. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you have moved up all of the grits of abrasive paper, you will need to use a cutting compound such as NW1 polishing compound, this starts off as a fine grit paste and the more it is worked into the **resin**, the finer the grit gets. This is the what we used in out river table tutorial online. The TOPFINISH 2 is designed for application AFTER the NW1 to give it the ultra-gloss finish on the **resin**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Broadly, there are two types of **sanding** when it comes to epoxy **resin**s, viz., dry and wet **sanding**. And both these methods come with their own set of advantages and disadvantages. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To apply **resin** gloss spray, first make sure the **resin** print’s surface is smooth. You’ll need to sand it down before using the spray to avoid lumpy layer lines. Also, make sure the surface is clean and remove any dust from the object before spraying. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When polishing by machine, follow the same general steps using a circular on and off motion. However, you should still be careful to use machine polishing only with **resin** pieces that have cured to a high level of hardness. Soft cured **resin** objects can warp due to heat or even breaking. A combination of machine polishing and hand polishing can be used for **resin** objects that have many curves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can shape your pieces on a 320 grit disc sander, then 400 grit dry (wear PPE designed for dust particulates). From there it's all wet **sanding** 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1500, 2000, etc. up to 3000 (some kits go up to 10,000+grit). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are several types of epoxy **resin** polishing compound on the market. We recommend that you experiment with each type of epoxy polishing compound available. As previously stated, automotive and wood polishes can work very well with **resin** jewelry and other small objects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Polishing compounds are another great choice for polishing your **resin** pieces up nice and shiny! These compounds come in sticks that you rub onto a buffing wheel (similar to how you would apply lipstick). The buffing wheels are usually made of flannel, felt, or cotton depending on the brand—again, some brands sell them online while others can only be found at craft stores. You’ll need to attach it to something that spins like an electric drill or Dremel tool. You don’t want your piece moving around too much because it could get damaged by the spinning motion, so try holding it in place with one hand while turning on the power tool with the other hand to avoid mishaps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   - sand with 800 Abranet. Abranet is a dust-free **sanding** material. On a random orbital, on high speed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to regularly polish larger areas of epoxy, then the purchase of a polishing machine specially designed for this purpose will certainly pay off. With such a machine you can use different polishing sponges for polishing the **resin**. Also, the speed of the polishing machine can be adjusted in such a way that an optimal polishing result is possible. With a reduced number of revolutions, you make sure that the surface of your work-piece does not get too hot due to the frictional heat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hi friends, it’s Natalie from Doodlecraft. It’s happened to even the best **resin** crafters… a cloudy **resin** finish. It’s super frustrating to spend all the time and money to make a project only to have the **resin** finish look dull and not shiny. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You want to make sure that you have a smooth, clean surface to work with when polishing. You can do this by working your way through various grits of sandpaper: the lower the grit, the deeper the scratches on the surface. So, if you’re trying to remove a bug, or level out the surface then you are going to want to start with a lower grit and slowly work your way up, until the surface is smooth. If your surface is relatively ready and free of imperfections than you are more likely going to start with a higher grit sandpaper since the surface needs less work. Again, check out our **sanding** tips prior to polishing so that you’re ready to take on the polishing process! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All epoxy **resin** objects can be polished, but the methods that you use will depend on what kind of object you are polishing. The rule is that softer cured **resin** objects should be polished by hand, and hard cured **resin** objects can be polished with a buffing wheel or drill head. Smaller objects should be polished by hand if possible or with a buffing wheel. Hand polishing is the correct option for small objects that have many curves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Actually, there are not many pitfalls lurking in cast **resin** polishing. Nevertheless, you should always work very carefully and thoughtfully during this step in order to get a nice shiny surface in the end. With the right polishing paste, for example, epoxy **resin** can be made to shine very well. Further factors for an optimal result are the choice of the polishing sponge used and the set speed of the polishing machine used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this first step, you start with the **sanding** of epoxy **resin** through the so-called wet **sanding**. First of all, you need ordinary tap water and special sandpaper that is suitable for use in wet conditions. The decisive criterion for this is the application of the abrasive grains on a waterproof fabric that cannot tear when wet under mechanical stress. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you can buff the **resin** print, you’ll have to smooth out the surface with sandpaper. Start **sanding** with rough sandpaper and transition down to fine-grit sandpaper for finishing. To sand the **resin** print, follow these steps: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Resin polish is usually a clear liquid or paste that is used after **sanding**. Any product that can be used for wood polishing also works great on **resin**. Various kinds of automobile polish also work very well with **resin**. You should experiment with test castings and determine what works well on the type of **resin** that you like to use in your castings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   TOP FINISH 2 is precisely what its name suggests. It is a fine polishing compound to be applied after epoxy **resin** products are crafted. The nano-particle formula of the products makes sure you get an ultra-glossy surface after polishing. You can also use it to bring back the shine of your dull epoxy **resin** that faded over time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You might be planning to sand epoxy **resin** on materials that are partially made of wood or any other similar material sensitive to moisture. In that case, it is best to go with dry **sanding**. This is because if you use any other method, then chances are that the surface might swell up and get blotchy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Today, we will share information and tips concerning how to polish **resin**. We’ll share ideas on how to use **resin** polish after **sanding**, what epoxy objects are easiest to polish, and what the best epoxy polish compounds are. Polishing epoxy **resin** is easy and will make your artwork shine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, you should know about another product from a brand, the NOVUS Plastic Polish Kit. It is an excellent product for restoring dull epoxy **resin** full of scratches. It ensures your objects can last for a long time looking beautiful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **resin** must be the correct temperature for the correct finish. If it’s too cold, it can affect the finish. To warm up **resin**, place the bottles of **resin** and hardener into warm water and let the **resin** warm up a tad before mixing. The bottles should be warm to the touch prior to mixing. Do not heat it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Essentially, there are 2 ways to sand epoxy **resin**: Dry Sanding and Wet Sanding. Wet **sanding** with water-resistant sandpaper is the best way to sand epoxy **resin**. However, it depends on the type of project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Polishing epoxy **resin**, like all other steps, is actually an indispensable part of working with epoxy **resin** in various projects. Only with careful polishing can the shine be created that turns a nice craft idea into a true work of art. But this only works if you lay the foundation for a perfectly polished **resin** surface by **sanding** (with different degrees of grain size) before the actual polishing. If unsightly **sanding** marks are not removed carefully enough during this initial step, even the final polishing cannot produce the desired surface quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After curing, release from a mold or other applications, epoxy **resin** may appear dull or contain haze. Here, polishing epoxy **resin** helps to give the final result that certain something and the necessary shine. The polishing is done in a few steps and makes the cured **resin** shine properly. We show you step by step how to sand and polish **resin**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can choose from a wide range of mineral oils to polish your **resin** prints. Still, Murphy’s Mineral Oil (available on Amazon.com) is recommended for its unreactivity and smooth effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are several different types of **resin**s used for jewelry, and you can’t treat them all the same way. Some **resin**s are very hard and can be polished and shaped with a Dremel tool. Other **resin**s are extremely soft and would be irreparably damaged with those means. If you don’t know what type of **resin** was used to make your jewelry, you should be very cautious about how you care for it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the other hand, soft epoxy **resin**s are soft as silicon after curing. You can dent soft epoxy **resin** with your fingernail. Besides, it becomes softer with body heat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Buffing on the other hand, acts as more of a filler than a remover like **sanding**. While buffing you are using a compound to essentially fill in the scratches previously made on the surface of your project. You work in the compound with a variable speed polisher, slowly working the material into the surface. You can do one, you can do the other, or you can do both—either way, skipping this step isn’t going to give you the glass-like finish your project deserves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, make 1 or 2 passes over the **resin**. Next, remove the sander from the surface. Then, use an air compressor to remove the **resin** dust from the sandpaper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mineral oil is a colorless, orderless, toxin-free liquid that you can use to achieve a shiny finish on **resin** prints. Apply mineral oil after you’ve sanded down the material. Mineral oil won’t have the same sticky effect as **resin** spray or coating, making it ideal for polishing **resin**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The product you choose should be easy to apply. You can find polishing compounds in spray bottles, squeeze tubes, and jars. So, pick one that you find convenient to use on the surface of the epoxy **resin**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first step is to know which type of epoxy you have. For soft epoxy **resin**, you can consider less abrasive liquid polishes. Hard epoxy is easy to clean with a bit of abrasive polishing. However, make sure the compound does not contain any chemicals that can harm the glossiness of the epoxy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now that you have learned how to choose a polish compound, you should know how to make your **resin** crafts glossy like glass using a polishing compound. Gather all the items required to polish your epoxy **resin**. The things you will need are: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this clip, Matt Hutton utilises sandpaper grits ranging from 80 to 600 to demonstrate the quickest and most robust approach for polishing epoxy **resin** countertops. Pure Acetone is what he uses to clean in between **sanding**. After that, he does wet sand and polish. He explains pressure in great detail, providing you with a solid foundation to begin your DIY projects. Go check out Matt’s YouTube channel and subscribe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sanding, Buffing and Polishing, is not always necessary. Sometimes a dome coat or a flood coat of clear **resin** is all that is needed (and can sometimes be the easiest). In some cases a flood coat vs wet **sanding** and oil/polish is a matter of preference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
