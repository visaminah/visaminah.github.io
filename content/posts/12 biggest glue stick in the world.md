## 12 Fun Facts Biggest Glue Stick In The World | 12-year-old from US Builds Tallest Popsicle Structure Ever, Enters Guinness World Record
-   For years, the only type of **glue** gun on the market had to be plugged into a wall outlet, but the new kids on the block are cordless models operating on a rechargeable lithium-ion battery or disposable butane cartridges. Cordless models make it possible to reach spots where an outlet isn’t available, such as gluing down that loose shingle on the garden shed. A single butane cartridge or a fully charged 18-volt battery will power a **glue** gun for approximately 2 to 3 hours. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   According to Klabel, he has been building objects with popsicle **stick**s and other recycled materials since 2015 after he was fascinated by the projects his father built. But, he got inspired to chase the world record after he once saw a video that highlighted Guinness World Records of other holders. Since, he knew he had the skill and passion for popsicle **stick** sculpting, he went ahead to grow it. Finally, he was able to build a record-breaking ice lolly structure that can be seen from a distance. This feat surely must have made his dad proud. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We recommend the Gorilla Dual Temp Mini Hot Glue Gun Kit or the Chandler Tool Hot Glue Gun Kit to cover most of your **glue** gun needs. The Gorilla Dual Temp mini **glue** gun’s ability to operate in high- and low-temp modes make it well suited to both heavy-duty and delicate craft or repair tasks. Crafters who like the flexibility of working without a cord should consider the WORKPRO Cordless Hot Glue Gun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **glue** gun should be set to the right temperature to melt the adhesive **stick**s it is designed to use. High-temperature **glue** **stick**s melt between 375 and 450 Fahrenheit, and low-temperature **glue** **stick**s melt between 200 and 250 Fahrenheit. The **glue** gun’s wattage will determine how quickly the tool gets to melting temperature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Low temperature: A low-temperature **glue** gun heats **glue** to around 250 degrees Fahrenheit. Though the **glue** gun still gets very hot at the tip, it’s safer to use and less likely to cause accidental burns than a high-temperature tool. Low-temperature **glue** guns are designed for use only with low-temperature **glue** **stick**s, which have a silicone base that melts easily under lower temperatures. This type of **glue** gun is suitable for light-duty projects, such as making paper chains and scrapbooking. It is also the tool of choice for child-friendly crafts, but children still must have adult supervision when using any **glue** gun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **glue** guns are on by default when they’re plugged in, but a few feature on/off switches that let you turn off the gun when it’s plugged in. Stand: Many guns feature a flip-down tripod that balances the tool when you set it down, but some come with a separate stand on which the gun can rest. Still others feature an upright design that can stand on its own base. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   A versatile **glue** gun comes in handy for creating everything from kid-friendly crafts and decorative seasonal items to fabric-based interior design pieces, such as headboards, lampshades, and no-sew pillow covers. Around the house, a hot **glue** gun can also help plug nail holes, add traction to the back of rugs, and a host of other projects.

Full-size guns dispense a larger volume of hot **glue** with each squeeze, while mini guns dispense a smaller amount, making them great for wrapping gifts and making delicate craft objects such as Christmas ornaments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
