## 14 Fun Facts What Colours Go With Teal Blue Clothes | What Color Top Goes With Turquoise Pants?
-   How to Wear It: "It's easy to go monochromatic with **blue**-greens because they don't have to match exactly. A deep teal jacket looks streamlined—and fresher than black—with a turquoise dress."—Adam Glassman - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You are likely to find exactly the vintage or contemporary turquoise **blue** dress you’re looking for on 1stDibs, as there is a broad range for sale. Blue is a pretty popular color, but we also have Green Black and more in stock now. You’re likely to find the perfect turquoise **blue** dress among the distinctive accessories we have available, which includes versions made as long ago as the 20th Century as well as those produced as recently as the 21st Century. Finding an appealing accessory such as this — no matter the origin — is easy, but Emilio Pucci Versace and Lanvin Paris each produced a popular version that is worth a look. There aren’t many items for men if you’re seeking these accessories, as most of the options available are for women and unisex. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What Should You Wear With Turquoise? There are not all women who wear light **blue** dresses, but if you do, you should DEFINITELY wear turquoise jewelry. There are risks associated with yellow, and it doesn’t fit well with most things. The turquoise, however, is not one of them. Wear a pair of white jeans and a yellow top to complement your turquoise jewelry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "When it comes to teal, we are evenly divided along pretty deep lines. One half the world sees teal as **blue**-green and the other insists it’s green-**blue**," she says. "The good news is, both sides are right because color is always subjective. What you see is what you get." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here’s another Parisian street style look you can try. Wine red is a beautiful hue that has a grandeur vibe like no other color. Pair a teal **blue** dress with a red overarching jacket and red pumps to up the ante of your look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red and **blue** can be a classy combination if you have the eye for it. You can throw on a **blue** chambray blazer over a muted red dress for formal meetings or a powder **blue** leather jacket if you are headed out. Finish off with a red hat to take it in the opposite direction. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red can be paired with neutral colors like white or black quite easily. For classy outfits, go for grays, browns, or earthy tones. In summers, tangerines, **blue**s, and mustards look vibrant. It depends on where you are headed and what your personal preference is, but here’s a list with a little bit of everything. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The way you choose colour depends on many factors but one of them is based on your skin tone. If you have a warm skin tone you should avoid **blue** and similar cool colors. But if you have a cool skin tone, go ahead and splurge on **blue**. I have warm skin tone, so there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Teal is one of those shades of **blue** that can feel daring and a little unexpected. A blend of green and **blue**, teal is a bold color that feels like a punchier, sassier version of **blue**.

There are endless colors that work wonderfully with teal—you just have to take care to pair it right. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Talking about the yellow ones, a mustard shade is always a go-to choice because it can add pop to your teal green outfit. Moreover, other options like metallic gold would be a perfect selection if you want to add glamorous and great gatsby vibes to make a bold statement look with your teal **blue** outfit. The browns family is the first choice you can think of if you want a formal kind of look. Caramel shades will help you get a subtle contrast, whereas some dark brown will help you incorporate more dramatic pop vibes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue is my favourite color too. I have a wardrobe full of different **blue** colored garments and then I learn that **blue** is not suited to me. I feel as if I have been living a lie! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue is an unavoidable color in most of our wardrobe. Ask a number of people their favourite color and many will mention ‘**blue**’.

Many brand logos have the color **blue** (think Facebook)- a testimony to the power of **blue** color to impart confidence. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you combine yellow and green, you get **blue**. Yellow, **blue** and green are a combination – they are of the same bloodline. So yellow as well as green can look good when combined with **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
