## 13 Interesting Facts Hammer Drill Vs Impact Driver For Concrete | Can I Use An Impact Drill For Concrete
-   Yes, **hammer** drills may be used to drive in screws and remove nails, but impact drivers are better for the job. In fact, they are made for the job. A **hammer** drill may cause wood to chip off while driving a nail or screw into it because of the **hammer**ing action. Such tasks are better done with an impact driver. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It will take at least 12 volts. That’s because the **hammer** drill with the least voltage takes 12 volts. In addition, the most popular **hammer** drills are 12-volt **hammer** drills and 18-volt **hammer** drills. This does not mean that an 18-volt **hammer** drill is better than a 12-volt **hammer** drill. They’ll both get the job done perfectly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both devices can be used to drill holes, but a **hammer** drill is better. It can drill faster, and it can drill into any material (wood and masonry). Yes, impact drivers can also drill holes, but they can only drill holes in wood. Masonry is a no-no for them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To prevent overheating the bit, wet the surface of the **concrete** with water before drilling it. After drilling for a few seconds, clean off the spot, and continue drilling. It won’t take you up to 2 minutes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To conclude, we’ll say **hammer** drills and impact drivers are different tools meant for different functions, even though they can do a bit of each other’s work. Hammer drills push forward while impact drivers have a great amount of torque. While a **hammer** drill is meant for drilling holes, an impact driver is meant for driving screws into materials and removing them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may want the best brands of **hammer** drills. It is better to go for Milwaukee, Bosch, Makita, and DeWalt **hammer** drills. They are the most popular brands. And that’s because their **hammer** drills are efficient. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, the depth of the hole matters as well. Any hole that is deeper than ¼ inch isn’t in an impact driver’s capability. Get a **hammer** drill for that. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **hammer** drill spins and **hammer**s forward. So, while drilling into **concrete**, it **hammer**s to push forward and spins to widen the hole. The **hammer**ing action breaks through, and the rotatory action expands the hole. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are various models of **hammer** drills and impact drivers, and they all have varying weights. Generally, **hammer** drills weigh about 4 pounds to 8 pounds, and they are usually heavier than impact drivers. Since they are both manual devices, they are both light enough to be carried around easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Actually, what caused the main confusion is that a **hammer** drill can also function as an impact driver to an extent, while the latter can also be used as the former to a large extent. And quite frankly, they look alike. After reading this article, you’ll be able to discern the differences between them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **hammer** drill applies forward pressure. Yes, a **hammer** drill can also be used to drive in screws. And it also works like a normal drill. That’s why many of them have three modes – a **hammer** drill mode, a screw-driving mode, and a regular drill mode. However, impact drivers are better at driving in screws and removing screws. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are two major types of **hammer** drills, and they are corded and cordless **hammer** drills. Corded **hammer** drills are powered by electricity, while cordless **hammer** drills are powered by rechargeable batteries. Both types are great for **concrete**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the other hand, a **hammer** drill can work on **concrete** and wood. It can drill holes into hard materials like **concrete**, and it can also drill into wood. So, you can conclude that a **hammer** drill works on masonry (**concrete**, cinder blocks, bricks, granite, and mortar) while an impact driver works on wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
