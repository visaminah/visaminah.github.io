## 4 Tips to Is American Standard A Good Brand For Sinks | is american standard a good brand for sinks
-   The most common sizes for a kitchen sink are 30″ or 33″, however a **standard** size could measure anywhere between 24″ and 36″ in length. The bulk of what you find while shopping will fall within this size range. Generally, **sinks** up to 30″ will contain one large single bowl. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Experts recommend at least 22 to 27-inches in length, which also works for small kitchens. Length is one factor, but you also have to consider the depth of the sink. Kitchen **sinks** should be at least 7 to 7.25 inches deep; anything less and your dishes will quickly pile up and reach the faucet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to American Standard, the reviews are a bit mixed. For some reason, although it appears that the quality of American Standard toilets, **sinks**, faucets, and more, is quite acceptable, even fairly high, for one reason or another, some people have complaints. Some people give this brand and its product great reviews, as high as 9 out of 10, while others give it a score as low as 3 out of 10. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First off, we have Glacier Bay, which is an American brand name exclusively sold by The Home Depot. The Home Depot is of course one of the largest home improvement chains in the USA at this time.
