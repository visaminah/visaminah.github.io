## 14 Interesting Facts Best Primer For Covering Red Paint | Painting Red Walls
-   There are a couple of options for **primer**s if you don’t have the time to commit. Self-priming **paint**, a product that was created precisely to cut out that extra step, is a great option for some. According to tests done by Consumer Reports, self-priming **paint** will offer some of the benefits of a traditional **primer**. But what should you do if you don’t have self-priming **paint**? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is no need to prime if you are applying a slightly different color, but anytime you are making a big change, it is a good idea. The last thing you want is to go through the work of **paint**ing only to see the old color showing through. This is particularly true if you are going from dark to light or from light to dark. Ask the **paint** retailer to tint your **primer**. One coat of a good **primer** will ensure a blank canvas for the new shade, and since **primer** is typically cheaper than **paint**, it also makes good economic sense. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While the **paint**’s job is all about color, the **primer**’s job is to prepare the surface for **paint**ing and make that color the best it can be. Even with a simple color change where you’re covering an existing lighter color with another color, it wouldn’t be advisable to **paint** without priming. If you **paint** without priming first, the end result could be a color that is a slightly different shade that the color you selected. For a simple color change from walls to furniture re-**paint**ing projects, KILZ 2® All-Purpose Primer is right for the job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For drywall, there are two choices that work best. If you are an expert or have hired professionals and are working with an exceptionally smooth surface, standard drywall **primer** will be sufficient. If, however, your drywall has small imperfections like pockmarks, scuffing, or fine ridges, a high-build drywall **primer**-sealer is a better option. Although more expensive, it will smooth and level an uneven surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Glossy surfaces do not hold **paint** well. Any color will have a much harder time locking in. The **primer**’s slightly rough and porous nature provides the perfect texture for the **paint** to adhere to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Taking an old furniture piece or transforming dark trim with a fresh coat of **paint** can breathe new life into a space. Just remember, **paint** is made to showcase color, not cover up what’s beneath. If the surface you are **paint**ing is stained, it is best to use a **primer** and then **paint** on top. This will ensure the stain doesn’t bleed through and also gives the **paint** a surface to hold on to. The result — an updated look that will last much longer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Often, what determines whether or not a surface should be primed is if the surface is too porous. The issue is that too much of the **paint** will be drawn in, and you will end up needing multiple coats of **paint**. This is especially true of fresh, un**paint**ed drywall and, in particular, the mud used on the seams. Even with a smooth sanding, it absorbs **paint** differently and will appear blotchy and dull without a **primer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Springtime and DIY projects go hand in hand, and this spring season it feels like that sentiment rings truer than ever before. With all of us staying home to practice safe social distancing we have a lot more time on our hands, making it the perfect time to tackling a DIY **paint**ing project. But before you **paint**, don’t forget to prime! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For any of these situations, make sure to **paint** over **primer** within 48 hours. Most **primer**s are made to physically and chemically bond with the **paint** applied over them. If you wait too long, it will lose its effectiveness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And it goes without saying that when **paint**ing over a darker color with a new, fresh-as-spring lighter shade, you definitely want to prime first. Otherwise shades like deep red will show through and change the tone of the new **paint** color you selected. If you’re going from a darker to a lighter color in your DIY **paint**ing project, KILZ® 3 Premium Primer has a thick, high-hide formula that is up to the task. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The question of whether or not to prime before **paint**ing seems as old as, well, **paint**ing itself. The answer seems to be different depending on who you talk to. Paint manufacturers say “yes” — it is an essential wall **paint**ing technique — because they want the best possible surface for the **paint** to shine. Do-it-yourself (DIY) fans seem less thrilled about the process, mostly because it takes more time and money. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are times when priming just isn’t necessary. If the surface has already been **paint**ed and it is in good shape, you can skip the **primer**. Just make sure there is no chipping or peeling. Generally speaking, interior walls that only need a touch-up or are being **paint**ed a similar shade will be just fine with no priming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are also certain surface types that are extremely porous, including brick and wood. If you **paint** on these surfaces without priming, there is a good chance the **paint** will seep into the surface – and that means your color won’t be as vibrant or true as you were expecting. When you’re looking to seal porous surfaces, KILZ® 1 Standard Primer and KILZ 2 All-Purpose are both great **primer** choices. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes, priming your walls isn’t necessary before you **paint**. But if you find yourself in one of the above situations, skip the self-priming **paint**. It’s best to take that extra step and prime your surfaces properly to ensure the best results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
