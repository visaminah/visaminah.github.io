## 39 Interesting Facts How To Get Rid Of Dog Poop Smell In House | Make your own Pet Odor Remover
-   Though we welcome the brilliant, warm rays of the sun, the sun magnifies remaining urine and feces stains left behind in our lawns, making it feel like you need a gas mask if you hope to enjoy a beautiful day relaxing in your yard. Thankfully, finding the stink-infested areas is a simple task since both urine and feces tend to scald grass, turning it a shade of yellow or brown. However, dogs don’t always limit themselves to grass when it comes to the ideal place to relieve themselves. Sometimes your trees, cement patio stones, and even wooden decks are the “object” of Fido’s peeing affection and also require cleaning and treatment to remove lingering odors which contribute to the foul **smell** in your yard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use a pet waste bag dispenser to collect bags for pickup. Pet waste should be picked up on a daily basis as long as it’s not raining as that will cause the scent to stay with you longer. Scented garbage bags will keep the **smell** at bay. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can sprinkle baking soda inside the bag to absorb the odor naturally. This means you are trying to alleviate the annoying **smell** of dog waste. Baking soda is also a natural product making it environmentally friendly and safe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dog **poop** disposal is a tricky subject. On the one hand, it is **poop**. On the other hand, it is **poop** that your dog leaves behind when he is not only **poop**ing but also peeing and making regular bathroom visits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Exposed to the sun and elements, dog or cat urine **smell**s can grow intolerable. In addition, dogs are inclined to use the same spot repeatedly. A few common household ingredients however should help eradicate the urine **smell**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Enzymes are microscopic, naturally occurring substances that break down organic particles like **poop** and pee to make them simple to remove. Enzyme cleaners are made to destroy dog and cat **poop** **smell** and persistent pet urine odor. These cleaners are all-natural, safe, and available in pet stores or online. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cleaning the pet stain is only the first part of the solution. To the naked eye the stain can look clean but you may find a **smell** lingers afterward. This is due to small enzymes of the stain being left in the carpet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another hypothesized reason behind this behavior has been assumed that dogs may be trying to hide their own **smell** by rolling in the **smell**y substance. This may relate back to when dogs were wild and had to hunt for their food. By rolling in their prey’s scent, or their prey’s **poop**, the dog’s own **smell** would be hidden. This would make hunting easier, allowing dogs to approach prey without warning them off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It started with a drop and roll and before I knew it, I had a stinky puppy. I didn’t realize how bad he **smell**ed until we got into the car to drive home. We were at a soccer game an hour away from home. Thank goodness it was summer, and we could open the windows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Be sure the charcoal items are out of reach of your pets and children. Unlike many odor-eaters, active charcoal works hard on stubborn **smell**s for up to a month. Change out active charcoal baggies after this time to ensure you continue to get the best results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A natural deodorizer, a healthy dose of baking soda is also an excellent way to cut down on the foul **smell**s in your yard or garden. Unlike other home remedies, baking soda requires a “setting” period to be most effective. Apply generously to stinky spots and allow to rest undisturbed for a minimum of an hour. To remove stains and **smell**s from cement or wood, you may need to work the baking soda into the surface prior to the rest period. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Set out little bowls or hang small bags of activated charcoal around problem areas in your yard to soak up unwanted odor. Activated charcoal absorbs an incredible amount of dog odor and dog urine **smell**. This fine black powder is unique thanks to its giant surface area, which gives it a sizable absorptive capacity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We bathed him as soon as we got home, but he still stunk. Second bath, still **smell**y. The third time we used a special home remedy and like magic, the **smell** was gone… keep reading to get the all-natural mixture we used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spray the solution generously in your yard, focusing on areas where foul odor arises, whether you are getting rid of cat **poop** odor outside or dog poo **smell**. White vinegar solution is also ideal for carpet cleaning when you have a pet stain indoors. Pat the accident dry with a paper towel, and pour the vinegar mix into a spray bottle to soak the area before drying. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sprinkle baking soda on the area. Let it sit for at least an hour so it absorbs the urine **smell**. For cement areas, use a scrubbing brush to scrub the area before you let it sit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In searching for the right product for your property, bear in mind that there are two main types of odor treatments. Odor neutralizers are the most effective form of treatment as they don’t just hide a scent, they actually break down the enzymes within a **smell** to help eradicate it entirely. By comparison, masking agents simply work to cover up odors but do nothing to remove them. Over time, an odor neutralizer will eliminate the source of the **smell**. A masking agent will need to be reapplied frequently to continue to disguise an order and replace it with something more pleasing to inhale. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sprinkle a thin covering of baking soda over the problem areas in your yard as a **poop** and pee deterrent for dogs and cats. Use a garden trowel to mix the powder for loose dirt or soil areas. The baking soda takes in the odor particles, removing them from your garden, and it won’t harm your plants. It stops cats from **poop**ing in your backyard without resorting to more extreme measures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This solution will work for a dog that rolled in a dead animal, animal **poop**, and even skunk spray. The hydrogen peroxide and baking soda combination naturally break down odors. The soap breaks down the oily part of the **poop**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After the **poop** is scooped away and you’re left with the “spot,” saturate it with your enzyme cleaner. Kinderbean’s No Stress Mess Eraser has a squirt top designed for this exact purpose. Use the bottom of the bottle to agitate the product into the area. Place your white rag over the top of the area and let it sit, preferably overnight. Re-treat in the morning if necessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes stains and **smell**s can stubbornly refuse even the most effective home remedies and a commercial treatment is necessary to restore the fragrance of freshly cut grass and aromatic roses to your yard and garden. If you share your home with pets, you will need to take care that the odor removal solution you select is safe for use around your dog or cat. Many odor treatments contain harsh chemicals which could cause your pets to become ill if ingested or even if the solution comes in contact with their skin. For best results, always carefully read the label of each product you are considering using, staying on the lookout for possible side effects and inherent warnings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The fact is, the faster you can clean up **poop** the better. Ultimately, what creates the stain and **smell** is the same for any kind of **poop** – biological bacteria from your dog’s digestive tract. Just because it has more water in it, doesn’t mean you should delay in cleaning it. You wouldn’t leave dog pee on your carpet until it dries, right? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The baking soda will do a good job of lifting the pet **smell**s from the carpet but it’s very hard to get it all. That’s why you want to follow up with a neutralising agent after your clean. We recommend a dash of lemon juice or Febreze over the stain when you’re done cleaning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While wearing disposable gloves, dip a clean cleaning rag/cloth in the vinegar and water solution. If the feces was left on a tile or hardwood floor, wipe down the entire area. If the little present was left on the carpet – just slightly wring out the cleaning cloth and place this over the **smell**y area. Push down hard to expel some of the vinegar/water mixture. Remove any remaining liquids with paper towels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1/2 teaspoon Dawn Soap Lather your dog’s fur with the mixture, focusing on the area that had the **poop** in the fur. Avoid areas around the mouth and eyes. Let sit for a minute, then rinse well. Repeat as needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "Gently and securely wrap the sprayed area with a blanket, towel, or other disposable material," says Drnek. "You will likely need a helping hand to keep the wrap in place and help keep your dog calm while you prepare. Be understanding towards your pup as his nose is much more sensitive to the skunk **smell**. It may help to distract your dog with treats or toys." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To some of you this might seem like a lot of work. If that’s the case you may opt to use the services of a carpet cleaner instead of doing it yourself. However, we highly recommend giving this a go before you get a quote! It’s not too difficult, uses completely natural ingredients and is a good skill to have. For those accidental moments when your pet makes a mess of the carpet, you’ll be glad to have the knowledge to clean the stains and pet **smell**s yourself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "Skunk spray contains thiols, which, if you think back to your second semester of organic chemistry, you’ll recall are compounds containing carbon and sulfur with hydrogen bonded to the sulfur. Thiols have notoriously strong odors. Hydrogen peroxide is a potent oxidizer. The skunk bath recipe works by oxidizing the thiols into compounds called disulfides, which are not so **smell**y." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Contrary to popular belief (i.e. what you’ve read on other blogs about cleaning up **poop**), simple household cleaners just won’t cut it. I’ll explain why in a bit, but first, grab your cleaning bucket and fill it with the following items: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "My best guess is that things that **smell** bad to us **smell** good to dogs” says Dr. Eric Barchas, DVM, Medical Director at the North Peninsula Veterinary Emergency Clinic in San Mateo, California. "So, if a dog likes the way something **smell**s, he wants to be covered in that **smell**, but this is nothing but speculation. Only dogs know why they roll in stinky stuff." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The problem of pet **smell**s and pet stains on carpet is a common one. It’s something you’ll come across at least once if you’re an experienced Pet Sitter or Owner. No matter how obedient your pet, even the most well-trained dogs have accidents from time to time! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lawns need regular watering to flourish. However, there is a greater advantage to making use of a sprinkler system when it comes to battling pet odors. By employing an oscillating sprinkler daily, your yard will receive continuous water to help lessen the concentration of urine residue. This constant watering allows for dilution of the urine. Over time, the unpleasant **smell** dissipates into the earth and is completely removed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remove the poo in question with a baby wipe or a thick, barely damp paper towel. Then scrape off any excess with a fresh wipe or paper towel. Pinch the carpet fibers to pick up as much of the **poop** as possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is often the case when Owners go away and leave their pets behind. They can become anxious over the first few days and do things that are out of character. This includes peeing or **poop**ing on the carpet or running through areas of the house that are usually out of bounds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Start by regularly collecting solid waste in **poop** bags and disposing of it in a sealed container. Spray your yard with the hose to help any remaining dog poo and pet urine disperse. If you have a lingering odor, use one of our simple cleaning ideas to eliminate the bad **smell**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I don’t recommend using any kind of synthetic spray, as this will merely mask the odor. Trust me, your dog can still **smell** it! An enzyme cleaner should have a light scent to it, with natural substances. I find many enzyme cleaners to have a rather noxious odor, and some can be downright too strong for pets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To put the fresh back in your breath of fresh air, use an enzymatic cleaner with live bacteria to break down and eliminate the tough odor sources. Simple Green Outdoor Odor Eliminator will help you reclaim your yard, patio, deck, and other outdoor areas from unpleasant **smell**s left behind by your dog, cat, or other outdoor animals.

Urine and **poop** are the challenging parts of owning pets, so it’s critical to learn how to deal with them. Additionally, you may find that one of these tips is what repels skunks too.

-   Yard Odor Killer Stool and Urine Deodorizer earns high marks for its efficacy and ease of use. Simply attach the container directly to your garden hose and spray away. The product is non-toxic, and thus, is an excellent resource for use around children, dogs, and cats. Yard Odor Killer Stool and Urine Deodorizer is effective at removing **smell**s on any outdoor surface including lawn furniture, patio stones, trees, and more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
