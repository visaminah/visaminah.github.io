-   The sun can fade your car’s **interior**. CCI recommends using a sunshade on the windshield during the hot summer months or cracking the windows to keep the car cooler. Prevent spills. Do your best to stop spills before they have a chance to happen by avoiding messy snacks. Make sure to only use cups with lids, and don’t pick drinks that will stain your upholstery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thanks. My mother did this on her new Honda CRV--the color she wanted only came with a black **interior**, and she didn't want that. So, rather than get a different color car with a gray **interior**, she had the dealer take it to an after market upholstery shop. She wouldn't tell me how much she spent, so I'm guessing it was over $3,000. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The obvious choice may be to obtain seat covers, door panels, trim, etc. that are in the color you want. However, this can be pricey and, in some cases, impossible if the parts can’t be found.

-   Tbh, the items I changed look fine because lots of cars with beige **interior**s have black wheels, shifters and switches. Once you go farther and change major pieces it begins to look hodge-podge. So at this point I think I'll either stick with what I've done, or else change out everything. Which is not that difficult, but it is very time-consuming and expensive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As with any investment, it’s important to understand the benefits of restoring the **interior** of the cars in your fleet or your personal vehicle before dismissing the repair.

-   Thinking about the future of my garage queen e30 vert. Thinking about eventually doing the old beige **interior** is some sort of brown leather, as 27 years is starting to show it's age (albeit no rips yet!)
