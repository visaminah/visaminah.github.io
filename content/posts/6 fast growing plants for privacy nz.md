## 6 Things About Fast Growing Plants For Privacy Nz | Green screens
-   However, take care not to overdo feeding or watering. Native **plants** don’t like soil that is too wet, and they can be sensitive to excessive fertiliser. Bear in mind too, that the fastest growing varieties require the most frequent trimming. Patience is a virtue rewarded with reduced maintenance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Classy clipped hedges offer year-round structure, as well as shelter and **privacy**. The finest formal hedges are created from evergreens with small close-packed leaves, which is why Corokia is so popular. Totara also makes beautiful formal hedge and deserves to be planted more often. Big leaf shrubs, such as glossy Griselinia make a nice formal hedge too, but slicing them with hedge sheers can make them look butchered. This can be avoided by trimming with secateurs, a much more labour intensive job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A common choice for **privacy** in Australian gardens, Syzygium smithii can grow up to five metres tall relatively quickly, and varieties range from large trees to small shrubs. They have dense foliage, oval-shaped glossy leaves, and new foliage can appear in a variety of colours. These range from vibrant pinks to fiery oranges and bright reds. Flowers can vary from small to “showy”( but are always “powder puff” looking), and colourful berries follow the flowers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A thick living screen is the most effective buffer to wind, dust and salt spray, but the **plants** we choose to protect us and our gardens need to be tough themselves. Shelter is often the first thing planted in a coastal garden, and coastal natives, like Olearia, karo (Pittosporum crassifolium) and pohutukawa are among the best. Established shelter trees will give protection for up to ten times their height. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a smaller garden and prefer a tree-like shrub rather than a tall specimen, many grevillea species can be “trained” to take on a tree shape and grow reasonably quickly. Taller grevilleas include Moonlight, which has white flowers, Honey Gem golden-orange flowers, and Sandra Gordon yellow flowers, which can be grown successfully into small, slender trees. You simply select a plant with a single stem and remove the lower growing branches as it grows. These varieties can grow from three to eight metres high and when closely planted, provide dappled shade and **privacy**. Birds and insects also love their nectar-rich flowers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Beautiful Podocarpus totara is a large slow growing tree, but with regular trimming it can be kept to almost any size and, although young **plants** are slow to thicken, it makes a stunning long-term hedge. The choice of olive green or gold has now been expanded with the arrival of ‘Matapouri Blue’, which has stunning blue-gray foliage. Totara is frost hardy and wind tolerant, although not ideal for coastal conditions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
