Ultimately, the key is to create a relaxing **room**, allowing space and **room** to breathe around artworks and furniture,' advises Helen Armon-Jones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the easiest ways to fill a large living **room** **wall** is with artwork â€“ whether a single piece, a collection or in a gallery **wall** style. 'A commanding piece of statement art is ideal for filling a large **wall**, as it wonâ€™t take up valuable floor space. Two to three pieces hung together is also effective,' advises Cynthia Masters, designer and founder of Panageries (opens in new tab). You can then use the colors and textures in the piece (or pieces) to guide your interior design and color palettes, resulting in a beautifully harmonious space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A folding screen can act as a statement piece while decorating the blank **wall** in your living **room**. A traditional folding screen might sound a bit odd, but it works beautifully as a **wall** decor without requiring any installation. Simply place it in the corner or line it along an empty **wall**, and the folding screen will become the main attraction of the **room**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hereâ€™s a peek at that Family Room I recently remodeled. I went with 3 large prints when I decorated the large **wall** over the couch. That extra height made sense on those 9â€² high **wall**s. You can see how I painted the built in bookshelves in another post. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The grid gallery **wall** follows a theme and offers a streamlined and symmetrical artwork display. If you own any favorite art collection or series, the grid-themed style is the best way to decorate the gallery **wall**. Or, you can also arrange some botanical prints for creating a beautiful grid gallery **wall** in your living **room**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you love literature, then a bookshelf is the perfect way to fill a large living **room** **wall**. There are plenty of bookshelf ideas for living **room**s meaning you can find the perfect design to suit your space and living **room** layout. A floor-to-ceiling built-in bookshelf will create a feature **wall** effect that will add texture and color to your **room** â€“ we love the geometric blocked look of this design â€“ as well as helping you in organizing a living **room**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moreover, a console table goes well with both modern and traditional styles of interior decoration. So, no matter the style of your living **room** space, a console table can be perfect for decorating the large empty **wall**. However, if you donâ€™t have enough space to set up a large console table, you can also go for a set of benches or small stools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Perhaps pick two or three lamps of larger scale with similar shades and then mix in slimmer less obtrusive metal floor and **wall** lamps to bring lighting all around the **room**. Mixing in glass lamps can also prevent lamp overload. You can have an outlet put into the floor near the perimeter of a conversation area for a lamp cord if it isnâ€™t convenient to plug it in the **wall**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Consider backlighting your driftwood for extra drama. The gnarled beauty of this piece casts shadows on the **wall**s because of the lights. Gorgeous. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One common option is to do a **wall** of built-in cabinets or bookcases. However, they are usually the most expensive option. If you are thinking of doing built-in cabinetry, consider if doing so will add value to your home. Or, maybe the subsequent owners might want to rip it all out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first board is from my old living **room**. This is the Donald cabinet before Laurel impulsively (but happily) painted it Cotton Balls. (you can see it painted by clicking on the link) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your TV is floating in a big, empty space, try to surround it with art, creating a gallery **wall**. When the TV is off, itâ€™ll blend right in with the frames. This is an especially useful idea if youâ€™re looking to design a living **room** that doesnâ€™t focus on the TV. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In a small **room**, you will likely only have **room** for one conversation area and no additional space for furniture groupings. Large **room**s can function as so much more than just a large sitting area, but you might have to get creative with how to best utilize the size or shape of the **room** you have. Identify several possible functional areas within the **room**, such as a conversation zone (or two or three!), a media zone, an area for a writing desk, a console or a game table, a dining area or perhaps a reading area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To that end, I made several boards for sharing some ideas for a big living **room** **wall**. At the top and left side, of some of them, youâ€™ll see some boxes. Those represent one foot. Most of these **wall**s are about 18 to 20 feet. If your **wall** is bigger, youâ€™ll probably need larger furniture, or itâ€™s also okay to have a little breathing space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Create greater punch by bringing together four chairs and a round ottoman or table rather than just two chairs. Chairs are less visually divisive in a **room** than a sofa so they can create a pleasing flow and conversation area in large spaces, small **room**s or awkward areas with challenging traffic patterns. Anytime you can use several of anything like double footstools, two lamps or sets of chairs, the impact will be greater! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With big, spacious **wall**s come big decorating dreamsâ€”and plenty of stress to go around. Should you go vintage or contemporary? Simple or maximalist? The countless possibilities of decorating a **wall** are equal parts thrilling and paralyzing, so we rounded up a few large **wall** decor ideas for living **room**s to point you in the right direction. Read on to find the perfect idea to bring your space to life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No matter what size of a **room** you have, lighting can make a difference in how the **room** feels. Fortunately with a large **room** there are often more windows, so during the day lighting isnâ€™t as much of a concern. But shadows and dark corners can make everyone feel uneasy at night. If you have just one center ceiling light, you will likely want to add more light with lamps. A **room** can look awkward if you have too many lamps, though, so here are a couple of tips for lighting a large **room**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Creating a **wall** of curtains will help you fill up any large and empty space in your living **room** and amp up the **room**â€™s aesthetic appeal. Just make sure that the color of your curtains goes perfectly well with the color of the **wall**s. So, carefully consider the color scheme before choosing the curtains for your new curtain panels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You could also do different colors and styling. This would be for a slightly smaller **wall**. I think itâ€™s best if thereâ€™s a little breathing **room**, like 6â€³-12â€³, on either side of the piece of furniture. But, if itâ€™s tighter than that, it should be okay. But the moulding of the piece of furniture should not touch the **wall**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, you can add a sculptural dimension to your otherwise bare living **room** by installing sconces having unique and interesting shapes. Whatâ€™s more, **wall** lighting can help open up space in your living **room** and brighten it up. A pair of sconces also goes perfectly well with modern and traditional living **room** styles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Well, yes, and no. Usually, itâ€™s not a good idea to line up the furniture along a long **wall**. We discussed this in one of my favorite posts about 21 Interior Design Mistakes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Plus, installing some glass sconces, such as the Murano Glass Chandelier and some floating shelves, can transform the entire space and brighten up the **room**. Theyâ€™ll add a dramatic visual dimension to the **room** along with the sleek TV design. So, creating a TV **wall** can be an excellent way to use the empty space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Decorating with mirrors is always a good idea â€“ whether you're looking to fill a **wall** in a living **room**, bed**room**, bath**room** or even kitchen. 'Living **room** mirrors are a great way to fill the space on the **wall**. As well as adding texture and dimension to the **room**, it can also make a small living **room** look bigger by reflecting light back into the space,' says Brittany Farinas, creative director, House of One (opens in new tab). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The reflection of the windows on that cheap plastic film ruined those fun posters. Removing it let the bold colors POP against that light paint color on the **wall**. You can also see how I used boards (Tip 6) to get those posters level and evenly spaced in this picture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A huge piece covering the entire **wall** will command the eye and serve as an impressive focal point. You could also hang multiple paintings side by side or in a grid to add a little variety. While many artists sell complementary pieces that would look great together, you donâ€™t necessarily have to buy a set. You can unify eclectically sourced paintings through their colors, styles, themes, or frames. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light fixtures are an often-overlooked way to make a statement, so keep an eye out for attention-grabbing sconces, lamps, or overhead fixtures. For a painting or fireplace smack in the middle of the **wall** without much **room** on either side, try placing two intricately designed sconces on either side. By framing the feature in this way, you subtly draw attention toward it while filling in the gaps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If **wall** hangings and other artworks cannot fill up the entire space in your living **room**, you can always go for a full-length bookcase installation. A bookcase system with tall bookshelves with a floor-to-ceiling design can be ideal for decorating large **wall**s. You donâ€™t need to worry about installing costly paintings or artwork if you go for this **wall** decor idea. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In a large space there tends to be more furniture and accessories, which can feel a bit haphazard. One way to tie a large **room** of furniture together and unify your style is through repetition. Repeating fabric patterns or colors on chairs or throw pillows will help carry your eye around the **room** and feel visually more pleasing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Similarly, placing tall plants, like a tall faux fig tree, can act as the statement piece and be the focal point in your living **room**. It will add a splash of greenery and make the **room** look fresh and organic. You can turn the entire place around by positioning a tall plant in front of the large, bare **wall**. It can perfectly complement a modern or traditional living **room** style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
