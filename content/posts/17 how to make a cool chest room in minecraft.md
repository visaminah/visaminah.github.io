## 17 Fun Facts How To Make A Cool Chest Room In Minecraft | Minecraft Hobbit Hole Storage Room Tutorial
-   A storage **room** is just about the most practical build you could ever make. It's all about practicality, about organising your things so that you always know exactly where to go to find what you're looking for. Minecraft gives you lots of tools like signs and item frames to help with such a build, and if you're putting in that much effort then you might as well make the place look nice! Check out the lovely storage **room** build above by YouTuber "TheMythicalSausage" and let yourself be inspired. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These houses are usually built with a farm inside them. Since there’s a lot of wood around us, **chest** **room**s are going to be an obvious creation in such houses. These houses are so popular because Minecraft forests are a resource hub. You can mine directly under them and collect food, alongwith other unminable items from the area around your house. As for the blueprint, Youtuber Reimiho has a simple and effective tutorial that you can use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It doesn’t get much safer than a hidden underground base with a secret water entrance in a pond. As an added bonus, you’ll get a bed**room** with a netherportal, and its own farm and mine entrance. For a much simpler underground base , skip the spinning rims and just dig, build, and hide your own underground house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Minecraft mod community loves to create features that many Minecraft players want to make their base feel more like home. With Macaw’s Furniture, you can recreate any **room** in your IRL home with nightstands, cupboards, dressers, and wardrobes, each with their color variations depending on the type of wood you use. And if you run out of ideas, check out some of our furniture ideas to complement this amazing Minecraft storage mod! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Above is one of the most basic house-plan you can easily survive in. It barely looks like a house but is safe enough to not have you get killed by the mobs. You can always throw in glass, carpet, and stone to add an extra touch of elegance to it. So make sure that you have at least 6-8 blocks empty inside it to place a bed and a **chest**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In Minecraft, there are multiple ways you can decide how you'll store items. People, in general, mostly build separate storage **room**s where they'll have everything they need in one place. Now, if you have ever wondered how to create a good-looking storage **room** in your base, this article will show you our top five Minecraft storage **room** ideas. Of course, each and everyone is different, so you'll definitely find an idea you'll want to incorporate into your Minecraft base. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Deep in the forest, high above the ferns, you’ll build a getaway that would make an Ewok jealous. This unbelievable double treehouse has everything you need to live it up in the canopy, including storage **room**s, a campfire area, and a lookout. If you don’t have lots of free time, try a simple starter treehouse tutorial instead - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   InfernoSD 7 years ago #4 One **chest** for every type of item would be too extreme. Maybe that would make sense if you're playing on PC with an enormous world and dozens of players, but in my world I couldn't justify having one **chest** for just cookies, one for just spiderwebs, etc. It would be too much trouble to build all that, and then everytime you returned home from an expedition you'd have to run around sorting your stuff out for ten minutes again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Depending on who you ask, a cathedral can be even more grand and opulent than a medieval castle. A cathedral is a huge block of architectural splendour which gives you so many opportunities for interesting designs, patterns, and block choices. The above cathedral was built by YouTuber "Lanwan Builds", and it's a recreation of Win**chest**er Cathedral, a building I've walked around many times and been inside once or twice as well. It's an incredible building, and such a build in Minecraft will be worthy of the blood, sweat, tears, and Diamonds you put into it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adding mods to Minecraft can completely revamp your gaming experience for the better. Many people get tired of cluttered inventory on their bases and try searching for Minecraft storage mods, especially with the release of the 1.17 update rendering many popular additions incompatible. After all, you only get to store up to 27 stacks in a single **chest**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Run up the Jolly Roger and roll out the cannons! It’s easier than you’d think to build a majestic medieval ship in Minecraft. This one boasts 3 masts, a poop deck, and a huge cargo hold below. The luxury state**room** is an added bonus. You can build a simpler ship in just 15 minutes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Privacy is important. If having your own Minecraft world isn't enough, build yourself a secret **room** in your Minecraft world. Watch this video to learn how to build a hidden **room**, perfect for storage of the most valuable items in Minecraft beta. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A major difference that players face in a nether base is the mobs. If your base is large enough, you might have mobs spawning inside. There’s also a risk of Ghasts noticing you and harming you within your walls. A good way to avoid disasters is to make multiple exit nether portals with a bed and **chest** next to them on the other end. As for the building plan, you can refer to the easy-to-follow tutorial by Youtuber Reimiho. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Kicking off our list, Iron Chests is one of the most popular Minecraft storage mods for any player looking to expand their containers options. With this mod, you can create several **chest**s based on ores, varying in color and size depending on their rarity. Everyone is expecting their update for 1.17, and considering the addition of the new ore, we are dying to know what a Copper **chest** would look like! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many classic RPGs have urns that players can break to obtain loot. Based on this trope, this mod adds urns which you can craft with bricks. These containers will crack and eventually break if they fall from at least three blocks to the ground, so they can also add a unique detail to any **room** inside your base. They’re a great mod if you want to go with a fantasy-styled world, especially if you feel like adding good-looking blocks to your save file to set the right atmosphere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What sets Expanded Storage apart from other Minecraft storage mods comes from the ability to combine the new **chest**s vertically or on both horizontal axis. There has always been a debate inside the community on whether Forge or Fabric is the best option for installing mods in Minecraft. For us, it all comes down to a matter of preference! Some of the custom **chest**s included with Expanded Storage are the Christmas **chest**, Pumpkin **chest**, and even an Obsidian **chest**, granting immunity to explosions to that particular container. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
