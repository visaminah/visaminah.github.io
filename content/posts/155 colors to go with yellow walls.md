That is the vibrancy of the color, that even a single **yellow** accent wall is more than enough to give your room a certain character. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to tone down **yellow**’s energy a bit, darker coffee-brown wood tones also look great. Dark brown furniture can hold its own against even the brightest of **yellow**s.

Crisp white wall trim and molding can really pull this look together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Make things easier for yourself by first focusing on your primary colour. No, we don't mean only red, blue or **yellow** - simply the shade you want to take precedence in the space.

-   Not all shades and undertones of **yellow** can be used for bedrooms.

The dark **colors** from the wall paintings above the bed stand out to provide visual focus. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re going for a fresh, spring-inspired color scheme, combining leafy green and **yellow** is a great choice. One of the best ways to do this is to include actual greens in your room. Potted plants make a statement against soft **yellow** walls. Or if you wish, you can simply place a few plants in **yellow** pots around the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But you also can go very bold with this look. A dark charcoal accent wall can certainly make a statement, especially if you add a few largely **yellow** wall hangings. And as is the case with bright **yellow** and most other dark **colors**, charcoal and **yellow** patterns make a memorable addition, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes, one color is used to keep another color (or color combo) from feeling cliché or predictable. Yellow paired with blue and grey generally accomplishes this aim with finesse. Using it solely as an accent to the classical and/or nautical vibe of blue and grey, **yellow** is a perfect choice to emphasize a variation in architecture or a diagonal line among other perpendicular lines, among other things. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Try adding a violet accent wall with **yellow** wall hangings to a room that’s mostly white. A series of gold hanging lamps can help dress up the look even more.

-   It’s not just the color that matters in design but also the materials and finishes that it’s paired with. In this kitchen for example we’re dealing with a rather unexpected type of décor. There’s **yellow** tiles on the walls and the countertops as well as the island while the ceiling features a natural brick design. It’s a busy but interesting design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yellow is not just an exciting color. It’s also one of the most fun **colors** to play around with when it comes to home decorating. Depending on the shades and undertones, it can have different personalities and impacts to a room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purple is another opposite color to **yellow**, making it a great match for **yellow** walls. You can pick rich purple shades for curtains to accent your light **yellow** walls. The dark purple shade will offer a crisp contrast with bright **yellow** walls like sunny **yellow** and golden **yellow**, while pale purple will add a softer touch to the area. Pick **yellow** and purple cushions to adorn your furniture to give your room a lovely modern feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a natural look, try beige curtains to match **yellow** walls. Since these **colors** are quite close on the color spectrum, they work together well.

Try a medium brown wooden table with a bright **yellow** table runner. Or if you prefer, hang brown picture frames on a soft **yellow** wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's important to work with your light when selecting the right **yellow** for your walls. Yellow automatically invites light into your space. Even darker rooms become warm and welcoming with a touch of **yellow**. That said, make sure you use your natural light to select the right colour for the mood you want to create. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Champagne also makes a nice wall color if you want a neutral but are looking for something that isn’t beige. With this color scheme, adding a few **yellow** accents throughout the room can create some more energy. But with this combination, it’s a good idea to include a little black or very dark brown to act as a grounding influence. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Getting back to the basics of color theory and the color wheel, **colors** that go with **yellow** must include, and always have included, the other two primary **colors**. Red and **yellow** are particularly effective visually because they are the two warm primary **colors** (blue is cool), so they naturally stick together.
