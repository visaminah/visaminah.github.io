## 17 Things You Should Know About Hot Water Heater Shut Off Valve Not Working | Water Valve Doesn'T Shut Off Completely
-   For one, you often need to start a pilot light. The pilot light aids in heating the unit. Sometimes, the pilot light is easy to light. Other times, lighting a water **heater** pilot light can be a real pain! This can depend on the unit’s location – if the water **heater** is in a dark, dank basement, it will be more difficult to get it started. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **heater** itself may use gas or electricity to heat the water. The tank is what holds the water. The tank works with the heating component to have gallons of hot water ready when you need it. When you turn on the hot water, the hot water leaves through the outgoing water line, and cold water refills the tank, and the **heater** begins heating again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, you should turn off your water **heater** if the house water is shut off for an extended time. Your water **heater** has a tank that contains water. As long as you don’t use the water, it stays in the water **heater** (this depends on the type of water **heater**). If, for any reason, the water levels fall in the tank, then it’s best to turn off the water **heater**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That assembly also has a pilot light, and the flames are supposed to be about half an inch high with blue tips. A small **valve** called a thermocouple is part of the pilot light; it is also called a flame sensor. Plumbing Solutions explains the three main problems that can cause gas water **heater**s to shut off. If the thermocouple, pilot light or any other components are dirty, this can cause the unit to turn off, and you will need to call a plumber to clean it out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Near the bottom of the water **heater**, you’ll find a spout to drain the water. This spout can be routed into a floor drain. Here’s a video that explains how to turn off the water **heater**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mr. Plumber explains that when the hot water is repeatedly cut off, it is probably because the hot water **heater** keeps tripping the breaker. If the water in the tank is more than 180 degrees, the reset button will shut off the power. These tanks have two thermostats and two heating elements, and if one of the thermostats is not working, one of the elements may keep heating the water, and the thermostat may need to be replaced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The same thing happens with traditional water **heater**s. The interior of the water **heater** is often coated with components that can burn up if there’s no water in the tank. In fact, some professionals site water loss in a water tank as one of the primary reasons they blow up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Should you turn off a tankless water **heater** if the main water is off? Well, it’s less important than turning off the regular water **heater**. It’s up to you and the manufacturer. Some tankless water **heater**s may benefit from being turned off, but for most, it isn’t an issue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These days, there are many types of water **heater**s and plumbing systems. Want the best advice? Find your water **heater**’s manufacturer and give them a call. Ask them what your water **heater** can and cannot handle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are several times you should always turn off a water **heater**, such as if the water **heater** is leaking, or if you’ll be away for several weeks. So, in this section, we’ll go over the steps required to turn off a water **heater**. It’s always best to follow the manufacturer’s guidelines, as every water **heater** is a little different in its setup. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Electric water **heater**s keep your home’s water hot enough to run your washing machine and dishwasher and also keep your shower and tub water nice and toasty. If your water **heater** keeps shutting off, you will need to troubleshoot the issue. A basic understanding of how this appliance works is a good first step. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can usually turn off the gas with a switch nearby the water **heater**. There is usually a simple **valve** that needs to be turned off. However, depending on the situation, you may also want to cut the gas supply to your house to prevent carbon monoxide gases in your house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tankless water **heater**s have two advantages. First, they don’t have a big supply of water that takes a lot of energy to heat and risks leaking. Second, instant water **heater**s provide a near-endless supply of hot water, unlike tank systems which can become easily overloaded with too much use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your gas water **heater** reset button keeps tripping, you will need to address it differently. Gas water **heater**s also take in cold water, which is heated with gas burners at the bottom. The water heats, rises and exits through a hot water discharge pipe. A gas regulator assembly on the outside of the tank controls the burner that heats up the water. There is also an exhaust flue designed for exhaust gas to flow up and out through a vent pipe or chimney. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the thermostats and heating elements are functioning properly, the electric water **heater** reset button might be the source of the problem. Regardless of the water temperature, the reset button could be going on and off by itself. Reset buttons are part of the tank’s upper thermostat, so this entire component might need to be replaced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cold water enters the electric water **heater** tanks via the dip tube. Once inside the tank, the heating element warms the water, and it rises up the tank. Then, it leaves the tank through the heat-out pipe and travels to where it is needed. Despite this simple process, problems do occur from time to time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   According to How Stuff Works , water **heater** tanks hold about 40 to 60 gallons of water, and the exteriors are insulated with polyurethane foam or a similar material, covered by an outer shell. The water gets into the **heater** via a dip tube on the bottom, and it is then heated. There are three main **valve**s: a drain **valve** for emptying the tank, a pressure relief **valve** and a shutoff **valve** to stop water from flowing in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
