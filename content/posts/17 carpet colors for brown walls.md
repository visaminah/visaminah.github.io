## 17 Tips for Carpet Colors For Brown Walls | What Goes With Brown Walls
-   The overall colour scheme of a room not only enhances its aesthetics, it can also set the tone and style for the rest of your home. Ideally, the colour of your **carpet**s should come from the same palette as the walls as well as some of your furniture. Contrasting colours can be added with other décor and accessories like bedding, rugs, artwork and cushions, but you want to avoid colours that result in an unsightly visual clash. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also take home **carpet** samples to see whether they present in the same way as they do in the showroom. They allow you to mix and match samples, compare them to furniture and décor, and take the time to choose carefully. With the addition of a flooring expert to give you professional advice, your floor coverings will make a world of difference to your home and your lifestyle! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This year, some **carpet** trends include natural fibre **carpet**s made from materials like wool, jute, sisal and seagrass. They offer a similar organic look and feel to hardwood, without the price tag! Stripes are also trending and are a great way to make a small room appear wider or longer. Designs range from big, bold patterns to thinner stripes for a more subtle statement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When choosing a suitable **carpet** for your home, it’s essential to rely on the advice of professionals. There are so many flooring options available, and the choice can be overwhelming! Flooring focussed companies employ staff that are fully trained to help bring your interior decorating ideas to life. They also have showrooms filled with rugs and **carpet** tiles that offer a realistic opportunity for you to get a feel for the perfect style, texture and colour of the floor covering for your home. This gives you a chance to relax, de-stress and enjoy the whole buying experience! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Conversely, if your home has fewer occupants or you are **carpet**ing a room that’s not always in use (like a bedroom), lighter and/or plush **carpet**s may be the way to go. Bear in mind that in both instances, **carpet**s will appear lighter once installed and will fade over time, so it might be worth choosing a colour that is a shade or two deeper than you initially had planned. Once you’ve decided on the **carpet**s, you can then decide how best to complete the room’s design by choosing the colour of the walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These types of **carpet**s feature yarn that is … yes, you guessed it, formed into loops. They come in a range of variations — some have a ribbed pattern giving them a sisal look, some a linear, formal look, and random loop piles give **carpet**s a casual, textured look. Styles include: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With wonderfully warm undertones, brown **carpet** is the ideal way to make your space feel cosy. Family-friendly and perfect for those with pets, it’s also the ideal way to cover up accidental stains! This hide-anything hue works well in the hallway, where it exudes an inviting atmosphere while hiding dirt from heavy footfall. When used in the bedroom or living room, it offers all the warm fuzzy feeling of a hug from a cuddly bear, creating the ideal conditions for comfort. Speaking of cuddly bears, brown **carpet** can also be used in the nursery or kids’ bedrooms, where it easily stands up to stains and wear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An important factor when choosing your **carpet** colour is how much foot traffic the room will get. For example, suppose you have a large family or entertain regularly — lighter **carpet**s may not be ideal in often-used rooms, as they will suffer wear and discolouration over time. This is also the case if you have little ones and/or pets that tend to leave mess wherever they go! Colour-blended, patterned and accented neutral **carpet**s can obscure stains and dirt and also add a little personality to a busy household. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Neutral **carpet**s are a safe choice, but the word “neutral” certainly doesn’t have to mean “boring”! Neutrals can include colours like off whites, taupes, greys, oatmeal, beige and stone, and are a great base palette for the addition of accent colours. If you decide on a vibrant wall colour, a neutral **carpet** colour can subdue and balance out your room’s interior. And if you decide on a bolder colour in your **carpet**s, you can introduce more neutral tones via the walls and other furnishings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to interior design, trends come and go, and what might be “in fashion” today may not be in years to come. Remember the bright feature wall craze? That was soon replaced with a trend towards white and café latte palettes. Because **carpet**s are such a big investment, they are certainly not something you want to be updating every year or so! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark and light colours in **carpet**s can also have different effects, including on the brightness and vitality of a room. Light colours can open up a room, making a smaller room appear more sizeable. When used in dark, narrow hallways, they can minimise that “boxed in feeling”. Neutral beige **carpet**s can also create an “airy” and bright feeling, so they are ideal in compact living areas like studies and guest rooms or in smaller homes like apartments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Colours also tend to follow the patterns of nature. For example, blues and greens can denote the cooler feel of a crisp winter morning, while reds and oranges create a warm glow like that obtained from a sunny day or a warming open fire. Therefore considering “layering up” your preferred colour palette — from the furniture and walls to the furnishings and **carpet**s — to help you choose the right balance of tone and mood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Old, worn or out-dated **carpet**s can have a negative and dramatic effect on a room. And just like furniture and wall colourings, **carpet**s can be a significant financial investment, so need careful consideration. Here are some tips for choosing the perfect **carpet** colour for your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Firmly in the family of neutrals, brown **carpet**s can look beautiful alongside a range of interior design schemes. It works particularly well with washed-out whites and natural wooden furnishings for a clean, contemporary space that never feels cold. You can also pair it with muted blue walls for a more classic look, complete with leather-bound furniture and accessories. Our range of brown **carpet**s includes every sepia shade under the sun, from rich mocha to faded toffee tones. There are also plenty of materials to choose from, including super-soft nylon or polypropylene, hard-wearing wool, and everything else in between. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Elegant squares can add interest without overtaking a room, and low-key patterns in neutral colours like white or grey can add a contemporary look and feel. Plaid **carpet**s are also becoming popular. Plaids are traditional yet trendy and a great way to add depth to a space. They work well in most rooms and have an additional benefit. They act as a grid for arranging your furniture! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A blue and yellow label identifies a **carpet** that has been graded for residential use. Residential ratings can have a maximum of six stars, and the rating system allows you to quickly decide which **carpet** is suitable for your needs. A black and gold label identifies a **carpet** graded for contract or commercial use. Contract ratings can have a maximum of four stars. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are redecorating a room, first choose the colour of the furniture (tables, couch, shelves etc.), then the curtains, **carpet**s and finally the walls. In the world of interior design, this is the preferred method to follow because typically furniture colours are more restricted than that of curtains and **carpet**s. If you can’t follow this sequence for whatever reason, play it safe and stick to a neutral palette throughout. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
