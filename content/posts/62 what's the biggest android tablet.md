-   The Galaxy Tab S6 also happened to be the first Samsung **tablet** to feature a dual camera setup at the back. Despite being a year old, it’s still one of the best Samsung **tablet**s for its $729 price tag, and can often be purchased at a discount these days. That’s because it offers a better display than the base Galaxy Tab S7 and there’s really no significant difference in performance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   NETFLIX free. Netflix launched in the UK in January 2012, meaning that its impressive **tablet** apps now have an audience on this side of the Atlantic too. Browse its catalogue of films and TV shows, then watch them on the device. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our Android **tablet**s use the very latest, cutting-edge technology. Whether it’s for entertainment, work or casual gaming, you’re sure to find the perfect **tablet** for you. View our full range of Android **tablet**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   DUNGEON DEFENDERS SECOND WAVE free. This is another game that'll show off the graphical grunt of your (high-end) Android **tablet**. The gameplay is a mixture of action-RPG and tower defence, as you set your defences then run around swinging at attackers as they pile in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An iPad is a **tablet**. Generally, the world of **tablet**s is split between iOS devices and Android devices. Android devices allow you to install third-party apps, while iOS puts roadblocks against that sort of thing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some caveats. First, this is aimed more at people unboxing an Android **tablet** for the first time, so some of the suggestions may seem obvious to experienced owners. Second, any selection of this kind will be tinged by the personal preferences of the writer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Samsung Galaxy Tab A One of the few compact drawing **tablet**s with pen support. The **tablet** features a smaller 8-inch screen and a slender S Pen making it easier to carry with you. Stylus: Active (Pressure sensitive) Check on Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It may be an oversimplification, but the best Android **tablet**s should come close to replicating the same experience as a smartphone, but with a larger screen. We won’t go so far as to say it should feel like a laptop, the Android OS makes that an almost impossible dream. But a good **tablet** should make you want to use it. Otherwise, you’ll always reach for your phone instead. Here are a few things we considered when picking out the best Android **tablet**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nobody makes Android **tablet**s the way Samsung does. The company is an outlier as it still comes out with a flagship Android **tablet** every year. As part of the company’s vision to offer something for everyone, Samsung’s lineup also includes mid-range and affordable options. Its flagship **tablet**s have really come into their own over the past few years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Battery backup is one of the most important features of the **tablet**. The whole point of getting a **tablet** is portability. A **tablet** with poor battery performance really limits its uses – especially outdoor uses. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This variety can often present a challenge to those who just want to know what the best Samsung Galaxy **tablet**s are. To help them out, we have created this list of best Samsung **tablet**s which breaks down the strength of each option and explains who should buy them, and why. In addition to detailed information about each **tablet**, you’ll also find links to our in-depth reviews for these **tablet**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   GOOGLE SKY MAP free. It's currently being cut loose – sorry, open sourced – by Google, but its in-house Sky Map app remains a joy. Hold your **tablet** in the air at night, and get an instant guide to what all those stars are called. A handy search mode is good for planet-spotting too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Samsung launched the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite earlier this year with the sole purpose of bringing the S Pen to the masses. Previously, one needed to purchase Samsung’s flagship **tablet** just to get the S Pen experience. With the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite, Samsung has significantly lowered that barrier of entry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the exciting features of the Tab S8 is its ability to connect to a PC and essentially work as a second screen. This can be very handy. The second awesome feature of the S8 is the ability to use your smartphone as a color palate in “Clip Studio Paint” and the **tablet** as a canvas when drawing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   GRAND THEFT AUTO III £2.99. 10 years after it was first released for consoles, GTA III returns for **tablet**s (and smartphones).

-   ZINIO free. An increasing number of magazines are launching bespoke apps for iPad, if not Android **tablet**s. One good way to plug the gap is Zinio, which sells digital replicas of a large range of mags from its in-app store. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Features: If you line up a bunch of Android **tablet**s and ensure that they are off, these devices tend to run together. Of course, there are a few outliers that stand out, especially when these devices are viewed from the back. Flashy cameras, responsive smart pens, and glitzy screens are just a few of the just-under-the-surface features that you didn’t even know you wanted. Surprises are good, especially if they add an extra quality-of-life layer to the whole package. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   IMDB MOVIES & TV free. The world's biggest database of film and TV information is really impressive on Android **tablet**s, enabling you to browse the database and watch trailers. There's a US focus, but it's still useful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Huawei Mediapad M5 Lite A good alternative to Samsung **tablet**s with good stylus support. But limited in the number of drawing apps available since it does not has the official google app store. Stylus: Active (Pressure sensitive) Check on Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An Android **tablet** should have as much space as you need. With light use, you likely won’t need more than a couple of hundred gigabytes. For gaming and content creation, air on the side of caution and opt for at least 500 GB. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Talking about important things, here is something which is not really important but still brands try to make it one.

-   TUNEIN RADIO PRO £0.61. The TuneIn Radio app has been a huge success on various platforms, and while it doesn't make major use of **tablet** bells'n'whistles, we'd still recommend it for Android slate owners.

-   Professionelle Geräte für Fotografen und Illustratoren Grafiker, Illustratoren und Fotografen haben schon lange die Vorteile von Android-Tablets erkannt.

-   A **tablet** should never be purchased alone. For one, these thin and incredibly fragile devices should be stored and transported in a shock-proof case to protect them from any accidental damage.
