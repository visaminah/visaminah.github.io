-   Plus, many of the **paint**s in our above list come in various colors and can be used on multiple surfaces including glass, ceramics, wood, paper, and canvas. Finally, select **paint**s listed above are safe for children to use and are U.S. ASTM D-4236 and European EN71-3- compliant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These are not as popular for working with glass. However, you might want to opt for solvent-based **paint** if you prefer working with oils. The colors can either be transparent or opaque. Prepare for a vibrant and glossy result. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting with **acrylic**s on wood is different from working with traditional flat surfaces because the **paint** doesn’t immediately soak in to create a smooth finish. It can take several coats before you see any real effect, and it’s important to let each layer dry thoroughly before applying the next coat. If your work area isn’t completely dust-free, you risk introducing dust and other airborne particles back into your **paint**, causing your layers to separate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Acrylic enamels have been developed to solve the problem. Unlike traditional enamels, which are solvent-based, **acrylic** enamels are still water-based. They can be used to **paint** glass jars to light bulbs, and they dry with good scratch resistance. Most can also be hardened further by curing in a household oven (depending on the object **paint**ed). Acrylic enamels are nontoxic, though that does not mean food safe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When applying **acrylic** **paint**, you have two options. You can brush it onto the surface of the wood in either a circular or linear motion depending on how you want the end result to look. If using brushes, use a synthetic-haired brush and large flat brushes that cover a larger area of the wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   What is Acrylic Primer? Acrylic primer is a type of **paint** that is made up of two components: pigment and binder. The binder in **acrylic** primer is usually an **acrylic** resin. This type of resin creates a strong bond with the surface it is being applied to, making **acrylic** primer ideal for use on many different surfaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A good tape isn’t cheap, so I use it sparingly. Tape off the first line that will be the dividing line between **paint** and product. Next tape on paper bag or newspaper to cover the rest of the product. Do a good job covering non-**paint** areas, spray **paint** hangs in the air and a certain radius will end up with microscopic **paint** droplets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We strongly suggest you use a primer before you begin applying your coats of **paint**. Particularly because the dark color of the wood often shows through to the **paint** layer without primer. This is also important for improving the adhesion of the **paint** to the surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wood surfaces have microscopic spaces between the fibers, as they have microscopic porosity. These spaces need to be smoothed out and filled. You can use a porous primer to fill these spaces and smooth them out, while also allowing you to seal the wood’s surface, before applying **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . Keep in mind that oil-based primers do give off their own strong odor when working with them. If you are working with wood such as redwood or cedar, or any other outdoor wood that is known to stain, you can use an oil-based stain blocker.

Use a primer that creates a sealant layer in areas that may receive moisture damage (like the kitchen or the bathroom) as it will decrease the chance of mildew growth. Before you apply the layer of primer to seal the wood, use a strong bleach-water solution to remove any existing mildew and mold . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

On new drywall, you will use 3 coats of the finish material instead of a primer coat plus 2 coats of finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
