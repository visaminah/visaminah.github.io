## 75 Tips to Wireless Mouse With Best Scroll Wheel | My quest for the perfect productivity mouse
-   Below, we list the best **mouse** options for different uses and different budgets. For each one, we've outlined its strengths and weaknesses and provided links that track the best current prices. If you're an Apple user, you might also want to see our specific guides to the best **mouse** for MacBook Pro and Air (and we also have picks of the best keyboards for Mac and the best MacBook Pro accessories overall). For other options, see our guide to the best USB-C **mouse** options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We used each **mouse** for at least three days, testing it on multiple different surfaces. Every wireless **mouse** worked through a normal day and then joined us for gaming sessions. We assessed the design, the comfort in both the short and long term for differently-sized hands, connectivity, ease of setup, and customization options. We also tested for accuracy, responsiveness, and battery life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   03. Razer Pro Click The best premium **mouse** for creatives Specifications DPI: 16,000 Interface: Bluetooth, 2.4GHz wireless (pairs with up to four devices), wired Buttons: 8 Ergonomics: Right-handed Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Great ergonomics + Plenty of buttons + Super smooth operation Reasons to avoid - No left-handed version - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Razer’s Viper Ultimate, literally on the other hand, is a surprisingly competent all-purpose **mouse**. For one, as alluded to, it’s truly ambidextrous. At 74g it glides across the desk making it a pleasure to use for extended periods. With a 70 hour battery life it was joint first with the G Pro X for longevity in this category (the G502 offers around 50 hours). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best **mouse** is a vital part of a solid setup for work or for gaming, even if you're using a laptop. The best **mouse** can help you work and play more comfortably, it can give you more accuracy, and it can even improve productivity. Bundled mice that come with PCs aren't usually very ergonomic, nor do they have advanced workflow-boosting features, but, happily, there's a range of good options out there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We've picked out the best USB-C **mouse** options including wired and wireless USB-C mice at different price points. We've evaluated them all for comfort during long sessions, pressure sensitivity (dpi) and useful productivity-enhancing features such as programmable buttons. We've also considered value, making sure we've included some cheaper options as well as the best USB-C **mouse** overall (see more about how we test and review). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Razer’s Synapse also offers app-specific controls alongside a wealth of predefined media and OS shortcuts, but perhaps less comprehensive than those found in Options. That said, you do also have full macro support: Simply hit record and whatever you do next can be converted into a single click of the **mouse**. There’s even “HyperShift” which means you can add a second layer of commands while holding down an allocated button. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Predictably, the MX Master 3S does seem to do most of the things I want. BUT, only really thanks to that thumbwheel. It is particularly suited for what I need. That said, I find myself quite taken by the Pro Click, and despite lacking a second **scroll** wheel, it pretty much matches the MX Master 3S in every other manner. It’s also lighter which is a small positive in its favor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let us clarify from the outset that this is not the best USB-C **mouse** to use for regular work, nor for creative design or anything that requires a lot of precision. The **mouse** is very small and we found the experience to be jittery and frustrating at times, with the **mouse** sometimes sticking. But, that disclaimer aside, if you're looking for a **mouse** that's super light, takes up barely any space and could help you out in an emergency, this should do the job for occasional use while travelling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If a vertical **mouse** doesn't tickle your ergonomic fancy, perhaps a trackball would be more suitable; it keeps your hand in one place, and you move the pointer around by spinning the ball with your thumb. Like a vertical **mouse** it's an option that you'll need to get used to, and we wouldn't recommend one if you're planning on using it for gaming as well as work. However, if you fancy giving one a go, the Logitech MX Ergo Wireless is an excellent option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On a more minor note. During my time with MacOS I joined the dark side of “natural **scroll**.” It’s not a deal-breaker for me, as I don’t mind regular **scroll**, but Logitech and Microsoft both offer reverse **scroll**ing as a setting, Razer doesn’t appear to — though you can work around this in other ways of course. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The only real downside is that it might be just a little too tiny for some. Designed with portability in mind, it comes in a bit smaller than the average desktop **mouse** and could prove to be just a little cramped for all-day use. If you have small hands, though, it should be the perfect fit and an ideal everyday option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We've made our own pick of the best **mouse** options by looking for the best specs combined with sound ergonomics. We've sought out mice that reviewers rate as comfortable for long periods of use while offering smooth and accurate tracking – which can help avoid the frustration of having to redo wonky selections. We've also looked for devices with adjustable levels of sensitivity and programmable buttons for shortcuts that can boost the efficiency of your workflow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you need the very best **mouse** and you need it now, we'll save you a bit of time. The Logitech MX Master 3 is our clear favourite – at least if you're right-handed (there's no left-handed version, unfortunately). We find its ergonomic design makes it comfortable for all-day use. It has ample programmable buttons, not to mention a thumb wheel, which allows shortcut profiles to be setup for our favourite apps so we can blaze through repetitive tasks more quickly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This budget USB-C **mouse** is very cheap indeed. And while it's a little basic, it does the job, with an adjustable DPI up to 1,600 and a 2.4GHZ connection with a range of up to 15 metres. The battery life isn't the most impressive (the manufacturer claims 15 days, but this will obviously depend on how much you use it), but it's easy to recharge. It's dual-mode, which just means that you get both a USB-C and USB-A port, which makes it a flexible option for using with different devices. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here's another decent option for anyone in search of the best USB-C **mouse**. The Seenda wireless **mouse** benefits from a noise-reduction design, enabling you to click and **scroll** silently, and its ergonomic design makes it comfortable to use all day. It also has an adjustable DPI that goes all the way up to 2,400; not the highest on offer here, but still good enough for just about anybody, even if you intend to use it for a bit of fast-paced gaming on the side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The winner of the most forgettable-looking option in this nest of mice goes to the Orochi V2. Or maybe it’s just understated? Especially for a Razer product. Looks aside, the Orochi V2 is a very capable mobile **mouse** with six buttons, Bluetooth or dongle connectivity and it works with Razer’s Synapse software, so any macros you might already have can be assigned here (or make your own!). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At 425 (2.4Ghz) or 950 hours (BLE) you get a decent amount of time out of each battery and you can use either a single AA or AAA. It weighs just 60g, so it’s also pretty nimble. At $70, it’s edging into full-desktop **mouse** territory, but given that it’s big enough to actually use this full time, that seems less surprising. Especially given that you can stow the dongle under the top cover, which is more than can be said for the MX Anywhere 3 (or even the MX Master 3S). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If constant clicking's giving your carpal tunnel cause for complaint, upgrading to one of the best **mouse** options with a proper ergonomic design can make a world of difference. Vertical mice look a little strange, but if you're serious about ergonomics, they're well worth trying because they keep your arm in a more natural neutral 'handshake' position. It can take a while to get used to, but it can be very beneficial for the wrist. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   02. Logitech MX Anywhere A more portable alternative to the MX Master Specifications DPI: 4000 Interface: Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless Buttons: 6 Ergonomic: Right-handed Battery: Rechargeable Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Box.co.uk (opens in new tab) View at John Lewis (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Compact and portable + Electromagnetic **scroll** wheel + Pairs with three devices Reasons to avoid - A little on the small side - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our favourite portable **mouse** is the Logitech MX Anywhere 3, but given the price you'd definitely kick yourself if you left it on the train. For a more reasonably-priced alternative that you can chuck in a bag and take anywhere without too much fear of losing it, we'd go for another Logitech option, the Pebble. It does the job, it's compatible with just about everything and it's cheap enough to lose without it being the end of the world. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Logitech MX Master 3's far from cheap, but we absolutely love it. You'll also find it top of our general roundup of the best mice for designers, and with good reason: it's packed with useful features, it performs brilliantly and yes, it's definitely the best USB-C **mouse** too. Its DPI goes up to 4,000, which frankly is a lot more than you're ever likely to need, but it means it'll track perfectly on pretty much any surface (including glass). It also has a stack of programmable buttons as well as a handy thumb wheel, and it's easy to set up profiles for all your apps so that you can instantly unleash your favourite shortcuts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What is the best DPI for a **mouse**? We'd generally recommend a DPI of around 1,000 for day-to-day use. There's a bit of a DPI war between gaming **mouse** manufacturers trying to eke the biggest DPI out of their sensors, but ultimately these huge numbers are impractical. The 16,000 DPI you can get out of the Razer Pro Click seems impressive, but if you tried to use it in real life the tiniest nudge of your **mouse** would send the cursor flying across the screen. An adjustable DPI can be useful however, allowing you to change the DPI for different tasks, increasing it for gaming for example. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   10. Microsoft Bluetooth Mobile Mouse 3600 The best budget **mouse** for creatives Specifications DPI: 1000 Interface: Bluetooth Buttons: 2 Ergonomics: Ambidextrous Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Box.co.uk (opens in new tab) View at AO.com (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Really, really cheap + Comfortable and easy to carry around Reasons to avoid - Smaller than most mice, not good if you are big-handed - Basic - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The latter two sound similar to the two **scroll** wheel feels offered in the Logitech MX Master 3S and 3, which is the most premium-feeling **scroll** wheel I've used. I've seen this Logitech MagSpeed wheel imitated but never executed as successfully. The Razer Pro Click Mini, for example, also lets you **scroll** smoothly or notch by notch, but it feels rattly and is loud. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Microsoft’s Surface Precision is listed as “up to 3 months” which I somehow read with an implied shrug on their part. It’s hard to know whether those are active use or “the **mouse** is on and it’s on your desk.” The better news is that all of them can be charged while you use them. In practice, I found the MX Master 3S to last the longest, but also needing a charge way sooner than its 70 days claim, in my experience it’s more like every 5-6 weeks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We've also aimed to cover different needs with some smaller, more portable mice, that aren't the most comfortable to use for a long time, but can be useful for people working on the go. For more options, see our choices of the best **mouse** overall. We also have a guide to the best **mouse** for MacBook. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best wireless mice are comfortable, accurate, and responsive. They free us from a tangle of cables and act as an extension of our will, whether we're pursuing the perfect spreadsheet or a tricky opponent in an online game. Until we find a way to think ourselves around the computer screen, the humble **mouse** remains our key to precise control. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That includes Razer's Pro 30K optical sensor, found in many of Razer's $100-plus mice. It's specced for up to 30,000 counts per inch, 750 inches per second max velocity, and a max acceleration of 70 g. All three of those are among the highest specs you can find in a **mouse** today. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   01. Logitech MX Master 3 The best **mouse** for creatives overall Specifications DPI: 4,000 Interface: Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless Buttons: 7 Ergonomics: Right-handed Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Scan (opens in new tab) View at Novatech Ltd (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Comfortable design + Can be used on different devices Reasons to avoid - Not ambidextrous - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With six buttons, it’s pretty configurable for something so small and at 99g it won’t overstay its welcome under your palm. Though for the life of me I cannot understand why there is no option to stow the USB dongle inside the **mouse** somewhere. Given its mobile nature this seems like a no-brainer. You can, of course, just use Bluetooth if, like me, USB dongles seem to vanish into thin air unless they have a home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   02. Logitech MX Anywhere 3 The best **mouse** to use on the move Specifications DPI: 4,000 Interface: Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless (pairs with up to three devices) Buttons: 6 Ergonomics: Right-handed Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Box.co.uk (opens in new tab) View at John Lewis (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Pairs with three devices + Compact and portable + Electromagnetic **scroll** wheel Reasons to avoid - Non-removable battery - Too small for some - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Razer Viper 8KHz was named best **mouse** in the Creative Bloq Awards 2022 , with the panel of judges noting that the 8K really makes a difference, providing for smoother cursor movements and lower click latency. That makes for an incredibly fast and responsive gaming **mouse**. The judges also praised its simple but comfortable ambidextrous design and its options for customisation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For one, its build quality feels far superior. It also looks more stylish (if that matters). More importantly, it has a more neutral position that feels really comfortable for a smaller **mouse** and doesn’t feel like it’s craning my hand forward. Throw in the fact that you can still assign app-specific controls via Microsoft’s Mouse and Keyboard center and you end up with something that’s smarter than it first seems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As the name suggests, the MX Anywhere 3 is the mobile version of the MX Master 3S. Unlike its bigger brother, the Anywhere has a semi-ambidextrous design. It’s perhaps a shade too small to cut it as desktop replacement, but in the mobile realm it feels premium, complete with the auto-switching between ratchet and free-flowing **scroll** wheel — which at $80, it should. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   06. Logitech MX Ergo Wireless The best trackball **mouse** Specifications DPI: 512 – 2048 Interface: Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless Buttons: 8 Ergonomics: Right-handed Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Scan (opens in new tab) View at Box.co.uk (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Comfortable design + Accurate trackball Reasons to avoid - No left-handed version - Tilt options are limited - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best USB-C **mouse** can be a real boon for your workflow. If you're looking to buy a **mouse**, a good USB-C **mouse** is probably you're best bet today, especially if you have a fairly recent laptop or PC. Even if you already have an older USB-A device, it could be worth upgrading. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   01. Logitech MX Master 3 A precise, versatile USB-C **mouse** for power users Specifications DPI: 4000 Interface: Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless Buttons: 7 Ergonomic: Right-handed Battery: Rechargeable Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Scan (opens in new tab) View at Novatech Ltd (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + High DPI + App-specific customisation Reasons to avoid - Pricey - Larger than the average **mouse** - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Who was betting on Microsoft having the most stylish **mouse** on this list? The Surface Arc is a delight with a “transforming” design that pops into shape (an “arc” no less). Once you’re done simply snap it flat again for easy storage in a pocket of your laptop bag. You don’t even need to turn it on as “snapping” it also acts as a power switch. Oh, and did I mention that the touchpad area does double duty as left/right click and vertical or sideways **scroll** (Magic Mouse style)? There’s even the option for a “triple” click to give the Surface Arc an extra, assignable button. All that, and it’s only around $55. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you buy a new PC, it’s easy to focus on the big three: Processor, graphics and RAM (sorry storage fans, that’s a close fourth). It’s the little things that are simple to overlook. I say that with the confidence of someone that just migrated over from a decade-old iMac to a part-picked PC. The rig I ended up with is solid, I had a nice keyboard already, but oh boy do I really need a new **mouse**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should look at the overall design. Additionally, it may take some time to get used to using the **mouse** in the new configuration. If you’ve ever used an ergonomic keyboard you know how different it is from a regular keyboard and there is a bit of a learning curve. The curve isn’t as substantial with a **mouse**, but you’ll need to determine if the design fits with what you’re looking for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   03. Seenda Wireless Mouse This super-silent USB-C **mouse** offers adjustable sensitivity Specifications DPI: 1000/1500/2000/2400 (adjustable) Interface: 2.4GHz wireless Buttons: 6 Ergonomic: Right-handed Battery: AA Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + High, adjustable DPI + Both USB-C and USB + 12-month warranty Reasons to avoid - Right-handed only - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We wouldn't say this is a **mouse** to be using all day, every day – we'd recommend one of the more ergonomic options on this list for regular use. But it's stylish and looks the part, especially if you're doing client presentations or similar. The metal **scroll** wheel is a delight and the **mouse** feels wonderfully accurate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Pro Click boasts an ergonomic design developed with Humanscale, a company known for its ergonomic office furniture. The **mouse** has eight programmable buttons and an adjustable DPI that goes all the way up to 16,000, making it roughly ten times more sensitive than you're ever likely to need. This is a **mouse** that's designed to be used all day, and with a battery life of up to 400 hours it'll keep on going for weeks until you need to plug it in for a recharge. It's the most expensive option in our list of the best **mouse** options, but we think it's well worth the money if you want superior ergonomics. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Inevitably, our choice as the best **mouse** overall isn't exactly cheap, so we've aimed to provide options at cheaper prices too, which we rate as the best in their class based on our own reviews and recommendations from contacts. See our how we test guide to find out more about our process. At the bottom of this guide, you'll find some tips on how to choose the best **mouse** for you, but first, here's our selection of the best **mouse** options available now. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But I've also spent time using the Apple Magic Mouse, and I like that one as well. And yet many of us at iMore use the budget options listed above and love those too. The important thing is to make note of the features you need, so you don't overspend on features you don't need. Whichever **mouse** you end up choosing, don't forget to pick up one of the best **mouse** pads as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some wireless mice offer extra buttons that can be remapped using the manufacturer’s software. Many offer extra side buttons that you can map to specific shortcuts, to smooth out common tasks. Some may even allow you to create macros that trigger a series of actions with a single button press. Taking the time to configure a **mouse** with the shortcuts you need can boost your productivity, but if you aren’t going to use them, they may just get in the way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Why use a wireless **mouse**? Removing the cord means less cord clutter on your desk, plus you're free to move the **mouse** about without getting tangled in the cord. Having to charge your **mouse** and connect it via Bluetooth is a fair trade. Here are some of the best wireless **mouse** options for your Mac. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Polling rate: This refers to how often your **mouse** is checking its position and reporting it to your computer and is measured in Hertz (Hz). A polling rate of 1,000 Hz indicates that your **mouse** is reporting its position 1,000 times per second. If you like to use a high DPI, you’ll want a high polling rate to go with it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If done well, the Naga V2 Pro could have one of the most personal **scroll** wheel experiences available. But we'll hold off on any applause until we see this working without annoying rattling noises or inconsistent behavior. Software dependence can also be a turn-off to some users, from those using multiple devices to those not wanting to dedicate computing resources to a **mouse** app. You can toggle between **scroll** wheel feels on Logitech's MX Master 3S and 3 out of the box by simply pushing a button on the **mouse**; no software is necessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This may come down to what you use the **mouse** for. If you play video games with the **mouse** you might want to add more controls to it. If you use your **mouse** for photo editing you can assign hot keys to the buttons as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **mouse** might look a little unusual, but vertical **mouse**s orient your hand and wrist in a more natural 'handshake' position, which makes them better to avoid putting tension on your wrist or contracting RSI. The Logitech MX Vertical Wireless Mouse takes a bit of getting used to but once you get used to the feel of it, it can offer great relief for your wrists. It has 6 functional buttons and is compatible with both Windows and Mac. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Google around for “the best PC **mouse**” and you’ll find one answer: Logitech’s MX Master 3. You might see a few mentions of others — like the Razer Pro Click and Microsoft’s Surface Precision **mouse** — but the reviews are clear that the MX 3 Master is the one. Since we first published this guide, Logitech has released the MX Master 3S which improves on the already popular device with a sharper sensor and quieter buttons. We’ve updated this guide accordingly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   09. Razer Viper 8KHz The best **mouse** for esports gaming Specifications DPI: 20,000 Interface: USB wired Buttons: 7+1 Ergonomics: Ambidextrous Today's Best Deals View at Scan (opens in new tab) Check Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Well-built and nice to hold + Very light. + Smooth movements and low latency Reasons to avoid - Wired-only, with quite a stiff cable - Software isn't compatible with Mac. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While the MX Master 3 is the best **mouse** for designers overall, it won't be to everybody's tastes; some may find it just a little too big and chunky, and that thumbwheel can feel like it's in the way if you're not making use of it. For a more compact and streamlined alternative perfect for taking with you wherever you go, the Logitech MX Anywhere 3 is just the ticket. Functionally, it's very similar to the MX Master (with the exception of the **scroll** wheel), and its simpler design makes it more suitable for use in either hand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main nitpick for me with the Viper is that the two buttons near your ring finger and pinkie take a little getting used to if you palm a **mouse** like I do. I had to train myself to click with the side of my finger rather than the tip. The net result is that I was surprised to find myself gravitating toward the Viper Ultimate most out of this category, despite the G502 being closer to what I had in mind when setting out on this test. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of this trio, the Pro Click offers the most configurable buttons (8). The MX Master 3S is a close second (7) but has the advantage of a second **scroll** wheel near the thumb. In reality, two of Razer’s “buttons” are side-clicks on the **scroll** wheel — typically these default to sideways **scroll**, the same as Logi’s thumb dial does. The net result is that I found the MX Master 3S slightly more configurable for my use cases. The thumbwheel is perfect for switching between desktops — something I do a lot, which would occupy two slots on the Razer meaning, effectively, the MX Master 3S has one more spare button in this setup. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're after the best USB-C **mouse** that'll play nicely with your Mac, the aptly-named Macally USB C Mouse for Mac is guaranteed to fit the bill. Its all-white looks seem to have been designed specifically to go well with any stripe of Mac, whether it's a desktop model or MacBook, and its USB-C connection plugs into any of its Thunderbolt 3 ports. And while the earlier Macally UCTURBO **mouse** had just 1,000 DPI on offer, this one has adjustable DPI all the way up to 2,400, which should be more than enough for most people. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Redragon M686 Vampire Elite is **mouse** that's hard to miss with a backlit design clearly designed for gaming. It boasts DPI up a massive 16000, eight customisable buttons and wireless 2.4Ghz nano for low latency. We've not tried this one ourselves, but gamers report being pleased with the ergonomics and build of the buttons and say it's easy to use. Battery life can be extended with an eco-mode. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The price of an ergonomic **mouse** will vary. You can pick up inexpensive options for under $20, or you can spend upwards of $100 or so on such a **mouse**. It really comes down to what you want to spend on the **mouse** and the other features you’re interested in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Modern Mobile **mouse** is Microsoft’s answer to the Pebble. Streamlined, lightweight and with a focus on the basics. There’s no 2.4GHz option here though; it’s Bluetooth only. At $35, compared to the Pebble’s $25 it might seem a foregone conclusion but there’s a lot to like about Microsoft’s take on a portable **mouse**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mice for MMO games have a special appeal. These button-laden peripherals are intended to make laying down combos in games a breeze. But their high programmability gives them great potential for much more, including heavy-duty productivity. One of the most popular MMO mice, the Razer Naga series, received an update on Thursday. Offering up to 20 customizable buttons is still the Naga's main prize, but Razer has also made the **scroll** wheel much more interesting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   04. Microsoft Classic IntelliMouse The legend returns - a great wired **mouse** Specifications DPI: 3200 Interface: Wired Buttons: 5 Ergonomics: Right-handed Today's Best Deals View at Jessops (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Box.co.uk (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Solid design + Responsive Reasons to avoid - Not wireless - Right-handed only - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your **mouse** will either take batteries, or charge with a cable. A rechargeable **mouse** means buying fewer batteries over time, but as years go by, the internal rechargeable battery will eventually falter. Rechargeables also have the advantage of plugging in to use as a wired **mouse** when needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The best USB-C mice have several benefits. For one, there's no need for an adapter if you have a newer laptop that doesn't have a USB-A port (a USB-C **mouse** is essential if you use a MacBook or iMac). But even if you have the option of USB-A, the best USB-C **mouse** offers the benefit of either-way-up connection, so should be able to plug it in on first attempt, and improved data throughput. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **scroll** wheel on Razer's new **mouse** appears to take customization to a new level. Razer says it has six different modes. Those modes, Razer's announcement said, include: Standard "for more typical in-game selections"; Distinct "for easy, definitive **scroll**ing"; Ultrafine "for the highest number of inputs"; Adaptive Scrolling "to give less resistance the faster the wheel is **scroll**ed"; and Free Scrolling "for always-on accelerated **scroll**ing." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That’s kinda it. It’s not a big ask but I soon learned there was always some mental bargaining going on trying to find the best balance. I also wanted to see what a modern **mouse** can offer beyond those requirements as, who knows, maybe there’s something I never knew I wanted or I have the sudden urge to get into Dota 2. Enter, the story I thought I’d never write: An 11-way PC **mouse** shoot out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moreover, the G502 has a button to switch between smooth and ratchet **scroll** (fast, free gliding versus clicky slow, basically). The MX Master 3S offers both types of **scroll**ing but with a setting where ratchet mode will seamlessly become smooth mode which is much more apt for browsing and navigating lists. I found **scroll**ing on the G502 a bit annoying. Much bigger “clicks” and finding the button to switch to smooth seemed to kill my flow. I am guessing it’s better for gamers though. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While we’re on the topic of buttons, the new MX Master 3S has almost no click sound at all. It makes almost every other **mouse** seem quite conspicuous by comparison. It also means the click motion feels a little smoother which all adds up to a much nicer experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So far we've seen some relatively expensive USB-C mice; if you'd rather go for something a little cheaper, take a look at the Aurtec Type C Wireless Mouse. It comes at a great price but still performs well, with a 2.4GHz wireless connection that'll work within a 10-metre range, as well as three DPI settings that you can cycle between by holding the left button and **scroll**ing the wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As satisfying as it is to click into shape, the hollow area under the arc does mean that your thumb and little finger don’t have anywhere to naturally rest. I also found the curve of the arc led me more into a claw position over my usual palm, which might be okay for you but gave me pause about using this for longer periods. As a purely mobile **mouse**, though, it’s one of the more pleasing, especially if you like its semi-trackpad nature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let’s be clear, there’s almost no chance any of the mobile mice on offer would make a great full-time desktop replacement. That said, it’s also one of the more interesting categories thanks to being free from the burden of having to do everything. A mobile **mouse** can get a little wackier and do one or two things really well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just because a **mouse** has a gaming focus, it doesn’t mean it’s no good for productivity. That was my reasoning when I looked at things like the Logitech G502 Lightspeed and the G Pro X Superlight. From Razer, the Viper Ultimate looked like another strong option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
