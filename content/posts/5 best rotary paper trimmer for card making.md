## 5 Things You Should Know About Best Rotary Paper Trimmer For Card Making | Best Rotary Paper Cutter
-   Some **rotary** **trimmer**s can easily cut through multiple sheets of paper. Once the blade gets blunt, it can easily be replaced with a new blade. The blades are cheap to buy and can be found in most craft shops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We like this cutter for its design, its versatility, and above all its impressive performance. The 18-inch **trimmer** provides ample space for most paper sizes, and the metal base not only is flanked by rulers on the edges but also offers quick guides for standard sizes like 4 x 6 and 8.5 x 11 inches. Directions for use are printed directly on the unit so you’ll never lose them. The model has 11 different blade types available for purchase separately, and a built-in storage compartment will keep extra blades and mats handy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you need the functionality of a **rotary** paper cutter for a variety of non-paper materials, this high-end Fiskars **trimmer** is cut out for the job. Most **trimmer**s can’t handle materials like plastic, foam, or even layers of cardstock, but this heavy-duty model can. It features a large, 14-inch base and a 12-inch cutting edge, and it folds in half for more convenient storage. Even if you intend to use it primarily for paper, this cutter is one to consider due to its dual rail system: Parallel guide rails stabilize the blade better than a single rail could. Also, since the unit is completely reversible, it can be used comfortably by lefties and righties alike. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Guillotine paper cutters are normally used for high-volume projects. They are also designed to cut through larger amounts of paper compared to **rotary** paper cutters. They are also much bulkier and heavier which makes them more difficult to store. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let’s face it, a vast majority of the guillotine paper cutters and **trimmer**s on the market range between 12 inches to 18 inches. This product from Tonic Studios, however, is an iconoclast. With an 8½ inch long blade, and a small base for cutting with embossed grid lines, this 1 pound heavy cutter can match the bigger models cut-for-cut. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
