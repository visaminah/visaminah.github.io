## 107 Tips to How To Care For Mini Succulents | How To Care For Succulents
-   For plants like sansevieria, cut leaf portions of about 2 inches (5 centimeters) in length. Allow the wounds to callus over then bury a small portion of the cuttings in soil, making sure they are right side up, as roots will only form from the bottom part. After planting, keep the soil moist for about four weeks, then use the normal watering method for **succulents**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This sounds quite simplistic and it is. Each plant has similar growing conditions and care but there are also minor differences too. Knowing all that you can about **succulents** will make your task of caring for them much more pleasurable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All **succulents** (and all plants for that matter) benefit from a complete soaking, until water comes out of the bottom of the pot. For **succulents**, wait until the soil is bone dry — and then some — to water again. Just be sure to keep the leaves dry to keep mold at bay. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you love **succulents** and want to add some life to your space but don’t have a lot of room to do it, this collection of **mini** **succulents** will do the trick. These bite-sized beauties are perfect for a nook that needs filling up with something green. They stay tiny and take up little room in your home or office. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Growing **succulents** is an easy way to get familiar with plant growing. Especially indoors. Thing is though, they’re only as strong as the foundation you give them to feed from. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As desert plants, most **succulents** need a lot of bright or even direct sunlight to really thrive. However, their reputation as tough houseplants makes it seem as though they can survive anywhere, even in dim rooms without much natural light. In fact, there actually are a few **succulents** that can handle low-light conditions, including snake plants, but most will grow best in the brightest light you can give them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Place **succulents** that require more lighting in a window that gets a lot of bright sunlight throughout the day. The exception to this is if you’re in a location where afternoon summer sunlight is too intense, in which case you should opt for a window that provides morning sunlight, which is less harsh. Or consider providing 14-16 hours of fluorescent grow lighting per day to ensure these **succulents** are getting enough light for their needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to the cactus soil mix, it depends on the cacti and **succulents** you have. Some cactus plants flourish in sandy soils, while others grow in tropical areas. Hence, it is essential to know your species choosing a potting soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some types of **succulents** have pups. These are little babies of the mature plant. Just as you’d take a leaf by tugging it from the stem, you can take a pup from the parent plant, put it into its own container then nurture the baby pup until it’s a mature adult, sprouting its own little pups. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because **succulents** are native to hot, arid climates, they generally prefer warm temperatures with lower humidity, though it can depend on the species. For a general range, Diane Glaub, plant arbor manager at the San Francisco Botanical Garden, says, "Most **succulents** prefer temperatures between 40 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 40 and 60 percent." Since **succulents** have adapted to desert extremes, they're pretty good at handling both hot and cold conditions within reason, Massura says, noting that humidity is the bigger concern here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Potting soil for **succulents** should be well draining and fast drying, to prevent problems caused by local humidity, over-saturation of plant cells, and root rot. Sandy soil that’s made up of equal parts organic and inorganic material is a great potting mixture for **succulents**.The idea is to provide a blend that will hold enough water for your plant to absorb what it needs when you water but will then dry out quickly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And they aren’t just suited for your garden or porch, they’re more versatile. Succulent plants are perfect ornamental beings to spruce up your interior decor uniquely – think about the shapes, colors, and sizes. It’s almost endless. Can **succulents** grow indoors? It’s a big ‘Yes’. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hopefully you’ve enjoyed this article on how to care for **succulents** indoors. I can’t recommend them enough as a house plant. They are so interesting, rewarding and diverse, and I believe that anyone can be successful in growing them at home. If you have any questions about caring for **succulents** indoors, please leave a comment below, or contact me using the contact form. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because **succulents** hail from environments with lots of sunlight, they tend to crave a good amount of UV rays. "At a **mini**mum, most **succulents** need more than six hours of light daily," Chad Massura, co-founder of the sustainable potting mix brand Rosy Soil, says. "Aim to place plants in a south- or west-facing window for the best results." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Succulents generally don't need fertilizer when planted in the ground, Elliott says, since they can typically obtain all the nutrients needed from the soil. If you're growing **succulents** in containers, however, you may benefit from periodically fertilizing your plant when it's actively growing. Elliott recommends using a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer, such as 10-10-10. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Due to their high water content, humidity is not good for most **succulents**, even within their ideal temperature range. One of the main reasons that **succulents** do well in most household environments is that they are typically quite dry, with relative humidity levels of 10-30 percent. This is the perfect amount of humidity for most succulent plants, as it encourages both fast drying of the growing medium after watering as well as healthy water storage by the plant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Secondly, the roots will get a fresh air supply for as long as they are in that pot. And that boosts not just their health but also that of the plant. And who won’t be happy to grow indoor **succulents** that are good-looking? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Caring for cuttings and bare root **succulents** are the same. Your **succulents** arrive calloused on the end, or have shallow roots, and are ready to be planted upon arrival. Follow these care instructions to ensure your plants continue to thrive: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The second issue is that, although **succulents** do very well getting by on slim pickings, they still need food and water. Too much competition means they’ll probably miss out. If your **succulents** arrive in a crowded arrangement, pluck them out carefully and give them their own spacious **mini** desert dune. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Watering Mini Succulents: Water your **mini** succulent by removing the plastic grower pot from your outer clay pot. Pour in about 1/4 inch of water (roughly 1 Tablespoon), then place the grower pot back inside. The soil will soak up water from the bottom to help avoid over-watering. Allow **succulents** to dry completely between waterings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also known as the Elephant Bush, Portulacaria afra is a succulent that’s native to South Africa. It’s not related to the jade plant (Crassula ovata) despite its name. It does have physical similarities to the Jade Plant, but the two species aren’t related beyond being **succulents**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In general, **succulents** prefer moderate temperatures. Of course,some **succulents** are frost tolerant, while many are of tropical origins and should not be allowed to go below about 50 F (10 C).The **succulents** that are commonly used as houseplants will do well at temperatures in the range of 50-80 F (10-27 C) that are typical of indoor environments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a few exceptions to this rule. Certain types of **succulents** require more frequent watering because their leaves are teeny tiny and can't hold as much water compared to other varieties with plump leaves. For these tiny leaf **succulents**, feel free to give them a drink up to once a week in the non-winter months if they look thirsty. Succulents typically look a little wrinkly when they are thirsty. Remember though, it's always better to under-water than to over-water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nurseries always plant their **succulents** in soil that’s too rich and retains too much moisture, so you’ll want to repot your succulent as soon as you bring it home. Start with a coarse potting mix with good drainage and aeration. You can find special cactus and succulent mixes at the nursery, or even use an African violet mix. To further improve drainage and prevent compaction, add perlite or pumice to the cactus or African violet mix (up to 50% of the total potting mix, depending on your particular succulent’s moisture needs). Always wet the mix before using to ensure it’s evenly moist. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Don’t let the lights on throughout the day. Take care of your indoor **succulents** by providing about 8 hours per day for them to thrive. A full 24 hours of light will interfere with the growth patterns, and hence the health of the plant. Those few hours of darkness every day are also beneficial. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you've ever been confused about the difference between **succulents** and cacti, a common geometry fact might help with the distinction. Like squares are to rectangles, cacti are to **succulents**. In other words, all cacti are considered **succulents**, but not all **succulents** are cacti. Cactus plants can also be distinguished from many common succulent plants because they typically don't have leaves Aloe: Native to Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian peninsula, these plants are known for producing a skin-soothing gel. However, out of over 300 species, only a few contain the well-known medicinal properties. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thing is, they don’t know when to stop. If they keep on taking in water, the cell walls on the leaves can rupture, causing the leaves to die and fall off. That’s why it’s best to edge on the side of caution when working with **succulents**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The but is because there’s two types of **succulents**. Summer **succulents** and winter **succulents**. Summer **succulents** will favor hotter temperatures, whereas cold hardy **succulents** favor cooler temperatures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'The other essential factor when it comes to succulent care is your soil,' says Brosnan. 'For indoor plants you’ll need a well draining, aerated soil. The more air flow through the soil the better as this will encourage evaporation over actual drainage, you can add in some pumice to aid with air flow. Outdoor **succulents** are difference, they’ll need a pot with a drainage hole to allow moisture to escape which allows the roots to dry out between waterings like they need to.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re planning on keeping these **succulents** tiny, a small pot is all you need. If the offset isn’t given space, they won’t grow. And since an individual rosette is barely 2 inches tall, if that, they’re perfect as potted houseplants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Watering Full Size Succulents: Water your 5” succulent by removing the plastic grower pot from your outer clay pot. Pour in about one inch of water (roughly 1/3 cup), then place the grower pot back inside. The soil will soak up water from the bottom to help avoid over-watering. Allow **succulents** to dry completely between waterings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like any other **succulents**, green cactus is more tolerant under a low light environment. So if you feel that your place doesn't get enough lighting, Blue Candle and Angel Wing is a great choice for you. However, if you do have a space in your home that has good lighting, you may grow a more colorful one like the Rainbow Cactus. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is essential, especially if you want to grow indoor **succulents** in a single planter. Individual plants should have enough space for air circulation. But most importantly, ample space allows each of them accesses to enough light – an equally significant aspect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll find a list of the most popular indoor **succulents**, organized according to lighting requirements, in the section on that topic below. Note that among the **succulents** listed, the Christmas cactus stands out as the exception to the general guidelines for humidity and watering. They are an unusual type of plant known as a jungle cactus that grows in the moist understory of tropical forests. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best way to water **succulents** is to water the soil thoroughly and allow it to fully drain. You should then allow the soil to dry out completely before watering again.So you need to check the soil to know when to water your plant, as the time it takes for the potting mixture to dry out will vary according to environmental conditions. In general, you’ll be watering more often during the heat of the summer, although you’ll find that your plant needs less frequent watering when there’s a lot of humidity, rain, or cloudy weather. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Outdoor **succulents** can be saved with the winds, rain, or irrigation. But to grow indoor **succulents** without the bother of these little rioters, it’s vital that you be vigilant. Observe the leaves and stems of your **succulents** for any of them and take immediate action when you see them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To water **succulents** growing in containers without drainage, the aim is to provide just enough water to wet all of the potting material without having water pool at the bottom. To achieve this, start by estimating how much potting mixture there is and measure half that amount of water. If it’s not a clear glass container that allows you to see if any water is pooling, monitor the potting mixture for dryness, keep a close eye on your plant for signs of over-watering, and make small adjustments to the amount of water you pour in until you get a good feel for what the right measurement is. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Succulents require well draining soil, as well as a drainage hole in their pot in order to thrive. All **succulents** prefer to be watered only when their soil is dry. Water thoroughly over the soil; until water drips from the bottom of your pot. This is typically about every two weeks, but can vary depending on season, humidity, and other factors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While sunlight is important, be cautious to not expose **succulents** to direct sunlight immediately after unboxing. You can always provide more sunlight, but cannot take away the effects of too much sun exposure. Slowly acclimate your **succulents** to more sunlight. If you wish to grow your **succulents** outdoors, research which zone you live in, and the hardiness of **succulents** in your zone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even though **succulents** are very good at conserving water, most of them do like quite a bit of sunlight. Even the **succulents** that can do well in less light do prefer some sun. Try these varieties for growing **succulents** indoors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A porous and well-draining soil with a loose and grainy texture is ideal for **succulents** to ensure they aren't sitting in water for an extended period of time. If you don't use a well-draining soil, you may have to adjust your watering habits to keep your plants from drying out or getting root rot. "If you are growing in a heavier soil, make sure that it has had time to dry sufficiently, and if growing in a lighter soil like sand or cactus mix, you may need to water a bit more," Guillou says. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re stuck trying to figure how to care for **succulents** indoors, you absolutely need to know these pointers. These aren’t just about getting your plants to look their best. The tips here spell out how to keep your plants alive. Figure that out and then you can focus on keeping them healthy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a comprehensive list of **succulents**, with pictures, have a look at this very helpful resource from plantsam.com. It’s also very handy if you already own **succulents**, but are struggling to identify them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **mini** **succulents** have all the features that make Echeveria so popular: rosettes of fleshy leaves, pretty flowers, and a wide range of colors and shapes. The leaves are grey-green with red tips, and they form in a rosette shape. The contrast of the red tips to the green leaves is particularly stark and eye-catching. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You don’t want your babies to end up with elongated stems, pale and bent. That’s their likely fate indoors, where the amount of light is considerably reduced. And that means you must be on watch when you grow indoor **succulents** to ensure they grow into their intended forms – colors and sizes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Succulents do often grow in low-nutrient environments, but fertilizer is still essential to their care. Pro-tip: For **succulents**, once-yearly feeding is enough. Use any well-balanced organic fertilizer, cut the dose in half, and feed at the beginning of the plant’s growing season for best results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You know how if you break your skin, it’ll scab over? The same happens with the leaves you pull from **succulents**. The part where the leaf was attached to the stem will scab over a few days. You need to give the leaf time to heal before you put it into soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The only difference between summer and winter **succulents** is the dormancy period. Summer **succulents** are dormant from November through to February. Winter **succulents** are dormant from May through to August. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thought it may seem like **succulents** thrive in sand out in the wild, they actually prefer loose, rocky soil and need nutrients to grow well. When used on its own, sand has a tendency to compact over time, causing too much water retention in a container. The best potting medium for a succulent is one specially formulated for cacti and **succulents**, or a well-draining mix of potting soil, coarse sand, and perlite/pumice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Overall, **succulents** are not very demanding in terms of water and light. They can thrive under indoor conditions with **mini**mal efforts. But if you want your **succulents** to have the best conditions to grow, there are certain things you need to remember. And here's our indoor succulent care guide. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After recently sharing how to create **mini** marbled painted pots, I wanted to follow that post up with a little something about caring for the cacti inside them. After all, there’s little point in having a pretty pot if the plant inside is left to fend for itself! Now, most houseplants are pretty easy to care for: water once a week and you’re golden! But unlike the more common houseplants out there a cactus seems like a prickly (pardon the pun 😉 ) puzzle to solve. It looks different and certainly responds differently to watering, sunlight and common potting soils. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Despite widespread belief, most **succulents** do not thrive if blasted with the hottest temps and the fullest sun exposure. While they appreciate a lot of light (and very few survive in full shade), most **succulents** need sun protection, especially if the temperature hits the 90-degree-mark, or if they’re small. Varieties that are solid green, pale, or variegated are most in danger of sun burn. Here’s a tip: If you are planning to blast your **succulents** with the brightest sun possible, opt for plants that are red, gray, blue, or covered densely with spines (which help to reflect the sun’s rays). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All plants do better with a good fertilizer. But before you add any, you need to know what you’re adding and if it’s needed. Think about what you’re adding because depending on the general potting soil you used as your base soil for **succulents**, you could find there’s extra nutrition in there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **mini** **succulents** are small, only growing to about 4 inches (10 cm) tall. Its body is covered in short spines that are mildly irritating if you brush up against them. The spines give the plant a fuzzy appearance and make it quite cute. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Native to Central America and southwestern Mexico, the rat tail cactus is a fascinating plant. Its distinctive long, trailing steps are re**mini**scent of a rat’s tail and have earned it its moniker. The tallest these stalks get is four feet. When kept inside, rat rail cacti do best when suspended from the ceiling in hanging baskets or pots. This gives the trailing stems room to develop in accordance with their genetic blueprint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In addition to the coating on its leaves, the Flower Dust Plant gets its name from the flowers that bloom on the tips of its stems. These pale pink to violet flowers are a treat to the eyes. Luckily, these **mini** **succulents** bloom readily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Succulents have a reputation for being easy-care houseplants that anyone can grow—and they are—but that doesn't mean you can just plop them down on a table and forget about them. They may be tough and simple to grow, but they do still need some care to look their best. If your **succulents** aren't thriving, they might need a little more attention. People tend to neglect them because they seem indestructible, but there are a few conditions even these plants can't survive. Keep them happy and healthy by avoiding these common mistakes (and fix the errors you're already making). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cactaceae: If you've ever been confused about the difference between **succulents** and cacti, a common geometry fact might help with the distinction. Like squares are to rectangles, cacti are to **succulents**. In other words, all cacti are considered **succulents**, but not all **succulents** are cacti. Cactus plants can also be distinguished from many common succulent plants because they typically don't have leaves - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is best to place your **succulents** near windows and in an angle where they can receive morning sunlight and less afternoon sunlight. Afternoon sunlight is not preferred as it is stronger and more likely to leave the plant sunburned, especially during summer in zone 9-11. Also, keep your eyes on your plants to monitor how plants adjust to their current positions in the house. Often, a sunny South-facing windowsill is ideal for your indoor **succulents**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Perhaps you’ve killed your **succulents** by overwatering them (far more common than under-watering) which causes rot. But maybe you’ve already gotten the memo, are diligently dehydrating your plants, and wonder why they are dying. Well, newsflash—they need some water. Succulents like it when soil approaches dry before being watered. But what does this mean, you ask? It means you’ll likely be A-OK if, during dry times, if you water small pots about once a week and large pots about every two weeks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   They include mealybugs, spider mites, and scale insects. A mixture of rubbing alcohol and water is a perfect killer. Use a piece of cotton to apply the mixture to the affected areas. That’s how you grow indoor **succulents** devoid of pests. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fluorescent lights are used to grow herbs and vegetables indoors. For the HPS, you need to place your cactus a distance away from them as they produce quite high amounts of heat. They also require you to invest heavily in setting them up and having a system that will manage the temperature. The LED is more efficient than the other two types, and the light is far more focused. There is also very **mini**mal heat produced if any. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our potted **succulents** can remain in their pot for some time, until they’ve fully outgrown the pot they shipped in. If you do wish to repot your **succulents**, we recommend waiting at least a week after arrival before doing so, giving them time to acclimate to their new environment. Follow these care instructions upon arrival to ensure your potted **succulents** continue to thrive: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Well-drained soil is very importantfor indoor **succulents**. Succulents grown outdoors often have better airflow than indoor ones so they are less prone to rot. Hence, you need to make sure the soil for indoor **succulents** is lightweight to ensure the plants will not suffocate and the roots will not get rot when you water them. If you feel like your soil is holding too much moisture, add pumice or perlite to increase its drainage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The plants benefit most from fertilizer in the spring (when the days get longer and new growth begins), and again in late summer. Use a balanced, all-purpose, water-soluble fertilizer (such as 8-8-8 or 10-10-10) diluted to half the strength recommended on the package instructions. There is no need to fertilize **succulents** in winter when they’re semi-dormant., They don’t need the nutrient boost because they are not actively growing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not all **succulents** can be propagated from leaves, but they can be propagated from cuttings. To do this, you’ll need a sharp pair of pruners so you can get a clean cut. Take the cut from the top of the plant, snipping the stem just above a leaf. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because of their special ability to retain water, **succulents** tend to thrive in warm, dry climates and don’t mind a little neglect. This makes them well adapted to indoor growing and ideal for people desiring low-maintenance houseplants. If you’re choosing **succulents** for the first time, follow these steps for successful care of your new plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That’s already a good enough reason to grow indoor **succulents**. But you know what, I want to share more with our lovely Succulent Family. Let’s get to it! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, if it’s winter season, reduce watering to once or twice a week. You don’t need gallons of water to grow indoor **succulents**. Let’s just say **succulents** are also water bill friendly! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Knowing when to water **succulents** is key to successful growing. Succulents are native to hot, arid climates, and their leaves are designed to hold water (see those thick, fleshy leaves?). This means overwatering is the fastest way to do them in. It's also one of the most commons mistakes first-time succulent owners make. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another helpful note is that your forest cacti and **succulents** grow in warmer seasons. So, it would be best if you watered them often while in winter months to spring infrequent watering is enough. Still, it depends on your cactus species and where you have it placed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While you might be accustomed to plucking a stem of your favorite geranium, rosemary bush, or houseplant and dunking it in water to watch roots grow, that won’t work for propagating **succulents**. You can actually practice the exact opposite method. When you’ve got a plant you like, pluck a stem and let it dry out in the shade for at least 3 days. This process, known as healing, helps form a callus, preventing rot. Place your new stem in the soil mix mentioned above, and you should be good to go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Living Stone Plant (Lithops) is a slow-growing **mini** succulent that originates from Southern Africa. As the name suggests, its appearance is very similar to that of a stone or pebble. In fact, when they’re not in bloom, it can be difficult to tell them apart from rocks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blossfeldia liliputana, or Blossfeldia liliputiana is the smallest cactus in the world. If you’re willing to go the cactus route in your search for **mini** **succulents**, it doesn’t get any smaller than this. These little green balls are one of nature’s wonders. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Succulents also tend to have really beautiful flowers. It can take quite a while for most **succulents** to flower but there are things you can do to help it along.! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'This is a sign that it is trying its best to “reach” sunlight. If you don’t have anywhere sunny to place your **succulents**, you can always opt for artificial lights to supplement your plants with the right amount of light.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like many other houseplants, **succulents** are susceptible to infestations of scale, mealybugs, and spider mites. Isolate an infected plant immediately to prevent the infestation from spreading to other plants. If caught early, these sap-sucking pests can be wiped away with rubbing alcohol. Here is an article outlining the common pests and diseases, along with pictures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'Succulents are a sun-seeking plant. They require around 800 foot candles of light to thrive and grow, for **mini**mum maintenance 400 foot candles of light should be sufficient,' says Mayo. 'You can measure the amount of light your succulent receives by using any of the free smartphone apps available. Alternatively, you can simply put your succulent in the sunniest place possible.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   to plenty of sunlight every day (6-8 hours of direct sunlight),' says Pol Bishop, a gardening specialist at Fantastic Gardeners. 'Of course, you can grow your **succulents** in the shade, but chances are their colors won’t be as lavish when compared to others that receive more sun.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A water gauge can help in deter**mini**ng the soils moisture — only water when the topsoil is dry. Overwatering cacti will make its roots rot, and the plant will start turning pale. Another alternative would be using a stick to poke the soil to see if the bottom has water. If soil sticks on the stick, then there’s still water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is where the low-maintenace part really comes in. When it comes to watering **succulents**, "neglect is best," Guillou says. While the frequency of watering will depend on the species and your growing conditions, most **succulents** should be left to dry out completely between waterings. That means your succulent's soil should be bone-dry and crumbly before you give it another drink. If the leaves and stems start to wrinkle and get brown, that's a sign your plant is dehydrated and needs to be watered, says Angelica Elliott, assistant director of public horticulture at the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most houseplants love regular feeding. Not the case with **succulents**. Instead of little and often, it’s drench the soil then leave it alone. The majority of **succulents** do fine with just a weekly watering, provided you give them the right amount. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can fix this by planting your succulent in a smaller pot with drainage holes and placing that in the pretty hole-less container you wanted to use. Use potting mix ($6), The Home Depot formulated for **succulents** and cacti. When you water, remove the inside pot until the extra moisture has finished draining, then return it to the decorative container. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Extremely hot weather will make the plants drooping when soil is too dry. And below zero weather will freeze the water stored inside the plant, causing damages to the plant’s tissues. You need to make sure your indoor temperature stays within a reasonable range then your plants should be fine. Ideally, most **succulents** would prefer temperatures about 60-80F. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In other words, you don’t need to dedicate much time to successfully growing indoor **succulents**. You’ll see this as you read more. Let’s continue! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some **succulents**, particularly desert cacti, need eight hours of full sunlight, while other succulent varieties require shade or partial shade. Some like it hot. Meanwhile, there are **succulents** that prefer cooler nighttime temperatures or rely on cold winters for their yearly growth cycles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Indoor spaces are already clogged up as far as free air circulation is concerned. And using a glass container doesn’t help the situation – for the roots. Same for succulent terrariums, they look nice, but for long-term care, it is not the ideal situation for indoor **succulents**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The flowers of these **mini** **succulents** are small and nondescript, so they’re not the primary reason to grow this plant. However, they can bloom intermittently throughout the year, adding a pop of color to an otherwise muted palette. The real draw of this plant is its beautiful foliage. They range in color from pale green to pale white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The number-one mistake many people make with **succulents** is overwatering them. It’s best to water more, but less frequently. Saturate the potting mix thoroughly (while ensuring water flows out of the drainage hole properly) but allow the mix to dry out slightly before the next watering. If the potting mix stays consistently wet every day, the plant may eventually die. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remember to rotate the **succulents** once every few days. With an indoor setting, the light source often comes from one direction only. Hence, rotating your plants will help distribute the sunlight evenly, preventing stretching **succulents** or disproportional growth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cold hardy **succulents** – Not all **succulents** are indoor plants. Some don’t mind the cold and can grow outdoors in the winter. Find out about them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because **succulents** don't need much water to survive, you might think that misting them is a good way to prevent overwatering. Misting leaves is great for plants that appreciate extra humidity, including many types of ferns, air plants, and other tropicals grown indoors. But for **succulents**, it can damage them and even cause them to rot. Instead, use a container with drainage and a succulent potting mix, and then give them a good soaking when the soil is completely dry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These plants are similar in appearance to aloe, but are typically larger and spinier. Agave plants, native to the Americas, are sometimes called "century plants" since they only bloom once in their lifetime. Echeveria: Likely the first image that comes to mind when picturing **succulents**, these plants are rose-shaped with thick, waxy leaves. Native to Mexico, Central America, and South America, Echeveria are often bred for their colorful leaves and flowers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Without enough light, **succulents** often lose their color and become leggy (meaning they stretch out their stems to find light). Any time you buy a plant, check its tag for how much light it needs each day and try to come as close as you can to that amount. If you want to grow one in a dim room, consider investing in a grow light so your succulent can still get the light it needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The term “**succulents** and cacti” is a bit confusing, as it implies that these are two different groups of plants.To add to the confusion, the word “cactus” appears in the common names of many **succulents** that aren’t actually cacti. Also, some **succulents** have thorns or spines that make them look like cacti, even though they aren’t. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Succulents don't need fertilizing often. Aim to fertilize once a year in the spring, right before the days start getting longer as this is the start of prime growth season for **succulents**. Other than that, fertilize as needed, but not more often than once every one-to-two months. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best container for **succulents** is a terracotta plant pot because it’s porous, so there’s better air flow. That’s great for plants. Not so much for growers because these pots can be heavy, shouldn’t be glazed and not all of them have pre-drilled drainage holes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While some **succulents**, including certain types of Sedum and Sempervivum, can withstand freezing temps, most cannot. Take care when a cold snap is in the forecast—since **succulents** are mostly water, their cell walls are prone to bursting, which turns the leaves to mush. When in doubt, assume that any drop below freezing will cause damage or death to your plant. The easiest solution for frost protection is to keep plants in containers that are light enough to move indoors or under awnings when a cold snap is predicted. Also, unlike the rest of your garden, **succulents** actually have a greater chance of survival if they’re dry before a cold snap, not wet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That is for dormant winter types. Fertilizer is only useful as long as it’s getting utilized. And when your **succulents** have put growth on hold, there is every chance that it won’t get used – even if it gets absorbed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Are you one of those people who hangs their head in shame whenever we tout **succulents** as the easiest plants to grow? You’re not alone, trust us. Succulents, plants adapted to survive in harsh environments and long periods with very little water, play by their own rule book, but they’re still pretty easy to care for. Follow these succulent-growing tips to help you keep your babies alive and thriving. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The roots on **succulents** need air and water. With a porous soil, the roots can soak up the water as fast as the soil can let them. The water’s then transported through the plant, then stored in the leaves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **mini**mal level of care required makes the moon cactus a good choice for a first houseplant. You can use them to spruce up your living room, porch, or window seal. Moon cacti do better in indirect light rather than full sun. Moon cactus, like other desert-adapted cacti, does not require a lot of water. If the cactus gets too much water, it could die from root rot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Succulents tend to come packed into adorable little dishes, all crammed together cheek by jowl. There aren’t many plants that like this arrangement, including **succulents**. Overcrowding is one of the best ways to encourage mold and insect infestations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Succulents thrive on bright, indirect sunlight. All **succulents** require the right amount of light in order to bring out their color and to maintain shape. After arrival, it is important to place your **succulents** in a brightly lit room, or on a windowsill. Your **succulents** may lose some color or sturdiness during shipping, but will perk right back up with some sunlight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Managing the plant’s size is easy. These tiny **succulents** remain small even if given ample space. Yellow, daisy-like flowers make frequent appearances from within the gap of the fork. They’re a common sight in the autumn, less so in summer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When **succulents** don't get enough sunlight, they will start stretching out to reach the light source. When you notice your plants growing taller while the leaves start to become further apart, it is a sign of stretching. It is not growing, it’s etiolation, and you need to reposition the plants. Also, they will lose their vivid colors and turn back to green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **succulents** like direct sunlight, but if all you have is a shaded corner in your house, go with low light-tolerant plants like mother-in-law tongue. If you plan to grow your succulent in a hanging planter, a trailing variety like string of bananas is a great choice. Always read the plant labels to determine the sunlight needs, size, and spread of your **succulents**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
