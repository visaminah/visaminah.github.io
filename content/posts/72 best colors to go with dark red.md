-   Combining different hues of **red** is a whole new ball game. It gives you the opportunity to create a bespoke outift with pieces you already have in your closet.

-   Surprisingly, purple is very flattering on **red**heads. Be sure to stay away from soft lavenders – muted shades can wash out your skin and hair. True purple and bright, electric shades are all complementary choices. Purples with blue undertones work best, but **red**-toned purples do not. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red is inc**red**ibly versatile and you can find comprehensive colour schemes for just about every style and shade. From muted, natural **red**s to dramatic bold shades, the colour **red** has a flexibility that earns it a place in any modern home.

-   That is not to say that white should be abandoned as a part of interior design – far from it. White provides much needed neutrality and can create a calming space. However, it is important to balance that neutral space with the little colour accents that stimulate the creative and emotional sides of your psyche. One of the best colours for this is, somewhat surprisingly, the colour **red**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many **colors** go with burgundy, as it is a delightfully versatile shade. It looks good with neutrals and cool **colors**. It also looks good when included in bright patterns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adding contrast and depth to any space, burgundy is a solid color choice for many styles. Often passed over as too bold of choice, burgundy blends in well with a multitude of **colors** and it comes in many shades itself. This makes it easy to add as much or as little as you’d like. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Burgundy got its name because it resembled the richly colo**red** **red** wines being exported from Burgundy, France. In France, the wine and the color are refer**red** to as “Bordeaux.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Burgundy and navy is a classic color combination that exudes class and sophistication. Both **colors** are warm and rich, with plenty of contrast for visual interest in an outfit or a room painted in a light, neutral color. It is also a combo commonly used for fall weddings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because **red** is such a strong and vibrant color, it pairs well with neutrals like white but also with soft pastels such as mint green or grey or even light blue. A combination of different nuances with subtle differences between them can add character to the room without overwhelming it while still allowing **red** to be the main accent color. {found on gilbertsonphotography}. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wadden also suggests using touches of **red** in the kitchen, like on a kitchen island, because of the color’s strong connection with food (yep, it goes beyond plating!). Using **red** sparingly can liven up the space without making it look like a drive thru, especially if you choose a shade beyond ketchup. “Consider the full spectrum of **red**s, which range from rich, moody maroon and oxblood to crisp, happy tomato **red**,” says designer Seana Freeman, aka Glamohemian Girl on IG (@bellybaila). “Reds are inc**red**ibly varied. There is bound to be one you like!” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark **red** jeans with a light blue jean jacket can be unique and strictly feminine. You can also wear a dark **red** dress with a fur vest. This outfit is great for a holiday, while a dark **red** cardigan with brown high boots is a great everyday look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A few years back, we did a blog post around the Rock It Like A Redhead event here in Nashville. The event was put on by How to be a Redhead founders Stephanie and Adrienne Vendetti and was a wonderful confidence inspiring event dedicated to **red**heads. Coming off of the event, we did a blog post dedicated to all the beautiful **red**heads out there…. What Colors Look Good on Redheads. We thought it would be fun to update that blog post with some fun current pieces for all of you gorgeous **red**heads out there! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The combination of **red** and beige as base **colors** is one that really suits traditional interiors. When combined, these two nuances give off a classic vibe that’s not too difficult to work with. The trick is finding the balance between these two **colors** and not going overboard with matching details. {found on kristine.robinson} - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Burgundy and mustard are another classic fall color combo. Although the pair might seem unlikely to work together, they are a warm, vibrant duo that complements each other well. Both are earthy **colors** that add a touch of elegance and richness to any room or outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While crimson isn’t a shy color, it can run away with a room if it’s not used sparingly. The lacque**red** sitting room of Diana Vreeland is a classic example. A judicious application of this striking hue can transform a room into a spectacular space. Alternatively, a strong **red** color can create a charming space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A tone brimming with sensuality and passion, the romantic **red** has the ability to transform any environment into any atmosphere you can imagine. This strong, dramatic color caresses the senses with its warmth and distinct mood. The variety of **red**s is what makes this hue so adaptable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Burgundy doesn’t just pair well with other standard **colors**. It also looks lovely with metallics like gold. Pairing gold with burgundy results in a lush, expensive-looking combo that is altogether timeless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Add a little character to the already classy **red** by styling it with some prints. Stay away from stripes and OTT florals and go for an animal print instead. Animal print pants, culottes, or skirts look inc**red**ibly cute with **red** sweaters or turtleneck T-shirts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Shades of blue are typically viewed as calm, relaxing **colors**. However, navy, which is a darker shade, is an authoritative color that signifies power and importance. It is also a highly professional color that is used frequently in uniforms and corporate offices. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Color matching is very challenging; you will need a guide for the color schemes. In this post, we have explained the color which can go with crimson **red**, dark **red**, and canvas cream. Please read this post carefully to guide yourself on their color scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In a more traditional setting like this dining room a darker and more subdued shade of **red** can look really nice when pai**red** with ivory or beige and with wooden furniture with a dark stain on it. It’s a classic combo which gives the **red** a very royal feel.{found on tylarkins}. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To avoid this, consider using the shade where you want to feel energized and connected to others. Then, pair the **red** with a neutral for a neutral look. If you’re having difficulty deciding between **red** and a neutral hue, try mixing the two. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because **red** is often associated with strong emotions like power, passion and energy, using too much can overwhelm the space. Wadden recommends using **red** in spaces where you want to feel energized, like a home office, or where you want to really connect with other people. “Communal rooms–like kitchens, living rooms and dining rooms–can handle the fiery hue,” she notes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can’t really go wrong with black and white. It’s the most classic combo and it’s timeless and it goes really well with **red** as an accent color. Check out how stylish this kitchen is with its white walls, white cabinets with black countertops, the mixed floor tiles and the **red** island complemented by patterned window treatments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue in general is a relaxing and calming color which makes it a nice fit for areas such as the bedroom. A strong nuance like this one can look beautiful when combined with other vibrant **colors** such as **red**. It’s nice in this case to keep the rest of the color palette simple and neutral. {found on robinsnestinteriors}. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s nothing wrong with using white as a primary color in a room. In fact, it’s the most versatile color that goes well with everything, including **red**. That gives you the possibility to really put an emphasis on your accent color and even to introduce a third color as well, like brown for instance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bronze is another metallic that goes great with the color burgundy. Bronze has a warm, coppery color with undertones of **red**. These **red**dish hues complement the dark **red**s in burgundy well and can be used in light fixtures, home decor, or accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gray is a foolproof color for formal wear. You just can’t go wrong with it. The cool tone of gray lets the **red** pop out and do all the talking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The natural color of wood is extremely versatile and stained wood is just as great. They go really well with **red** and lots of other accent **colors**, as you can see in this farmhouse-style kitchen. We like the contrast added by the concrete countertops that prevent the **red** cabinets from clashing with the wood backsplash.{image from blackburnarch}. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The colour **red** is generally regarded as a strong colour. It is the colour of passion, of confidence, aggression and love. Red actually has a subtle physical effect and can stimulate your heartrate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The name crimson comes from a **red** dye made by kermes scale insects. Kermes oak trees are native to the Mediterranean region. The dye was popularized in medieval times and was used for dying silk. It’s a history-making fact that you can trace kermes dye back to Ancient Egypt. In the Ancient Egyptian period, it was conside**red** a color of wealth and was available only to the upper class. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **red** front door, or in this case two, adds a nice pop of color to the house. It’s also a great way to make the entrance more visible to visitors. As for the rest of the color palette of this gorgeous entryway, we love the dark grey of the floor tiles and the way in which they ground the space while the white walls open it up.{found on balarch}. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not only can **red** look great on walls and major focal points like a kitchen island, but it can work famously on wood paneling or trim. “Try it on a front or back door, an entry hall, or around the TV or fireplace in a living room,” Wadden says. “Tonal **red**s, such as **red**-brown or merlot, are sophisticated and add elevated elegance to a space. To encourage conversation around the dining table, consider painting just the ceiling **red**.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When combined with linen white walls, apple **red** window frames truly add to the dramatic attractiveness of a room’s design. This impact is aided by well-chosen flooring, such as carpets with a variety of **colors**. It is possible that the **colors** you choose to compliment this style will be both warm and cold in tone, depending on the look you are aiming for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yellow and **red** is probably not the first color combo that came to your mind. But, you can sport it as long as you do it cautiously. You can start with subtle details like a yellow clutch, pumps, or accessories with a **red** outfit. Or, wear a yellow tank top under a **red** blazers, or vice versa. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first thing to think about is painting the walls, which is not as simple as it appears. Red walls can transform a space into something gorgeous and elegant, especially when applied in a Mediterranean or classic style. In order to accomplish this look in a current and modern style, it is necessary to balance the strong impression of **red** with other elements of the design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’m sure you’ve heard the stereotypes saying **red**heads can’t wear **red**. But this myth is far from truth. When picking out **red**s to wear, go for a true jewel tone **red**! Of course, you can be bold and wear that gorgeous **red** dress, but if you aren’t comfortable going all **red**, here are some ideas on how to incorporate **red** into your outfits to highlight your beautiful locks: a **red** shell under a jacket; bright **red** pants or a skirt with a black top; **red** accessories such as a **red** belt, **red** shoes, or **red** nail polish; or a print with **red** accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can pair dark **red** with blue or gray, but make sure you stick to a light shade. Light blue and dark **red** are complementary **colors**, but brick or brown are off-limits. Light blue with dark **red** is a striking combination and looks sexy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As far as furniture is concerned, **red** can make or break the appearance of a room. For the more courageous, brighter **red**s may be a bold decision that will inject personality into your room. A set of seats and a table works quite well with the rest of the room’s neutral tones. For instance, **red** and yellow make an excellent color combination. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Consider a canvas cream color if you want a neutral yet sophisticated room. This soft off-white can give any room an air of effortless style. While it might be difficult to find complementary **colors** for this neutral color, there are several that can work well together. Consider the following **colors** to use with canvas cream. These shades have been selected to help you achieve your desi**red** effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is also conside**red** a sign of wealth. Although it is a shade of **red**, burgundy typically doesn’t have the negative connotations associated with traditional **red**. It is a more comforting and energetic color than an aggressive one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Red interior **colors** stimulate the senses and compel people to act. Red interior design and décor encourage people to take risks and make snap judgments. Red bedroom design makes it easier to wake up but could also cause difficulties in going to sleep. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You don’t have to look like a Christmas tree to pull off green and **red**. Velvet, corduroy, and georgette are interesting choices of fabrics to bring **red** and green together. The materials have an inherent undertone that works well with this color combination. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red can be pai**red** with neutral **colors** like white or black quite easily. For classy outfits, go for grays, browns, or earthy tones. In summers, tangerines, blues, and mustards look vibrant.
