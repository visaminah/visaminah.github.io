## 3 Things You Should Know About House Number And Street Address Example Philippines | Postal addresses in the Philippines
-   The above is just one common example. If you have questions about other situations, please refer to the U.S. Postal Service **address**ing standards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Philippine **address**es always contain the name of the sender, the building number and thoroughfare , the barangay where the building is located, the city or municipality where the barangay is located and, in most cases, the province where the city or municipality is located. In the case of Metro Manila , however, provinces are omitted and, in the case of Manila , include the district instead of the barangay. ZIP codes are also part of the typical Philippine **address**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Philpost recommends using ZIP codes in Philippine **address**es. However, most Filipinos (and even foreigners) do not use, let alone know how to use, Philippine ZIP codes, and thus are usually omitted. Omission of ZIP codes, however, is problematic, since it takes longer for mail to reach its intended destination, as well as that it can increase the chances of mail getting lost in the postal system. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
