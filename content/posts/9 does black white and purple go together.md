## 9 Tips to Does Black White And Purple Go Together | What Colors Should You NOT Wear Together?
-   The key to deciding which colors you should not wear **together** is to have a full-length mirror and try on clothes in as much natural daylight as possible. Too much brown or swampy green will make you look frumpy. And too many bright shades could leave you looking like a fairground attraction! The colors you wear **together** can totally change your image, so take note of your first impression – good or bad – when you look in the mirror at any color combination! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you've determined the feel you're going for—a lively spot for entertaining or a soothing retreat from it all—that can navigate your decision to finding the right shade of **purple**. From there, it's all about finding the right color pairings that will make the color sing, whether it's used in the form of accent pillows or lacquered onto the walls. We asked top designers to share their favorite colors that go with **purple** to inspire a **purple** room of your own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, it’s difficult to set hard and fast rules for what colors you should not wear **together**, as everything depends on the tones and shades of the colors you try to match. Fabric tinting includes a lot of color mixing between warm and cool colors, to create new tones and shades. And really you need to be able to use your own observation of which colors don’t go **together** on other women, to inform your own choices. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Learning which colors you should not wear **together**, is an important part of developing your own sense of style. As children, we don’t always have any sense of harmonizing colors and if we chose our own outfits, the colors could well be pretty mis-matched. But the teen years see us start to develop an appreciation of what looks good on other people and a desire to look just as good. And a vital part of your individual fashion style is knowing which colors you shouldn’t wear **together**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some colors seem to have endless pairings (think: sky blue, hunter green, and stormy gray), while others may seem to constrain our decorating scheme when using them. Purple can often be one of those colors for design enthusiasts, though many designers have found myriad ways to incorporate the color into their projects. This may need to begin with expanding our knowledge of **purple** shades as the word often conjures up a classic Crayola crayon color (and possibly an endearing boy named Harold to go with it). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But other times, a new fashion just turns out to be a horrendous mistake – like the fashion for re-decorating bars in bright orange and **purple** in the 1970’s! That was a classic warm clashes with cool color disaster. And a couple of years ago, a fashion stylist dressed Meghan Markle in an attention-grabbing outfit of a **purple** dress under a red coat. It’s just too much color intensity, even though both are cool colors, so it’s tiring on the eyes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For example, red can have orange undertones and it can also have deep pink undertones, which would make a terrible mis-match. And the reason is that orange is a warm color, but deep pink is a cool color. Similarly, green can have so many different shades – some of which include yellow and others which include blue. So if you put different shades of green **together**, you can get an unpleasant clash between the yellow and blue undertones, even though they are both cool colors! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For instance, black can have a variety of undertones, including brown, green, blue and **purple**. So you wouldn’t want to wear a brown blouse with a black skirt or trousers, if the black fabric had a blue or **purple** undertone. This is because brown is a warm color, which would not look good with blue or **purple**, which are cool colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Designer Renvy Graves Pittman says at the far end of the spectrum, you have rich aubergines—which Mario Buatta was famous for using in his work. At the opposing end is lavender, while mid-range colors like amethyst establish a base point even better than a true, royal **purple**. Designer Henry Prideaux notes that it is quite a versatile, "sometimes regal" color, which makes **purple** a great option when designing traditional and contemporary interiors alike. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
