## 17 Interesting Facts How Do You Use A Laser Level For Framing | Using A Laser Level To Level Ground
-   Set the tripod on firm ground and attach the **laser** level to the head of the tripod. The tripod head should be reasonably level. Adjust the level by adjusting the length of one of the tripod legs. Use the levelling bubble on the **laser** level if it has one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most professionals that use **laser** levels use them to make their working life easier. Often, they will have large areas that need to be the same level. Often the jobs take days or weeks to complete. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Inside a building (or home) this is most likely going to the floor level. This can have an arbitrary value in some corner. Measure from the floor and read the measurement from the centre of the **laser** line. Add this value to the floor level value. This will be your height of collimation or height of instrument. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now that the height of the **laser** level beam is known we are now able to take measurements. These measurements are always taken perpendicular to the **laser** beam. Each measurement can be either subtracted from (for below the **laser** beam) or added to (for above the **laser** beam) the height of collimation giving a new elevation measurement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are two different types of **laser** levels that can do sloping levels. These slope matching **laser** levels and grade (single and dual) **laser** levels. The main difference between the two (apart from the cost) is the amount to which they can be set from the horizontal or vertical plane. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A slope matching **laser** level is a horizontal **laser** level that the self-levelling feature can be manually altered to achieve a desired slope. These **laser** levels will always revert back to the horizontal plane when they are switched of and on again. Using the slope matching features of these **laser** levels is usually requires two people. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Installing new drywall against bare wood studs requires attention to the drywall's horizontal orientation. The drywall cannot be hung off-plumb; if it is, the bottoms of the sheets will need to be trimmed where they meet the floor aand they will throw off adjacent drywall panels. As a solution, you can use a self leveling drywall **laser**. These rotating electronic devices project a level, horizontal line across the entire room. This line can be used to line up the new drywall for an accurate installation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All **laser** levels provide a horizontal (and/or a vertical) reference plane. Nearly all **laser** levels are self-levelling as long as they are setup within 4 degrees of horizontal. Once the **laser** level has self-levelled, the **laser** beam from it will provide the horizontal reference plane from which all measurements can be taken. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Outside, on construction sites we will have a TBM established before work commences. Measure from the TBM using an E-Grad staff and **laser** detector to find the height of the **laser** beam above the TBM. Add this measurement to the value of the TBM and this will be your height of collimation or height of instrument. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **laser** level can be setup in the most convenient spot each day. Go to the relevant datum point. Set the **laser** detector at the correct level on the measuring staff and you are ready to go to work. That is the way to shoot elevations with a **laser** level easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dual grade **laser** levels allow for a grade to be set on either of the x or y axis of the level. Both axes can be set at the same time. Careful setup and alignment of the axes of the **laser** level is required when this is being used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A single grade **laser** level will only allow the desired grade to work along one axis of the grade **laser**. There will be a sighting line on the top of the **laser** level which will indicate the line of the axis that can be set. There will also be markings that indicate which way the slope will fall. A positive angle will indicate a rise from the **laser** level. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mark the wall with a suitable horizontal line or take a reading on the staff. At this point you should have the same level (or difference in level if noted) marked as the previous round. If there is a substantial difference in level (more than the specified manufacturerâ€™s tolerance) then you should get the rotating **laser** serviced at your preferred survey equipment specialist. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I would recommend that site staff should check a rotating **laser** for accuracy every week. This site check should also be logged and stored with the Calibration Certificate for the rotating **laser**. Any deterioration in the accuracy of the rotating **laser** can then be easily identified and the rotating **laser** can be serviced and calibrated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grade **laser** levels are available in two different formats. Either single grade or dual grade. Grade **laser** levels will self-level to horizontal. A specific grade for the works to be done can then be typed into the **laser** level, which will then adjust the **laser** beam to that grade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For the purpose of this article and to keep things simple I am going to ignore any affects due to the curvature of the earth. The current maximum range for rotating **laser** levels is about 800m (2600ft). And thus, the curvature of the earth is negligible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The accuracy of **laser** levels can vary tremendously. It is important to select the right type of **laser** level for the type of work to be done. It is also important to check that your **laser** level is accurate. Because when a **laser** level is wrong it can have disastrous consequences. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
