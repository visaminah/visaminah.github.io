## 7 Things You Should Know About Best Carbon Steel Seasoning Wax | Cast Iron Wax
-   New, unseasoned carbon steel pans come with a protective layer to prevent them from rusting. You can tell your pan is unseasoned if it has a silver metal color, instead of a pitch black hue. My pan had a coat of bees**wax** applied to it in the factory, and other pans might use different technology for protection prior to use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   PS. It’s very important that the oil that coats your pan is super thin to ensure even **seasoning**. You should wipe off any excess oil if you accidentally add too much oil to your pan. It will produce a sticky uneven surface that will require cleanup later. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When searching for a good quality carbon steel pan, chances are you'll often hear the term "**seasoning**." Seasoning is the process of coating a pan with heated oil to create a protective barrier, which helps ensure a nonstick and rust-resistant surface. Like cast iron, **seasoning** carbon steel is a vital process, so we followed the manufacturer's instructions to season each pan. If a pan was labeled pre-seasoned, we did not do any extra **seasoning** to see how functional the manufacturer's coating was. Most manufacturers advised against using soap when cleaning, so we washed each pan with hot water and a scrub brush to help preserve the **seasoning** of each. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Heat up your pan on the stovetop over medium-high heat until it starts to smoke. Continue heating the pan until you see a golden brown color start to appear. If you’re **seasoning** a large pan, you might see the surface form an uneven color. Move the pan around your stove so it will color evenly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Carbon steel pans combine the durability of a cast-iron skillet with the functionality of a nonstick pan, so it's important to find a pan that can conduct heat evenly on both the stovetop and in the oven while maintaining a completely slick surface. Just like cast iron, carbon steel pans require **seasoning**—the more you season them, the more nonstick they become over time. When shopping for a pan, pay attention to whether it comes pre-seasoned or if you'll need to season it yourself, and keep in mind that it won't be as slick on the first use as it may be on the 100th use. Some of the pans we tested arrived pre-seasoned, and some we seasoned ourselves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Different from a nonstick pan, the oil is fully absorbed by the pan and it will turn the pan darker (further **seasoning**). You can expect this until the pan is well seasoned. So be sure to use a bit more oil in your dish if your pan is newly seasoned. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some tutorials suggest wiping oil on the outside of the pan, as well. I find it unnecessary. I usually do not wash the **wax** coating from the exterior of the pan, as it will protect the pan well over time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
