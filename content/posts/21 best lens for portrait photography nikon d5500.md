## 21 Tips to Best Lens For Portrait Photography Nikon D5500 | Best Wildlife Lens For "Nikon D5500"
-   For less than the price of the two previous Nikon **lens**es, you can have one **lens** that does it all. Time is money, and for the commercial portrait photographer versatility in your gear is a premium. Throw this **lens** on and get the job done! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But, if your focus is high-end art portraiture then Nikon does offer a version of the 50mm **lens** with a maximum aperture of f/1.4. This will allow more background blurring and a smaller area of sharp focus. Think photographs where the eyes of your subject are in focus, but the tip of the nose, the ears and the rest of the head are blurry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I will choose to take a zoom **lens** over a prime **lens** for any commercial job where I am on the clock. The confidence in knowing that the one **lens** on my camera can get it all done is key. When working with a family, especially one with young children, you don’t have all the time in the world to change **lens**es and restage shoots. You need to be able to capture those candid moments, and the Tamron 24-70mm won’t let you down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Each **lens** has a maximum aperture. This is the lowest aperture you can use with that particular **lens**. In order to obtain apertures between f/1.2 and f/2.8, you’ll need a **lens** that is capable of getting that low. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are working in a studio with a flash unit, then your shutter speed will likely be synced at 1/200 of a second, and your aperture much smaller to compensate, making wide maximum apertures a moot point in the decision to purchase. Furthermore, I wouldn’t be concerned about shooting in low light with this **lens**. The f/2.8 aperture is still acceptable, and modern camera bodies are capable of handling higher ISO levels with little noticeable grain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The beauty of the Nikon 50mm **lens** is in its simplicity and time tested usability. Prime **lens**es are simple and easy to use – you move around until your frame is desirably filled, then you shoot. Want more space around the subject? Take a few steps back. Want your subject to fill the frame a little more? Take a few steps forward. It’s really that simple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Typically, as focal length increases the maximum aperture decreases (a larger f-stop), and less light makes its way through your **lens** to the camera sensor. Nikon has managed to overcome this, equipping the 85mm **lens** with a wide f/1.4 aperture, making it highly capable of producing high-quality images in low light, and beautiful background bokeh. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For example, the D5100 kit **lens** can only go down to f/3.5 when shooting towards the wide end (18mm) and f/5.6 when shooting towards the long end (55mm). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Tamron 24-70mm similarly fits into this category, but with the added versatility of zoom capabilities. No longer do you have to take a few steps back to fit the whole family in the frame, but just a little twist of the wrist, and a click of the shutter. You can go out on the job with only this **lens** and be confident in getting all the shots you need, and getting it done with ease. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Distortion is not so problematic when shooting landscapes, but becomes obvious when shooting photographs of people and faces. You might notice straight lines (such as a fence) appearing curved towards the edges of an image, or the appearance of bulging noses and facial features of images taken with a wide-angle **lens**. This is distortion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At 35mm, this **lens** is great for capturing wide shots. You can feel confident getting the whole family in the frame when shooting in tighter spaces. And, while not as compressing as the Nikon 50mm or 85mm, image distortion will appear minimal with good distance to your subjects. But get up close and you will notice the bulging features and less attractive qualities associated with wide-angle photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **lens** is great for shooting single portraits, but when considering this **lens** as an ideal candidate for shooting family portraits, its long focal length becomes less ideal. Getting an entire family framed nicely in a shot with an 85mm **lens** will mean having to move quite far from the subjects. If you are shooting inside, or in a studio, it might be impossible to back up far enough. If it were your only **lens** you would be in trouble. But for grabbing beautiful headshots and close-ups, this is your go-to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As I mentioned before, there is a distinction between the needs and desires of the art and commercial photographer. This **lens** is truly geared towards the commercial family portrait photographer. The f/2.8 aperture may appear less desirable than its Nikon prime **lens** counterparts, but in a commercial setting, it is unlikely to be running the aperture that wide anyway. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sigma 35mm is a high-quality **lens**, and it is obvious in the images it produces. You will notice a distinct sharpness in the photos you take, and good contrast, even with your aperture wide open. As I mentioned, the **lens** is a niche product, and not necessarily one I would recommend to the photographer beginning to dabble in family portraiture. But for the professionals looking for a high-quality product to add to their arsenal, the Sigma 35mm has what it takes to inspire a new photographic direction. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to capture portraits, where the subject is sharp and the background is out of focus, it’s best to use a “bright” **lens** with a maximum aperture between f/1.2 and f/2.8. Lower f-numbers reduce the area in focus, giving you a shorter area in focus. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are shooting commercial family portraits, then maximum aperture may not be as important as versatility, or usability. You’re going to want something that you can rely on to get the job done. The Nikon 50mm **lens** is a tried and true classic – a wide enough angle to capture an entire scene, yet just narrow enough to avoid significant **lens** distortion. It’s so easy to use and capture great images, it’s almost a crime! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The large aperture value of the Nikon 50mm is certainly a selling point, and another reason to have this **lens** in your camera bag. Being able to really open the aperture up makes this **lens** invaluable when shooting in low light. Maintaining a higher shutter speed will help reduce motion blur, giving sharp, well-exposed images of your subjects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the majority of your portraits will be indoors or in low light, it would be best to use an external speedlight in addition to one of the “bright” **lens**es mentioned above. An external speedlight will allow you to bounce light off a ceiling, rather than directly at your subject. This spreads the light evenly throughout the room, giving you more natural looking portraits indoors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the main selling points of the Sigma 35mm is the large f/1.4 aperture. This **lens** excels in low light conditions. Shoot confidently, with crisp focus and beautiful background bokeh without having to crank the ISO. When wide open you can achieve an extremely shallow depth of field – a trademark effect for the professional art-portrait photographer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Portrait mode will automatically adjust in-camera settings to capture soft, natural looking skin tones. With a proper **lens**, it will also blur the background to make the subject pop. See how to enable portrait mode or refer to page 30 of the manual. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When photographing people the longer your focal length, the more compresses, and therefore more attractive your subjects will appear. Nikon 85mm really plays into this, producing sharp, attractive images, with very little noticeable distortion. Again, this is a prime **lens** (fixed focal length), so it is simple and easy to use – slap it on and what you see is what you get. Move around, fill the frame, take the shot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
