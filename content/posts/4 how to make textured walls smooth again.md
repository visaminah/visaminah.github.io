## 4 Things About How To Make Textured Walls Smooth Again | How To Smooth Heavy Textured Walls
-   If the texture on the **walls** has been painted it wonâ€™t be possible to use the soak and scrape method as the paint will repel the water and keep the texture from softening. That means you will need to apply a skim coat over the entire textured surface that will receive the wallpaper. Even though helpful online videos make it look easy, it is not. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, you need to prime the **walls**. There are different primers depending upon the porosity of the surface being covered. Some surfaces are non-porous and others are more porous. Each will require a different primer for superior results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the texture on the **walls** has never been painted, it can usually be removed by a process called soak and scrape. The method is pretty straightforward and it works just like it sounds. Just be careful not to over soak the **walls**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let the skim coat dry for 24-48 hours and apply a second coat if needed. Once you are satisfied with the results, **smooth** the finished product with sandpaper sponges and rub very lightly. You are only sanding joint compound, and it comes off quickly. Over-sanding will require that you do another skim coat and repeat the process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
