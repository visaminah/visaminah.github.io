## 16 Fun Facts What Does Adding Peat Moss Do To Soil | will adding peat moss do to soil
-   Many nutrients are positively-charged ions. Cation-exchange-capacity (CEC) refers to the negative charge of the **soil**, which allows it to hold onto positively-charged nutrients. (source) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is best to till and amend bare **soil** late in the fall before the ground freezes. This will prevent weeds from germinating on bare **soil**, and it allows organic matter to begin to break down. The **soil** will be loose from tilling, and it is important to keep it from getting compacted. Don’t allow people to walk or drive on the tilled area, or else you will need to till again before planting, which can destroy the structure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat moss is very difficult to break down, and the effects it has on porosity last much longer than compost. However, because it is difficult to break down, it doesn’t release nutrients into the **soil**. This is why you need to add **peat** moss and compost together to increase porosity and add nutrition. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For example, if your lawn and garden space is 35’ x 25’, you need to amend 875sq’. Each large bale of **peat** moss contains 3.8 cubic feet of material, which is enough to cover 90sq’ at a 1” depth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sphagnum moss grows in bogs. As the moss matures, old, dead plant material forms layers underneath the living moss. These deposits can grow to over 20’ in-depth, and form the material we call **peat**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat moss can be a useful amendment in clay **soil**s IF you plan on doing regular **soil** tests. Peat moss can help with drainage by providing stable organic matter in the **soil**. However, it also increases the amount of water and nutrients clay will hold, which can cause root rots and nutrient toxicities. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is where **peat** moss truly shines. Clay **soil** is made up of tiny particles that pack together and form impenetrable layers. This makes it incredibly difficult for water to penetrate, and if it succeeds, it is just as hard to drain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How can I improve my pH? Clay **soil**s are naturally alkaline, but plants prefer acidic environments. Organic matter generally lowers pH, so consistent compost and **peat** moss amendments can lower pH gradually over time. However, for more reliable results, it is better to use sulfur to lower pH and rely on organic matter to help maintain lower pH values. Learn more about **soil** alkalinity here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Soak the moss in a large bin or tub of water for 24 hours. Peat is difficult to saturate, especially in the **soil**. Soaking it first helps it incorporate into the **soil** instead of creating dry patches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How much compost should I add to my clay **soil**? Compost is the best **soil** amendment and should be the primary focus in improving clay **soil**. Add up to 3” to existing lawns and landscapes, and use compost as a topdressing around the drip ring of established plants. After each major addition of organic matter, the nitrogen in the **soil** will drop, so you may need to supplement with fertilizer on established lawns. Read our article on compost for more information. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is good news for homeowners with sandy **soil**s. Sand is generally acidic and suffers from poor water holding capacity. Peat moss would help **soil**s retain water, but has not been recommended for sandy **soil**s because they are already acidic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blueberries are a popular acid-loving plant, and most growers swear by **peat** moss. However, the addition of **peat** moss has less to do with pH and more to do with how blueberry roots access nutrients. Peat moss helps encourage fungi on the roots that enable the plants to grow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Clay textures can improve, but it takes time and sweat. The best thing you can add to a clay **soil** is organic matter. Compost is the best general-purpose **soil** amendment, but there are specific **soil** conditions where other organic materials would be beneficial. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Clay **soil** is difficult to manage. When it’s wet, it’s a slippery, sticky mess. When it’s dry, you need a jackhammer to till a vegetable patch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sphagnum moss is used to line baskets, for arts & crafts, and as a **soil** amendment. Sphagnum moss can be milled and baled, or sold in loose in bags. Sphagnum moss has a neutral pH and helps with aeration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Incorporating large amounts of organic matter into your **soil** can cause a temporary loss in nitrogen. As the material decomposes, it draws nitrogen from the **soil** to support the process. Once decomposition is complete, nitrogen is released back to the **soil** and is available for plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
