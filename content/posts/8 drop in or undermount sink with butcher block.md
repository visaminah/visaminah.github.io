## 8 Fun Facts Drop In Or Undermount Sink With Butcher Block | Best Sink For Butcher Block Countertop
-   Wood Countertops with Undermount **sink**s are the most popular style of **sink** we accommodate. The **undermount** **sink** style is our preferred style to use with wood countertops. They provide a clean line on the surface and also enable us to incorporate drainboards when used with Durata® waterproof finish. We recommend a 1/2″ radius edge profile to be used on the **sink** opening but can accommodate a variety of edge profiles to suit your design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I had marked where the center of the **sink** should go when we dry fit the boards….so now I measured the center of the **sink** opening and aligned those two marks. The other thing to keep in mind is how far you want the **sink** to sit back. We did three inches from the front. We needed to have enough countertop in the back for the faucet and enough countertop in the front to mount the **sink** to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How I made the template was to trace the paper template on this piece of 1/4″ plywood. Then I measured the distance from the edge of the router blade to the edge of the router….the router would sit on the inside of the cut plywood and the plywood would be a guideline for it while it cut the opening for the **sink**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Request a butcher block with **sink** quote below. Additional drawings or specifications can be emailed to glumber@glumber.com. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the countertops were cut and dry fit to the cabinets and walls….it was time to cut the **sink** hole. Remember our lovely Moen **sink**? Here are the details on that beauty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The openings are cut based on your centerline placement with a preferred set back of 3 to 4 inches from the edge of the counter. The cut out size is typically based on the manufacturer template, or a handmade physical template for custom made one of a kind **sink**s. It is rare that we require the actual **sink** to do the cut out. The countertop will be designed to overhang the **sink** opening by 1/8″ to allow water to naturally fall into the **sink** and not collect on the **sink** ledge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To dry fit the **sink**, we followed the basic steps that we did in this past post. First you align the **sink** on the hole….this required me to get under the countertop while it was on sawhorses and make sure everything was right. Then the guys marked the location. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the **sink** is in place, make sure your faucet can go in and make sure none of the braces will interfere with cabinetry frames. Then we had to install the shield for the dishwasher. It went where Danny’s hand is in the photo below…. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
