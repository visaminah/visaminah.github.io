## 6 Things You Should Know About How To Calculate Linear Feet For Flooring | Linear Foot
-   For example, U-Pack is a leading company when it comes to shipping household belongings using freight trailers. According to their website, U-Pack offers 28-foot moving trailers that have a loading capacity of 2,000 cubic **feet** each. The inside of each of their trailers can fit almost all of the belongings in your entire home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Instead of just charging by weight or per mile, freight moving companies typically charge based on the total amount of linear footage that your furniture takes up. This way, you aren’t paying for an entire truck, or paying extra because your belongings may be heavy. Using linear footage, your estimate is generally based on how long your items are and how many **feet** they will take up in the truck. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cutting waste also allows for some minor defects, if any, in the **flooring** to be cut out or eliminated. If you are doing a project that involves several rooms which includes a lot of cutting you should calculate 10-15% more for additional **flooring** material. This will allow for less waste in one large room opposed to several smaller rooms. Please review the Diagram provided below to properly measure square footage for the new floor you wish to install. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Measuring in linear **feet** comes in handy when you are considering how much floor space will be taken up by an object. For example, let’s say you need to rent a storage unit. If you need to store things like couches, mattresses or motorcycles, then you might want to consider how much linear footage you may need. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While renting out the entire trailer is ideal when making a large move, customers who have smaller moves and a lighter lift are charged for the space they use instead. When taking this route, the minimum is five linear **feet**. Measuring by linear **feet** is a way to save space, time and ultimately save more money if you can utilize options like the ones that U-Pack offers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another instance where one may want to measure in linear **feet** is when moving cross-country, or another long distance. Typically, if you’re moving to a place that is not too far away, you may opt for a U-Haul or another self-service truck rental company. However, if the place you’re moving to is far away, you may want to hire a freight moving company to assist in your move. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
