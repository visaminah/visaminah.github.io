-   Think of an overall style. The style of your room plays an important part in choosing which colors should go with your **brown** furniture.

All the design elements that you put into the space, including the pillows should match the style of your room to create a cohesive overall look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pairing **brown** furniture with a **brown** wall paint color also creates a perfect monochromatic scheme.

-   If you want more color, you can explore mellow hues and pastel shades of yellow and green. These two colors work well with **brown** paneling, whether in a traditional or contemporary setting.

So when you are thinking about what colors make **brown**, the answer is: it depends. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although wall paneling makes a house more interesting, it can sometimes make a house feel outdated. Dark **brown** wall paneling also has the tendency to make a room feel closed in.

With a **brown** floor, you can easily play up the colors of your furniture, furnishings and accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another personal favorite of mine is combining **orange** with blue. It can be **orange** with a dark navy suit or a mid blue, or a royal blue suit, and again, it can be your tie, can be your pocket square, maybe your shirt. It just helps to really offset each other because there’s enough contrast and it’s a bold combination. It’s similar to yellow, so it’s good if you want to make a noticeable first impression without being just the clown that is over-the-top obnoxious. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Orange is a vibrant color and conveys positivity. But you should know what colors go well with **orange**. You might end up looking like a Halloween queen if you don’t. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
