## 6 Things You Should Know About How To Build A Roof In Minecraft Nintendo Switch | how to build a roof in minecraft nintendo switch
-   While the walls and **roof** of a home tend to get a lot of the focus, the floors of homes need some love too. If players want some extra layers to what they walk on, carpets are a great way to go. These thin squares of wool can be placed on top of anything that is exactly one block tall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you look at the architecture in the world around you, you’ll see many different types of **roof** designs. Since Minecraft is an open-world sandbox, you can create every single **roof** design the real world has to offer and more. If you’re looking for the best **roof** designs in Minecraft, you’ve come to the right place. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most blocks will work for a preliminary house, whether it’s Dirt, Wood, or Cobblestone. Sand and Gravel will also work, but they cannot be used to make a **roof**, as they will fall down. Keep in mind that using wood-based blocks will make the building susceptible to fire, so we recommend using stone or other mined blocks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **roof** design is perfect if you have a medium-sized house and want it to look cute and mid-modern. Picture an upside-down V, but less steep on both sides. To build it, place your central block and then place blocks 1/2 a space down going left and right until one block hangs off from where it connects with the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Clerestory Roof is perfect for two-story buildings. It adds natural light to the loft and looks fantastic. Place one slab where you want the lower **roof** to end. Six slab places above the first slab, place a slab and build seven more slabs going down and to the right. At the starting slab, build five slabs going down and to the left. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Though this one is the simplest on the list, sometimes simple is better. The Flat Roof design in Minecraft looks very modern and leaves room for you to decorate in other ways like building a beautiful fence. To build this **roof** design, simply place slabs flat across your structure with one or two jutting out from where it connects with the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
