-   What is **schematic** **diagram**? Definition and meaning (2017) in Available at: (2017) in Available at: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/**schematic**-**diagram**.html (Accessed: 9 February 2017). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the power system is unbalanced, but it is linear (or can be approximated by a linear system), then Fortescue's theorem (symmetrical components) can be applied. In this way, from the one-line **diagram**, three different per-phase **schematic** **diagram**s are obtained, known as sequence **diagram**s: positive sequence **diagram**, negative sequence **diagram**, and zero sequence **diagram**. Each of these **diagram**s can be represented as an impedance **diagram** or as an admittance **diagram**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Free Online Drawing Software Tools 2022: Diagrams are effective communication elements that can visualize and make others understand our concepts faster than anything else. There are hundreds of drawing tools available online but choosing the right **diagram**matic tool to draw the figures in our thesis is quite complicated also a single tool cannot be more effective for all kinds of **diagram**s. with this intention, ilovephd covers the top 10 free online drawing tools for effective thesis **diagram**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   6.Labeling of the parts and components used in the **schematic**s are really very important. All parts should have values or types indicated; it’s best to give all parts a label, too, e.g., R7 or IC3. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The microstructure of most materials and products has a direct influence on function and stability. To understand the microstructure, good microscopy is needed. In turn, understanding microscopy images requires knowledge of the used methods and product expertise. Therefore, at Consistence, we use **schematic** drawings as a language to communicate learnings and insights with our customers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After completing our first assignment of are ‘Vogler Presentation’ we began a new project, task 1 being to create a **schematic** based on a chosen film, and then create an artefact related to our findings and research. Our group had a very optimistic outlook on this challenge because we had all worked so well together in the previous task, also the film given to us for the Schematic task, ‘Raging Bull’ (1980) was a very interesting watch. Mainly because I would have never really watched a film of this genre on my own terms, so having to watch it as part of our task was certainly a good reason to watch such a well thought out film. Having never done a task like this before, I wanted to familiarise myself with what a **schematic** actually is. Following a recent group meeting we decided it would best benefit the team to plan and schedule how we should tackle such a tedious task of creating a **schematic**, including looking at last year’s works and how to apply the positive aspects of their work to our own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The group’s original idea was to create the Schematic pointing downwards so the information and timeline could be structured in a non complicated way, followed by some possible icons instead of a colour scheme to represent the characters. When seeing last years Schematic Diagrams, we wanted to try and challenge the usual format and really liked the idea of transforming our Schematic **diagram** into a circular shape rather than the conventional use of straight lines. What better way to link our Schematic **diagram** to the film ‘Raging Bull‘(1980) than to make it in the shape of a bull ring with iconography possibly related to this as well, such as a bull’s head. The circular shape of the **diagram** would also indicate how the beginning of the film starts at the end in a continuous cycle, or a loop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **schematic** representation of research design is shown in figure 4.1. This figure demonstrates the variables and the statistical analysis used to test these variables. The statistical package for social science (IBM SPSS v19) was used for statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics, Cronbah’s alpha (reliability measure), factor analysis, cluster analysis, ANOVA, cross analysis and chi-squared test were used as statistical techniques in the quantitative study. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Based on the minimal details provided here, it may seem that the two papers are an instance of salami slicing, the act of breaking up a larger paper into smaller papers to increase one’s publication count. This obviously is an unethical practice. The one instance in which this would be okay to do is when the research is large enough to warrant multiple publications. You would be the best person to decide. As you are anyway mulling over the **schematic** **diagram**, and although the second paper is so close to publication, now might be a good time to think over the situation of the two papers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   7.A good **schematic** makes the circuit functions clear. Try to keep functional areas distinct. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Every new electrical circuit board design starts as an idea. That idea is then defined, with words and **diagram**s, in a specification. Anyone can take an idea this far, but the next step requires a fundamental understanding of circuit **schematic**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Schematics have two fundamental purposes. First, they communicate design intent. To someone skilled in the art of electrical design, **schematic**s should clearly convey the intent of the design. And second, they exist to direct and drive the PCB layout. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However the real challenge is, how to create the circular shape of the **diagram** without making the overall piece too convoluted or without enough room to provide information. I suggested that maybe these circular **diagram**s could be separated into two, with one being linked to the main characters of the plot, and the other linked to secondary characters. Although, this would have complicated the **diagram** more than needs be, we wanted all of the information to be easily accessible by remaining all in the one place. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A re-imagined circular **schematic** **diagram** based on the London Underground – http://www.vicchi.org/2013/02/01/re-imagining-the-london-tube-map-with-curves-and-circles/ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A well-drawn **schematic** **diagram** is very important for understanding the working of the circuit and for trouble shooting of the problems. A poor and ambiguous drawn **schematic** **diagram** is hazardous because it creates the confusion in the working of the circuit. By keeping a few rules and tactics in mind, we are able to draw a good and confusion free **schematic** in no more time than it takes to draw a poor one. A good and neatly drawn **schematic** **diagram** saves the time and also the resources. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A the connecting leads or pins of a component in a **schematic** **diagram** can be identified using letters or abreviations. For example, the connecting leads of a bipolar junction transistor, (BJT) are identified as E (emitter), B (base), and C (collector). Arrows are also used within **schematic** symbols to indicate the direction of convertional current flow around a circuit or through a component, or are used as part of their graphical symbol to show that the components has a variable or adjustable value. For example, a potentiometer or rheostat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I Hope, these online **diagram**matic tools may help you to create figures online to draw a graph for a research paper, make scientific flowcharts, make **diagram**s with free figure drawing software. If you know of any other useful tool, do comment below. Thank you! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For example, a subway map intended for passengers may represent a subway station with a dot. The dot is not intended to resemble the actual station at all but aims to give the viewer information without unnecessary visual clutter. A **schematic** **diagram** of a chemical process uses symbols in place of detailed representations of the vessels, piping, valves, pumps, and other equipment that compose the system, thus emphasizing the functions of the individual elements and the interconnections among them and suppresses their physical details. In an electronic circuit **diagram**, the layout of the symbols may not look anything like the circuit as it appears in the physical world: instead of representing the way the circuit looks, the **schematic** aims to capture, on a more general level, the way it works. This may be contrasted with a wiring **diagram**, which preserves the spatial relationships between each of its components. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In electronic design automation, until the 1980s **schematic**s were virtually the only formal representation for circuits. More recently, with the progress of computer technology, other representations were introduced and specialized computer languages were developed, since with the explosive growth of the complexity of electronic circuits, traditional **schematic**s are becoming less practical. For example, hardware description languages are indispensable for modern digital circuit design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In electric power systems design, a **schematic** drawing called a one-line **diagram** is frequently used to represent substations, distribution systems or even whole electrical power grids. These **diagram**s simplify and compress the details that would be repeated on each phase of a three-phase system, showing only one element instead of three. Electrical **diagram**s for switchgear often have common device functions designate by standard function numbers. Another type of **diagram** used for power systems is a three-line **diagram**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **schematic** we had to create, in regards to this task, is a **diagram** that represents the timeline or narrative of a film, including major and minor characters and what they do on and off screen until the end of the narrative. As a cause of its simplistic approach, **schematic** **diagram**s tend to use iconography instead of realistic pictures, this is done in order to present the viewers information in its simplest form. A great definition I found of what a Schematic is from (What is **schematic** **diagram**? Definition and meaning, 2017) is “A drawing showing all significant components, parts, or tasks (and their interconnections) of a circuit, device, flow, process, or project by means of standard symbols. This is one of the main reasons why these types of **diagram**s are used on things complicated as railway station maps or the design of equipment in the electronic industry. It omits unimportant information and simplifies the subject to it’s core details, much like how our group want to deconstruct the film ‘Raging Bull‘ (1980). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There might actually be two elements to consider here. One is that of the **diagram** for this paper. The other is the matter of the other paper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For analysis purposes of a power system, from the one-line **diagram**, if the system is balanced, an equivalent per-phase (or single-phase) **schematic** **diagram** can be obtained. If all of the parameters are represented as impedances and voltage sources, the equivalent per-phase **schematic** **diagram** is called an impedance **diagram**. If all of the parameters are represented as admittances and current sources, the equivalent per-phase **schematic** **diagram** is called an admittance **diagram**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Schematics for electronic circuits are prepared by designers using EDA (electronic design automation) tools called **schematic** capture tools or **schematic** entry tools. These tools go beyond simple drawing of devices and connections. Usually they are integrated into the whole design flow and linked to other EDA tools for verification and simulation of the circuit under design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Coming to the query of the **schematic**, that brings up questions of its own. How large is the **diagram** (and therefore, the experiment)? Do you plan to make only cosmetic changes, such as shading and shape? (That may make the two **diagram**s look somewhat different, but not significantly so.) Do you plan to make changes that might impact the flow of the experiment and possibly even the results? (This obviously may not work.) And all this gets further complicated because your paper is at the proofing stage, when only minor changes (such as spellos and punctuation) are okay to fix. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In electrical and electronic industry, a **schematic** **diagram** is often used to describe the design of equipment. Schematic **diagram**s are often used for the maintenance and repair of electronic and electromechanical systems.[1] While **schematic**s were traditionally drawn by hand, using standardized templates or pre-printed adhesive symbols, today electronic design automation software (EDA or "electrical CAD") is often used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   8. Examine **schematic**s drawn in commercial application notes, textbooks, etc. to see examples of good **schematic**s.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
