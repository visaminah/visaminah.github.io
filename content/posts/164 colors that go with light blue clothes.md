-   For patterned ties, pick a tie containing a color that’s similar to your shirt’s.

-   Super combination for "going out" - a gala event or party. Most impressively combination of dark **blue** and gold...

To achieve this unique look, you can wear a sky **blue** shirt dress that consists of a button up shirt upper part and a midi pleated dress lower part.

-   Black does not always work well with light purple **colors**, however. It can sometimes make light purple **colors** look washed out or make them appear gray. Use caution when pairing such light and dark shades together, and consider adding an element of white to the look to help keep the light purple from looking dull. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now that you’re across all things **blue**, it’s time to decide what colour palette you will match it with. While some colours naturally work well together, some definitely do not. Complementary colours (which are those that you'll find opposite each other on the colour wheel) often create a vibrant interior while analogous colours (which are close neighbours on the colour wheel) create a calming one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red and **blue** are always striking. But if bright red and cerulean form a combination that’s a little loud for your taste, the muted nature of clay red just might work. Since clay red is close to being a neutral, you might be able to find clay-red coats like the one in the picture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Try using intense sunny yellow for a bold contrast or soft yellow for an airier look. It also works to combine various shades of sky **blue** with a single shade of yellow. If you like to get creative with combining **colors**, this is a great place to start! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue is one of the most popular **colors** in fashionistas' wardrobes, as it is almost universal. It is also appropriate in office business suits, an evening **blue** dress will make you irresistible. It is important to pair it correctly with other **colors** so that it reveals its best qualities to you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black, white, brown, beige and grey are core neutrals for women’s wardrobes. They work tirelessly to blend with literally any other shade under the sun. You can consider them your fuss-free foundation tones when deducing what **colors** go well together. They even pair well with those trickier statement shades, such as chartreuse. What’s not to love? Take a peek at how we leverage a handful of neutrals to create dynamic outfit duos. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red can be paired with neutral **colors** like white or black quite easily. For classy outfits, go for grays, browns, or earthy tones. In summers, tangerines, **blue**s, and mustards look vibrant. It depends on where you are headed and what your personal preference is, but here’s a list with a little bit of everything. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, you can still wear a darker **blue** shirt and opt for a darker green necktie, but you need to ensure the contrast is still there and the tie doesn’t get lost in the rest of the outfit. I would even say you can wear a light green tie in a darker **blue** shirt since it still looks good in most cases. However, wear a darker green tie if you want to feel safe with your choice - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is despite both shades belonging to the same color family. In both cases, the choice of tie color is relatively simple. The tie will build a bridge between the two **blue**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I also love a patterned tie. When choosing a patterned tie, the trick is to mix two **colors**, one being the color of your shirt and the other a complementary or contrasting color. For example, with a **blue** shirt, you can wear a tie with different shades of **blue** since it will look flawless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of the entire color palette, **blue** is the most controversial and mysterious color. How diverse are the shades of **blue**, so different associations it evokes in us. Light **blue** is like an endless sky, it is light and airy, and dark **blue** is heavy, a little gloomy, like a bottomless ocean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This striking combination often looks almost regal. But it’s also at home in more casual contexts. As you can see in the picture, these two **colors** make quite a statement when combined in a pattern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a bolder (but more difficult) look, choose a pastel or bold-colored shirt. Next in line after white and light-colored shirts are pastel shirts. These **colors** are fairly light, but not as neutral as **colors** like white and light **blue** – pastel shirts give the wearer a chance to pull off striking – or clashing – combinations. Finally, bold, richly-colored dress shirts offer truly unique possibilities. Paired with an appropriate tie, they can give the wearer a more sophisticated look, but can look showy or ridiculous when paired with inappropriate ties. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for a head-turning combination of **colors**, magenta and yellow is a great one to choose. Like cerulean and neon green, this is a nice combination for beachwear or activewear. But for slightly more formal occasions, wearing a pink dress with a yellow purse (or vice versa) is a great way to stand out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It can be split into two halves – “warm” **colors** and “cool” **colors**. Warm **colors** include reds, oranges, and yellows. Cool **colors** include **blue**s, greens, and purples. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One color combination we haven’t talked about yet is purple and black, which can also make a striking combination. Black works well with dark **colors** of purple since it can make these dark shades pop. This can make dark purple **colors** look more intense than they normally would against other color shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you like the energy of yellow but prefer something closer to a jewel tone, a golden shade of yellow like the one pictured is a great way to go. It pairs well with medium **blue** and even denim **blue**, so this look works well for casual outfits. And of course, if you like patterns, shirts or dresses that use this combination are a nice way to stand out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A bold choice for those looking to stand out from the crowd and become more visible. If you are tired of dull office outfits, then try adding a red strap, handbag or shoes to your **blue** dress. Do not overdo it with red and you should not do too much contrast, it can look defiant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As we’ve seen so far, **blue** and brown seem to pair well together regardless of shade. Chocolate brown and lighter **blue** form a dignified pairing that works well with formal looks. As you can see in the photo, a medium-**blue** tie looks great with a chocolate brown blazer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Juicy lime green color - for the same courageous women of fashion :) Such a combination of **colors** will definitely not leave you unnoticed. In this version, a brighter shade will always lead, and in order for the outfit to be balanced, the **blue** shade should not be too bright, but not too dark. The best choice is ultramarine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A light **blue** shirt looks excellent with a darker purple tie, and you want to avoid wearing a light purple necktie. I would avoid a purple tie regarding dark **blue** shades or even royal **blue**. It’s not that it looks terrible, but your outfit will be properly darker, and a purple bow tie looks much better with a light **blue** shirt because of the contrasting **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your body type is slim or skinny, boost it with extra confidence. Don’t hesitate to choose the **blue** suit. It will make you appear sharp, calm, and luxurious – all at the same time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since both of these **colors** are dark, it’s a good idea to incorporate lighter **colors** alongside them to create a balance. Try putting together an outfit that incorporates a gradient of color. You can see this in the picture: the model wears a dark navy **blue** top, while her scarf includes teal, several shades of lighter **blue**-green, and white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Refer back to the color wheel and take a look at the “cool” **colors**. These are the **blue**s, greens, and purples. In general, cool **colors** have a calming and soothing effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue and cyan (turquoise) are related **colors**, they look great together. This option is suitable for office and for a walk. Dark **blue** trousers and a blouse of bright turquoise or **blue** color will suit fashionable women of any age. The color scheme is perfect for blondes. If you want to add some accessories, then stop on the following **colors** for them: white, black, yellow, orange, gold, red. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Look together very gently and elegantly. Beige is a neutral color, so any shades of **blue** will suit it. Brown leather accessories will complement the outfit. White and ocher color - may become additional in this combination. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to adding color to women’s wardrobes, pretty pastels and bold brights get the job done. Typically, these lively hues are what we think of when we’re looking to make an outfit really pop. When deciphering what **colors** go well together, these striking shades can be the most persnickety of the bunch. Yes, there’s definitely a way to overdo it on the neons and head-to-toe pastels may wash you out. It’s all about balance, and we’re happy to guide you to the ultimate equilibrium of color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When wearing a **blue** shirt with a **blue** tie, always opt for a darker **blue** necktie and a lighter **blue** shirt since it will complement well. Avoid wearing the same shades of **blue** for both pieces, or the tie will not be noticeable. You can also go for a tie with patterns and more than one shade of **blue** on it since it will look good, especially if you mix the color of the shirt with other **blue**s in the outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’re looking for a shirt that will embolden your **blue** look. Thus, you can never go wrong with a crisp and clean white shirt matched with a **blue** suit. Period. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, you need to vary the shades of **blue**. For example, if you wear a dark **blue** suit, choose a light, powder **blue** tie. On the other hand, a light **blue** suit will call for a darker **blue** tie. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink shades surprise with their diversity. There are a lot of them and they differ from each other in their characteristics. If we talk about the combination with **blue** in clothes, then with brighter pink shades, the same bright or darker **blue** will look good. Pale pink pastel tones form more harmonious combinations with more muted and lighter heavenly shades, for example, cobalt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark purple also works well with bright or dark **colors** that contrast with it. Dark yellows often pair well with dark purple, as do bright reds. You can also pair dark purple with **blue** tones, drawing out the cool tones in purple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As mentioned above, the color wheel largely divides **colors** into two camps, warm and cool **colors**. Using a color wheel, we can create color schemes that will help us achieve the all important concept of harmony. Below is a list of the major color schemes working from schemes with lower intensity and contrast to the boldest color schemes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gray and **blue** are two of the best complementary **colors** in your wardrobe. When you mix both **colors**, it looks perfect. For example, you can wear a light **blue** shirt with a dark gray tie or a dark **blue** shirt with a light gray tie. Both options look great, and it’s pretty difficult to get it wrong when matching both **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, regarding shirts and ties, I prefer to have one of the items totally plain without any patterns. So if your necktie is patterned, opt for a plain **blue** shirt, or if your **blue** shirt has stripes, dots, etc., you should opt for a simple tie. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another classic option. Perhaps such a neighborhood may seem gloomy or heavy to someone, but do not write off drawing conclusions. By combining these two **colors**, you can get a very stylish set, the main thing is that the **blue** is bright enough, you can add some accessories in metallic shades (gold or silver), red (a handbag, a strap or red shoes ) or purple handbag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For some reason, I wanted to allocate a separate block for this option. Probably because the combination of a different color (not necessarily **blue**) with black and white, seems especially effective and stylish. The black and white range means not only simple combinations of **blue**, black and white monochromatic clothes, but also the combination of **blue** with black and white patterns, drawings and prints. This may be the most familiar black and white vest , "Peas" or "cell", which, together with our color look very special. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a summer look, bright enough combinations with ultraviolet and ultramarine are also suitable. Orange + Blue + White make your look fresh, light, bright and positive. For the **blue** and white version fit orange accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As with light purple, dark purple clothes often go well with neutral **colors** like white or gray. Beige can be a bit trickier with dark purple but can work if you pair it with a warm-toned purple that has reddish hues. You’ll also want to avoid browns, oranges, and certain shades of red and green with dark purple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Regardless of the shade, **blue** and gray work well together. This is especially true of shades of **blue** and shades of cool gray. From a practical standpoint, charcoal gray is a great choice to pair with sky **blue**. This deep and dignified gray is a common color for blazers, suit jackets, and pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For the Fall & Winter Seasons, Silk & Woolen ties are your best complement . They will add a subdued look, generally with earthy **colors**. This, in addition to the rich textural variation provided, will offer the best finishing touch for your suiting ensembles during the colder months of the year. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a super chic look that you can both wear for cocktail parties or for girls’ night out. Although this dress doesn’t require you to show much skin at all, it does show your curves which makes the outfit a low-key sexy one. In detail, the dress is a sky **blue** lace fit and flare mini scalloped hem dress. Pair it with black ankle strap open toe heels to complete the outfit in an elegant way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What Pants Go Good With Light Blue Shirt? Wear black skinny jeans with light **blue** denim tops for a stylish, clean and fashion-forward look that’s both casual and stylish. A light **blue** button-down shirt is also commonly worn by men. Men should wear black or navy slacks when they want to look professional and put together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Forget the old adage, **blue** and green can definitely be seen when it comes to colour schemes. Ink, cobalt and emerald make a dramatic combination with brass and bold accents adding a luxe touch. A velvet couch or armchair ought to do the trick. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the weather turns cooler, more people turn to darker, cooler **colors**. And for a more understated combination, gray and green are a good choice. To create a palette that verges on the monochromatic, pair a very dark green with dark charcoal. For higher contrast, try pairing lighter gray with dark green as shown in the picture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like some other combinations on the list, this one works well when there’s a color gradient involved. Coral looks nice in an outfit that incorporates **blue**, green, and the spectrum of **colors** between. And of course, incorporating white is a fairly simple way to lighten up the look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Teaming a **blue** dress shirt and a black tie is a surefire way to inject style into your wardrobe. Complement your look with black leather oxford shoes and off you go looking boss. For an outfit that’s absolutely Bond-worthy, try pairing a **blue** dress shirt with a black tie. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, some guys will tell you that wearing a brown tie with a **blue** shirt looks good. I think differently, at least when it comes to neckties. No matter what shade of **blue** or brown you try to match, it just doesn’t look on point regarding shirts and ties. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark shades of **blue** don’t look great with a black tie since it will make the outfit darker. When it comes to light **blue** shirts, I would always pick a navy tie over a black one. That’s because a navy necktie matches a **blue** shirt much better, and it doesn’t give that professional and formal look that a black tie provides. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   When matching **colors**, a color wheel is a strong foundation upon which to understand the essentials. A color wheel is largely divided into two categories of **colors**; warm and cool **colors**. Warm **colors** exhibit more vibrance (red, orange and yellow), while cooler **colors** represent more calm (**blue**, green and purple). The goal of using the wheel is to create harmony, or balance, with respect to **colors** in your suit, shirt and tie ensemble . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Finish off with a red hat to take it in the opposite direction. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The dressier the light **blue** shirt, the more likely it is that a tie with more sheen to it (eg. silk) would work well. The more casual the light **blue** shirt, the more likely it is that a knit tie would work well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a truly eye-catching combo and is suitable for both formal and casual occasions. The warm red tie against the cool white shirt backdrop really pops. Your **blue** suit adds an attractive frame to the ensemble. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Baby **blue** is the most popular color amongst all the **blue** hues and is traditionally used as a color for the newborn baby boys.

-   Purple is made up of red and **blue** and therefore comes in many different shades with both warm and cool undertones. Your best chance of matching purple clothing is to choose **colors** that share the same undertones as the purple you have. Stick to warm **colors** with red-toned purples, and use cool **colors** with **blue**-toned purples. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This unique double-purple combination comes close to being mostly monochromatic. However, lilac and lavender have different undertones. Lilac has a pinkish hue, while lavender has stronger **blue** undertones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A light **blue** shirt can be worn with a dark **blue** tie for a monochromatic look, or a neutral-colored tie for a similarly subtle appearance. For more contrast, consider a “cool” colored tie (eg. purple or green) or a “warm” colored tie (eg. red or yellow). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Most **colors** seem to work with purple clothes, as long as you match undertones and shade intensities between the **colors** you pair.

-   What else does **blue** in clothes go well with? → Orange - the main contrast of **blue**.

For a harmonious look, it is recommended to choose a dark **blue** shade or shades of **blue** in darker tones in a pair with bright orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For formal occasions, silver or gold accessories are also good matches with a purple dress. Silver often works best with cool-toned **colors** and gold with warm-toned **colors**. But realistically, either should work with a purple dress and you can find shoes, jewelry, and other accessories that all coordinate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you likely already know, red and white also look great with navy **blue**.

Even a red and white flannel with a few stripes of navy is a great way to do this. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An orange tie is an accessory that stands out in your outfit, so wearing one will make people look at you without a doubt.

-   When in doubt, opt for dark, solid-color suits. As with shirts, when it comes to suits, simplicity equals versatility. Solid-color suits that are black, grey, or navy **blue** will work with most shirt and tie combinations. In addition, these suits are appropriate for a variety of occasions – from joyous events like weddings to somber ones like funerals. Most men should have at least one suit of these **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A Triadic Color Scheme involves choosing **colors** that form a triangle along the color wheel. Finally, we now have a color scheme that involves harmony (creating a balance between warm and coll **colors**).Hence, triadic color schemes are **blue**, red and yellow and green, orange and purple. While both of these color schemes involve both warm and cool **colors**, the contrast is not as strong as with a complementary color scheme. This slightly muted, but highly attractive color scheme, is a great way to introduce color into your wardrobe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   You’ll want to stick to a pure white color, however. Off-white shades can have yellowish tones, which won’t always work with all shades of purple. If you stray into the off-white range, try to pair it with purple **colors** with warmer tones – like plum, mauve, or shades with a reddish hue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Are you scratching your head when trying to figure out what **colors** go well with teal green? Let’s look at Mother Nature. You can find green and **blue** in the wild, so it’s no surprise that they’re a coupling that’s meant to be. It’s difficult to look at a clear **blue** sky and lush green trees and not love what you see. Rain or shine, teal green and various shades of **blue** go hand in hand. A matching teal green jogger and sweatshirt set accented by midnight or cyan **blue** puts the fresh in refreshing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Match light purple with dark purple tones to give contrast to your look. Just be sure to stick to similar undertones in the **colors** you choose. Keep cool-toned purples separate from warm-tone purples since they will look like entirely different **colors** when placed side-by-side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Shades of purple vary widely, and some are more appropriate than others for the changing seasons. Pastel purples are popular in the spring, bright purples in summer, and earthy warm-toned purples in the fall. Winter is an excellent time for cool, **blue**-toned purples. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For solid-color ties, pick a color that fits your purpose. Solid-color ties are fairly versatile – nearly any shade of solid-color tie looks good on a white shirt, while conservative shades like navy **blue** and black can look great on bolder-colored shirts. Generally, you’ll want to pick a solid-color tie that’s as eye-catching (or not) as your occasion warrants. A red tie on a white shirt, for instance, will create a striking (but not clashing) contrast that’s sure to get attention. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll also want to pay attention to the undertones of the greens and purples you mix. Pairing a warm-tone green like an olive green won’t work with a **blue**-toned purple like periwinkle. Stick to **colors** that are both cool or both warm to make good combinations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Green and red have similar issues with tone. Green will generally only work with purple if it is cool in tone, even bordering on **blue**. Bright red will work with many shades of purple, but other tones are often hard to match. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To be clear, I’m not condoning wild, free-for-all color choices here. True, the real beauty of a **blue** suit is that it’s so darn versatile. But that doesn’t mean you can throw everything together in a haphazard frenzy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to matching **colors**, many designers and artists turn to the color wheel and basic color theory for choosing coordinating options.

-   Complementary **colors** are opposite, meaning the contrasting shade of **blue** is orange. It’s not always easy to combine complementary **colors**.

-   While lighter ties are ideally suited for the warmer months, ties that are often characterized by heavier weight and earthly **colors** are best suited for the winter months. Cue the woolen tie.

For example, a lighter **blue** shirt will look good with a darker burgundy tie, and even if you opt for a darker **blue** or navy shirt, you can still wear a burgundy tie. However, remember to choose a darker burgundy tie if you want to wear a dark **blue** shirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

A triadic color scheme is a highly professional yet versatile scheme, and so can be used at work, in professional settings such as meetings and presentations, and for formal social events such as a wedding or elegant horse race! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Opt for “serious”, formal **colors**. When it comes to suits, formal **colors** are your friends. Most people can’t pull off playful, brightly-colored suits. This isn’t to say that no one can – just that it takes tons of charisma and can make you look like a goofy game show host if it backfires. Most people are best-suited (no pun intend) to **colors** like black, grey, navy **blue**, and (sometimes) brown when it comes to formal pants and jackets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another way to look refreshing and breezy is to add some floral element to the mix.

-   Neutral **colors** play an essential role in interior design. While bright **colors** can make a room feel lively, too much color can overpower a space quickly. It can feel overwhelming and gaudy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do you recall mixing paint **colors** for the first time as a kid? Red and **blue** create violet, red and yellow make orange and **blue** and yellow produce green. Tertiary **colors** are a mixture of primary and secondary pigments. Easy, right? This handy guide relies on the rainbow of basic **colors** in order from cool to warm. Typically, the most flattering color combinations are directly across from each other, hence the term, complementary **colors**. The science behind color theory goes into much greater depth, but nailing these principles is a solid jumping-off point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Warm **colors** exhibit vibrance, such as red, orange and yellow. Cooler **colors** are associated with calm, such as **blue**, green and purple. The concept of a color wheel allows us to harmonize **colors**. Harmony is the process of creating a balanced look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The key to mastering color theory, or the best color combinations, is to understand the color wheel for clothes. Let’s quickly get back to elementary basics. The graphic above illustrates the relationship between primary, secondary and tertiary **colors**. Primary **colors** include red, **blue** and yellow, while secondary hues are the combination of two primary shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This color combination also has a natural beginning, like heaven and earth. It is quite harmonious and calm. The best thing brown combined with ultramarine shade. In this neighborhood, **blue** saves brown from some dullness and gloominess, and brown smoothes the aggressive brightness of **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another reason for purple’s popularity has been its flexibility. Purple is made through a combination of red and **blue** and can be created in various tones and intensities. This makes it a color that can be tailored to fit many different styles, skin tones, and seasons – making it a go-to choice for designers all year long. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The color wheel is a helpful visual aid to identify adjacent and opposing or complementary **colors**. As a rule of thumb, adjacent **colors** create a harmonious result. Opposing or complementary **colors** create a stark contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the case of purple, the **colors** on its immediate sides are **blue**s and reds. Both **blue** and red are accent **colors** to purple and often pair well with the color. Looking across from purple, its direct opposite shade is yellow, which contrasts well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is the easiest way to start experimenting with color and also the most conservative color scheme. A monochromatic color scheme matches darker variants of a color with lighter variants e.g a navy tie against a light **blue** shirt or a burgundy tie against a light pink shirt. This will allow you to look elegant and sophisticated, without necessarily taking you out of your comfort zone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wearing a **blue** shirt with a pink tie is easy, and you can barely make a mistake here. However, I prefer a light **blue** shirt with any shade of pink. Whether you choose a lighter or a darker pink tie, it will look great. You can also wear a dark **blue** shirt with a dark pink tie, but I prefer a light **blue** shirt for a pink necktie. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also incorporate light **blue** as a neutral color. The key is to choose a shade that looks muted. For instance, a pewter **blue** can fulfill the same purpose as a gray shade. A periwinkle **blue** can also be an excellent choice for a soft and dreamy atmosphere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The next progressive step for the aspiring dapper gentleman, an analogous color scheme is one step bolder than using a monochromatic color sequence. This color combination involves choosing adjacent **colors** on the color wheel. While this generally means wearing tie **colors** that are either cool or warm **colors**, and hence not introducing harmony yet (warm and cool color balance), this does introduce an element of sophistication without being overtly bold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re set on trying to find a combination that works, stick to earthy tones. Go for a warm-toned purple or mauve paired with a warm, medium brown color. Stick to brown **colors** commonly seen in leather handbags, especially those in a medium to the light color range. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Complementary **colors** are the most strikingly contrasting **colors** and are directly opposite each other across the color wheel. Hence, a **blue**’s direct contrasting color is orange, red’s complementary color is green and yellow’s complementary color is purple. Hence, complementary **colors** form the strongest contrast. It is best to understand this through the concept of warm and cool **colors**. Because we are pairing warm and cool **colors** that offer the strongest visual contrast, these **colors** also provide the most pop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Olive is a versatile earth-toned neutral color that can be matched with just about any hue. Warm pinks, browns and dusty **blue**s (we’re looking at you, chambray) are good go-to’s with this trend-savvy desert daze star. Are you hoping for a lighter approach when matching **colors** for clothing? White is a crisp and clean contender when you’re on the hunt for a stellar color mate for olive. A structured white blouse with slim olive slacks and nude flats is chic sophistication at its finest. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best pairings for green and purple are ones where the **colors** have similar undertones and intensity. Pastel greens can pair with pastel purples, while bright greens can pair best with bright purples. Just avoid mixing and matching the shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because you want to ensure your tie is noticeable, you want to pair a navy necktie with a light **blue** shirt and avoid wearing dark shades of **blue** with navy. I have seen some guys wearing navy ties with dark **blue** shirts, and I’m not too fond of it. The point of wearing a tie gets lost if you can’t notice it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, the color of the ties you choose also depends on the shade of **blue** you pick. If you have a lighter **blue** shirt, the color of your tie should be as darker as possible for a good contrast. If you have a darker **blue** shirt, try to opt out for a lighter color tie. The most significant point when wearing a tie with a **blue** shirt, or any shirt, is that you want your tie or bow tie to stand out on your entire outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
