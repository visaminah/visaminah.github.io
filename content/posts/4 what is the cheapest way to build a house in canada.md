-   Although the real estate market in Canada is boiling and prices are soaring, there is no need to give up on the thought of owning a house here.

You may not be situated in a central or upscale neighbourhood, but you will find something to your taste. With that in mind, here is our list of the ten **cheapest** houses in Canada for sale as of October 2022. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When building a new home, it’s usually **cheapest** to find land that is currently unoccupied with no existing house or structure built on it. That’s because buying a property with a house already on it means you’ll be paying for the structure as well as the land, even if you plan to demolish it completely. To save costs, work with your real estate agent and locate a piece of land to purchase or search for listings of vacant land online. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you know the scope of your project, consider getting in touch with several contractors and asking them to bid on your build. You’ll likely get a range of prices so remember, the **cheapest** is not necessarily the best. The last thing you want is a contractor who cuts corners on quality or is unable to stick to a completion schedule. Conduct your own research about each contractor on your list by looking for reviews, ratings, word of mouth referrals and examples of their previous projects. Treat pricing as just one in the longer list of factors involved in your choice of contractor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
