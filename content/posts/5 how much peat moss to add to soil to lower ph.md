-   Measure your **soil**'s pH. Before using **peat** moss, you should consider what you are growing and what your **soil**’s pH is. Because it is so acidic, it should only be used for acid-loving plants such as blueberries, or in **soil**s that are naturally neutral or alkaline. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sphagnum **peat** bogs are fragile ecosystems that are slow to regenerate after being harvested. It takes one thousand years for them to grow a yard in depth. Even though harvest is carefully regulated, **peat** moss is not considered a renewable resource or a sustainable product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat moss is an excellent **soil** amendment for your acid-loving plants and vegetable gardens. There are approximately 12,000 species of moss, but it’s only the 380 species of sphagnum moss that create **peat**. Bogs and fens form where Canadian sphagnum grows because both living and dead moss absorb and store water. As it grows, it spreads onto drier areas and turns those into bogs as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat does not decay very easily in the bog conditions, due to the sphagnum cell structure and to slower-acting anaerobic conditions. Although it grows very slowly, it can accumulate to a depth of many meters. The live moss grows on top of the dead moss, and it is the dead moss that forms the **peat** we use in the garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   can meet similar goals using repurposed plant-derived waste products, as an alternative to **peat**. Compost and worm castings are just as good of a source of organic matter within a potting mix. Use sphagnum **peat** moss for your specialized gardening needs, and grow organic for life! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
