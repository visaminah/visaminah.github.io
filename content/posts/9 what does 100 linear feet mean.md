## 9 Things You Should Know About What Does 100 Linear Feet Mean | Linear Foot
-   Instead of just charging by weight or per mile, freight moving companies typically charge based on the total amount of **linear** footage that your furniture takes up. This way, you aren’t paying for an entire truck, or paying extra because your belongings may be heavy. Using **linear** footage, your estimate is generally based on how long your items are and how many **feet** they will take up in the truck. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While renting out the entire trailer is ideal when making a large move, customers who have smaller moves and a lighter lift are charged for the space they use instead. When taking this route, the minimum is five **linear** **feet**. Measuring by **linear** **feet** is a way to save space, time and ultimately save more money if you can utilize options like the ones that U-Pack offers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   100 Feet IS 100 Linear Feet. If you wanted to know how many **linear** **feet** would give you 100 square **feet**, you would take the square root of 100, which is 10... SO a 10 x 10 **linear** foot area would be 100 square **feet**, and a 100 x 100 Linear foot area would be 10,000 square **feet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Measuring in **linear** **feet** comes in handy when you are considering how much floor space will be taken up by an object. For example, let’s say you need to rent a storage unit. If you need to store things like couches, mattresses or motorcycles, then you might want to consider how much **linear** footage you may need. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Square footage is a very common way to measure space, especially in regard to homes and apartments. The difference between square footage and **linear** footage is exactly what it sounds like. Square footage measures the area of a space in a square, two-dimensional way. As mentioned above, **linear** footage is measured in a single line and is usually used in reference to floor space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The lumber industry has a lot of terms that are often very tough to navigate especially if it’s the first time anyone considered buying wood. Most wood products are sold per piece or per square foot. Often a lot of people won’t know how to convert from square **feet** to **linear** **feet** and if they order amounts per the square foot then there will be a very big shortage of material. Luckily we do provide a handy dandy square **feet** to **linear** **feet** calculator that’ll do the hard work and a page that explains what lumber sizing is! But, have you wondered how exactly the calculation happens? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this current housing market, the number of people either looking online for a new place to rent, or a home to buy, is at a record high. When searching online for a place to rent or buy, the most common measurement used is square footage. At some point, you may be tasked with considering **linear** footage as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For example, U-Pack is a leading company when it comes to shipping household belongings using freight trailers. According to their website, U-Pack offers 28-foot moving trailers that have a loading capacity of 2,000 cubic **feet** each. The inside of each of their trailers can fit almost all of the belongings in your entire home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another instance where one may want to measure in **linear** **feet** is when moving cross-country, or another long distance. Typically, if you’re moving to a place that is not too far away, you may opt for a U-Haul or another self-service truck rental company. However, if the place you’re moving to is far away, you may want to hire a freight moving company to assist in your move. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
