To retain your **hair** color and its shine for longer, pick organic shampoos that have natural active ingredients. They are great for your **hair** in every way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It takes work and skill to remove a dark color from **hair**. You could get a couple estimates from reputable salons, but they will likely be about the same. If you have trust in the first professional, it might be good to go with them. But if you really want to save money, you could go to an advanced training salon. Instead of a traditional beauty school, this would be a place where professionals go for additional training after already being licensed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just open the jar, take the required amount in your hand, and apply it to your **hair**. It is a temporary solution. As soon as you wash your **hair**, the colour will be gone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And one of the most common and easy ways to look stylish it to dye your **hair** in some funky color - red, **brown**, blue, whatever you like. Yes, easy it is. But hey, it also has side effects. Your **hair** could become weaker and thinner or even look dry. Hair dye may make you look better, but may not be better for the health of your **hair**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Certain medical conditions like autoimmune diseases increase the risk of developing gray **hair** prematurely. In alopecia areata, people suffer from abnormal **hair** loss and the growth of white **hair** on the scalp. Dysfunction of the thyroid gland is also linked to premature greying. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even after you lighten your **hair** with bleach, it becomes more porous. This doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be able to soak in moisture easier. In fact, your **hair** may look dry and damaged more often than not. It’s also much harder to go back to your original color after your **hair** has been bleached, because of the damage that has been done. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although studies are yet to prove it, stress is believed to play a significant part in the premature greying of **hair**. According to a survey conducted by New York University and published in Nature Medicine, high-stress levels can trigger certain hormones in our body, which deplete the melanin-producing cells called melanocytes. This lightens our **hair** color and leads to premature greying. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Honey is one of the world’s most perfect substances. It can be used for a variety of different health and skin conditions, and it can also be beneficial for your **hair**. One thing to be aware of is that honey contains trace amounts of hydrogen peroxide. It is this substance that helps to lighten the **hair**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Heat treatments have now become an indispensable part of our **hair**styling practices. But the extreme application of heat is severely damaging for **hair** as it breaks down the hydrogen bonds of the **hair** shafts. In addition, it has been found that getting regular heat treatment for styling **hair** accelerates the process of premature greying. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Jerome Russel Temporary Hair Color Spray – a fine mist spray with a super high color payoff. It comes in a 2.2-ounce can.

-   Frequent and long-term exposure to the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays (UVA and UVB) can give your **hair** a faded color and texture. Sunlight induces oxidative stress by increasing the number of free radicals in the body, which, in the absence of proper antioxidant defense, causes imbalance and makes the process of greying happen prematurely. Harsh sunlight also bleaches the **hair** strands by stripping them of their natural pigments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

They can even contain persulfates known to aggravate asthma in those who have it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Begin by diluting the hydrogen peroxide half and half with water. Next, apply as directed above and test after 15-20 minutes.

Indeed, for those wanting to know how to lighten **hair**, peroxide is another very popular method! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Choosing the right color to dye your **hair** without bleaching depends primarily on the undertone of your **hair**. Asian **hair**, for instance, has a warmer undertone.

Repeat the process 2-3 times every week, and the difference will be easily noticeable in just a couple of months. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark **brown** **hair** might be difficult to lighten naturally at home.

-   Spraying lemon juice onto your **hair** causes the pigment to be stripped away, thereby lightening your **hair** gradually. However, if you’re looking to get a darker shade of blonde, tea made from dried flowers of chamomile and calendula will help you achieve that shade for your **hair**. The root of rhubarb, on the other hand will give your **hair** a lovely honeyed golden tone. Steep a cup of the flowers or the root in boiling water before straining it and pouring the water over your **hair** a number of times (we’d suggest you do it at least in the double digits).

-   Hairspray is one of the proven methods to get your **hair** coloured grey with no use of bleach. However, this method is temporary. The colour will go once you wash your **hair**. There are varieties of grey shades available in the market, choose the one which matches your interests. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most lightening procedures require bleaching the **hair**. Unfortunately, bleaching can strip your **hair** of many nutrients. It may help to give you the color you want, but at what cost? People who frequently get their **hair** bleached can experience a lot of problems. But, it only takes one time for the damage to be done. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another option to lighten black **hair** is by using henna and pair it with a lighter shade. You can also buy lighter dye-at-home kits like blonde or ginger to lighten black **hair**.

-   If you want to go for a more dramatic change from your natural black **hair**, try Auburn. Auburn is a bright reddish-**brown** or deeper ginger **hair** color that looks stunning. The vibrant orange-red may not be as prominent on black **hair** without bleating. But what you will certainly obtain is a much more vibrant **brown** with a visible red hue. If you’ve always wanted **hair** like Princess Merida from Disney’s Brave, this could be your best shot at it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Highlights would be the best way to go back to blonde. When you go to the salon, ask the **hair** colorist to give you an all over, heavy highlight. If you want platinum highlights, make sure that you let the **hair** colorist know in advance. A heavy highlight will leave you with mostly blonde **hair**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For better results, you could opt for a more concentrated cup of tea. But do remember to not go overboard with it. Higher concentration and longer duration of the **hair** mask works well, but an extreme case of it may not. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Given all these risks, it would be pretty prudent to opt for **hair** dyes that have natural ingredients in their composition, either being made entirely from plant or clay-based products or those that do make use of them to some extent at least, and not the chemicals mentioned above. Hair dyes available in the market today are increasingly making use of natural ingredients such as henna and amla. But if you’re still averse to taking the risk, here's how to dye **hair** naturally at home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do you know what’s worse than premature greying? Browning! Brown **hair** may be in vogue if you’ve coloured your **hair** on purpose, but it could the opposite if you didn’t.

-   Brahmi oil is very effective in fighting against the premature greying of **hair**. But, unfortunately, regular use of it darkens the **hair** color too.
