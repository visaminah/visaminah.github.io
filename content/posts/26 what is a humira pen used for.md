-   Gilmore believes the drug will be less ex**pen**sive in the European Union from October 2018 when biosimilars become available: “At least part of the world will be able to continue using the drug with fewer burdens.

In Japan, companies are required to lower the cost of the drug every other year.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   AbbVie has also received criticism for steep price increases and it is not uncommon for drug companies to increase prices of drugs bi-annually. Typically in January and June of each calendar year, AbbVie has increased the price of Humira by an average of 7%-10%, says Gilmore: “Since the price of the drug was high to begin with, the added increases are definitely a burden to both patients and insurance providers. Patient ‘assistance programmes’ are limited in the US, so it has been reported that compliance is suffering as patients skip doses they cannot afford. Phase III clinical trials are extremely ex**pen**sive though so in many respects with the evolution of the lifecycle and added indications, there is some justification for the price increases for Humira.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The cost of Humira has more than doubled between the years 2012 and 2018. As a result, many consumers cannot afford it even with coupons, rebates, and government intervention. Many Canadian employers, on the other hand, have agreed to cover the ex**pen**ses. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before using Humira, take it out of the fridge and leave it at room temperature for 15–30 minutes. This helps make the injection less painful.
