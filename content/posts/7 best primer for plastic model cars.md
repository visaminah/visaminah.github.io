## 7 Things About Best Primer For Plastic Model Cars | best paint for plastic model cars
-   Firstly, priming the prefabricated **plastic** model will help you to identify the drawbacks of preparing the model for painting. After you have sanded, putty and processed the model, you need to make sure that it is ready for painting. It is the priming that will show you all the existing preparation flaws, if any. If there are chips, cracks, roughness and unevenness somewhere – all this will make itself felt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The third reason is that a **primer** is required when working with complex models (a combination of different types of **plastic**, photo-etched, resin). All of these materials have different adhesive surface properties. Therefore, the paint will “stand” on them in different ways. To avoid this, you must first go through the **primer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Etch **primer** is perfect for applying to a bare metal panel. It offers excellent adhesion to steel, aluminium and fibreglass making it the perfect choice for restored body panels. It shouldn’t be used for spot repairs however as it can lift existing paint leading to bad-looking results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **primer** is the first coat of paint on the model’s surface, which is then covered with a base coat of paint. Some modelers apply one or even several coats of **primer** before painting the model, others rarely or do not use it at all. A standard question from beginners arises – is it necessary to prime the model? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the most simple yet effective tools, a hand file removes supports and sands down surfaces. Using a firm grip, you can remove marks with more control than with a rotary tool. Keep a wire brush on hand and clean the file’s teeth often (otherwise **plastic** and resin will gum up teeth). Like a rotary tool, a hand file will leave a rough surface, so it’s best for removing the larger support marks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is the basic **primer** you can buy for your car and is largely used for repair work in spots (e.g. repairing deep scratches) because it won’t damage or lift any surrounding paintwork. It’s no good for dealing with rust but is often the cheapest type of **primer** you can buy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our top choice for rust-removing **primer**, Jenolite anti-rust **primer** seals rust to prevent it from spreading through the metal. It can be used on steel, iron and aluminium and will offer excellent moisture resistance and corrosion protection. It’s also touch dry in just 30 minutes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
