## 38 Unexpected Facts About How To Cook Scrambled Eggs In A Carbon Steel Pan | How To Season Carbon Steel Pan
-   The technique for making omelettes dictates the equipment needed. It's something like rubbing your stomach and patting your head at the same time. A thin layer of **eggs** is poured into a very hot, generously buttered pan and encouraged to form an even mass by shaking the pan back and forth and agitating the **eggs** with the flat edge of a fork at the same time. When the **eggs** have cooked on the bottom the sides of the omelette are pushed back here and there to allow uncooked egg to run onto the bottom of the pan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nonstick, with a fitted lid: I once had a roommate whose boyfriend would crack five **eggs** into a large nonstick pan, cover it with a fitted lid, walk away, and two minutes later, return to slide perfectly fried **eggs** onto his plate for breakfast. In his memory, I had to give this method a try. The result? Three slippery, oily fellows! Crisp nowhere to be found. I can't totally see the utility here, unless you hate a crispy fried egg and also don't eat butter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Stainless steel: I found these tests to be so upsetting that I considered scrapping phase two, until the carbon steel sweet-talked me into resuming my mission. Frying **eggs** in a stainless-steel pan, no matter how great, is like throwing super glue at a velvet wall and then trying to peel it back off in one piece. Would not recommend. (According to a blog I found through angry searching on this topic, you can minimize sticking by letting your **eggs** come to room temperature first—that is, if you're the sort of organized person who sees a dentist every six months and remembers to defrost poultry well in advance of a dinner party—and fussing with the flame and pan angle.) Hard pass. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It comes in various diameters but is invariably shallow. If the pan is too deep, the omelette tends to slide back down into the pan as you try to roll it. The sides of a proper pan slope gently upward and outward, also to facilitate rolling. Heavy-gauge carbon steel is used because it can take high heat without buckling and it allows the layer of **eggs** to cook through without burning the bottom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   NOTHING BRINGS out the dogmatic nature of cooks faster than a discussion of omelettes. Ask 10 cooks how they make omelettes and you'll get 10 Only Ways. There are people who stir the **eggs** just long enough to mix the yolks with the whites, people who whisk, people who roll and people who fold, people who never wash their omelette pans and people who always do. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I noticed that when I originally seasoned my de Buyer pan and my Matfer Bourgeat pan by following the videos from Vollrath at this link that the black seasoning kept flaking off. The seasonings flaked off while cooking **eggs** and other foods and also when I washed them with water. I followed their instructions to the “t” making sure that I applied very very thin coats of flaxseed oil. I did some research on why this was happening and found out that I was not alone. This made me feel a little better but I still think I was developing an obsessive-compulsive seasoning anxiety disorder, which others evidently have contracted. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the first phase of trials, several tablespoons of each of nine cooking fats was used to coat the bottom of a nonstick pan, heated over a medium-high flame. Three **eggs** were fried in each cooking fat, over a medium flame, while the whites were spoon-basted with the hot fat until they set. (Exceptions: the **eggs** cooked in cream, and the butter-water fellows—more on each of those in a bit.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I didn’t believe cooking **eggs** in stainless steel without sticking was this easy until I gave it a try. After years and years of stinky, burned **scrambled** **eggs** in stainless steel pans, I somehow nailed this technique on the first try! In fact, this technique works even better than nonstick pans do. Nonstick pans are notorious for beginning to stick after a few months of use, and we were having the scrape the heck out of ours by the end. (Of course, this is horrible for the nonstick coating, too!) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’m sitting here in my kitchen trying to figure out why my **eggs** are sticking to my de Buyer carbon steel pan. It took me about an hour or more to season my new pan by applying multiple coats of oil. After I finished seasoning I thought I would test the pan by frying an egg. To my surprise, I found out that the egg stuck to the bottom of the pan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Olive oil: The olive oil–fried **eggs** had the crispiest edges of the bunch, besides the flavorless canolas and the bacon-fat **eggs**. Importantly, olive oil also produced nice browning on the underside of the white, which spread less than when fried in butter. Olive oil makes for an excellent everyday fried egg, through and through. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When push comes to shove, cooking **eggs** in stainless steel pans is all about the appropriate temperature. As long as the stainless steel cookware is not too cool or too hot before food is added (and there is an appropriate amount of fat), there is no reason that **scrambled** **eggs** should stick. I don’t know why this is such a secret in the home cooking community, but I hope it won’t be one much longer! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Keep stirring and cooking the **eggs** until you have just a bit of liquid egg left and the rest is formed as curds, then remove the pan from the heat and put it on the trivet. The pan and **eggs** are still hot and the carryover will cook the rest, so just keep folding until no liquid remains, but so the **eggs** are still a bit on the wet side. (If you need more heat, you can put the pan back on the burner.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I wish it didn’t take me this long to realize that cooking **eggs** in stainless steel without sticking is this easy. I was on the “nonstick pan” train for years, under some misconstrued notion that it’s easier to cook **eggs** in nonstick pans. (I mean, who can resist those infomercials with sunny-side up floating magically across the pan?) I knew that nonstick pans aren’t great for our health, and I was very aware that nonstick pans don’t last very long at all. However, the thought of smelly, brown, burnt **eggs** stuck to the pan after cooking **eggs** in stainless steel kept me in the zombie “nonstick pan” line. That is, it did until now. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A well-seasoned pan gets better with use. Such a pan of my aquaintance has withstood being used by uncaring hands to make butterless **scrambled** **eggs**, then being plunged, hot, into cold water to soak. It recovered. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your carbon steel pan or skillet is too cold your **eggs** will not even come close to cooking. If your burners are turned all the way counterclockwise to the setting of “low” on a gas stove then it will take forever to cook your **eggs**. Assuming you are using butter or coconut oil, the temperature of the oil has to be high enough to coat the bottom of the pan. You want your pan temperature just above the “low” temperature setting on a gas stove so that the oil becomes fluid and moves freely around the bottom of the pan. If you are using butter, set the heat on medium and wait until the bubbles on the butter stops bubbling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   During phase two, three **eggs** were fried in each of five pan types, again using a medium-high flame to heat the pan and fat, and a medium flame to fry the egg. Based on the results of phase one, olive oil was used as the sole cooking fat across all pan types. Accordingly, Bun was not consulted as a taste-tester. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Butter and water: This aforementioned method (touted by Martha Stewart) produced "fried" **eggs** with a crispiness factor of exactly zero. Come on Martha! But—and this is an important but—they were a textural wonder, with whites like an omelet and yolks just perfectly thick and runny. If you're not into a crispy little guy, this method could be for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In Absolute Best Tests, Ella Quittner destroys the sanctity of her home kitchen in the name of the truth. She's seared more Porterhouse steaks than she cares to recall, tasted enough stuffing for 10 Thanksgivings, and mashed so many potatoes she may never mash one again. Today, she tackles fried **eggs**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Browned butter: Browned butter **eggs**, it turns out, are a lot like the butter-fried **eggs**...with more browning. And a nuttier flavor, which deserves its own sentence. As always when working with browned butter, these were finicky to time, so I would only recommend them to someone who can give egg frying some undivided attention. But since fried **eggs** are usually prepared in a half-asleep state, this is not the best use of your time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In order to cook meals in anything other than a nonstick, such as stainless steel, the pan must reach the temperature of 320 degrees Fahrenheit. When you are in a hurry to cook your breakfast I doubt you have time to take the temperature of the pan. Personally, I have never taken the pan temperature. There are better and quicker ways to determine the correct temperature for cooking **eggs**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That’s it! The key to cooking **eggs** in stainless steel without sticking lies in pre-heating the pan to the right temperature. Remember how the droplet of water would glide across the surface of the pan without evaporating? That’s because if the pan is hot (but not too hot) a tiny layer of air is formed between the water and the pan. (Read up on the Leidenfrost effect for more details on this phenomenon.) The same thing happens with your food, and therefore prevents sticking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   An egg is but an albumen—alternating layers of protein and water, making up the "white"—and a yolk. In 1868's Eggs, and How to Use Them, chef Adolphe Meyer describes two main ways to coagulate those classes of matter such that they can be considered fried: the "French method," wherein an egg is submerged in a half pint of hot fat, and the "second method," where **eggs** are broken into a hot frying pan with an ounce of fat. This series of tests falls under the "second method" umbrella, the shallow fry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cream: Speaking of textural wonders! Have you ever wished your fried **eggs** were essentially the best pudding you've ever had? If so, cook them in cream, and do not share them with anyone. This certified-Genius technique has you add said heavy cream to a cold pan along with the **eggs**—nuts, right?—before turning the flame to medium-high. The cream caramelizes, you lose track of where its butterfats end and the egg whites begin, and everything is so delicious it makes you forget all deep existential concerns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some people, at this point, just crack the egg into the pan. I do not because it seems that every time I do this, part of the **eggs**hell joins the egg and it is a pain in the butt trying to remove the **eggs**hells from the heated pan. I usually crack my **eggs** into a bowl and then remove any **eggs**hells that have fallen into the bowl. Problem solved! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the keys to Aldous' soft **eggs** comes in heating the pan before you get started. By waiting until the pan is already hot to add the butter, he finds the fat stays on the surface of the pan, which keeps the **eggs** from sticking while they cook. Let the pan heat up over "just below medium" heat as you prepare the **eggs**, so it is already hot when you add the butter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Crack your **eggs** into a much bigger bowl than it seems you would need for three **eggs** (or however many you are making). This keeps the mess down and gives you room to "get rough with them," as Aldous instructs. He whisks the **eggs** rapidly to break up any of the "hard white stuff," which he says could give a chewy bite later. The aggressive whisking also whips air into the **eggs**, making them fluffier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, let’s switch to a more positive note! Cooking **eggs** in stainless steel is so much easier than I ever imagined possible. And no, it doesn’t have to do with adding copious amounts of oil or butter to the pan. Ever noticed how stainless steel pots reviews online can have drastically different testimonials regarding sticking, depending on the reviewer? This is because cooking **eggs** in stainless steel without sticking all depends on the cooking method, not the amount of fat used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pour your **eggs** into the hot pan and let them form just a bit of curd before you start moving them, just like in a traditional scramble, says Aldous. Then start stirring, making sure to scrape the sides and bottom with your spatula so that you don't end up with any dry bits. Keep mixing, using a bit of a folding motion, so that the curds keep picking up more and more of the raw egg. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A good carbon-steel skillet can literally do it all: You can bake, broil, sear, and stir-fry in it; plus, you can cook delicate foods like fish and **eggs** in it with no fear of sticking. It’s no wonder that these skillets are used by so many professional chefs in restaurant kitchens around the world. The only caveat? Cooking with acidic ingredients will take away some of the seasoning, but it can be easily restored. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the butter or oils become fluid, but not burned, I pour the egg into the pan and wait until the egg whites start to turn white and become slightly solid. At this point, you can turn your **eggs** over and at the same time turn the burner heat OFF because carbon steel cookware really retains heat effectively. Once the **eggs** are done they can be slid out of the pan with NO Sticking. Yum! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Carbon steel: The carbon steel batch of fried **eggs** was surprisingly easy to work with, thanks (again!) to top-notch pan seasoning. They didn't get quite as crisp at the same temperature as the nonstick and cast iron, but there was a lot of potential. I’m hesitant to call this method the best way to fry an egg though, because I imagine that far fewer home cooks own carbon steel compared to nonstick or cast-iron. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are as many cooking fats in which an egg can be fried as there are pun-opportunities about the social life of someone with time to fry 42 **eggs** (must be a total yolk!). I tested nine fats, based on which were the most commonly recommended and which ones a home cook would likely have in their pantry. Do I want duck oil fried **eggs**? Absolutely. But this was not the time nor the place. They were: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Learn how to make soft-**scrambled** **eggs** and reap the rewards of luxurious creaminess every morning—no cream required. Eggs can easily go wrong, ending up rubbery, stuck to the pan, or (impressively enough), both too dry and oddly watery at the same time. After years helming a high-end boutique resort kitchen, chef Jason Aldous knows how to make sure his **eggs** turn out well: "All you need is egg, salt, and less time than normal." That's his basic recipe for soft-**scrambled** **eggs**, which he says is the only way he makes them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sure, some fat is required when cooking **eggs** in stainless steel. But I use no more butter for 8 **eggs** than I would use on a single piece of toast. So it’s really pretty negligible, and you shouldn’t be afraid of butter, anyway! As someone who eats 3500+ calories a day, I can assure you that lack of exercise is far more dangerous to your health than a tiny sliver of butter in your **eggs**. But, that’s a topic for a different post. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Butter and olive oil: These **eggs** tasted better than they looked, thanks to a doubling down on delicious fats. But in a nonstick, they didn't crisp nearly as much as the oil-only batches, or the bacon-fat **eggs**. (My initial thesis for this test—that olive oil would raise butter's smoke point—proved both irrelevant, since I was frying all **eggs** over the same heat and it didn't cause the butter to smoke in the solo-butter tests, and also untrue, according to J. Kenji López-Alt over at Serious Eats.) If you're looking for extra flavor and don't care much about crispness, these are calling your name. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cast iron: My cast iron–fried **eggs** were delicious, with great crispiness. Despite my skillet's top-notch seasoning, I did need to get in there a bit with a silicone spatula to avoid sticking in a few spots, and if I were especially concerned about breaking my yolks through unnecessary jostling, I might avoid cast iron. But for everyone else (hi, Dad), this is a solid option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Canola oil: The canola-oil egg sort of balled itself up as it cooked, as if it were being deep-fried. It was disappointing from a flavor perspective, though surprisingly efficient from a browned-edge perspective."Crispy, but at what cost?" read my greasy notes. Use canola oil if you're out of more flavorful oils and are jonesing for diner-esque edges. There was nothing wrong with frying **eggs** with canola oil, but there was nothing quite right about it either. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
