## 94 Facts Type Of Paint For Ceilings | How to paint ceilings
-   Once you’ve loaded your roller evenly, begin in one corner and move fluidly in a parallel motion. For best results, work in 1 metre sections **paint**ing across and then down. Roll as far into the previously brushed sections as possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you need to deal with a hairline crack in a corner or around woodwork, use a cartridge gun to apply decorative caulk (not silicone). Squeeze it into the gap and carefully smooth it with a wet finger or sponge. Allow it to dry according to the manufacturer’s instructions – you can over**paint** most varieties within an hour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The last before and after example of the best **paint** sheen to use on **ceilings** is from our Master Bathroom. I gave our Master Bathroom a Full Remodel a couple years ago. It was another room with an underwhelming feature ceiling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To choose the right white **paint** color for your **ceilings**, pay attention to the undertones. The basic ceiling white can look too stark and clinical, but **paint** companies now offer a range of cool and warm whites. Select one with faintly yellow or blue undertones that coordinate with the rest of the room's color palette. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, all this might make you think that the higher the viscosity, the better. That’s true, up to a point. But if you’re planning to use a **paint** sprayer, you must have the correct consistency of **paint** for the tool. Indeed, there are levels of viscosity to consider, even in ceiling **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’ve found my favorite types of **paint** to use, through trial and error. For **ceilings**, I’ll always pick high-viscosity ceiling **paint**. If I’m **paint**ing it myself, I’ll likely use a brush and a roller, and leave the **paint** sprayer to the professionals. I like that ceiling **paint** dries fast and opaque, which means I only have to **paint** one coat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let’s start with the ceiling **paint** in the room I’m remodeling right now. You might have seen peeks of this ceiling in my How to Paint Built In Bookshelves and Cabinets post. It’s the ceiling in our Family Room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although these terms are often used interchangeably, a flat **paint** finish typically has no sheen, while a matte **paint** will have a very low level of sheen, sometimes referred to as a velvet finish. Always check with your supplier before purchase, because manufacturers’ formulas vary. An experienced supplier will be able to advise on sheen level, as well as other considerations such as how many coats are typically required to obtain smooth, uniform coverage and help conceal surface imperfections. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ceiling **paint** offers strong adhesion to a variety of textured surfaces such as stucco, drywall, and plaster. It’s also more durable than many types of wall **paint** and doesn’t crack or peel. You’ll find that you have a choice of water-based (latex) or oil-based ceiling **paint** as well. We’ll talk more about the differences between the two, shortly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paint with a flat finish will not reflect any light. It is great for covering up any imperfections a wall or ceiling might have because light will not highlight these blemishes. Paint with an eggshell finish will mimic the shine of an eggshell. It is low-luster, and though not overly shiny, it will still reflect light around the room. Eggshell **paint** is often used in high traffic areas because it's more stain-resistant and easier to clean than a flat finish **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vaulted, cathedral, or multiangled **ceilings** can pose a special problem. Where do you start and stop color? In low attics, carrying the same color across the ceiling from wall to wall is a practical solution. However, you can increase the apparent height of the ceiling with a little visual trickery. Add a chair rail around the wall at about hip height; then **paint** the area below the chair rail a darker hue than the area above. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The new ceiling **paint** reflects light nicely with that Eggshell Ceiling Paint Sheen. You might have noticed the new built ins I built to replace the old arched opening to our foyer. Now we can use that wall as storage and for a large TV we can play video games on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before **paint**ing the ceiling a darker color, think about the effect it will have on the room. A light ceiling makes the room feel bigger and highlights the walls. Consider using trim if you want color up top. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is the most obvious answer as this is specifically for ceiling **paint**ing projects. Although matte finish is the most common, you have the option of getting an eggshell or satin finish as well. All options help to scatter light and not draw the eyes upwards while also hiding imperfections. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are lots of benefits to wall **paint**. First, there’s a wide variety of color choices. What’s more—you have options for the type of finish you want to create. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first job was a proper clean using squeegie mops on telescopic handles and Krud Kutter Tough Task cleaner to remove any grease, food, and surface mould growth. This was followed by a wash with a strong bleach solution to kill any remaining mould spores. Damp was a real issue, especially with the pot-washer going at the same time. Luckily, the clent had hired a powerful gas heater/blower which dried the ceiling surface enough for **paint** to be applied. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Architectural features, such as molding or timber framing, make it easier to know where to stop and start color, but wherever one plane or flat surface meets another, you can change colors. When **paint**ing, you'll need to tape off the ceiling carefully to keep the dividing line sharply defined and straight. An uneven line where the two colors meet will spoil the look. Changing colors where the wall meets the ceiling, for example, will focus attention on the living space instead of on the soaring height of the ceiling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As with **paint**ing your ceiling with primer only, you can, but you probably shouldn't. Wall and ceiling **paint** are not equal. They have different qualities, finishes, and thickness. Ceiling **paint** is thicker, so it doesn't drip to the floor while you're **paint**ing. Its qualities are less appealing to the eye than regular wall **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, with the right preparation, you can use wall **paint** on the ceiling and achieve beautiful results. It takes some work. That’s why it’s important to know what you can achieve with either wall or ceiling **paint** so that you can pick the perfect product for your home improvement project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A flat **paint** sheen is the best at hiding some of that texture. Like I mentioned at the beginning of this post, a flat **paint** sheen doesn’t reflect light. It just looks like a uniform color across the entire ceiling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As far as wall **paint** goes, an elegant eggshell for the primary bedroom, and something more durable such as a semi-gloss for the kitchen, bathroom, and kid’s rooms. In the living room, I prefer a velvety matt finish with a semi-gloss trim. How about you? What are your favorite **paint**s for **ceilings** and walls? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The answer is not exactly. Flat white ceiling **paint** will generally work in most homes. It has a matte finish and hides imperfections, which you want in a ceiling **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Is it time for a little home refresh? A nice new coat of ceiling **paint** can do wonders for any room. With the right **paint** from a good brand, your home will feel brand new. Here is a list of the best ceiling **paint** brands that are tried and true that many people love. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is usually the second choice for professional **paint**ers when **paint**ing a ceiling. It dries quickly and offers great durability. It also can open up your color options. Just be sure to use **paint** thinner or thickener accordingly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing **paint** finishes for kitchen or bathroom **ceilings** requires more thought. Ideally, choose a formula specifically made for steamier environments to avoid bubbling and peeling; **paint** finishes for bathrooms and kitchens are often specially formulated. Many manufacturers offer low sheen finishes that are mould resistant and washable, such as Modern emulsion by Farrow & Ball (opens in new tab) and Aura Bath & Spa by Benjamin Moore (opens in new tab). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fill up your roller tray, attach your extension pole and get ready to roll! How to **paint** a ceiling with a roller starts by working from the outside in, from a window or corner. Load up your roller evenly and roll the **paint** on in sections of about one metre long at a time. Move quickly from one section to the next, to ensure the **paint** along the edge doesn’t dry before you do the overlap. To get good coverage, it helps to **paint** in a ‘w’ pattern and finish off each section with one smooth roll. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You don’t have to be Michelangelo to **paint** a ceiling. Admittedly, it might help if you’re attempting something along the lines of the Sistine Chapel, but if you just want a couple of coats of emulsion, it’s definitely something you can tackle yourself. If the idea of **paint**ing above your head makes your shoulders ache, you can find an endorsed **paint**er & decorator with Which? Trusted Traders to take it on for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I had decided on Johnstones Acrylic Eggshell as the most job-friendly **paint**. Johnstones informed me that even the standard Acrylic Eggshell contains anti-fungal agents, and it is a suitable coating for damp atmosphere’s like kitchens and bathrooms. The only other **paint** I might have used is a Chlorinated Rubber **paint** which finds uses in swimming pools and dairy parlours, but is solvent based and has a longer interval for recoating, and so would be much more problematic for this job (especially as the kitchen was still in use). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bathroom **paint** needs to provide protection from humidity and moisture that leads to staining, chipping and peeling. Whether you are **paint**ing walls, **ceilings** or cabinets, the choice is hands-down a semigloss **paint**. The semigloss finish is durable, washable and mildew-resistant. Ceilings in particular tend to foster mold and mildew, since they are not wiped down as often as more accessible areas of the bathroom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Flat (or matte) is the most low-maintenance because it doesn’t scuff and requires little cleaning. Using flat **paint** is easy to touch up if you make mistakes, and it has a very smooth texture to it. Jordan has said that he will add flat **paint** to the walls in any flip house we do in the future. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you tackle the so-called fifth wall of your room, make sure you're **paint**ing it first if you're planning on also **paint**ing the walls in the room. “You want to **paint** your **ceilings** first and then your walls," said Winters. "You certainly don’t want to spatter a freshly **paint**ed wall with your ceiling **paint**." As for your furniture, you'll want to either entirely remove it from the area or push it into the center of the room and cover it with plastic tarps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "It’s almost like **paint**ing a car," Winters said. "Most car primers are some shade of gray, either a light-medium or dark gray and what we learned was that they worked really well, even with architectural wall **paint**." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re giving your home a facelift with a new **paint** job, then you might hit a point where you wonder if it’s worth it to buy ceiling **paint**. Maybe you could use wall **paint**. Really, what’s the difference? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to variety, that’s what you’ll get with wall **paint**. First off, you can choose water or oil-based. Water-based is easier to work with and clean up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re planning to protect areas you don’t want **paint**ing with masking tape, use the best tape you can afford, and be aware that it may still allow some **paint** underneath. An alternative is a **paint**ing shield, which costs about £5 and can be reused. You hold the shield with one hand to mask an area, while you **paint** with the other hand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both water-based and oil-based **paint**s provide a durable finish; although, oil-based is the most durable. The resin makes this **paint** hard when it dries, so it’s an excellent choice for molding and trim. It’s easy to wipe clean, and the surface holds up much longer than water-based **paint**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is another great option if you decide not to use ceiling **paint**. Boasting the same finish as most ceiling **paint**s, it would still have a low sheen and scatter light well. It’s also preferred over other types of wall **paint** because it dries quicker and is low-odor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A white ceiling can also offset an intense wall color. Boldly colored walls appear crisp and sharp, and the ceiling feels higher. If the walls are pale and therefore space-expanding, **paint**ing the ceiling white opens the space even more. In rooms that receive scant natural light, a white ceiling helps boost the perceived illumination by reflecting whatever light is available. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   People always say that glossy sheens are easier to wipe clean too. I do think that flat **paint** sheens are hard to wipe clean. The texture is just a bit too rough. It holds on to dirt and oils. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In choosing a ceiling **paint** finish, don’t **paint** anything above a satin. Satin has a low sheen but is more reflective than eggshell. This will make your **ceilings** shiny and will draw the eye to it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here’s a look at the finished ceiling and crown molding **paint**. For this ceiling, I really wanted to accentuate that beautiful crown molding. So, I **paint**ed the crown molding with Behr’s Polished Pearl in Eggshell Sheen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most common, and recommended, use for ceiling **paint** on walls is to use it in place of a primer. Because it’s thicker, it can usually be applied in one coat. It can help hide imperfections better than regular primer, giving you a solid base to put your new color on top of. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A satin finish is great for washability, without reflecting my purdy lil face back at me. I have done some furniture pieces in semi-gloss, and they looked sharp but were too reflective. Again, the shinier the **paint** is, the more you will see flaws, so if you’re **paint**ing your own cabinets, satin will have a bit more forgiveness than semi-gloss for a less-than-perfect job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you've decided to **paint** your entire room, you need to know where to begin. After prepping your room and materials, you should work from the top down. So, yes, you should **paint** your **ceilings** before your walls. Painting a ceiling is generally a quick and simple process. Even if you considered only **paint**ing your walls, it may be worth adding one more task to your to-do list and **paint**ing the ceiling first. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I like to use eggshell **paint** sheen on crown molding and all of the other trim in my home. The old rule of thumb was to use semi-gloss or gloss on molding and trim in a home. Again, I ignore that rule of thumb and use what I like. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This means we’ll be **paint**ing a ceiling again, which got me down the rabbit hole of researching ceiling **paint**. I learned a lot of things I thought might be helpful for you if you’re trying to figure out the difference between ceiling **paint** vs. wall **paint**, if there even is one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Opt for an oil-based primer for your ceiling to avoid pulling moisture into the material. Start around the edges of the room and the edges of fixtures first, then **paint** outward, meeting in the middle of the ceiling. Allow it to dry completely before adding your **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It was already a nicely designed drop ceiling with beautiful wood trim. But, the **paint** always felt wrong to me. Have a look at the before photo. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now that you’ve finished a large section of your ceiling, and while it’s still damp, you can begin laying-off the **paint**. This is a crucial step in achieving a smooth and consistent finish. Using an unloaded roller begin in the top left corner of your ceiling and gently pull towards you in a straight line with no pressure. A lightness of touch will prevent new brush strokes from forming. Repeat this action and slightly overlap your last movement so your roller rubs away the line created by the previous stroke. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   OIl-based **paint** it more challenging to work with, and you should also wear protective gear if you choose this type. You’ll need to use a solvent, such as turpentine to clean brushes and everything else. The fumes are strong, so make sure the area is well ventilated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As for the perfect **paint** finish, go for flat. Smooth **ceilings** have a tendency to have some ripples and waves in them, so the flat finish helps minimize those imperfections. Winter says the flatter the finish, the better—and the less likely your eye will pick up those blemishes in the ceiling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wall **paint** is not always a good idea to use on a ceiling because it may create too much brightness on the ceiling. If you really want to use flat white on your ceiling, that’s fine. Just know it wasn’t designed for that type of application. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When browsing your local hardware store for your **paint**, you might have noticed that there are four different finishes. There is flat, eggshell, semi-gloss, and gloss. It is highly unlikely that you'll use semi-gloss or gloss for your ceiling. So let's talk about what is meant by a flat or eggshell finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is a myriad of options which will affect the overall look of your room, as well as how long the **paint** surface will last and how easy it will be to clean and maintain. As a general rule of thumb, gloss **paint**s have high sheen levels, are reflective, easier to clean and more durable than **paint**s with low gloss. However, as low gloss **paint**s – flat or matte – reflect less light, they are much better at concealing imperfections in the surface of the ceiling, hence their popularity, especially in white which will lift a room and boost the feeling of space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Color on the ceiling can enhance a room's character, but beware of excess. For primary living areas, keep the ceiling treatment simple so you don't grow tired of it. For a clean, simple look, white **ceilings** are often the best choice for a room. When used overhead, white tends to disappear, so your attention focuses on the walls and furnishings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is the perfect option if your ceiling is flat or bare drywall. This **paint** dries with a slight texture to it so you can avoid spray texture but still achieve a slight popcorn-ceiling look. One consideration is that you cannot use this over already textured **ceilings**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We mentioned above that flat **paint** is more commonly used, but according to Home Depot, eggshell **paint** is the second most popular choice for ceiling **paint**. Choosing either one will not be a bad decision. They also recommend using an eggshell finish if you need a more washable surface such as in a bathroom or kitchen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One reason why you may consider an alternative is because ceiling **paint** is limited as far as color goes. White and shades of white, is what you’ll get with this product. The thing is that some shade of white is typically the standard for **ceilings**. And there are ways to achieve a colored ceiling if that’s what you want. You can have the store mix a custom color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s time to open your **paint** and pick up your brush. Start by **paint**ing around the fixtures where a roller won’t reach. This same rule applies when considering how to **paint** edges between wall and ceiling. This technique is called ‘cutting in’ to create clean lines. Simply **paint** from the edge to an inch on the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It can be tempting to only want to apply one coat of **paint** to your ceiling. After all, it would save you both time and money. However, skipping a second coat can leave you with a **paint** job that looks subpar. Second coats leave you with a smooth and uniform finish, and you'll most certainly have to do at least two coats if you are **paint**ing over a darker color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We don't recommend using anything shinier than an eggshell finish though, as more sheen can create a more noticeable glare. This is what we meant when we said it is highly unlikely you'll use a **paint** with a gloss finish for your ceiling. It'll draw attention upwards rather than towards the rest of the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s easy to understand why you don’t want ceiling **paint** to be too thin. In **paint** terminology, this means that it must have a higher viscosity than wall **paint**. The best way to explain viscosity is by thinking of it in terms of a liquid’s thickness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s easier to get a smooth, uniform finish with ceiling **paint**. That’s because, in addition to adding body to the **paint**, a high viscosity also supplies full, opaque coverage in one coat. What this means for you is that it will cover stains and discolorations on your ceiling with much less effort. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best drop cloth to use, according to Winters, is a canvas drop cloth with a rubber backing. "The canvas allows the **paint** to absorb in so you’re not tracking it around the house," he said. "And the rubber backing makes it nonslip." If you use a plastic drop cloth—which you shouldn't—the drip from the ceiling could get tracked along the floors, creating a mess. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Viscosity works the same way with **paint**. Ceiling **paint** has a higher viscosity than wall **paint**, so it doesn’t splash and splatter. Not only that, but it also dries quicker. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’m a huge fan of an eggshell finish on **ceilings**. It reflects light, making the whole room feel lighter and brighter. Some links on this post are affiliate links. As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases at no additional cost to you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So, we've told you that flat **paint** is the more popular choice when **paint**ing your ceiling, but keep reading as we discuss the differences between the two. We'll also give you a few reasons why you might pick one over the other. Finally, we will answer some other questions you might have about **paint**ing your ceiling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ceilings are the middle child of design canvases—they're often forgotten, but have tons of untapped potential to make your home stand out. A ceiling can tie together any room, whether it’s **paint**ed brilliant white, an unexpected pattern, or a bold and bright color of your choosing. Once you’ve decided on exactly what you want your ceiling to look like post-**paint** job, you need to take the first steps—and we're here to help with some expert advice from Jeff Winters, the VP of Marketing for Sherwin-Williams, and designer Rasheeda Gray of Gray Space Interiors. So read through all of Winters' advice and watch Gray's simple step-by-step instructions for **paint**ing a ceiling in the video above for a visual demonstration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Current ceiling in apartment was satin finish. Whole apartment being **paint**ed with primer. Walls will be semi-gloss for ease of cleaning. The ceiling will be 25% wall color and 75% ceiling white. Should it be satin or semi-gloss? I want as much light as possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ceiling **paint** is also great for hiding any stains since it has a higher viscosity. If you are dealing with mold and mildew stains, cigarette and cigar smoke stains, cooking splatters, incense and water spots, ceiling **paint** does a significantly better job at covering stains compared to ordinary latex **paint**. You’ll be left with a clean and uniform finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here’s another massive improvement that only involved a **paint** change. We have a huge ceiling that goes over our Foyer, upstairs Hallway, and Living Room. And by huge I mean it’s probably 18′ x 50′. It’s massive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All in all, ceiling **paint** vs. wall **paint** doesn’t have to be a difficult decision. As long as you know what sheen you want for your ceiling, you can find the ceiling **paint** that will go with it perfectly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you choose water-based **paint**, make sure to clean the walls first. Then, you can rough the surface up a bit with some fine sandpaper. Creating some texture will help the **paint** adhere to the surface, especially if the prior **paint** was oil-based. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We've given you lots of things to think about, but don't worry too much about whether to choose flat or eggshell **paint**; there's not a wrong choice. Both will get the job done. Just think about whether you'd like a slightly more lustered finish. Happy **paint**ing! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Undoubtedly, you’ll be heading out soon to grab **paint** samples – stop right there! I want you to check out SAMPLIZE. Samplize offers peel-and-stick **paint** samples that are more AFFORDABLE, EASIER and more ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY than traditional **paint** pots. Here are just a FEW reasons why I recommend Samplize to my clients… - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here’s a look at the before photo. The Dining Room trim work was already nice. But, I thought this Simple DIY Coffered Ceiling Design Makeover would add even more style. The subtle sheen of that Eggshell ceiling **paint** finish will look better too. Side note, you can see the steps for that distressed DIY Gray Chalk Paint Furniture Makeover on that buffet in a previous post. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ceiling **paint** is more viscous (thicker) than wall **paint**. Most ceiling **paint** is latex-based and is designed to have a smooth, even finish that can be easily applied. Ceiling **paint** is typically available in either a flat or a low-gloss sheen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many **paint**s are versatile and can be used in a variety of **paint**able surfaces. Ceiling **paint** has the advantage of being thicker, with less splatter and quicker dry times. But wall **paint** is a suitable option as well if you are wanting to add your own personal touch to a room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You wouldn’t want to mix satin wall **paint** with flat ceiling **paint**. Before you **paint** the whole project, you should do a test to see if there will be any issues. In addition, I would only recommend mixing small quantities of ceiling and wall **paint** so that if you do run into any problems, you’re not wasting a ton of your **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wall **paint** also comes in a flat white finish, but it’s not marketed as ceiling **paint** for a few reasons. This is primarily because ceiling **paint** has less sheen so that light reflection is minimized. Too much gloss on ceiling **paint** will reflect light all over the ceiling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wall **paint** has low viscosity, meaning it’s thinner. This is great for being able to brush a few fresh coats on your wall but can prove to be a nightmare if used incorrectly on **ceilings**. If not properly applied, wall **paint** on your ceiling will drip easily causing an unsightly finished product and doubling your workload when you have to start over. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In rooms with oddly shaped or multiangled **ceilings**, carrying the wall color across the ceiling can simplify the shape and unify the space. In general, a same-color ceiling seems lower, so it makes a room with lofty proportions feel more intimate. Applying the same color to walls and ceiling also makes your **paint**ing job easier, because you won't have to tape off the molding at the ceiling line. Whether you show off the crown molding and other trim with a contrasting color or **paint** them to blend in depends on your personal preferences. Highlighting the trim accents the architecture and calls attention to its shape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can use wall **paint** on your ceiling, but extra care should be taken when doing so. Wall **paint** is thinner and more prone to dripping. It is not recommended to use wall **paint** on your ceiling if your ceiling is extremely textured or has excessive damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fresh coats of **paint** can really make all the difference in a room. If you're thinking about **paint**ing your ceiling, you might be wondering whether the **paint** you use should be flat or eggshell. Well, we've researched this question in-depth, and have the answer for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A primer is a primer for a reason and it is not meant to be used as a finishing coat. A primer will not seal as well from moisture and will begin to yellow and stain which means you'll have to re**paint** your ceiling faster. Its purpose is to seal and bond the finishing **paint**, and you'll likely still be able to see the seams and joints through the primer. It's not worth cutting corners if you have to deal with the problems caused by it sooner rather than later. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Congratulations! You’ve successfully conquered the best way to **paint** a ceiling. Depending on the **paint** chosen, you may need to wait for it to dry and do a second coat. Although you might be in a hurry to get the job done, it’s crucial to wait until the first coat is completely dry, in order to avoid making a mess of it. To **paint** the second coat, follow the same process as above. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Think basements in the north or the midwest coming in and out from snowy days. Or a mudroom where you’re going to be taking off muddy soccer cleats or rain boots. Having thick, plain ceiling **paint** on walls may be a better option there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wall **paint** is also much more durable than ceiling **paint**. It has to be able to withstand many more interactions from people and furniture. Many interior wall **paint**s are washable and easy to clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There's a good reason to examine **paint** finishes for **ceilings**. The first step to achieving a great result for your ceiling **paint** ideas is to choose the right **paint**. The ceiling may be above your head – and seemingly less noticeable than walls – but its finish can make a surprising difference to the success of your project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remember to leave each coat to completely dry before applying your next to avoid having to do more. Not waiting until the first coat is dry can result in peeling, patchy **paint**. Follow any directions listed on the **paint** can for dry times between coats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to primer, the kind you should use varies based on if you have water or nicotine stains and what color you've decided to **paint** your ceiling. You should be using oil or shellac-based primers if your ceiling has stains and a gray-shaded primer if you're planning on **paint**ing your ceiling in a bold color, like a navy or a sable. Believe it or not, the gray is actually better to **paint** over than a white primer for brighter colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although you may be thinking that you need a ladder for the entire project, Winters says that's not the case. While a 6-foot ladder is a good thing to have for those hard-to-reach places in this project, like the corners, you actually won't be using it much to **paint** your **ceilings**. The best thing you can purchase to reach up above is a **paint** roller extension pole—what's recommended are extension poles that are 6 to 8 feet high, depending on the height of your ceiling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For interest and contrast, bolder colors in flat and matte **paint**s can be used to introduce intimacy to a room, as interior designer Victoria Maria (opens in new tab) explains. ‘I often treat the ceiling the same way as I do the walls, **paint**ing them in the same color and with a matte finish to create an enveloping effect, rather like being in a box,’ she says. ‘This is especially effective with a warm, dark color, such as a deep blue – and it’s velvet-soft matte finish enhances the inviting feel of the room.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Flat **paint** has little to no sheen. Because of this, it’s usually not washable or even very wipeable. Some higher-end brands have some luck with basic washability (Benjamin Moore Aura and Sherwin Williams Emerald), but I’m sceptical over the long-term for high-use areas. I’ve found the only TRULY WASHABLE **paint** is Benjamin Moore ScuffX. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
