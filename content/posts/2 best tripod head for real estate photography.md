## 2 Reference List: Best Tripod Head For Real Estate Photography | Camera and Photography Equipment for Realtors
-   You know my answer already! Whichever works best for you! If you are shooting something with a lot of movement or tend to be a hand-held shooter that’s looking to remove the camera shake element from your photographic game, then I’d say that the ball head might be the best bet for you. You’ll get that intuitive, ease of control while enjoying the added stability of a **tripod**. On the other hand, if you are a landscape photographer, shoot real estate, or just really want precise control of your camera, then the pan head is probably something that you should check out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Naturally, you don’t have to spend that much and there are countless quality options out there for much less. The point I am trying to make is that there is more that goes into a **tripod** purchase than simply picking one up at Walmart, and there are some things that you need to consider so you end up with the gear that you will get the most use out of. That being said, one of the most important components of a **tripod** is the head. This is the piece that your camera connects to and going cheap, or purchasing the wrong kind, can turn your **tripod** into a hindrance with legs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
