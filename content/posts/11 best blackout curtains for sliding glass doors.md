## 11 Facts Best Blackout Curtains For Sliding Glass Doors | best blackout curtains for sliding glass doors
-   Daylight saving time is almost here — this year falling on Sunday, Nov. 6 — which means we'll gain an hour of sleep and, in the process, get sunlight earlier in the morning and lose some in the evening. If the time change means the sun is up before you are, blackouts **curtains** can be a worthwhile investment: Experts told us they look like typical **curtains** but feature a blackout lining that stops light from filtering into your room. They can also help regulate how well you sleep overall — studies have found that shifts in exposure to light before you rise can reduce your quality of sleep, disrupt circadian rhythm (the internal process that regulates sleep) and make you feel fatigued much earlier in the day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   O’Brien also noted that **curtains** with blackout lining are heavier than typical **curtains**, so investing in a good quality drapery rod is important. “Don’t buy the thinnest, least expensive rod — you don’t want it to sag or break,” she said, adding that shoppers should look for a rod that has a larger diameter of about 1 inch that can hold more fabric. And while there’s a price jump, both O’Brien and Brown recommended a traverse rod, which features a baton or string that you pull to open and close the **curtains** for additional ease. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Available in three different sizes ranging from 80 inches to 104 inches in length, these **curtains** with pole pockets can be a simple yet effective choice, explained Brown. “This selection accomplishes all of your needs for a beautifully designed blackout curtain that’s still reasonably priced,” she said. The curtain is offered individually or in a set of two and you can purchase separate ring clips for ease of use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For your bedroom, these thermal insulated drapes can block up to 99 percent of light, according to the brand. I previously highlighted these **curtains** as my favorite sleep aid during cold New York winters when I need complete darkness, and Brown agreed they can be a good option for the bedroom. Available in 24 fade-resistant colors and 10 sizes, the brand says they come with two panels per package to accommodate various types of windows and styles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   O’Brien recommended Pottery Barn's blackout **curtains** due to their array of styles and colors “that work well with most people's houses.” Sold as individual panels, the brand’s Emery Linen Blackout Curtain is made from a linen and cotton blend and includes curtain hooks to use with round or clip rings. You can select from two widths — 50 inches and 100 inches — as well as three lengths: 84 inches, 96 inches and 108 inches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Depending on the length of your ceiling and where the window is located, Brown recommended measuring at least 8 to 10 inches from the sides of the window, if possible, so the **curtains** are wider than your actual windows. And as a rule of thumb for floor-length **curtains**, Brown suggested they “kiss the floor,” meaning **curtains** should be an inch or so above the ground. Our experts emphasized that hiring a professional to measure the right size curtain can help avoid mistakes and costly replacements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're looking at a specific curtain that’s not offered as a blackout option, or if you simply want to keep the **curtains** you already have in your home, placing a blackout curtain liner under your regular curtain can be an effective (and often more economical) way to get the blackout effect, according to Peters. “You can buy any **curtains** that fit your style and pair them with a blackout curtain or blackout curtain liner,” she said. Our experts recommended this blackout liner that comes with two panels and drapery rings, is machine washable and blocks out up to 99 percent of light, according to the brand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . Blackout **curtains** can have a “muffling effect” that softens the noise from outside, according to Pamela O’Brien, principal interior designer at Pamela Hope Designs. Insulate the room from drafts or heat . Because there’s a thick liner attached to blackout drapery, O’Brien said they can help keep your room a little warmer by limiting the cold air seeping through the window (it’s even more effective if you choose a thermal curtain ). And by blocking direct sunlight, they can also make the room a little cooler during the warmer months. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

By blocking sunlight, blackout **curtains** create a decent barrier between the sun and your furnishing, said Jennifer Hunter, interior designer and owner of Jennifer Hunter Design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Susan Peters, owner and interior designer for 9108 Designs, emphasized PBteen’s combination of quality and design details. “Don't let the ‘teen’ part fool you — this curtain is appropriate for all ages,” she added. “Pottery Barn across the board makes some amazing blackout **curtains**.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
