-   Decorative trims or beading on **curtains** may not survive home washing. Similarly, it’s a bad idea to **clean** **curtains** made of embroidered or tapestry fabrics at home. These fabrics can be fragile and are often susceptible to shrinking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vacuum heavier fabrics with your upholstery brush attachment. (Tape a piece of mesh or pantyhose over the brush when working on lightweight **curtains** so the vacuum does not suck up the fabric into the nozzle.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Curtains require professional dry **clean**ing in order to achieve the best results and prevent shrinkage and other damages. Sometimes you can gentle wash your nets and some basic types of **curtains** at home. This is indicated on the care label. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Put these blackout **curtains** in a front loader for a gentle wash so that their fabric could not get damaged. If you are going to use a simple washing machine, keep in mind that it could damage the fabric of your blackout **curtains** and they won’t be in theory original condition. In this way, you will make the situation worse rather than get them **clean**ed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you deep **clean** the **curtains**, you should be careful about a few facts. Firstly, these fabrics are heavier. So, you will need muscle power to pull and twist them. FR retardant fabric needs to be washed off with extra care. However, you may look at Direct Fabrics for FR blackout **curtains**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A key reason why it's advisable to wait for warm weather to wash rubber-backed **curtains** is that they should always be air-dried, even if you decide to wash them in a washing machine. Curtains treated with a rubber backing should never go in a dryer or the rubber will start to crack and peel, ruining the backing and clogging your dryer with bits of rubber. You may hang wet **curtains** up to dry indoors, but the rubber backing means that they'll dry slowly and mildew may set in if you're air-drying them in a poorly ventilated room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do thicker **curtains** cost more to **clean**? Depending on the build of your **curtains** these may turn out to cost a little more. Many **curtains** are thicker, due to an insulating layer placed between the lining and face fabric. These will cost a little more to **clean** due to the complexities of the build and volume of material. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These types of blackouts that are made of woven triple weave fabric are the ones, with no coating on their backside. They are very soft to touch and have drapery.

-   For **clean**ing the **curtains** use a warm, damp cloth to gently massage a tiny amount of soap into the problem area before rinsing with **clean** water. To make sure your laundry soap won’t change the colour of the fabric, try a small area of the curtain in a hidden location first. For coated **curtains**, use Soapy Water to thoroughly **clean** them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cleaning curtain tracks is commonly known as the bane of any **clean**er’s existence. These pesky grooves often accumulate a range of dust and debris and it is difficult to get the right tool to **clean** your curtain tracks. We have a range of suggestions: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blackout **curtains** features: What should I look out for? Curtains that effectively block out light are the finest kind of blackout **curtains**. Many blackout **curtains**, blinds and shades only filter some of the light that enters your house, even if they are advertised as such. Design features like seams, opaque fabric and reduced heat are all features of high-quality blackout **curtains**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blackout **curtains** are composed of velvet or suede, which is a heavy, thick fabric that is difficult to see through. To enhance their ability to filter light and act as a thermal insulator, opaque textiles are sometimes reinforced with rubber, polyester or polyethene. Double and triple layer blackout **curtains** are the most effective due to their structure, which blocks out light better. When it’s day or night, they do a great job blocking out light from all directions to provide a peaceful night’s sleep. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   North-facing rooms need regular redecoration because the intense sunlight penetrating dulls the wall paints, ages furniture, and fades carpet and curtain fabrics. Installing blackout **curtains** in these locations can help keep your home cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter by reducing the amount of time spent repainting and refinishing. Close the **curtains** throughout the day, particularly during the sun’s peak hours. Then, just open them as the evening draws in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is, in part, because correct handling of blackout **curtains** especially, is imperative to ensuring it remains intact. Contemporary methods of **clean**ing, via machine etc, run the risk of damaging the **curtains** and can result in losing the effectiveness of the curtain or compromising it entirely. Making it unusable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Put your **curtains** into that tub and start washing them gently with your hands, then squeeze and scrub with the soft hands. Once you are done with the washing procedure, now unload the tub with that water and fill it with **clean** water. Rinse the blackout **curtains** from that water and let them dry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the very first place, when you hang them off, from the window. Start vacuuming them in order to remove dirt and debris from them. Clean them properly from both sides. Hanging them off is not a mandatory thing to do while **clean**ing. You can vacuum them up while keep them hanging on the window, and by the use of a dust attachment with your vacuum. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An average house loses 30% of its heat via the windows. As a result, your home’s heating and cooling systems must work harder, using more energy. Thermal loss may be controlled by using blackout **curtains**, which block off the sun’s rays. Curtains that block out the light may help regulate the home’s insulation, which in turn helps to keep heat from escaping during winters. According to several manufacturers, heat loss may be reduced by up to 25%, which can result in substantial savings on your energy bill. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When washing rubber-backed **curtains** by hand outdoors isn't an option, you may be able to safely machine wash them — but only if the **curtains** are in good condition. Any small tears in the fabric or damage to the rubber backing may be made worse by a trip through the washing machine. Assuming the **curtains** don't have any signs of wear and tear, and there's no manufacturer's tag telling you otherwise, it should be safe to wash them with cold water and mild detergent using your washing machine's most gentle setting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, it’s not true. You may wash off these fabrics using a regular vacuum, laundry soap or detergent, and a conventional deep **clean**ing method. So, let’s see the best ways to wash the fabric and **curtains** for a **clean**er indoors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The Spruce / Sanja Kostic Rinse the Curtains Let the soapy water go down the drain or pour it out of the bucket. Replace with **clean** lukewarm to cool water. Swish the **curtains** in the water to loosen the suds. Keep rinsing the **curtains** in clear water until all the suds are gone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is possible to minimise the amount of light that enters a room significantly by using blackout **curtains**. Multiple layers of densely woven, thick cloth make up the reverse, making it completely opaque. Investing in blackout **curtains** is a smart move that will improve your quality of life and save you money at the same time. Since these **curtains** completely block out light, they’re ideal for those who work night shifts and need to sleep during the day. If you have a home theatre set up in a separate room, adding blackout **curtains** will help to recreate the theatre experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may wash off the particular spots of the **curtains** with laundry detergent or soap. Many times, juices or coffee might spill and fall on the curtain. Thus, when the spill dries out, it makes the fabric look ugly and dirty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Washing rubber-backed **curtains** is a job best saved for a warm, sunny day for a few reasons. These **curtains** tend to be heavy and bulky, and washing them outdoors lets you spread them out so the rubber backing doesn't stick to itself. Outdoor washing also lets you use a hose, which can be a more efficient way to wash large **curtains** than trying to wrestle them into a tub for handwashing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because of the widespread use of see-through doors and windows in contemporary interior design, sometimes privacy can be compromised if you are residing in a densely populated neighbourhood. However, there is no need to be concerned, since blackout **curtains** are available to serve as your ideal privacy shield.

-   The back of the cloth is covered with a blackout layer on the readymade blackout **curtains**, so there is no need for a separate lining.

-   The Spruce / Sanja Kostic Hang to Dry Once the panels are just damp and not sopping wet, hang them up to dry (do not put the **curtains** back on the window yet). Hang them over a drying rack or from a bathtub curtain rod. Do not hang them near a heat source or they may shrink or otherwise damage the fabric. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After soaking your **curtains** in cold water for 10-15 minutes, use a medium to hard-bristled brush to lightly scrub the soiled or mouldy areas.

-   The Spruce / Sanja Kostic Attach a Drape or Fabric Tool Put the correct tool onto the hose. Gently brush the fabric from top to bottom of the curtain, holding the hose upright as you suck the dirt out of the **curtains**. A light touch is required when brushing the fabric with a steamer tool—you do not need to press the curtain into the window as you brush it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   High-quality blackout **curtains** keep out street lights and sunshine, enabling the pineal gland to generate the hormone melatonin at its maximum capacity. This is critical since the sleep cycle is influenced and regulated by melatonin production. Those who work midnight shifts are more prone to sleep disorders because of their inconsistent sleep patterns. The use of blackout **curtains** may make the transition throughout the day a little easier, which helps with the sleep quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Buyers get access to innovative blackout **curtains** in the market that help regulate the temperature. When it’s chilly outside, these **curtains** will help keep you snug and warm, and when it’s hot, they will help keep the space fresh and cool.

-   Repairing frayed hems on **curtains** can be tricky and rehemming is usually the best way to remove frays. If you can't rehem the panels, try to snip as many frayed threads from the hem before and after **clean**ing the **curtains**, however, you run the risk of creating more holes. You can try treating the hems with a fray-sealing adhesive product that dries clear. If you have **curtains** with a frayed fabric liner, it may be best to talk to a professional **clean**er to see if they can replace the lining fabric. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blackout **curtains** are built to endure thanks to their densely woven materials. Even though they’re more expensive, these drapes and **curtains** are well worth the investment.

Blackout **curtains** are an excellent investment because of their many uses and appealing aesthetics. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How to Clean blackout **curtains** that are made of foam-coated fabric, by giving them a proper hand wash.

-   Some curtain fabrics must be dry-**clean**ed because of special materials (such as adhesive **curtains**) or fabrics with special weaving methods (such as knitted fabrics). Do not wash them in order to avoid damage or deformation of the fabric. If there is a top-cover style, the **curtains** are decorated with ornaments, such as silk tassels or hanging tassels next to the curtain cloth. Dry **clean** or hand wash as much as possible, never machine wash. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
