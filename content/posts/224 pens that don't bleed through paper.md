## 224 Things You Should Know About Pens That Don'T Bleed Through Paper | Pens That Don'T Bleed Through Bible Paper
-   The first part of the answer is fairly obvious: alcohol is more ex**pens**ive than water. Another significant factor is the production costs: the use of alcohol makes the whole process more complex and thus ex**pens**ive. But! Using alcohol as the solvent gives the markers their unique qualities. So the investment really pays off! The most popular brands are Copic, Winsor & Newton, Ohuhu, Twinmarkers, Touch markers, Prismacolor, etc. They may vary in price and color range, but don't get stuck if you are just starting with markers! Just buy what is available and start drawing! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

The Faber-Castell Pitt Artist Pens come from a reliable brand, and contain pigmented India ink (which is more lightfast), but I found that they didn’t blend as well as I would have liked.

These gel **pens** feature a 0.8 to 1.0mm tip which allows you to make highly detailed colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At its most basic, a non-gel pen has to do just two things: be good for drawing and writing. But there are so many reasons to choose one over another.

And what does it look like? With so many varieties out there, we are determined to find the best markers for drawing and good line art **pens** for you to use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a couple of common bible pen tip sizes presented in this article, ranging from 0.25mm to a maximum of 0.7mm. Each tip size is compatible with specific purposes as I have mentioned above; therefore, I advise you to consider choosing bible journaling **pens** due to their head tip measurements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our second favorite is the Parker Jotter Pen Sets. Each set contains one ballpoint and one gel pen. The ballpoint contains smooth-flowing black ink for a great writing and drawing experience, while the gel **pens** are filled with black gel ink that dries quickly and does not smear. Both **pens** feature a clip that show the iconic Parker arrowhead design. You get a two-year warranty by the manufacturer when purchasing this set. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Metal gel tips – Most bible journaling **pens** engineered with strong metal head tips are slim and perform a high level of precision in calligraphy and drawing details.

We highly recommend the Lionet Gold pen, which excels for the use in illustration and fashion design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   From what I can tell about Sharpie, it is technically one of the biggest and most reliable brands to manufacture bible journaling **pens**. However, nothing is perfect and the awful fume coming from the art pen in this set is not that much of an emergency. I know the brand will strive to give out better products soon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I think the best-selling point of these Markers for Coloring Books are their color options. There are a lot of different choices to make coloring fun. However, I don’t think these are the best markers for artists. If you are serious about creating the best color effects, better go for something with more quality. I think these are entry-level markers that don’t **bleed** for coloring but the tips do get worn out after some use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At a similar price point to the previous one, this was a tad disappointing because the color options are not as varied. You get only 24 **pens** in Markers set. I overlooked that because I was set on having dual-tip markers and to in my head, that more than com**pens**ated for its less than stellar color options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another way to blend with your Tombows is by using a wet brush. You can also dip the brush **pens** in water or touch a lighter brush tip with a darker one to create a nice, ombre effect. That being said, coloring may not be the best application for these brush **pens**. Tombows work best when used with water so you’d need a thicker kind of paper, preferably watercolor paper to really have fun with it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These are no **bleed** markers for coloring. They dis**pens**e ink easily, especially the brush tip but don’t **bleed** to the back page and the rest of the surface. I do let it dry for a few more seconds before running my hands on the surface of the page just to be on the safe side but so far, streaking and smearing are not an issue with this. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best brand of watercolour markers is the Winsor & Newton Watercolour ProMarkers. These markers are vibrant, pigmented and fade-resistant. The **pens** are also acid-free, lightfast and non-toxic, which makes the pen suitable for professional artwork, like commissions and saleable paintings. There are 36 colours to choose from and they work in conjunction with both watercolours and regular alcohol based markers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

It comes in fine and medium nibs and is on the more affordable end of the spectrum. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fineliner **pens** are the go-to-choice for drawing and sketching for many artists and hobbyists. They either have a felt nib or a plastic fiber nib and come in a range of sizes and colors. Usually, fine point drawing **pens** are disposable and are a much cheaper option than technical **pens**. When it comes to finding the best fine tip art **pens**, most illustrators, artists, and graphic designers will have their favorites and there are many different reasons for their choices: It is the blackest, it has the best controlled line, it has great resistance, etc. Here are three choices that we deem the best. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cons Gel **pens** can cause skipping which makes it difficult to get a consistent line. This is often preventable if you store your pen downward with the nib down. Gel **pens** smudged more than the other **pens** tested. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I think this iBayam set of 36 colored bible journaling **pens** is definitely potential in making its name on the global market. The outer shell of this pen is elegant in black with a color-matching cap to recognize which one you need for your bible studying or daily planning on the calendar. It would be perfect with a higher volume. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Ink type: fineliners can have either water based, or oil based ink. Water based ink is most widely used, and has the advantage of being less likely to **bleed** through your paper. Oil based inks work on glossy surfaces like photographs, so can be more versatile. They are also better for mixed media work as they do not **bleed** when interacting with wet media like paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our third choice for the best acrylic **pens** are the Kuretake Zig Posterman Paint Markers. You can use them on canvas, paper, plastic, metal, wood, and stone. On absorbent surfaces, these **pens** are permanent, and the colors can be overlapped once fully dried. They have outstanding coverage, are lightfast, odorless, and non-blurring. We recommend this set of 8 markers with versatile medium tips, which is a good basis to start with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have always loved Stampin’ Up! products and was so excited to see these **pens** in their line up. The set comes with 2 **pens**: 1 each of 2 different widths (.01 and .05), both with black in. They write incredibly smooth and are great for small details, taking notes and writing text. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since these are dual-tipped no **bleed** markers for coloring, I don’t expect the ink to last that long. There just isn’t enough room for a lot of ink in there. If you color a lot, you might run through these **pens** fast. I think that’s not a big issue since it is fairly cheap for the number of **pens** you are getting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best for Bible Journaling: Pigma Micron Bible Study Kit Buy on Amazon Buy on Walmart The Pigma Micron Bible Study Kit is a perfect set of **pens** for those who enjoy taking a fresh and creative approach to Bible journaling.

-   According to Sakura, “Scientists, architects, archivists, anthropologists, entomologists, and laboratories alike consider Pigma Micron a necessary tool for any archival-quality, handwritten project, and record-keeping.” We can’t outright recommend this pen though because it is disposable. Sakura has no program to recycle used **pens** and buying more to just throw them away later is not a practice we can get on board with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With thin paper these issues may not just impact the page you are writing on, but the back of the page and page after as well.
