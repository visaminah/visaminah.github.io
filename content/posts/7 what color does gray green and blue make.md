## 7 Things You Should Know About What Color Does Gray Green And Blue Make | Color mixing
-   Average mixing obtains a new color out of two component colors, with brightness equal to the average of the two components. This is different from additive mixing, which results in a color lighter than the colors being mixed; and from subtractive mixing, which results in a color darker than the colors being mixed. Some examples of average mixing are: black and white averages to **gray**, and blue and red averages to purple. Average mixing has eight primary colors: white, cyan, magenta, yellow, red, **green**, blue, and black, and a maximum of four of those colors would be needed to archive a particular color, for example, using two colors that are part of a color wheel, along with white and black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The color wheel comprises three primary colors that are red, blue, and yellow. These colors are mixed to further create secondary colors that are purple, red, and orange. Lastly, tertiary colors are made by mixing primary and secondary ones which give us six colors like red-violet, blue-**green**, etc. But what other colors work together and how are they combined? What happens when you mix blue and pink together? Let’s keep reading to learn about this tertiary color and subsequently know more about what color is bronze and what color is carbon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A simulated example of additive color mixing. Additive primaries act as sources of light. The primaries red, **green**, and blue combine pairwise to produce the additive secondaries cyan, magenta, and yellow. Combining all three primaries (center) produces white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red-**green**–blue additive mixing is used in television and computer monitors, including smartphone displays, to produce a wide range of colors. A screen pixel uses a juxtaposition of these three primary colors. Projection televisions sometimes have three projectors, one for each primary color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In some case, paint mixing can result in average wavelength. For example, mixing blue and yellow usually results in some shade of **green** despite them being complementary colors, because there is a **green** spectrum between yellow spectrum and blue spectrum. It's also one reason why mixing red and blue along with white can result in **gray**, because red and blue averages to purple, but the average wavelength is **green** which is a complementary color of purple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A simulated example of (idealized) subtractive color mixing. An external source of illumination is assumed, and each primary attenuates (absorbs) some of that light. The standard subtractive primaries cyan, magenta, and yellow combine pairwise to make subtractive secondaries red, **green**, and blue (which are additive primaries, or in practice somewhat darker and less-saturated versions of typical additive primaries). Combining all three primaries (center) absorbs all the light, resulting in black. For real pigments, the results would be somewhat complicated by opacity and mixing behavior, and in practice adding a fourth pigment such as black may be helpful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To mix pink and blue with **green** leads to a brown or **gray** color. This combination of mix has the same result as all contemporary colors. These colors produce **gray** or brown because of their vast spectrum of shades. Gray, when mixed, becomes muddled. Apart from the two colors, brown and **gray**, complimentary colors also include blue and orange and yellow and purple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
