## 47 Interesting Facts Printers That Enlarge And Reduce Copies | hp printers that enlarge and reduce copies
-   That said, a few imageClass X monochrome **printers**, like the imageClass X LBP1238, are aimed for work-from-home use "as part of an organization's extended print fleet," which also makes them suitable for a home or micro office. If you can make use of their extra features. like the LBP1238's unusually large 5-inch color touch-screen control panel, and the printer's ability to print from the cloud, you might find them worth considering. However, if you don't need the extras, you can get the same core features for less with non-X imageClass models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With laser **printers**, it’s more typically true that high resolution (1,200dpi or more) looks better. You’re most likely to notice it as improved graphics and smoother outlines to text – the latter can look jagged at the 600dpi resolution typical of entry-level models, but only if you have very sharp eyes. Note that a laser’s quoted resolution may be the product of interpolation, rather than the print engine’s native or “true” resolution. An interpolated resolution of, say, 1,200dpi is likely to look better than a 600dpi print, but not as good as a true 1,200dpi print. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ink tank **printers** offer voluminous ink capacity and microscopic printing costs but can be expensive to buy. The Epson EcoTank ET-1810 addresses this problem by whittling away the fancy extras that help justify the cost of more expensive models, including core MFP features such as scanning and copying. What’s left behind is a more affordable ink tank printer that’s just as good at printing as more expensive models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The MegaTank **printers** cost more than otherwise equivalent cartridge-based **printers**, but they have lower running costs, which means they can have a lower total cost of ownership in the long run. However, that's true only if you print enough to save more in ink than the extra money you spend in the initial cost. (Read our feature How to Save Money on Your Next Printer: Weighing the Cost of Tank vs. Cartridge Ink.) The G models range from a single-function printer to both three-in-one and four-in-one AIOs, including one three-function AIO that uses a six-color ink system to boost photo quality: the Pixma G620 Wireless MegaTank Photo Printer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bulk-ink **printers** in families such as Epson's EcoTank, HP's Smart Tank Plus, and Canon's MegaTank are refilled from bottles instead of using replacement cartridges. (HP's Neverstop lasers do the same with toner.) Brother's INKvestment Tank **printers** don't use bottles but boast larger, lower-cost cartridges than old-school inkjets. These **printers** can drive per-page costs to under a penny for monochrome printing and just a few cents for color. Our tank versus cartridge tutorial has the details. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Then there's what we call "bulk ink" **printers**. For decades, the printer industry followed a razors-and-blades model, selling **printers** at relatively low prices and making most of their profits from costly ink and toner refills. Most of today’s entry-level inkjets still follow that plan, but in recent years manufacturers have rolled out products with a selling point that's the polar opposite: saving money on operating costs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The simplest lasers use one (mono) or four (colour) toner cartridges with an integrated OPC drum. These make the printer easy to maintain, but they can result in high print costs. The absence of other user-serviceable parts can also limit your printer’s lifespan. Other laser **printers** have separate OPC drums, waste toner bottles and even fuser units, which can produce a lot of hidden costs even if the toner cartridges are cheap. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This allows Epson to whittle down the cost of photo printing, with 6x4in colour photos costing just 3.4p each. Unlike other photo **printers**, it’s also a good all-rounder, more than capable of taking on regular printing jobs. It doesn’t have the sharpest output at standard settings but with black text documents working out to 0.2p each, it’s as good value as four-colour ink tank models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of the list of wireless standards, only Wi-Fi and AirPrint are actual local area network (LAN) protocols. The others—Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth, Mopria, and NFC—are primarily peer-to-peer protocols that let you link a mobile device to the printer without either being part of a formal network. NFC (near-field communication) is unique in that it allows you to connect simply by tapping an NFC-enabled device to a hotspot on the printer, usually on or near the control panel. In addition to all these, most **printers** and AIOs these days also support connectivity via several popular cloud sites, such as Google Cloud Print, Microsoft OneDrive, Box, and Evernote. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s an inkjet printer that uses cartridges for convenience but its running costs are comparatively low. Once you’ve consumed the 3,000 pages worth of mono prints and 1,500 pages of colour that come in the box, replacement cartridges work out at 0.7p per mono page and 2.7p per colour page. Typically, this is only bettered by tank-based **printers**, which tend to cost significantly more to buy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Meanwhile, print quality is excellent across the board, with text that wouldn’t disgrace an office laser printer and some of the best quality photo prints we’ve seen outside a specialist photo printer. Business graphics can be dark, with the ink saturating the paper, but nothing too disastrous, while printed illustrations look fantastic. With rock-solid wireless connectivity and a practical approach to paper handling, the only problem here is high running costs, but if you’re not printing large amounts of colour documents and photos, this is one of the best **printers** around. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for one of the most affordable multifunction **printers** around, the Canon Pixma TS3450 is a great option. Despite costing less than most basic **printers**, it comes with a flatbed scanner on the top for both scanning and copying duties. Print quality is great for the price, but you don’t get top-end features such as automatic duplex printing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note that a printer's input capacity tends to scale with its rated print volume, which manufacturers usually express as the number of pages the machine is good to print per month, or the "duty cycle." There are two kinds of monthly duty cycles, maximum (the absolute most pages a printer is rated to crank out before likely breaking down) and suggested (a much smaller, more reasonable target to avoid undue wear and tear). Some makers of cheap **printers** don't supply information on rated duty cycles, but it's info worth looking for if you can. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Pixma TS205 is one of the cheapest **printers** you can buy, and when you look at what it’s missing – no Wi-Fi, no scanner, no cloud or smartphone-friendly features – it’s really not hard to see why. All you get is a compact inkjet printer that connects via USB, printing black text pages at a slow-ish 7.5ppm, and pages with colour graphics at a painful 1.6ppm. To make things worse, it’s noisy while doing so. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nowadays, most **printers**, especially the cheap kind, come ready to connect to most handheld devices (smartphones and tablets) wirelessly. The standard wired interfaces for use with desktop and laptop computers are a USB port for connection to a single PC and an RJ-45 Ethernet jack for joining an office network. The latter is more of a business-centric protocol and is rare on low-cost **printers**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's important to note that you can find some very cheap **printers** nowadays—some under $50—at the bottom of most inkjet manufacturers' product lines. But it rarely makes sense to buy a slow printer with scanty features when you'll blow past its purchase price with its first set of replacement cartridges. It’s smarter to look for authoritative reviews that assess features and cost of ownership, like PC Labs' do. All of our picks below are informed by rigorous testing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A graphical control panel is handy, though. In addition to making walk-up functions (such as making **copies** or printing from cloud sites) easier, such panels let you specify security and other configuration changes, monitor and order supplies, and generate usage and other reports. You can also control, configure, and monitor most **printers** via an onboard web portal that you access from any browser, whether on a PC or phone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brother has performed a small miracle with the DCP-J1200W. Not only does it cost less than £100 to buy but you won’t get stung by replacement ink prices, either. Brother’s cartridges last for 750 pages, and cost 3p per page for mono and 6.2p per page for colour prints. This won’t worry even cheaper-to-run ink-tank **printers** but it’s an attractive price for an multifunction printer that’s so affordable to buy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So much for the inkjets; onward to Canon's lasers. Almost all of the Canon laser **printers** of interest for purposes of this overview are in either the imageClass or Color imageClass lines. As the names suggest, the difference between the two is that imageClass lasers are all mono **printers**, while Color imageClass models print in color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Almost all **printers** and MFPs can work over a USB connection to a single PC, but these days most can also connect to your wireless network. Office **printers** may have a wired Ethernet port. Whatever the method, a network connection lets you share a printer among multiple PCs or other devices in your home or office. Almost all network-capable **printers** now support direct printing from iOS (iPhone, iPad) and Android devices, or indirect printing via cloud services such as Google Cloud Print. Some **printers** additionally use NFC technology to help you connect a smart device – it’s most useful for visitors to an office environment who may not have access to the core network. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   MFPs have several advantages over a separate printer and scanner. They’re great if you’re short of space, and you can use them to make photo**copies** without your PC. You can usually scan and copy directly from the MFP’s control panel, although these interfaces vary in how easy they are to use. Our reviews tell you what a printer’s built-in control panel is like to use for basic tasks. If we don’t mention it, it’s fine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you need to go bigger with your photos than an A4 print, step up to the Expression Photo HD XP-15000. With a six-colour, 5,660 x 1,440dpi print system and Claria Photo HD prints, it’ll print sensationally sharp and detailed photos with perfect skin tones and precise shade control, along with high-contrast monochrome stills. Black text and colour graphics lack the punch you’d get from the best office **printers**, but none of them are going to give you such great photo prints – and particularly not at A3+ sizes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In general, the higher the resolution, the sharper the print, but other factors influence the final result. With inkjet **printers**, a smaller droplet size helps avoid grain – tiny dots of colour that might otherwise be visible in lighter areas of a graphic or photo. Some photo inkjets use extra colours to reduce grain further or to improve neutral shades or the colour range (gamut) in photos. Inkjets are quite sensitive to paper quality – you’ll get better documents if you avoid lightweight papers and dramatically better photos on coated photo paper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Canon also offers floor-standing, large-format **printers** for posters and signs, as well as production **printers** that wouldn't even fit into most home offices. But for this overview, we'll ignore those categories, focusing only the types of **printers** we usually review, and you're most likely interested in. We'll start with a selection of our favorite Canon **printers** for a variety of applications, based on our test-centered reviews, and follow that by sorting out the different Canon sub-brands, the related lines within those families, and the range of printer capabilities in each, to help you find the category or categories that fit your needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, that doesn’t mean the TS205 doesn’t have its plus points. It works perfectly well for basic, low-volume home printing and ink costs are lower than for some more expensive **printers**. Most importantly, print quality is surprisingly good, with bold, punchy graphics, crisp black text and even decent-looking photos – despite a slightly warm colour bias. It’s both capable and cheap as chips. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Display: It’s worth considering whether to choose a printer with a built-in screen. While that might sound excessive, it helps when connecting a printer to your wifi for the first time, and the chances of needing to reconnect the printer at a future point are strong, whether due to a change of your internet provider, if you suffer a power cut or you’re moving the printer to another home. Most brands have an app that can be helpful for the connection process, and for **printers** without a screen, it can be a crucial aid. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Preset ratio You can select one of the preset ratios to reduce or enlarge **copies**. Select the appropriate ratio for size of original and page size. The setting in Magnif.: 70% A4->A5/86% A4->B5/94% A4->LTR/115% B5->A4/141% A5->A4/156% 5x7->LTR/183% 4x6->LTR REFERENCE Some of the preset ratios are not available depending on the country or region of purchase. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   7. Specify the number of **copies** by using the + or - button. Change the print settings as necessary. -> Refer to [Setting Items] within this webpage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There's only one Ivy standalone printer model at this writing, but Canon also offers Ivy Cliq+2 Instant camera **printers**, which are the photographic equivalent of AIOs that happen to have a camera instead of a scanner. You can connect to them by Bluetooth to print from your phone, or take a picture with the camera and print it (which is basically what a copier does). Note that Canon also has Ivy Cliq cameras (without the "+2" in the name); these do not offer Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, and cannot print from a phone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both lines include single-function **printers** as well as three- and four-function multifunction **printers** (MFPs)—a term that is essentially interchangeable with "AIO," but more common when talking about lasers. Somewhat unusually, Canon includes "All-in-One" as part of the name for most of its four-function lasers, and "multifunction" in the name of most of its three-function lasers, which can help you spot which are which, when you're looking through a list. However, the naming convention isn't consistent, so be sure to check the specs, as well. And note that Canon doesn't make the same distinction for its inkjets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Today, even as the pandemic seems to be (fingers crossed) winding down, venturing out to Kinko's or Staples to make prints and **copies** doesn't have the appeal it once did. Even part-time home-based workers, not to mention families and students, need to print, scan, and make **copies**, and maybe even send the occasional fax. And while co-workers in a corporate office might share the same high-volume printer, smaller settings and smaller budgets call for diverse desktop **printers**. We've collected our under-$200 favorites from recent reviews. Check them out, then keep reading to learn what to look for as you shop for your next affordable printer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Each family or home office has its own unique needs in terms of print and copy volume. Since we're focusing on cheap single-function and AIO **printers** here, this article assumes you won't be printing or copying more than a couple of hundred pages per month. For most families and homebound office workers, this is plenty, although demand is rising as we're seeing more printing from home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We scrutinized all of the **printers** PC Labs has tested in the last few years that are still on the market, focusing on lasers, home office or business models (both laser and inkjet), and photo-centric models (all inkjets). Usually, you'll see significant differences between machines tweaked for office use and for photo printing. Low-cost office inkjets, for example, often include automatic document feeders while their photo-centric counterparts don't. Meanwhile, photo-minded inkjets by definition do better with photos, with some higher-priced models employing five or six ink cartridges instead of the standard four process colors (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black, collectively known as CMYK). By contrast, the cheapest inkjets sometimes use old-school dual-cartridge (black and tricolor) designs, which work fine but are more wasteful as you must throw away the color cartridge as soon as one of its three hues runs dry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At first glance, Canon seems to have just two inkjet lines: Pixma and Maxify, with no obvious difference between them. All the Maxify **printers** are tank-based, but so are some Pixma models. And the Pixma **printers** (unlike the Maxify models) cover a wide range of features and capabilities, with some suitable for only light-duty home use, some designed for much heavier-duty use in a small or home office, and some that can serve nicely for both home and home office - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Canon's Maxify line is similar to the Pixma G MegaTank line. They both share a tank-based design that translates to having a high initial price and a low running cost, thanks to inexpensive ink. Here again, the ink comes in bottles, so you can pour it into tanks in the printer. They also share essentially the same capability as the Pixma G **printers**, making either one appropriate for the range from home office to small office. So, if you're considering one category, you'll also want to look at the other. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To use the touch screen keypad to enter the number of **copies**, touch the quantity, then touch the numbers required. To amend the number of **copies** entered, touch the X button. Touch Confirm (checkmark). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   : The 9 most commonly used reduce/enlarge percentages have been provided as preset options. These preset options can be customized by your System or Printer Administrator to meet individual needs. Auto Fit : Reduces or enlarges the image on the **copies** based on the size of the original and the size of the selected output paper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of today's lower-end machines come with Wi-Fi and USB connectivity. Ethernet, if you can find it, is the fastest and most secure option; Wi-Fi, which is more or less today's standard, is highly convenient and plenty fast enough for most uses. Most modern **printers** also provide free downloadable apps for iOS and Android phones. What you get doesn't always correspond to the printer price, so check the individual details of any model you are looking at with care. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both the imageClass and the Color imageClass families include models suitable for the range from home office to small-to-medium-size office. Within either line, single-function **printers** include an "LBP" before the model number. Most multifunction models use an "MF" designation before the number, though some use a "D" instead. Letters added after the model number include "d" (for duplex, or two-sided printing), "w" (for Wi-Fi), "n" (for Ethernet), and "C" (for color). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At one time, laser **printers** were considered faster, more reliable, and less expensive to use and were lauded for better output quality than inkjet machines. A surprising number of people still spout these traditional wisdoms, but they're decidedly unwise nowadays. Lasers may still have an edge for super-sharp text on plain paper (and color lasers do surprisingly well with charts and graphs), but inkjets are superior for photo prints and have made huge strides in print quality and speed. We bust some myths and break down pros and cons in our inkjet versus laser comparison. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Given all the printer choices Canon offers, it helps to start your search by selecting which printer lines to focus on. In addition to our descriptions of those lines here, we've included our favorite Canon **printers** for a range of use cases, based on our tests and overall evaluations. For other choices—from both Canon and others—take a look at our picks for best **printers** overall. For more focused picks, also check out our guides to the best photo **printers**, business **printers**, wide-format **printers**, and cheap **printers**. If you're solidly in the Canon camp, though, we've laid out the specs for our top Canon picks below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Pixma MG, TS and TR models are all cartridge-based, which means they have a low initial price for their capabilities but a relatively high running cost. For those who print few enough pages over a printer's lifetime, they can cost less in the long run than equivalent tank-based **printers** that offer a low running cost, but a high initial price. The three lines offer ascending levels of capability for home use, but they also overlap in price and capability. So, depending on the printer you need, you may or may not want to look at more than one of the categories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Connectivity: While most **printers** can connect to your laptop or desktop computer using a supplied USB cable, you’ll want to consider if the model also has any additional options. Most models pair to your computer via your wifi or link up wirelessly and let you send documents or photos from a smartphone app. Apple’s approach is called , and a popular option for Android is known as Mopria. Manufacturers usually have their own app for setup and sending documents from your smartphone or tablet, such as the Canon Print app or Brother iPrint and Scan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes all you need is a device that prints, and paying extra for a bigger device with imaging features you don't need doesn't make sense. That said, most home offices will benefit from at least occasional copying and scanning, and therefore choose an AIO. Even if you don't make a lot of **copies**, if one of the reasons for buying a printer is reducing your family's need to run local errands, spending a little extra for a part-time copier makes sense. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ratio specified copy You can specify the copy ratio as a percentage to reduce or enlarge **copies**. button to specify the magnification. If you select other than Fit to page and press the right Function button, Magnification screen is displayed. Use thebutton to specify the magnification. REFERENCE 400% MAX (maximum copy ratio) and 25% MIN (minimum copy ratio) are selectable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You're probably familiar with Canon **printers** , but you may not appreciate the full range they cover. Canon offers inkjets aimed at every level, from inexpensive models that cost less than most laser **printers**' toner cartridges, to pricey choices that deliver output suitable for gallery-grade prints. The imaging giant also has a wide range of mono and color lasers for everything from home offices to enterprise-level printing, which won't surprise anyone who knows that Canon's laser engines were in all the early desktop laser **printers**, regardless of manufacturer. And other Canon **printers** fill smaller niches, including portable **printers** using Zink technology for printing photos from your phone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   • The repairing parts for **printers** will be available five years after production is discontinued. Depending on your model, we may ask you to replace it with a new one, or one with almost the same performance as a maintenance service. In this case, it may be that you cannot use supplies or accessories for your model or the compatible OS will be changed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
