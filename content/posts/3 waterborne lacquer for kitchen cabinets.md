## 3 Tips to Waterborne Lacquer For Kitchen Cabinets | Painting Cabinets?  Why We Love Lacquer
-   We’ve all seen painted **cabinets** that have visible brushstrokes, and it cheapens the whole look. Lacquer lays down perfectly when it’s sprayed, and melts into a truly furniture-quality finish that will make your **cabinets** seems like you bought them that way, rather than taking the design low-road. And nothing feels quite like the silky-smoothness of **lacquer**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sure, but honestly, I recommend using colored **lacquer** rather than traditional paint, for all the reasons stated above. Oil-based paint used to be the standard for painting **cabinets**, but it takes too long to dry, off-gasses in your home for what feels like forever, and (worst of all) light colors will turn yellow over time. We use traditional paint mainly when we’re going to apply a decorative glaze or antiqued finish on top, or for a few other specialty considerations – otherwise, **lacquer** wins, hands down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So then you think to hire a professional to do this tedious work. The key word is “tedious.” The pro knows what he’s in for and will charge accordingly. Unless you’ve got access to some minions who will work for pennies a day stripping those **cabinets**, then it’s time to look for more practical alternatives. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
