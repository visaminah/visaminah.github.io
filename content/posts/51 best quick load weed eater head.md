-   Adding to its list of features is its wide 12-inch cutting swath and 0.065-inch line diameter.

-   With a bump feed weed **eater**, when you press the **head** of your trimmer against a flat surface, it squeezes a spring in the **head** of the string trimmer.

-   In most cases, battery-powered string trimmers can run under nickel-cadmium or lithium-ion batteries. The latter has a higher power holding capacity than the nickel-cadmium batteries.

-   Whether you decide to go with the automatic feed or bump feed electric weed **eater** essentially comes down to your personal preference. For a less attentive weed trimming experience, the automatic feed option is ideal, but will likely cost more and could break. If you're happy to bump your way along the garden, it will be the cheaper option, but wear and tear could eventually prove a problem. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
