The matching has the effect of spreading the intrinsic qualities of the **wood** throughout the whole surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First determine the kind of **wood** you’re working with, for example, soft**wood** more often than not has uneven grain and hence the use of a darker die is advisable in order to pop out the fibers and give it an even base. Soft **wood** is understandably more delicate and hence complex to work with, when using **walnut** **wood** stain this should not be a problem at all. Hard**wood** on the other, hand is mostly even, neat and has a finer grain allowing you a wider range of **walnut** **wood** grain. This means that whatever shade of **walnut** **wood** grain you decide to use will come put perfectly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Walnut is among the most long-lasting **wood**en materials on the marketplace, with higher resistance to degradation than other **wood** species. They have excellent durability and strength meaning they can have a long lifespan. A high-quality **walnut** cabinet will last for many years before it needs to be replaced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While purple has long had a reputation for difficulty, many designers have recently found that it can make for unusually chic interiors. Warm-toned **wood**s will be best served by dark plums or luscious eggplants, while silvery purples and pale lavenders make cooler-toned **wood**s pop. Use a milky, misty purple with unvarnished oak trim, and blackish purple with mahogany. Dull wine purples work well with ebony, while lapis lazulis match better with cherry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of all the North American species, black **walnut** (Juglans nigra) is probably the species that would receive the title of "elegant." It has an aura of being expensive, while yet being very serviceable for furniture, millwork, cabinetry and flooring. Oftentimes, thicker (8/4 and 10/4 thicknesses), defect-free pieces (8 inches and wider) of **walnut** demand extremely high prices. Note that the NHLA grading rules for **walnut** are different than for all other Eastern hard**wood**s. The grading system is based on small clear areas rather than the large areas commonly used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Eastern black **walnut** trees reach maturity at about 150-years-old. At this age, some are as tall as 150 feet, with diameters reaching 8 feet. Their root systems are also quite immense and give off a chemical which can prevent the growth of vegetation around them for as much as 50 feet from the trunk. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Walnut may appear in other areas, though it is far less abundant. This is, in part, due to its sensitivities to soil conditions. In order for Black Walnut trees to thrive, they require well-drained, nearly neutral soils that are moist and fertile. The growth of Walnut hard**wood**s is also hindered by damaging agents such as insect attacks, tree disease- including root rot and mold-and frost. While it has various challenges with thriving in forestlands, Walnut **wood** has the biological advantage of being allelopathic, which means it can release chemicals from its roots and tissue to damage other organisms, which gives it a competitive advantage and fighting chance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once dried, **walnut** is extremely stable, although like all **wood** species, it will swell with gain of moisture and shrink with loss. Walnut’s shrinkage and swelling rate is lower than many other North American species, however. Further, due to its inherent straight grain, warping when the moisture changes is rare. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Walnut grain is typically extremely straight and is quite uniform; annual growth rings are not obvious. However, grain deviations do occur from time to time, especially in **walnut** burls, that lead to swirls, ribbon stripes, and other beautiful grain patterns. Such grain deviations in lumber will attract higher prices, especially in retail markets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also known as California Black **walnut**, claro **walnut** **wood** is most closely related to Black **walnut** **wood**. It is generally found in California and Oregon. The trees are usually 9 – 18m tall and 1 – 1.5m wide. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark reds can give **wood**-trimmed rooms a Victorian feel. Use wine reds with **walnut**, maple, ebony and mahogany to produce rich effects. Cranberry or blood red tones can match slightly lighter **wood** hues. Beware of choosing deep reds that match too closely with any reddish tones present in your **wood**, as this will make your **wood**work fade blandly into the background. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are different types of Walnut **wood** that comes from Walnut trees that grow all over the world. Walnut **wood** belongs to the Juglandaceae family of plants, a genus comprised of 21 species. Walnut tree characteristics range from heights of 30 ft to 130 ft and their leaves differ in size. Walnut **wood** used in **wood**working projects is one of the most common due to its dark coloring. There are several types of Walnut **wood**, including: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   American black **walnut** **wood** is dark, hard, dense and tight-grained. It’s prized by **wood**workers for its strength, grain and color. It polishes to a very smooth finish, and the color ranges from creamy white in the sap**wood** to a dark chocolate in the heart**wood**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While some will use stain on **walnut** **wood**, which will make it maintain the darker hue indefinitely, it is typically clear-coated or oiled. A clear coat doesn’t stop the color change altogether, but it can minimize it if maintenance is performed regularly. On the other hand, an oil-finished piece needs to be oiled regularly, which will give it richer hues over time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the Janka Hardness Scale, the Walnut hard**wood** species rating is dependent on Walnut type. Black Walnut hardness is ranked at 1,010 lbf, while the exotic Brazilian Walnut hardness is ranked at 3,684 lbf. While this may appear to be a large difference in overall strength, when comparing it to the 22 lbf strength of Balsa **wood**, a soft**wood** tree species, we can see that Walnut species overall rank high in terms of hardness against others. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Consciously or not, we register **wood** grain just as much as color. Generally, large **wood** grains suggest a more casual, rustic look. Fine **wood** grains are more formal. While mixing **wood** grains can keep a room from feeling too contrived, tune in to the mood of the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Depending on the type of the **wood** and the method used to dry it, the color and sturdiness of **walnut** **wood** can vary drastically. Generally, lumber that is kiln dried to speed up the drying process is flat brown in color. On the other hand, if **walnut** **wood** is allowed to air dry, it results in dark purple color which works to increase the overall visual appeal and effectively adds an X-factor to the **wood**en items when used for decorative purposes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For those who want to purchase authentic **walnut** **wood** furniture made by expert craftsmen and topped off with a lifetime quality guarantee, Vermont Woods Studios is the place to shop.

It can withstand sanding and re-finishing better than its veneered equivalents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hard**wood** species are classified by the seeds the tree produces. Each hard**wood** tree species has a coating that takes the shape of a fruit or a shell that becomes a flowering plant. These flowering seeds are known as angiosperm, which translates in Greek to “vessel seed.” Additionally, hard**wood** trees lose and regrow their leaves annually, making them deciduous. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The color of **walnut** is often dark. Nevertheless, certain **walnut**s have brighter tones, particularly if they are very young. Indeed, for **walnut** kitchen cabinets, a light hue might also be an appealing option. Every moment you enjoy your time in the kitchen, this light color will create a vibrant and enjoyable mood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moreover, stains tend to wash out the grain, removing bits of character. For this reason, a natural **walnut** **wood** product is rarely stained. Instead, **walnut** furniture tends to get a clear coat finish; either of some type of varnish, wax, oil, or lacquer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black **walnut** **wood** is obtained from trees that are widely distributed in the eastern United States. They can grow up to 37 m in length. However, the trunk diameter is only about 0.6 to 1m thick. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Pieces with an oil finish generally do best if a natural Danish linseed oil is applied at least once per year, though those in warmer climates may need to do this more often. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When purchasing **walnut** cabinets, it is critical to determine if you are purchasing genuine (solid) **walnut** **wood** or a **walnut** veneer. Whenever you purchase from a huge home improvement store or merely a larger manufacturer, in particular, you are not always expecting to receive solid **walnut** cabinets. Rather, you will receive a veneer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The good news is that Black **walnut** **wood** is abundantly available. The price is still high for domestic **wood** but it is generally more affordable. Taking advantage of the relatively low price, a lot of people use it for building cabinets, interior panels, furniture, and even novelty items. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Those who are worried about durability of **wood** may also use the term “hardness,” though this refers to the Janka hardness test. During this test, a steel ball is placed on a block of **wood** and force is applied until the ball is embedded halfway. The force is measured in pounds-force (lbf) or represented as a number followed by the word “Janka.” Wood types may receive a rating based on their “side hardness” which involves a test run perpendicular to the grain, or may be tested on their “end hardness.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
