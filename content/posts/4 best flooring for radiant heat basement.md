-   Conventional forced-air heat will warm your **basement** up quickly, usually in an hour or less, but then the temperature will quickly drop when the furnace turns off. After a short time, the furnace kicks back on (using more energy). This cycle continues all day long: hot-warm-cold, hot-warm-cold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Conventional forced-air systems can do a good job drying out your damp **basement** and reducing mildew and mold spores. However, forced-air heat also stirs up dust and other airborne irritants. And if you don’t keep your ducts clean, you can introduce dust mites and other nasties into your living environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

In fact, your **basement** can be one of the coziest parts of your house. And the cost to finish a **basement** is often far less than adding square-footage above ground. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
