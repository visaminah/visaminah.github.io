## 138 Unexpected Facts About What Plants Do Flies Eat | What Do Flies Like
-   Adult fungus gnats do not damage **plants** but they can cause annoyance when they are flying around indoors. The larvae feed mainly on dead roots and other decaying plant material and associated fungal growth. Some species of fungus gnats may also feed on soft plant growth, such as seedling roots and the base of soft cuttings. Established **plants** are unlikely to be damaged by fungus gnat larvae. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Scientifically proven and tested, marigold **plants** are known to keep many types of pests out of the yard, especially **flies**. Marigold flowers can be utilized to produce an insect repellent spray that you can use in fly-infested areas. You can also grow them in pots or containers and placing them in a certain area to ward off **flies**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This plant is one of the most common **plants** repel **flies** naturally in the United States. These trees have long, sticky foliage that traps **flies** and other bugs. The sticky foliage also makes it hard for certain insects to lay their eggs on the tree. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you find the place they are laying eggs, try to eliminate all the garbage bags, stagnant water, and stinky spots. Sealing these will help you keep the **flies** outside your house. Keeping your wheelie bins should help too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Perhaps the best known of the insectivorous (insect-eating) **plants**, the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) exhibits a unique system by which it attracts, kills, digests and absorbs its prey. Because it is a plant and can make its own food through photosynthesis, the Venus flytrap does not eat and digest its prey for the traditional nonplant objectives of harvesting energy and carbon. Instead, it mines its prey primarily for essential nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous in particular) that are in short supply in its boggy, acidic habitat. So, yes, the Venus flytrap does have a digestive system of sorts, but it serves a somewhat different purpose than an animals does. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Flies can make a five-course out of your indoor garden. White**flies** usually infest on leaves. Depending on their types, they can suck nutrition from your **plants**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Basil comes in many varieties, with many unique scents such as licorice, cinnamon, and lemon. Any of these varieties will work to ward off **flies**, even for mosquitoes and spiders. Plus, the best thing is that you can use fresh basil leaves in your cooking too! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is one of the most effective **plants** out there for repelling **flies** away. Venus fly trap plant traps **flies** using its sticky foliage, which use the fly’s own digestive juices to eliminate and consume the insect. This process helps other bugs aside from **flies**, like mosquitoes, repelled. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Furthermore, if you don’t have a green thumb, mint is absolutely the go-to. Mint is very easy to grow and spreads fast that it has a tendency to become invasive if not controlled. Ideally, you’d want to keep mint **plants** inside a container or pot to monitor their growth. You can grow them indoors if you have a well-ventilated and bright windowsill. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But what really repels **flies** is the tree’s scent. In fact, the fragrance of bay trees has been used as a natural insect repellent for hundreds of years. The pungent odor can ward off **flies** and other bugs such as spiders, cockroaches, and more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The scent of eucalyptus is very strong that it can overwhelm the sense of smell of **flies**. Moreover, eucalyptus foliage releases oil as it grows which aids to clean the air and get rid of contaminants. Together, these effects make eucalyptus one of the most powerful **plants** that repel **flies** naturally. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This plant is famous for having strong fly-repelling properties. Marigolds contain natural chemical compounds that make them poisonous to **flies** and other tiny bugs. They also produce odor that wards off **flies** from landing. Moreover, marigolds are great at absorbing light energy and emitting it as a heat, which can also repel **flies** and other insects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After a temporary halt thanks to Covid-19, Finch plans to return to Manbulloo later this year to find out if the latrine **flies** live up to expectation. “They might just stick around the carrion all day, distracted by the disgusting smells,” he says. If they do venture through the orchard, he’ll monitor how many actually visit flowers and how often. The next test is whether the **flies** deliver pollen where it’s needed — on the stigmas of flowers that need fertilizing — a job that requires a microscope and plenty of patience. After all that, if the oriental latrine fly is still a contender, then it’s time to find out if its efforts pay off by releasing **flies** among trees protected from all other insects and measuring their success in mangoes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lantern **flies** are a complex problem. The scary part about lantern**flies** is that they can feed over 70 different plant species. Unfortunately, it prefers **plants** that have vital economic importance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adult **flies** feed on flowers. They eat nectar and honeydew. Different types of **flies** are attracted to different flowers. They invest in **plants** or decaying materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of the over 110,000 known fly species have no teeth, so they cannot chew solid food. Their mouthparts are like a spongy straw. Once they land on your food, they need to release digestive juices to liquefy it into a predigested, slurpable soup they can swallow. In short, some **flies** are on a liquid diet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, a few rosemary springs placed around your house are an excellent way to keep small and large **flies** away during family entertaining or gatherings. If your kitchen is the issue, try growing a whole plant on your windowsill indoors. As long as there’s low humidity and enough direct sunlight, you should have no problem growing this plant indoors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because of its natural repellent properties and versatility, marigolds are considered one of the greatest companion **plants** in any vegetable garden. These **plants**’ cheerful orange blooms are bound to put a smile on anyone’s face. But above all, marigolds can be used as an edible garnish for desserts and salads. But again, marigold truly shines as a powerful plant that repel **flies** naturally. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rosemary is also one of those powerful **plants** that repel **flies** naturally. In fact, it is a member of the mint family and has been utilized traditionally to repel **flies** and other pesky insects. Rosemary contains terpenes, which are chemical compounds that give the plant its distinct scent. These chemical compounds make an effective repellent for **flies**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Phorid fly pupae do not feed. An interesting and perhaps very important management technique under investigation involves adult phorid fly females in the genus Pseudacteon. These female **flies** are known to deposit their eggs in the thorax of fire ants. When the fly’s egg stage is complete, larval phorid **flies** move to the head of the fire ant and begin feeding on the tissues in the ant’s head. After completely consuming the ant’s brain, the ant becomes a “zombie” and wanders about purposelessly until its head falls off and the fly pupates in the separated head, soon after developing into a mature adult fly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Flies have approximately 8,000 lenses in each eye, which gives them great vision. However, stray light rays play havoc with those lenses, which you can use to your advantage by hanging bags of water around your outdoor party. The light reflections may well keep **flies** away! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some **flies** have medical uses, too. For example, doctors use blow fly maggots – the young, immature form of **flies** – to remove decomposing tissue in wounds. The maggots release antiviral and antimicrobial juices, and these have helped scientists create new treatments for infections. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Scientifically known as tropaeolum majus, Nasturtium is a flowering plant that is indigenous to the North Africa and Mediterranean region. The seeds, flowers, and foliage are all used in traditional medicine. But aside from that, Nasturtium has also been used to repel **flies** for many centuries now. This plant is easy to grow as it is drought-tolerant and can be cultivated in small areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That’s beginning to change. Scattered studies have logged how often **flies** visit flowers, counted the pollen grains stuck to their bodies and recorded crop yields, and found that some **flies** give bees a run for their money — and in some cases, outdo them. Researchers studying avocados in Mexico, for instance, found that the large green blowfly Chrysomya megacephala (aka the oriental latrine fly) visited more flowers in a given time than bees and carried pollen grains on parts of the body that would contact the stigma of the next avocado flower it visited. Studies in Israel, Malaysia and India all suggest that blow**flies** are effective at pollinating mangoes, while trials in the US and New Zealand showed that the European blue blowfly (Calliphora vicina) produced as good a yield of leek and carrot seed as bees. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your house is clean on the inside, but you can still see a swirling cloud of **flies** in your garden or around your patio? Yep. It’s a common issue and here’s why: **flies** love laying their eggs in moist surfaces. Though you can’t see them during the rainy season, it’s only because the larvae are just babies and are not yet ready to fly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Where there is a carcass of a dead animal, you will always find bottle **flies**. In addition to eating, they will dig into the carcass and lay eggs, giving rise to more and more **flies**. Adult blow **flies** also feed on feces, garbage, and fresh meat. Cluster **flies**: A cluster fly generally consumes plant juices like flower nectar. If it can’t find these, it will eat decomposing organic matter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Specifically, you would want to avoid maggots. Maggots are fly larvae. Although **flies** don’t live long, they reproduce in large numbers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Animals are responsible for pollinating around 76 percent of crop **plants**, including a large number of globally important ones. Birds, bats and other small mammals do their bit, but insects do much more — pollinating flowers of many fruits, vegetables and nuts, from almonds to avocados, mangoes and melons, cocoa and coconuts, as well as crops grown to provide seed for future vegetable harvests. In a recent analysis for the Annual Review of Entomology, Australia-based biologist Romina Rader and colleagues from Australia, New Zealand and the US calculated that the world’s 105 most widely planted food crops that benefit from insect pollination are worth some $800 billion a year. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bagging prevents fruit **flies** from laying eggs on the fruits. In addition, the bag provides physical protection from mechanical injuries (scars and scratches). Although laborious, it is cheap, safe, and gives a more reliable estimate of the projected harvest. Bagging not only protects fruit from fruit fly damage but protect the fruit from physical damage improving the market appearance of fruits. However, it is only practicable on small trees. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Build a simple trap to lure and capture **flies** and other unwanted bugs. All you need is a plastic wrap, a plastic container, and bait. Your fly bait can be any foods that **flies** enjoy such as ripe fruit, vinegar, or meat. Set up the trap somewhere in a corner to draw and imprison the **flies**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tansy doesn’t only ward off **flies** but it will also give you beautiful clusters of yellow flowers that will surely brighten up your house. Compared to most aromatic **plants** out there, it is the flowers that produce the fragrance instead of the leaves. So, you should really give it proper care for the plant to bloom indoors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because mint contains a chemical compound called menthol, it is an effective plant that repels **flies** naturally. Menthol irritates the noses and eyes of **flies** and even other bugs, which make them unable to smell or see. This ultimately impedes their ability to mate, leading to lower fly populations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Have you seen little bugs fluttering up from your house**plants**' pots whenever you water? Known as fungus gnats, they're actually tiny **flies**, about 1/8-inch long, drawn to moist potting soil and decaying leaves on the surface of the soil around your **plants**. If you spot one up close, you'll notice that they look a little like tiny mosquitoes, but they don't bite. Fungus gnats also don't cause much harm to **plants**, but they can be annoying to have around. Luckily, there are ways you can make your house**plants** less welcoming for them in the first place. And if they've already moved in, there are methods you can try to get rid of fungus gnats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Aside from **flies**, chrysanthemums also repel spider mites, fleas, ticks, aphids, and roaches, which makes these **plants** good companion **plants**. This is also the reason why you normally find it as an ingredient in many aerosol bombs, indoor spray, and pet shampoos. All you need to do is put this plant in a sunny spot in a container with well-draining but nutrient-dense potting soil mix and let it do the work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The larvae feed on organic matter (food leftovers are their favourite dish!) so it’s very important to keep your outdoor bins in a dry area and your garden waste dry. Disinfect your bins with a good disinfectant such as Domex. Cleanse the outdoor area with camphor fumes or light up citronella candles which deter **flies**. Never leave a lit candle unattended for safety. Get yourself a selection of **plants** that keep **flies** away - place them inside and outside your home, focusing on doors and windows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As a leafy plant, basil also comes with various uses around the home, especially in the kitchen. Its oils produce a powerful earthy scent that wards off insects, including **flies**. The easiest way to make use of basil’s fly repellent properties is to keep an entire pot of basil in your kitchen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is difficult to think of anyone who doesn’t like the smell of mint. This herb is fresh, tasty, and the different types of mint each come in slightly different tastes to delight our senses. That’s why, as much as people love the bring and strong scent of mint, **flies** and other bugs definitely hate it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By far one of my favorite **plants**, lavender thrives in well-drained, hot, and sunny climates. Both the foliage and blooms are fragrant and fend off many types of insects, **flies** included. During flower bloom, harvesting of the flowers for drying results in bundled, rich-smelling sachets to place in closets, drawers, and cupboards to keep creepy crawlies away. Plus, it makes your clothes smell great! On top of that, if you’re concerned about beneficial insects and how they support your garden, you need some lavender to provide food for all those benefits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Butterworts thrive in well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. Unlike other carnivorous **plants**, your potting soil should be a mix of ¼ peat and ¾ sand or lava rock. Also, make sure that they don’t get too wet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can make your own simple fly trap to help keep **flies** away from food at an outdoor party. Pour a little bit of wine into a glass jar, cover with plastic wrap, and poke a few holes in the top. The **flies** can get in but they can’t get out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While most fly eating plant won’t survive indoors, some can work perfectly as house**plants**. Given the right conditions and care, fly-eating **plants** won’t just serve as interesting decor. They can also lessen or rid your house of rogue **flies**, bugs, gnats, and other insects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a plant that is well-known to help keep **flies** away. Tansy possesses a pungent scent that wards off insects and discourages them from living or landing on the plant. Moreover, tansy can be utilized as a natural pesticide to eliminate flying insects not just **flies**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When asked to describe insect species that can pollinate flowers, most people think of bees, butter**flies**, moths, and hummingbirds. However, **flies** are critical pollinators in both natural and agricultural systems. A recent analysis of crop species found that **flies** visited 72% of the 105 crops studied (bees visited 93%). In some cases, **flies** can provide more consistent pollination in early spring than bees, likely because they are often active at cooler temperatures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If drying out the soil doesn't help, it might be time to try a product such as BioCare Gnat Stix Traps ($10, Amazon), which are sticky yellow traps. Place one sticky paper near your **plants** to trap the adults and reduce the number of eggs the fungus gnats lay. Be careful not to touch the plant leaves with the trap. Check them every few days and replace them with new traps when they become covered with gnats. Eventually, you'll eliminate all the gnats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While there are over 200 species of Sundews, most have tentacles or orange hair-like filaments with sticky tips. These tips are what both trap and digest insects. Once it traps its prey, a Sundew’s arms fold in on themselves, suffocating insects until the digestion is complete. They prefer mosquitoes, but spiders, crickets, ants, and **flies** will also satisfy them. You can feed them every two or three weeks if they don’t manage to catch prey by themselves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Distilled water or rainwater work best for fly eating **plants**. Don’t use tap and spring water which contain too many minerals that will be detrimental to their health. In fact, avoid any water that contains minerals. While distilled water can be bought at the grocery store, avoid bottled drinking water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you can’t find a sunny place for your fly eating plant indoors, artificial light can be an alternative. Fluorescent tubes specifically designed for **plants** work better than plain light bulbs. Set the timer for 12 to 14 hours. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   House **flies** do not eat **flies**. Adult house **flies** usually feed on decaying materials and harvest their eggs on them. Decaying organic material includes rotten fruits, vegetables, meat, and plant secretion. Male **flies** and female **flies** both tend to suck nectar from flowers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   They can be used with either specific attractants such as methyl eugenol or food baits such as protein hydrolysates or yeast or a peace of fruit (banana, mango). Also vinegar is a very good attractant. (Methyl eugenol attracts males of Bactrocera species and of a few Dacus species). Food baits attract both males and female fruit **flies**, they are not species specific, and also attract other insects, including natural enemies. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Avoid feeding your fly eating plant with cheese or raw meat. Keep in mind that they’re still flowers, so large pieces will kill the traps. Additionally, avoid overfeeding your **plants**. Instead, give them access to their natural prey. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Venus flytrap occurs in a very restricted range in sandy shrub-bogs in coastal North and South Carolina, where it is listed as an endangered species. The ecosystem that supports Venus flytraps experiences frequent fires that clear out competing **plants** and volatilize nitrogen in the soil. Hence, Venus flytraps have a corner on the nitrogen market immediately following fire, when they obtain three quarters of their nitrogen supply from insect prey. If fire does not reoccur within 10 years, however, competition with other **plants** restricts the Venus flytraps access to light and insects, and populations begin to decline. Venus flytraps provide a fascinating example of how organisms adapt to stressful conditions, in this case behaving as predators to make up for the nutrient deficiencies in the surrounding soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The boggy, wet areas to which fly eating plant are native have extremely poor soil. As a result, they have evolved to get nutrients from other sources. Bugs, some small frogs, and mammals are just some creatures from which fly-eating **plants** get their protein. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Crane **flies** are harmful to **plants**. The larvae of the crane **flies** tend to eat the roots of vegetables and other **plants**. And this continues till they are in their adulthood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pyrethrum To control fruit**flies**, a spray with a pyrethrum solution can be used. It will kill bees if they are sprayed directly, but it does not leave poisonous residues. The best time to use it is in the evenings (after 6 pm) most of the bees are back in their hives. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Promise is one thing, practical application another. In Australia, researchers like Finch and Rader are working on a five-year, multi-institution project that, among other things, aims to match fly to crop, and then develop the best method of rearing them. At farms across the country, teams are putting candidate **flies** through their paces on crops as varied as mangoes and avocados, blueberries and vegetable seed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike the first two fly-eating **plants**, Butterworts are the least suspicious-looking carnivorous plant. They are small, growing between 1 and 6 inches, and have soft yellow-greenish leaves. During spring, they bear flowers that resemble orchids. These come in a variety of shades, such as pink, purple, yellow, and white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You need to crush a few of the lemon thyme’s leaves if you want to release the citrus scent to repel **flies**, and don’t worry because the smell lingers for many hours. You will get lime green and dark leaves on slender stalks and small, oval foliage with this plant, and it does very good both outdoors and indoors. As a bonus, the plant will thrive throughout the year under proper plant care. The best part is you can use lemon thyme in your cooking! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Flies are amazingly diverse and near ubiquitous, living in just about every sort of habitat. Hundreds of species belonging to dozens of families have been reported visiting one or more crops, but two fly families stand out: hover**flies** and blow**flies**. Rader’s analysis showed that hover**flies** visit at least 52 percent of the crops studied and blow**flies** some 30 percent. Some species visit many different crops around the world: One hoverfly, the common drone fly (Eristalis tenax), has been recorded visiting 28 of Rader’s 105 crops, while the marmalade hoverfly (Episyrphus balteatus) is close behind with 24, and the bluebottle Calliphora vicina (a blowfly), visits 8. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But how to harness **flies** to maintain — and boost — food production? One way is to attract more of them to fields and orchards. Schemes that encourage farmers to plant wildflowers, keep remnant native vegetation and leave grasslands uncut can be very effective at increasing the number and diversity of insects and expanding the pool of potential pollinators. Hover**flies** and blow**flies** need a few extras if they are to proliferate, though: carrion for blow**flies**, access to aphids for some hover**flies** and ponds or streams containing dung, decaying vegetation or carcasses for others. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many **plants** to keep flying away, and below I provide you with a healthy list of natural fly repellants. Combined with other proactive attempts to eradicate your fly problem (keeping animal feces picked up, covering your compost pile, and dusting damp areas with lime or diatomaceous earth to name a few), some **plants** repel **flies**. These can be some of the best fly repellants to have in your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All marigolds require warmth and a lot of sunlight to thrive. Of course, you also need to keep them well watered to make them happy. Marigolds make great potted **plants** but thrive best outside rather than indoors because of their high lighting needs in order to produce flowers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Basil is considered an annual, although it can reseed itself in warmer climates if allowed to bloom. These inexpensive **plants** can be purchased each spring from local garden centers, and seeds can be easily cultivated indoors and transplanted outside after the last frost. Basil also makes a good choice for indoor herb gardens and can be kept alive year-round. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just keep in mind that keeping **plants** under glass terrariums also means that they can heat up very easily, so keep them out of bright direct sun, especially during peak hours. Also, the soil requires it to be much more acidic compared to the usual potting mix. In fact, most venus fly traps that are grown indoors are planted in a potting soil mix that is mostly peat moss. Try to use distilled water to keep the growing medium from losing its acidic trait. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To keep insects from landing on your food, you should always cover it. If your house is infested with **flies**, you can use simple traps to get rid of them. Carnivorous **plants** can also eat the **flies** and help control their population. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blow**flies** are drawn to the smell of rotting flesh because they mate and lay their eggs on corpses and carcasses. They also forage among flowers to fill up on energy-boosting nectar and protein-rich pollen, transporting pollen from one flower to another in the process. So it seems fair to assume that extra **flies** will pollinate more flowers and the trees will bear more fruit. But do they? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Flies do not eat **plants**. But certain kinds of **flies** can and do eat **plants**. They are more active during sunny and warm days. Flies mainly feed on plant leaves, fruit surfaces, honeydew, and other parts. Flies also tend to feed on decaying materials and rotten food. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Understanding **flies**’ diet is a great way to prevent an infestation. In this post, we tell you what **flies** eat and why having them in your home is dangerous, and give you tips that can help you get rid of these bothersome buzzers in your home and the surroundings. Read on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A cluster fly generally consumes plant juices like flower nectar. If it can’t find these, it will eat decomposing organic matter. Horse**flies**: While all horse **flies**’ main source of food is honeydew and plant liquids, females require a blood meal to lay eggs. You will, therefore, mostly find them around livestock. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Propagate new **plants** using growth from existing **plants** and mix them into containers around your yard. You can also take cuttings and hang fresh or dried rosemary around to repel insects. As mentioned above, when mixed with bay leaves you have a nice natural way to keep **flies** at bay. Having a fresh supply of rosemary to cook with and dry for the winter also saves a lot of money since it’s a fairly costly herb to purchase. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All **flies** do not eat **plants**. But a few types can eat **plants** and they do. Fruit **flies**, green **flies**, and lantern**flies** are some examples. Flies that infest **plants** usually cause a good amount of damage. The good news is some **plants** can be used to deter **flies** and bugs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As for plant care, Tansy just requires regular watering and a few hours of bright indirect light. Tansy is quite tolerant of poor plant care, but again that’s not an excuse to give it the right care. You should also keep in mind that tansy will self-seed very fast and is infamous as an invasive plant in some areas. If you want to grow it, be sure to keep your indoor **plants** out of the garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Did you know **flies** can taste food without their mouths? As soon as they land, they use receptors on their feet to decide whether they’re on something nutritious. You may have noticed a fly rubbing its legs together, like a hungry customer getting ready to devour a meal. This is called grooming – the fly is essentially cleaning itself, and may also clean the taste sensors on the bristles and fine hair of its feet, to get a better idea of what is in the food it has landed on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lemon thyme is one of the powerful **plants** that repel **flies** naturally due to its strong odor. Moreover, the leaves of lemon thyme contain high amount of terpenes, which make them poisonous to **flies** and other insects. Also, the chemical compounds, thymes, that the plant produces act as natural pesticides. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But prior to using insect-repellent **plants**, be cautious and do research on their capacity to trigger human allergies. There are some that can irritate your skin while others, when ingested, are toxic. If you want to use these **plants** around kids and pets, do comprehensive research first to ensure safety. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since lavender is one of the **plants** that repel **flies**, it is often used as a natural pest control agent. When inhaled or applied topically, lavender oil can aid to ward off **flies** as well as other bugs away from areas where food is being stored or prepared. Aside from its natural anti-fly properties, the sweet fragrance of lavender may also be effective in repelling these insects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   White**flies** are a pretty common greenhouse pest. They infest on leaves and suck up plant juices. But unfortunately, at certain times of the year, these pests can be an issue for vegetables or **plants**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the most important things to consider when caring for fly eating **plants** is their natural habitat. Because they grow in bogs, they thrive best in damp soil that is low in nutrients. Keep in mind that most of their nutrients come from their prey. However, overfeeding should be avoided. While they’re carnivorous, their insides are still that of a delicate flower. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   More importantly, the fruit **flies** you may have seen flying around ripe bananas in your kitchen have been invaluable in biological research. Biomedical scientists from all over the world study fruit **flies** to find causes and cures for diseases and genetic disorders. And in our lab, we study what the world looks like to insects, and how they use their vision to fly. This knowledge can inspire engineers to build better robots. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The benefits of mint are strongest when the leaves are use fresh. But of course, dried mint leaves also work fine. Just prune a few stems off the mint plant, hang them upside down, and place them around your kitchen to prevent **flies** from landing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To fit more food in their stomachs, some **flies** try to reduce the liquid in what they have already eaten. They regurgitate food into vomit bubbles to dry it out a bit. Once some water has evaporated they can ingest this more concentrated food. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lemongrass is a close relative of citronella grass and has lemongrass oil that is very similar to citronella oil. That’s why lemongrass is also a very good plant that repels **flies** naturally. Similar to its citronella cousin, lemongrass thrives well in sunny, well-draining soil and can reach up to four feet in height. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike the two fly species we have discusses above, horse **flies** do not transmit any harmful bacteria. However, they do have really painful bites that can cause rashes or allergic reactions. They are persistent little creatures and won’t stop biting until they have had enough blood or have been killed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The realization that **flies** perform such a vital service has prompted a big push to learn how to make the most of these unsung heroes, by attracting them to fields and orchards and putting them to work in greenhouses and growing tunnels. As demand for food rises, growers will increasingly rely on managed pollinators reared for the job, and not just honeybees, says Rader. Flies will be crucial to ensuring future food security, she says. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lemon thyme is a very hardy plant that doubles as a plant that wards off **flies**. It is a low-maintenance herb, and it can grow in almost any growing condition. But it thrives well in dry, shallow, and rocky soil, while also requiring full sun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Basil – Basil is known to repel **flies** and mosquitoes. It can be grown in pots in a shady spot near the back door. It protects beans, tomatoes and cabbages. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black **flies** can also spread virus diseases. They infest by sucking plant sap. They often cause damage to your **plants**. A bad fly infestation can weaken the plant terribly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A housefly mostly feeds on sugar, flower nectar, and decaying matter. Sometimes it will also feast on the honeydew left behind by aphids. Fruit **flies**: These will normally be found feeding on the yeast that grows on decomposing fruits especially bananas and mangoes. They also love sugary substances like alcoholic beverages and fermented liquids. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moth fly larvae feed on the surface film of poorly maintained drains and pipes dirty waste disposal containers, plus places where sewer leaks occur. Adults of many moth **flies** may feed on nectar from **plants** and polluted water sites. Eggs and pupae do not feed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **plants** are popular for gardeners out there since they are easy to grow and add beauty to any garden setup. Chrysanthemums can be grown in either part sun or full sun and will thrive well in most types of soil. These **plants** are also resistant to diseases and other unwanted pests, not just **flies**, which make them suitable for gardeners who like **plants** that will last longer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While many different types of **flies** visit flowers, one of the most commonly observed is adult syrphid **flies** (in the family Syphridae), also known as “flower **flies**." These **flies** have been recorded visiting over 50 different crop species. They often resemble bees with yellow and black striped bodies. However, they have a distinctive flight pattern, and because of this pattern, they are often called “hover **flies**." There are more than 6,000 described species of flower **flies** in the world and over 400 in the northeastern US alone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Green**flies** are one of the most common types of **flies** that you will notice in your garden. These **flies** are found on all types of **flies**. They tend to feed on **plants** using fine tabular mouthparts. They insert these mouthparts into the plant cell and suck nutrition from it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Then take a pen or pencil and poke 4 to 5 holes in the plastic, just big enough for a fruit fly to fit into, about 7mm. Once a fruit fly crawls in, it cannot get out. You would think they would just fly back out through the holes, but they will not! If you see fruit **flies** crawling around on the surface of your plastic container but not going inside, make the holes larger - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because of its heady scent, rosemary is a popular flavor and aromatic herb to use in many culinary dishes and beverages. These properties are also the same that keep away many **flies**, as it is the leaves that put forth the most scent. Many gardeners will grow it as an annual in the North, but rosemary does surprisingly well through the winter. In northern climes above zone 5, you may want to bring **plants** indoors if your plant is unprotected and the winters have consistent deep freezes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use food baits that attract a whole range of fruit fly species in the orchard such as protein hydrolysate (Nulure®, Buminal®, Solbait®). An alternative is waste brewers' yeast at a rate of 45 ml per litre water. Use about 250 ml of the mixture in each trap. Add one tablespoonful of borax (di-sodium tetraborate) to each trap to prevent rotting of the **flies** caught. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mango growers realized way back that **flies** are important pollinators. “Some encourage **flies** by hanging large barrels from their trees and putting roadkill in them,” Finch says. “Other guys bring in a ton of fish and dump it in a heap in the middle of the orchard.” The farmers are convinced that the pungent bait makes a difference, and the biology of blow**flies** suggests that it might. Yet there’s no scientific proof that it does. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of us don’t much like **flies**. Finch, though, is a big fan. He’s part of a team investigating the role that **flies** play in pollinating crops and whether, like honeybees, they might be managed to improve yields. He’s traveled from Western Sydney University on the other side of the continent to test a widely held belief among mango growers: If you leave out rotting carcasses, **flies** will come, and more **flies** mean more mangoes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And because fly eggs hatch in less than 20 hours, this means that for every pile of poop you leave unattended, you will have 200 **flies** tomorrow. To avoid this, scoop your pet’s poop and clean the litterbox on a daily basis. Check their cages and clean these as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These will normally be found feeding on the yeast that grows on decomposing fruits especially bananas and mangoes. They also love sugary substances like alcoholic beverages and fermented liquids. Bottle **flies** (blow**flies**): Where there is a carcass of a dead animal, you will always find bottle **flies**. In addition to eating, they will dig into the carcass and lay eggs, giving rise to more and more **flies**. Adult blow **flies** also feed on feces, garbage, and fresh meat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Though people love lavender, it’s not the case for **flies**. The powerful aroma of lavender flowers as well as its leaves ward off **flies** far away and other unwanted insects. The oil that lavender produces is the main thing that repels **flies**. Whether you simply pick the lavender flower and display them around your house or extract the oil, rest assured that **flies** won’t bug you anymore. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bees, especially honeybees, get most of the credit, but overlooked and underappreciated is a vast army of beetles, butter**flies**, moths, ants, **flies** and more. In Rader’s analysis, only a handful of crops were visited exclusively by bees; most were visited by both bees and other insects. She and her colleagues assessed the contribution of each type of insect and found that **flies** were the most important pollinators after bees, visiting 72 percent of the 105 crops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pennyroyal can be most helpful in your garden and help deter many bugs from your susceptible veggies. By simply planting this low-grower under and around your **plants**, you provide a natural insecticide to help keep them pest-free. As a member of the mint family, be sure to re-transplant them come fall or rip them out since they can become invasive quickly if left unchecked. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Flies are attracted to a variety of flowering **plants**. As a rule of thumb, **flies** tend to prefer white flowers with open structures that are easy to access. Often these flowers have scents that are not necessarily floral but resemble decomposing material. A thirty-three-year data set on plant-pollinator interactions, generated by Charles Robertson in Illinois, found that syrphid and tachinid fly species visited 257 species of flowering **plants** from 57 families, and they preferred species in the Asteraceae, Rosaceae, and Apiaceae families. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You will need to concentrate on two factors to keep your venus fly trap thriving, those are soil acidity and humidity. Venus fly trap **plants** require very high moisture content in their surroundings and are often placed in glass terrariums (such as the one below) to maintain the ideal environment for them. The soil shouldn’t be soggy but slightly moist. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adult lantern**flies** also prefer cultivated grapes or trees of heaven. As the **flies** grow into adults, their food preferences start to get narrow. Along with grapevines and trees of heaven, they sometimes switch to maples, willow and others. These pests can rarely feed on trees. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are growing cucumbers and tomato **plants**, you should plant nasturtiums around them to get rid of the **flies** (especially carrot fly) as well as some pests such as wooly aphids, cabbage moths, asparagus beetle, squash bugs, Japanese beetles, tomato hornworm, and cucumber beetles. Nasturtium’s flowers will serve as natural fly traps when they bloom. The flowers release an airborne substance that repel **flies**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dragon**flies** are predators. They do not scavenge or eat **plants**. The larvae will consume small aquatic creatures that they can find. This includes small fishes, aquatic worms, tadpoles, and other dragonfly larvae. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hover**flies** also show plenty of promise. In trials, a number of species have proved to be effective pollinators of seed crops, oilseed rape, sweet peppers and strawberries. Recent experiments in the UK, for instance, found that releasing a mixed bunch of hover**flies** into cages of flowering strawberry **plants** increased the yield of fruit by more than 70 percent. What’s more, the strawberries were likely to be bigger, heavier and more perfectly formed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Compost heaps are excellent breeding spots for **flies**. In the spirit of keeping the annoying insects at bay, it will help to have your compost heap away from your house. Also, turn it frequently so it doesn’t get too moist, as this could promote the growth of **flies** too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because of their diversity of lifestyles and the overall lack of research in fly ecology, we know little about what types of habitats best support fly populations. They tend to favor environments with adequate humidity and access to water, such as riparian areas, meadows, and forest openings. To encourage **flies** and other insect species in your backyards, consider a mixed planting system that creates different microhabitats; include decomposing materials like leaf litter or other organic matter. Insecticides used to control pests can negatively affect fly species, so an integrated pest management approach is recommended to reduce off-target effects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fungus gnat larvae feed on plant roots, other organic matter and fungi found in the soil. Fungus gnat pupae do not feed and the adult stage generally feeds on flower nectar. Larval stage feeding can sometimes damage **plants** and stunt their growth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like bees and butter**flies**, **flies** exhibit complete metamorphosis, moving from egg, larvae, pupae, and finally to adult. Larval **flies** from different syrphid and tachynid species lead surprisingly exciting and diverse lives. Many species are predators, feeding on insects such as aphids and scales, thus providing biological control of pests. Others help to break down organic matter, thereby releasing nutrients back into your garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rosemary can be used as a pot herb indoors or planted in the garden. It grows in moist soil and doesn’t need much care once it is established in its place. Rosemary is a versatile herb that can be utilized to ward off **flies** and keep them away from your garden or home. The oil contained in this plant makes it an effective fly repellent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   But here is the most effective way to lock the nuisance bugs out; seal the entrance. Check windows and door screens for any damaged mesh and repair it right away. Add caulk around windows to seal spaces and small cracks where **flies** are likely to enter. It would also help to keep attached garage or cellar doors closed at all times. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lavender – Lavender, with its strong scent, will protect **plants** from insects like the white-fly. Lavender planted near and under fruit trees will deter the codling moth. It can also be used to mask the scent of a rose from aphids. Bear in mind, though, that not all species of lavender can be used; the weed species must be avoided. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Flies can be more than a nuisance; they can also carry diseases. The last place you want to see them is inside your home – especially in the kitchen, where everything should be kept clean and hygienic. Never fear! Cleanipedia has come up with the following top tips for how to repel **flies**, whether inside or out so that they’re gone from your home for good. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Do you know that **flies** are actually beneficial insects with vital roles in the environment? They draw wildlife to our yards when acting as prey, and attack other bad insects in the garden, but most importantly, **flies** break down organic matter. But sadly, these reasons don’t change the fact that **flies** can be very annoying, particularly in the heat of summer. The good thing is you don’t need to whip out **flies** with a fly swatter. Rather, you can opt for a natural approach by simply planting certain types of **plants**. Keep reading as I will be sharing with you 13 powerful **plants** that repel **flies** naturally. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   They are called drain **flies** for a reason. Drain **flies** love **plants**, but they cannot harm the **plants**. They are attracted to moist soil. These **flies** survive on decomposed materials and drain water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The latrine fly might prove an effective pollinator, but that’s still not proof that the farmers’ carrion trick makes a difference. “For that, we’ll have to compare yields in orchards with carrion and without,” says Finch. If the growers are vindicated, then their cheap trick can be rolled out elsewhere. “If it turns out that they aren’t as good at depositing pollen as honeybees, then we may need to add more **flies** to compensate for their lower effectiveness.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Flies are associated with dirt, damped soil, and stink. They can turn the cleanest place into an unpleasant one, even your garden. In case you are wondering how to keep **flies** from eating your **plants**, here are a few things you can do: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

When picked fresh and rubbed on your arms or clothing, it will help to keep **flies** away. It also can be dried and bundled to be placed in doorways, closets, etc. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hover**flies** and blow**flies** visit flowers to drink nectar, which fuels energetic activities like flying, and eat pollen to get the nutrients needed for sexual maturation. Like bees, many of these **flies** are hairy and trap pollen on the head and thorax as they feed. Larger **flies** can collect — and carry — hundreds and sometimes thousands of pollen grains as they fly from flower to flower. Unlike bees, which must forage close to their hive or nest, **flies** don’t have to provide for their young and can roam more widely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both fresh and dried, the scent is given off by basil deters **flies**. Since this is a plant that thrives in patio pots, adding some to your summer flower arrangements near areas of home entry can help keep the worst of your **flies** away.
