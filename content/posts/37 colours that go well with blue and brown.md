## 37 Reference List: Colours That Go Well With Blue And Brown | what colors goes well with blue and brown
-   Brown and **blue** interiors are inviting and warm. They convey an earthy elegance that translates into comfort. In the bedroom, living room, dining room or home office, the combination of **blue** and brown works with a variety of styles. With a variety of tones at your disposal, this is a classic color scheme that works. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can create warmer brown colors by adding more orange, yellow, or red. On the other hand, cooler browns can be created by using more **blue**s and greens. Always mix colors in small amounts and carefully, you can always include more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You might doubt this choice but believe us it looks stunning. Brown can be used for your home’s furniture essentials like sofas, chairs and other materials and **blue** should be applied to the walls. Blue represents a relaxed and calm space and when it is combined with a warm brown color, it creates a relaxing space to live in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No matter what **blue** you use, the result will end up looking a little darker or muddier after being mixed with brown. In some cases, it might even have a hint of purple in it. It’s a unique mixture, but it’s probably not one that’ll be used often. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're looking to design with this well-loved color but feeling a bit overwhelmed by the options, never fear. Navy **blue** is a versatile color that pairs with everything from classic white to deep bordeaux. We've rounded up some of our favorite hues to pair with navy, and some of them definitely aren't what you were expecting. Whether you opt for a traditional pairing or go for something unexpected and bold, navy **blue** comes through again and again. Which is probably why it's earned itself a spot in the pantheon to begin with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you run out of brown and **blue** paint, you might be able to recreate those colors. Since **blue** is a primary color, it’s difficult to make it with paint. According to the CMYK color model, which is used for printer ink, cyan and magenta can mix together to create **blue**. However, those colors are less common in paint, so it might be easier to buy **blue** paint instead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tints are lighter versions of a color. So, if you want to lighten the dark **blue** color a bit, you can add white to it. White is a light color that’s easily drowned out by other paints, so you might need to add a lot of it before you’ll notice a significant change. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown and **blue** are two very different colors, but they go well together in design. The bright, calming properties of **blue** balance well with neutral colors like brown. So, whether you’re painting an art piece or designing a room, these two colors can make a pleasant pattern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting your home with shades of brown can also be a way of creating a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere. Brown can be a rather dull color; however, it is versatile and can work great if used with other colors that work well together. It is also helpful to understand the undertone of your brown. Cooler browns tend to work better with **blue**s and greens, while warmer browns work best with reds, oranges, and yellows. Many interior designers also recommend you opt for a matte brown paint finish as a glossy brown wall reflects light and can make a space look smaller than it is. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Luckily, brown is a much easier color to make. The most common way to mix brown is by using an equal amount of red, yellow, and **blue** paint. You can also get types of brown by mixing complementary colors on the RYB color wheel. For example, **blue** and orange or red and green make brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the other hand, shades are darker versions of a color. Since a mixture of brown and **blue** paint is usually dark to begin with, you likely won’t need to worry about this. Yet, if you want it to appear even darker, you can add a hint of black to the mix. A little black paint can go a long way, so only use it sparingly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue is everyone's favorite color for a reason—and if you're thinking umm, no, it's not mine, it's still hard to deny its timeless beauty, especially when it comes to interior design. Evocative of the open sky and calming sea and the source of some of the greatest literary and visual art works in history (Yves Kleins' signature shade and Maggie Nelson's Bluets, we're looking at you), **blue** is one of those pigments that instantly calms the senses and fills any space with beauty. Not to mention, it goes with just about every other color and design trend, from stark minimalist environments to warm and vibrant backdrops. So whether it's the main act or a supporting character in your home, we rounded up fourteen rooms with colors that go with **blue** to pave the way. Keep reading for plenty of inspiration and **blue** color palettes to experiment with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Overall, the color **blue** is a symbol of security, trust, and loyalty. It gives off feelings of protection, support, and relaxation. While it can have many positive associations like peace and confidence, it can also have negative attributes like passive and predictable. However, that is just general color symbolism. Specific types of **blue** can have their own unique meanings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   CMYK is a color model that’s the opposite of the RGB color model. It has cyan, magenta, and yellow as the primary colors, while red, green, and **blue** are the secondary colors. However, even though it seems similar to the RGB color model, brown does exist in it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The RGB color model is made of colors on the visible light spectrum. The primary colors are red, green, and **blue**, and when those colors all mix together, they create white. The colors can be adjusted by dimming or brightening the existing lights, but there’s no way to make brown light using that method. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most colors look great with brown, in moderation, but always consider earthy, natural colors when making your brown color combination choice. Natural greens, ocean **blue**s, and so forth. These colors look very natural next to brown, as we often see them in nature. Brown complementary colors like orange for a cool **blue**, works well when used in moderation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mixing a variety of colors together can help you better understand color theory. By using trial and error, you might even find some new and exciting colors to use. So, just because brown and **blue** is an unusual mix doesn’t mean you should avoid it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The RYB color model uses the color wheel most people learned in early art classes. The primary colors are red, yellow, and **blue**, and when combinations of those colors are mixed, they can create the other colors. If equal amounts of red, yellow, and **blue** are mixed together, they’ll make brown. So, while it’s unlikely that you’d use brown to mix with other colors, it’s still possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A dark navy business suit can provide an excellent template for experimentation with these two **colours**. When paired with a white shirt and black oxfords, it’s the epitome of formal wear. However, if you switch things out for brown suede boots and a brown knit tie, you can transform it into something else entirely – an outfit far more suited for socialising, and smart nights out. A brown suit is equally famous for its ability to be dressed up or down; a smart charcoal suit, for example, can be lightened up with a jovial **blue** pocket square. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Below are the brown hex codes to the above brown colors. We have also included the brown color code or hex code as well as the percentage of red, green, and **blue**. CMYK represents the amount of cyan, and magenta, as well as yellow and black, which work with printing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re familiar with the theory of the colour wheel, you’ll already have a bit of a headstart in this explanation. Essentially, **blue** and orange are on opposite sides of this colour wheel, which means they contrast strongly but complement each other as they do it. Since brown isn’t too far from orange, the same applies to this pairing, too. They naturally work well together, creating a subtly pleasing effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Reaching darker brown tones, you can add dark **blue** paint to the brown, for example, ultramarine **blue**. You can add black to darken a brown, however, this can give rise to a muted and lackluster color. There are many shades of brown, so the only real way to discover these combinations is to experiment and keep a color palette record so you can achieve similar results for future projects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lighter shades of brown are great for things like creating highlights or adding lighter hair colors. The process is simple, include a small amount of white to your basic brown to lighten it. Work slowly and carefully as you do not want to mix in too much. You can also blend in a small amount of one primary color to create a richer color. Adding a touch of **blue** will create a light brown that is cooler while adding red will make it warmer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We're well-documented fans of designing in a **blue** color scheme. As much as we're partial to a bold pop of purple or a wash of muted green, there's something about the color **blue** that just has astounding versatility. And if we were to play favorites, we'd have to say that navy **blue**—one of the most iconic shades ever—is the epitome of everything we love about this part of the color wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We have mentioned that to lighten a brown color, you can simply add white. However, to darken brown, black can be used in small amounts. In most cases, however, it might be better to add a darker color instead of black. For example, if you blended orange and **blue**, use more of the **blue** for a darker shade. You can also try using purple to create darker shades of brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s plenty of choice within the two **colours**, too. You can take your pick from chocolate browns, as well as medium shades, lighter ones, or even pastel **colours**. With **blue**, meanwhile, you can choose your favourite from navy, medium **blue**, royal **blue**, sky **blue**, and plenty more. As long as you steer clear of matching up the extremes (such as navy **blue** with deep chocolate brown), you might be surprised at the effects you can create! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You won’t find brown on the traditional color wheel, but since its closest shade is orange, many use **blue** as a complementary color for brown. Combining **blue** and brown tones can make a relaxing environment out of an ordinary bedroom. Brown leather paired with navy **blue** makes a room feel rustic and refined, whereas pale **blue** paired with beige or a lighter wood creates a more serene environment. The cool tones in shades of **blue** mix well with the warm browns of darker wooden furniture without leaving the room feeling too dark or heavy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, you get complimentary colors, which can be found on a color wheel facing each other. So, when you look for red, the color opposite should be green, the opposite of **blue** should be orange and for yellow it is purple. Combining these ‘opposite’ or complementary colors creates brown. There are many colors between these, which in turn, can create a variety of brown shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Add equal amounts of paint of each primary color onto a mixing palette. Three amounts of red, yellow, and **blue** can be placed a little ways from each other, but still close enough to mix easily. Take the same amount from each and blend with a palette knife. You can also include a tiny amount of white to lighten the color. You can then add a primary color to change the hue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not only is the color brown an unusual color to mix with, but it also doesn’t exist in lights. In physical art mediums, it usually makes colors look darker or muddier. Yet, in lights, it’s impossible to use brown in mixing. For that reason, brown and **blue** are a color combination that you won’t see often when combining colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Personally here at Acorn, we’re pleased to be living in an age where people are taking ever bolder risks with their personal style. Arguably though, brown and **blue** is still a colour combination that’s widely under-utilised, especially in the world of men’s style. And that’s a shame, because the right shades paired together can give almost any outfit an air of understated elegance. We’ve got plenty of brown and **blue** cotton shirting fabrics to choose from here at Acorn, and over all our decades in the business, we’ve picked up a few ideas on how you can use them! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The tone of **blue** color should be darker to get the best effect. Navy **blue** will be the perfect choice for this combo. You can even include white color and it will add a cherry to the cake. There are so many wonderful home decor ideas and colors to really make your home stand out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even though you can easily create several brown shades, it is amazing to know that there are hundreds of shades of brown. Each of these colors has its own unique name as well as color code, especially for use on digital devices. The color code is known as a hexadecimal (hex) code and consists of six letters and numbers preceded by a hashtag. These letters and numbers represent the amount of red, as well as green, and also **blue** in a specific color. Some of the more common and familiar shades of brown include: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Brown colors come about by combining the primary colors, which are yellow, red as well as **blue**. However, when painting, you need to create different shades of brown to represent various things like wood, skin tones, and hair. Varying brown shades are also used to enhance lighting effects and shadows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cool brown means that there is a visible undertone of **blue**. This brown hue is usually associated with good quality and masculinity. The complementary color of **blue** is orange, which makes orange a great combination with cool brown. An earthy orange, like terracotta, works best with a cool brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many considered brown to be the color of humility and was worn by monks in the Middle Ages. During this time, dark colors, including browns were not used often as brighter greens, **blue**s, and reds were preferred. Only later, closer to the sixteenth century, did the color brown become more popular. Even then, the color was limited to four brown shades namely, burnt sienna, burnt umber, raw umber, and raw sienna. All of which was obtained from natural sources of clay and earth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
