## 20 Tips for Where Can I Buy Perlite And Vermiculite | where can i get vermiculite and perlite
-   Humans likely were aware of **perlite** as early as the Third Century BC. However, industrial mining of **perlite** is a fairly recent activity that started in the 1950s. Use in agriculture is even more modern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adding **vermiculite** would be like stuffing bread crumbs between the bowling balls. It sponges up more water to help the soil stay wetter for longer. Many plants benefit from this moisture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vermiculite is a biodegradable clay, but it takes a long time to break down. As **vermiculite** decomposes, it feeds soil microorganisms and the nutrients absorbed in its microscopic clay sheets become available to plants. It also adds grit to the stomachs of worms, which can be very beneficial for your soil or compost. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Particle Size Comparison These soil additives come in different sizes that have different uses. Both materials come in varying sizes that are most suitable for distinct uses. For example: Fine-grade **perlite** (1/16 to 1/128” diameter) is almost as effective as superfine **vermiculite** (1/25” and smaller) for rooting cuttings and starting seeds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you look at groups of people who are exposed to the largest quantities of **perlite** (the miners and factory workers), you can feel even safer about using **perlite** in your garden. Studies show that mining dust from **perlite** production plants does not negatively affect the respiratory health of workers in the U.S. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While **vermiculite** and **perlite** have some similar uses in soil mixes, they are not the same material. Perlite is best for aerating the soil and making it drain faster. Vermiculite is better for holding onto moisture and keeping soil from drying out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While **perlite** is a mineral from the earth, it is not technically biodegradable. The **perlite** balls in the soil are made from superheated volcanic rocks that won’t decompose over time. Adding **perlite** to the soil permanently alters the texture and improves its capacity for growing crops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Perlite is made of crushed and heated volcanic rocks that are formed by the hydration of obsidian deep underground. Once mined, **perlite** is heated until it pops like popcorn. It has the unique capacity to expand to 20 times its original volume under heat, which makes the final product fairly productive at absorbing and retaining moisture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another big advantage of **vermiculite** is its ability to hold onto soil nutrients. It has a high cation exchange capacity, which means that minerals and fertilizers “stick” to it. Vermiculite attracts positive ions like potassium, magnesium, calcium, and ammonium. On its own, it also contains trace amounts of potassium and magnesium. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are no chemicals involved in making **perlite**. It is simply a heated “popped” mineral. Perlite is 100% non-toxic. It does not threaten the health of humans, animals, or the environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As a soil additive, **perlite**’s primary role is aeration. Its airy texture helps improve the drainage of potting soil and seed-starting mixes so that water flows through them more easily. This results in healthier seedlings and potted plants with a lower risk of diseases like dampening off or root rot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Large volumes of **vermiculite** particles can irritate your nose and throat if you breathe them in. It’s best to use **vermiculite** outdoors in a ventilated area while wearing a mask. Vermiculite should be used while moist to ensure that dust fibers are not released into the air. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After **perlite** is mined from the Earth, it is rapidly heated to 1400 to 1800°F by a giant “popper.” The water contained in the **perlite** transforms to steam and causes each tiny “pearl” to bubble up to 20 times its original volume. The result is “expanded” **perlite** which is much like popcorn. It is lightweight and filled with air, ready to be added to your soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When added to soil, **vermiculite** can improve the moisture retention, drainage, nutrient holding, and overall vitality of your plants. It can be added to the seed starting mix to keep seeds moist while they’re germinating. It can also be added to potting mix and compost to improve drainage and nutrient holding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of the world’s **perlite** mines are located in the U.S., Greece, Turkey, and Japan. The American share of **perlite** reserves amounts to less than 15% of global resources. The majority are located in California, Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oregon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At the same time, **perlite**’s extremely porous particles make it moisture-wicking to enhance the drainage of soils. Rainwater and irrigation can pass more freely through soils with **perlite**, which means less waterlogging or disease problems. This dual function of absorption and drainage means **perlite** is one of the best-known materials for growing plants in containers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, it is a common misconception that **perlite** and **vermiculite** are the same things. There are some major differences between these two materials. This guide will help you determine whether **perlite** or **vermiculite** is better for your plants. Let’s dig into everything you need to know about **perlite** versus **vermiculite**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Perlite is a very safe, natural, non-toxic material that has even been added to lotions and soaps to replace plastic microbeads. It is also considered completely safe by regulatory agencies. There is some concern over the very fine dust **perlite** generates that could harm your airways when inhaled. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Perlite’s rounded shape is what makes it so great for adding aeration and drainage to the soil. It can hold about four times its weight in water but doesn’t retain nearly as much moisture as **vermiculite**. Vermiculite has a flat or flaky shape that adds some drainage but tends to hold onto far more water than **perlite** (up to 16 times its weight). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vermiculite and **perlite** are mineral soil additives that improve the porosity and water-holding capacity of the soil. Whether used in a seedling mix, potting mix, or in your garden beds, both **vermiculite** and **perlite** are mainly used for water management. In general, **perlite** has the best drainage enhancement while **vermiculite** has the best moisture retention. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
