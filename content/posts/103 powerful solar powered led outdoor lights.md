The soothing light, the energy efficiency, the absence of concern about plant and structural damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best place to install outdoor **solar** **lights** is an open place where there is ample sunlight. Try to find a spot which doesn’t have any shades due to buildings, trees, poles or other objects so that the sun rays are not blocked. Also, keep the area surrounding the **solar** **lights** clean as plants can grow and obstruct the sunlight from falling on the panel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The light is left turned on as long as there is a movement within its sensor’s vicinity and it automatically turns off when the person leaves the sensor’s range.

For a PIR Sensor, there are two factors that are at play to determine its quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **solar** **lights** are used for lighting up a single area or highlighting trees and shrubs. They also double as security **lights**, as they’re good for dark spots that could use brief bursts of bright light, like the front of sheds when you're locking or unlocking a door, or alleyways when you’re putting the bins out. If you’re looking for gentle mood lighting, these might not be for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We tested a variety of **solar** **lights**, putting them through their paces between early February to late May 2022. They were in a range of urban, suburban and rural gardens across the country, and subjected to changing weather and hours of daylight for nearly four months. They were then assessed according to the following criteria with equal marks attributed to each: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **lights** come with a separate light and land spikes unlike most of the landscape **lights**. The light’s height is fully adjustable.

-   Key features: 200 **lights**, 19.9 metres long (3 metres to the first light and then 19.9 metres), claimed battery life of up to eight hours during the summer, It's recommended you store the **lights** away over the winter, 8 light settings, warm white light. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Before the tests even commenced in earnest, these **lights** were left outside in a garden for six weeks over the winter. During this period the country shivered in a cold snap and temperatures in the garden remained below zero for five consecutive days. Our Best Buys have now survived outside for two consecutive winters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For help in choosing them, I asked award-winning garden designer and BBC Gardeners' Question Time panellist Matthew Wilson. You can find all of Matthew's advice on how choose garden **lights**, where to put them and how to get the best out of them at the bottom of this feature. His key advice was to go for ambience over brightness - I was looking for charming glows, twinkles and flickers, not glare. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With string and fairy **lights**, try to keep an eye out for how much cable there is between the **solar** panel and the first bulb. At least a metre of this lead-in is useful, as it means you have more flexibility when placing your **solar** panel. With enough cable, you can still put your panel in a sunny spot and trail your **lights** up a trellis a few metres away, even if it’s in the shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The next test was to find out how well they charged in both direct and indirect sunlight. I placed one of each type of light in my front yard to receive direct sunlight, and another of each in my backyard against the house since the sun rarely shines there. Then, I waited for the **lights** to charge, checking to see if they were able to charge in a day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Not to be confused with outdoor string **lights** or fairy **lights**, **solar** **lights** sit on stakes in the ground and charge by sunlight during the day to illuminate your yard all night. Solar spot**lights** can be used to mark walkways, highlight decorative features, detect movement, or serve as focal design elements in their own right.

Solar Lanterns – They are also known as hanging **solar** **lights** or garden lanterns. They are compact and portable making it perfect for providing light in remote places, especially in the backyard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This focused on the hours needed to charge and the **lights**’ runtime after a full charge. We looked at how soon after sunset the **lights** switched on, and checked the **lights**’ brightness to see if they provided practical or aesthetic lighting. We made sure to check if the **lights** worked on overcast days, and finally if there was any sign of degradation or rusting. Value for Money.

-   These string **lights** are good quality and although the bulbs look like glass, they’re made of tough plastic and more than capable of holding up to accidental knocks. The **solar** panel is discrete, and they’re easy to control through an on/off switch and eight lighting modes. There’s also generous three metre lead of cable between the panel and the first light, so there’s a lot of slack to play with when you’re setting these up. However, despite being a white light we found these **lights** a little dim, especially from a distance. They could also sometimes be slow to turn on, and have a weather resistance rating of IP44. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We put a range of **solar** **lights** to the test, using them in urban, suburban and rural gardens across the country. We started testing at the end of February 2022, and collected our results in late May, so we’ve put these **lights** through months of different lighting and weather conditions. They’ve seen wind, rain, hail and sleet; cold snaps, heat waves, and even dust from the Sahara. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But surely they’re not all that bad?
