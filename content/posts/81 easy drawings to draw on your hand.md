-   Use an HB pencil to **draw** a rectangle slightly longer than a square. Make a slope at the top.

Taper the right side of the rectangle as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   [ My tutorial focused on explaining in depth for each hands, I will not talking about you have to do it my way, tell you how to color, using this particular brushes, etc. But more to theoretically present the principle of hands **draw**ing from my passed away master of traditional sketches, my only mentor in hyper realistic **draw**ing: my uncle, Mr. Hariyanto. "I miss you, sensei." ] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While there are seemingly endless cool **draw**ing ideas floating around, some of the most popular subjects tend to be nature-themed or revolve around the human figure. Get acquainted with how to **draw** them with some of the step-by-step guides below. You never know—learning to **draw** them might spark even more **draw**ing ideas! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In our previous tutorials, we showed you how to **draw** a face and how to **draw** a person. In this one, we’re going to teach you how to **draw** hands in five steps. Even if you’re an absolute beginner, you’ll still be able to follow along. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Outlines and shadows can be added to finish the **draw**ing of the hand. Remember to consider the light source when you are adding the shading. It should be consistent for all of the parts of the hand and each of the fingers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Learn how to **draw** a rose — The rose is an enduring symbol of love. Just as writers have spoken of its beauty, artists **draw** its delicate petals. But just because the rose is popular doesn't mean it's easy to sketch. Loaded with layers of petals, it can be a challenge. But have no fear—we break a rose **draw**ing down so that it's both approachable and fun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of all parts of the body, the hand is by many considered to be the hardest to **draw**. We all have stories of how, early on, we would keep our characters' hands behind their backs or in their pockets, avoiding as much as possible the task of tackling hands. Yet paradoxically, they are our most readily available reference, being in our field of vision every moment of our lives. With just one extra accessory, a small mirror, we can reference hands from all angles. The only real challenge, then, is the complexity of this remarkably articulated organ: it's almost like **draw**ing a small figure onto a larger one, one doesn't know where to start. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The limitations are very great indeed, either with or without mirror, but perhaps greatest without one since it is almost always obvious that the hand **draw**n is the artist's own, and we are always necessarily confronted with the thumb side, as in the **draw**ing directly above. Image below is my mom's fingers reference and I did not the exact way, adding more imagination and slightly make it... A bit less wrinkles and give a long sleeve in order to make it into an old style **draw**ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drawing has become an interesting hobby for many people. Fortunately, you don’t have to be a professional artist to make it your pastime too. Once you start **draw**ing, you will enjoy several amazing personal benefits. Here are some of the benefits of learning how to **draw**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drawing from imagination is good paired with **draw**ing from life. If you’re **draw**ing from imagination and you’re really struggling with a certain pose, take a picture of your own hand in that pose and study it. When you study from life you learn more about how the hand works and how the shapes look in various poses. You can use that knowledge to improve your work from imagination. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 8 I **draw** the pointing finger along its dotted line. Half of the middle and the tip are visible. I join the “mitten’s” lower portion, representing the back of the hand, from the little finger to the thumb. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The muscles on the pinky side are also a teardrop, but they’re mostly covered with a thick layer of fat on the palm. I include the fat and **draw** the form as a convex box. When the pinky is flexing or abducting, the crease between the fat and muscle appears. I’ll show the corner of the fat pad, and the round form of the muscle belly. If the the pinky was relaxed, I would round out this edge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   8. A hammer: A hammer is one of the tools that make great subjects for ****draw**ings**. It is quite easy to **draw**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now that you’ve learned how to easily **draw** a hand, you can start giving your characters and people even more personality. For more inspiration, search the internet or flip through fashion magazines for hands you can use for a reference.

-   2. Focus onto shading first, add values to your **draw**ing with black and white or any other monotone. Don't start with colors yet, but aim to had the understanding of shapes, forms and full control of your pen pressure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Like any other form of art, **draw**ing requires relentless practice. That’s why you need to always have your sketchbook handy.

-   1. Draw from references if you don't have a mirror, ask your parents, your fiances, your friends. Make sure to **draw** from reality. Many of hand **draw**ing tutorials here already filled with anime style ****draw**ings**, which is good. But not really the best way to develop your skill. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the fingers are grouped together, you can try to imagine a mitten shape for all of them. If one or more of the fingers is separate from the group, **draw** it separate. Group the ones that you can and decide if they’re bending. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So lets do it. Your assignment is to follow this process and **draw** 5 hands from imagination. Post them in the Anatomy Group. I might critique your **draw**ing in the next critique video. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How to **draw** a hand? You can tell a lot about a person by the way they use their hands when they’re talking or contemplating something. That’s why I believe the quickest way to give my portraits or character illustrations personality and emotions is by using interesting hand poses and gestures. And, even though there are so many components of hands, I’m here to demonstrate an easy process of making natural-looking hands. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hands are one of the most expressive parts of a pose. By conveying the story and emotion through the hands, you can add more life to your ****draw**ings**.

-   Tumblr and Instagram among other platforms offer daily **draw**ing challenges (think Inktober, but yearlong). Joining one of these and posting your ****draw**ings** will increase your accountability and motivation. Not only will set themes give you direction and just the right amount of constraints to work within, you’ll also be joining a creative community that shares feedback. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   13. Kids’ toys: Most toys come with simple but interesting shapes that you can **draw**. Furthermore, most of them are brightly colored. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our hands are extremely expressive and can form endless amounts of gestures. These gestures can convey many emotions such as fear, anger, sadness and happiness. No wonder they’re so difficult to **draw**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Does your artwork depict intricate details? Try using a **draw**ing pen. Pens offer consistent linework and precision. There is a pen for almost every type of linework, including sketching, cartooning, drafting, calligraphy, and more. Check out our picks for the best **draw**ing pens. And if you’re looking to add color to your work, we’ve identified some of the best colored pencils to use, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first step is to get a clear idea of the hand you’re gonna **draw**. Don’t jump in blindly and start **draw**ing. Figure out the angle we’re looking at the hand from. Can we see the back of the hand or the palm? How much of the front are we seeing? Or are we looking at it from the back? What is each finger and thumb doing? What about the wrist? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now that we have all 4 fingers **draw**n, it’s time to locate each joint. Add 2 more ticks on the middle finger, each roughly 1 quarter of the way down. Using these ticks, **draw** 2 more curves. We now have reference points for joint placement! Wasn’t so bad, was it? Please note that these are only loose measurements for simplicity sake. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 6 Here, the ring finger peeks out from behind my pinky. I study the arc’s distance, as this will determine the finger’s length, and I **draw** it to where I want it to meet that line. Notice that the lower joint is concealed behind the little finger. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is safe to say that everyone loves kittens and a kitten which is seen in most cartoons is beyond cute. You can practice by **draw**ing a real kitten and then move onto the cartoon one. If you find it difficult to **draw** you can divide it into parts; the head first then the body and after that **draw** the limbs and end with the tail. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, limited the basic view of it may be, each pose, even though similar to a preceding one, is always subtly different. So, there is more of an exercise in **draw**ing and less of an anatomical study. Exploration of forms is common to most master ****draw**ings** in any era. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   32. An old person’s face: You can either **draw** the face of your grandparent or find a picture of an older person that you know. Make sure you get the wrinkles right. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   360 degrees: Choose an object and **draw** its outline. Turn the object slightly and **draw** the outline again. Repeat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is perhaps the coolest thing to **draw** because who does not love Captain America. The shield of Captain America is a sign of bravery and loyalty and it is the best shield as nothing can damage it and it has saved Captain’s life countless times. You can **draw** it by making a circle which blue and red lines and white stars. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lips might seem easy to **draw** but they would prove to be difficult if you do not pay attention. If you focus, you would find lips to be one of the easiest parts of the human body to **draw** as it involves curves only. In a mirror, you can observe your own lips and try to replicate them on a paper by imitating the curves and edges of your own lips. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Keep in mind, even though the process itself is quite simple, **draw**ing hands is never going to be easy. There’s prerequisites that make it challenging, like anatomy, perspective and shading. If you want to **draw** simple hands, rather than learn a simple process to **draw** real hands, I also have a lesson on **draw**ing Cartoon Hands. But all this stuff ties together, so let’s get started… - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, **draw** a transverse line to mark the place where the metacarpals end and the proximal phalanges begin. The former area is where the so-called “mountains of Mercury, Sun, Saturn, and Jupiter” are, while the latter refers to the area of “the mountains of primary and secondary Mars and plain of Mars.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To determine the length of each finger, measure the length from the wrist to the knuckles and duplicate that. The dotted line marks the maximum finger height. Our fingers vary in length and since the middle finger is the longest, we will use it as a reference to find the height of the other 3 fingers. To do that, **draw** a curved line that is similar to the first one **draw**n in step 1. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hands are extremely expressive. When you’re **draw**ing hands you have to be an actor. Just like when you’re **draw**ing facial expressions. You gotta feel the expression of the hand pose you’re **draw**ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To **draw** a hand in a fist, start from the proximal phalange of the thumb first and connect it to the Thenar and the Hypothenar Eminence, i.e., “the mount of Venus” and “the mount of moon,” like Gonçalo shows: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For the thumb, **draw** a curved line coming from the bottom left circle. The height of the thumb will change depending on how far it is spread out. Measure the length of the thumb and **draw** a circle at the halfway point. Add another circle halfway up from there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gonçalo starts off by **draw**ing the thumb part between the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joint cases. Don’t let these big words scare you. The former refers to the joint that connects the thumb to the palm and the latter to the joint where the thumb bends. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The cover photo is the actual me in person (Futopia; on the right) with my mom. Well, we use the A4 paper in order to let Clip Studio team and judges know exactly that it's actually us, the real persons behind this tutorial creation. I use my mom's hands and mine as references for ****draw**ings** as well as my fiance's hands for female part but I don't want to distract viewer's attention with so many photos: in the end, we keep everything simple by using only sketches and our avatars. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Practice, practice, practice. The way to get good at **draw**ing hands is to **draw** lots of them. Before you get into **draw**ing realistic, academic hand ****draw**ings**, start with stylized ones that you can find in illustrations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hands are the ideal subject for beginners, with different gestures providing perfect practice for perspective, scale, curves and lines. Use with either a photo or a wooden artist’s model of a hand that can be moved into different positions. Beginners should try **draw**ing the basic outline of an open hand, starting with the palm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the past, many people believed that **draw**ing was an artistic undertaking pursued by a few people with the dream of achieving artistic greatness. However, today people have realized that **draw**ing is much more than that. That’s why you will find a lot of people, both young and old, carrying their sketchbooks around. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are **draw**ing multiple subjects or one subject with multiple parts, always make sure the size and position of each subject are proportional to the others. For instance, if you are **draw**ing a person’s face, place their eyes directly in the middle of the head. Checking the proportions of each subject helps to ensure that no subject is too small or too big in relation to another. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Investing in great supplies will help ensure that you expand your sketching capabilities. So, check out our recommendations for the best **draw**ing pencils, best sketchbooks, and best type of paper. Although pencils are the most popular tools when it comes to **draw**ing, charcoal is also fairly popular for those who like to sketch and do it fast. While working on ****draw**ings** that have deep shadows, charcoal will offer rich black tones perfect for shading. You can check out our selection of the best charcoal pencil sets for artists. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use this diagram form before beginning any **draw**ing, but keep it separate and do not attempt to superimpose the finished **draw**ing over it. Above was taken from my past tutorial as well. Focused on creating heads for galactic creatures. If you're interested, please head to the link I provided. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Always make sure your **draw**ing fits well into the **draw**ing area. For instance, if you are **draw**ing on a piece of paper, size the subject to ensure that it fits in the sheet. But it should also leave enough space on the sides so that it doesn’t look cramped. At the same time, make sure the subject doesn’t appear too tiny on the sheet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Feel free to download and use the hand images below for your reference! You may find that it is difficult to use the measurement system for certain gestures. In this case, eye the approximate measurements and remember to implement the use of curved lines when **draw**ing fingers. If you practice enough, you should be able to sketch them without the use of guidelines or better yet, be able to visualize and **draw** any gesture! Understanding muscles, tendons and fat tissue will help add a layer of realism to your hands. Click here for an interactive 360 degree model. You can view different layers by clicking on the thumbnails at the top. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   9. Game pieces: If you love board games, just pull one out and take a look at the pieces. Choose the pieces that will make an interesting subject for **draw**ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Subtractive **draw**ing: Try this one with charcoal. Using it horizontally, shade your paper an even value of grey. Now “**draw**” with your eraser – erase the highlights of your subject. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you start your **draw**ing project, start with the larger shapes and work your way down to the smallest details. For instance, if you are **draw**ing someone’s face, start with the shape of the head and the neck. Then, work your way down to the smallest details such as eyes, mouth, nose, eyelashes, nostrils, pupils, etc. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This means that you shouldn’t fully **draw** one part of a subject first before moving to the next one. For example, if you are **draw**ing a person’s face, don’t fully stretch one eye and then proceed to **draw** the next. Instead, **draw** the outer shapes of both eyes and then move on to the pupils. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   6. A stapler: Staplers are everywhere and they’re made up of simple shapes that are easy to **draw**. Start by **draw**ing the shapes and then add the details. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When **draw**ing, minimize the number of strokes and use long steady lines. Don’t scribble or make many small strokes to **draw** a line. If you make a mistake when **draw**ing a light line sketch, you can **draw** several lines to correct it. But if the mistakes are too many, you should just erase them and start afresh. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nature has long provided artists with inspiration for **draw**ing. Trees and the sandy beach are both beautiful to look at and are also fun to **draw**. As you improve on your **draw**ing, try revisiting these same subjects to see how differently they now look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
