## 10 Reference List: What Color Does Dark Blue Go With | Dark Blue Color Code
-   When it comes down to truly timeless **color** ideas, few come close to navy and gray. To make the most of this combo, ensure that both shades feature cool undertones — that way, you'll end up with an impactful yet understated finish. The den in this Westport home designed by Chango & Co. is a prime example of how well the two can coexist. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adopting a navy **blue** **color** palette means balancing it out with a steady flow of earthy neutrals. Take for example this tiny workstation from Raili CA Design, where light wood finishes, warm leather, and verdant greenery bring out the essence of the backdrop. The shiplap wall paneling and woven desk chair add visual texture with a subtle hint of contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And speaking of powder rooms, this tropical design by Zoe Feldman is another picture-perfect example of how to use navy **blue** in a small space. Here, a graphic palm wallpaper print in a soothing shade of light **blue** and forest green fits right in with the bold **blue** baseboards, window trim, and wall sconce. The greenery on the print allows the base **color** to pop while the lustrous brass fixtures tie it all together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blues and greens never fail to please and the bolder you go, the more of an impact the **color** pairing will make. In this formal sitting room by Studio McGee, the emerald green sofa acts as the perfect supporting cast for the navy board and batten accent wall. The framed piece of abstract art ties the whole look together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to home decor, you can't go wrong with gold and navy. The two make a perfect pair and there are a whole host of ways to rock the look in your own home. For example, we love the minimalist scene spotted in this Prague apartment, complete with a dark **blue** velvet sofa surrounded by accents flaunting a gold finish. And if you really want to kick things up a notch, throw in herringbone wood flooring, too. Swoon! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to **color**s that go with navy **blue**, white is as high-contrast and classic as it gets. While the pairing may typically be seen in the form of white walls and navy **blue** cabinetry, we're all for switching things up like Chango & Co. did in this powder room with a white vanity cabinet and wallpaper showcasing a navy and sky **blue** pattern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When two deep shades combine in one space, the result is a moody **color** scheme with a luxe finish that eliminates the need for much else on the decor front. However, if you are a maximalist at heart, allow this chic living room from Sarisa Munoz of Indigo Leopard Home to serve as your guide. While the **blue** walls establish a rich backdrop, the burnt orange sofa adds to the intensity. An aqua accent chair shaped like a hand, a checkered area rug, an assortment of mirrors, and a handful of potted plants complement the **color** combination while adding a little something extra to complete the eclectic scene. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cool, calming, and oh-so-complementary, the **color** **blue** is truly unique. It's not too vibrant, yet it always manages to stand out regardless of the shade. From dining rooms to bedrooms to offices to kitchens, when it comes to decorating with the popular hue, no area of the house is off-limits — its versatility is just one of the many aspects that earmark it as a timeless classic. And while there are more shades of **blue** than we could ever count, there's something captivating about a bold navy and the way it commands attention with effortless ease. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This living room makeover by Dabito from Old Brand New is a fresh take on navy with its cheerful yellow accents and dramatic boho flair. Not only is it a complementary **color**, but it also offers a striking dose of contrast you'd be hard-pressed to achieve with white or any other neutral. Navy-painted walls with pops of yellow introduced by way of a gallery wall, small chandelier, and an area rug are all you really need to recreate this stunning vignette. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Among the many **color**s that go with navy **blue**, purple may not always be top of mind, but we urge you to reconsider. Establishing a balance between the two shades is key when integrating them into any space. Follow the lead of this drama-filled bedroom by Allison Crawford Design and put the powerful duo to work with the help of dark navy curtains and an eggplant wall **color**. Use warmer elements, such as light wood flooring and neutral bedding, to temper the intensity of the **color** combo. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
