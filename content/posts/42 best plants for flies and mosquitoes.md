-   Mosquitoes, like all creatures, are attracted to environments that contain the things they need to live. And that includes certain plants!

As adults, **mosquitoes** eat the nectar of certain plants, such as taro, papyrus, water lilies, and water hyacinths. So removing those plants from your yard may help. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A member of the mint family, Mentha pulegium is a wonderful garden plant that doubles as a bug repellent. The spearmint-like scent deters **flies** and small rodents too. But unlike mint, this plant is not edible and is toxic to the liver, causing a number of problems if ingested. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – The strong aroma of rosemary will also repel **flies**, as will lemon balm.

-   Widely used for cooking, aromatic basil, a member of the mint family, may also offer protection against **mosquitoes**. Research confirms that the essential oils found in the leaves of lime basil (Ocimum americanum)1, a plant native to Africa; holy basil (Ociumum sanctum)2; and sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum)3, may be toxic to **mosquitoes** and their larvae. But all types of basil are easy to grow with plenty of sun, so try multiple varieties and experiment! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
