## 89 Fun Facts What Colors Look Good With Blue Hair | What Color Looks Best On Dirty Blondes With Blue Eyes

-   The first thing to base your decision on is your skin tone. If you have a cool complexion and blond hair, bright white shirts bring out the best things about your features. Silver jewelry and cool tones like ice **blue** or mint green look shockingly good on you. If you are warm-toned, you should play up the peachiness in your complexion and wear **colors** such as coral, warm red and yellow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Think about where you’ll be going. This might sound obvious, but if you’re going to be rocking **blue** hair at school or work, you’ll want to make sure that it’s appropriate for those environments. Since **blue** is one of the less common and bolder hair **colors**, it’s a little harder to pull off in more formal settings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   There are a few tricks to be sure you’re choosing the right hair **colors** for your skin tone. First, your eyes are a great indication of your skin tone. If they are **blue** or green, chances are your skin tone is cool. If you find flecks of gold, then your skin tone is warm. Still not sure?

-   If you want a dark **blue** that borders on the medium-dark section of the spectrum and retains a saturated richness, then consider this type of color.

Bleaching your hair can cause scalp irritation if you are particularly sensitive, or if not applied by a professional. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Don’t use a conditioner, otherwise, the dyeing process can be hindered. When you do the coloring itself, make sure you have enough dye. Light **blue** hair **colors** aren’t as easy to apply as more natural shades, so make sure you have plenty of dye to work with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This one’s for fans of bob haircuts. Since the bob is a shorter style, dyeing it makes it bolder and helps it stand out more. This hair is a dark **blue**berry with lowlights of darker **blue** throughout to create an overall dark look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some **colors** serve to shift the appearance of **blue** eyes. For example, wearing a **blue**-violet top makes **blue** eyes take on a purple hue, whereas a teal shirt brings out the green undertones in **blue** eyes. Steer clear of **blue** eye makeup, though, as this distracts rather than highlights the **blue** of your eyes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The lighter the **blue** color is, the more natural it looks. If you have really light **blue** locks, you can darken the top a little to keep the image more stunning. Otherwise, your hair might look closer to blonde. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to go blonde, you’ve got a number of great options. Reese Witherspoon’s sun-kissed look is a classic example of someone with **blue** eyes and tan skin understanding what works for them. Her warm skin is complemented by her locks, and the icy **blue** eyes are very striking amidst all that warmth! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An olive/dark skin-with –**blue**-eyes combination is a rare gem that's worth celebrating and showing off to its best. You too can work either cool or warm hues depending on your skin tone. Here are six more examples: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Trend-forward denim hair color is like your favorite pair of jeans: instantly appealing, warm and comfy. This hair color shade is on the lighter side like a color of much-washed denim. Try it as a **blue** ombre as an all-over **blue** hair color in a chic, short bob hairstyle. The best part? It naturally matches with one of the best items in your closet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just like your complexion, your shade of blond ranges from cool to warm. Platinum blond is the coolest shade on the spectrum, and rose-gold blond -- a combination of honey, apricot and gold tones -- is one of the warmest. Cool-hued blondes look stunning in true red and almost any shade of **blue**, particularly vibrant electric **blue**. Warmer-toned blondes tend to look best in rich, autumnal **colors** like orange, rust, or deep chocolate brown. Another classic look is an outfit made up of monochromatic neutrals like cream. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pastel **blue** hair is everyone’s number one choice. This color gives your funky hair an ideal touch of elegance. Adding subtle green streaks become unparalleled peek-a-boo. Bring out the mermaid in you in its most real sense with this light **blue** hair color and enjoy the heads turning your way all day, every day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, you should always go to a respected salon professional when dying your hair. They have the very highest quality dyes which can last much longer. Plus, they’re experts are helping you choose which hair **colors** suit your **blue** eyes. There’s also less of a chance of suffering from an allergic reaction to the dye if you visit a professional colorist. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So we’ve covered light hair and dark hair – but what if you want something in between? You could always be a little daring and opt for knock-out red hair. Emma Stone is the classic example of someone who can pull off the pale skin and **blue** eyes, with her textbook cool undertones. Jessica Chastain and Christina Hendricks also make this look work for them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Celebrities and social media stars are loving this deep-**blue** hair color shade. Whether you add **blue** to your dark natural hair tones or lighten hair to achieve this look, it’s a classic **blue** hair color shade that will turn heads from one angle and look brown or black from another. Navy **blue** hair works well on anyone with a warm and dark complexion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light **blue** hair color is a wonderful choice for many girls and women all over the planet. Just take a look at how balanced these hairstyles look. There is nothing outrageous or extravagant about them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ashy, white, silver or platinum blonde hair are a great complement to pale skin that contains red undertones. When it comes to color, remember that opposites attract. Any light cool blonde will neutralize pink skin so it’s an ideal hair color for pale skin and **blue** eyes. If your hair was white blonde as a child, then this color will suit your fair skin the best. Pale beauties like Gwen Stefani are famous for their platinum locks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This got me wondering about what **colors** look best with gray hair. So I’ve spent the past few weeks reading all about it online and in books like Anne Kreamer’s “Going Gray.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s a subtle way to incorporate color that still looks great. Of course, if you have lighter hair, the effect is much more dramatic. If you’re seeking a muted **blue** hairstyle, this is the look for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I don’t believe in restricting yourself. My only advice on color would be to hold **colors** up against your face and see how your skin reacts to that color. Have fun and experiment! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to choosing a hair color, we also need to pay attention to the importance of skin tone. Two people could have **blue** eyes and dark hair, but their skin tones can be completely different. One may have skin which is prone to burning in the sun and has a ‘cool’ tinge to it. The other may have skin which tans when exposed to the sun and comes across as warmer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here’s a final light-meets-dark look that combines a frosty silver top with dark **blue**. The silver blends into **blue** at about eye level, which means the hair is mostly **blue**. The silver on the top provides a healthy amount of contrast and gives this look a style of its own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Neon hair **colors** are sweeping every fashion magazine, and there’s no more vivid hair color than electric **blue**. Especially striking on pale skin tones, this hairstyle works well for anyone who loves to stand out. Amp the look up to 10 with a complementary fuchsia pink or statement neon purple lip. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pale babes know that strawberry, amber and rust are some of the best hair **colors** for light skin. Stars like Jessica Chastain and Emma Stone know how well their cool undertones are complemented by a warm red-like copper shade. You’ll want to mix cool and warm tones in your dye to achieve a creamy color with hints of copper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want hair **colors** for light skin that aren’t in the blonde family, try taking your look to the other end of the color spectrum with a rich espresso shade. Dark brown hair may be too intense for cool-toned skin but it’s ideal for those with warmer or more olive-toned skin. The contrast makes skin appear porcelain-like and suits green eyes beautifully. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pastel pink, purple or **blue**. Again, these pale **colors** work well with pale skin and are perfectly offset by **blue** eyes. If you have warmer tones in your skin, you might find these pastel shades hard to pull off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You simply can't make a blanket statement about what looks good on people with blond hair. Thanks to some serious improvements in hair coloring technology there are a multitude of different shades of blond -- from chic platinum to brilliant gold to warm honey. Aside from your blond tone, there are several factors to take into consideration when choosing **colors** that complement your own unique palette. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1. Cool ash blond: When in doubt, look at the color wheel. Opposite medium to dark **blue**, you'll find yellow, which is why cool and neutral ashy hair **colors** look so good with **blue** and gray/violet eyes. Think bronde (brunette + blond), beige and champagne combinations to give your hair some depth and create an overall ashy shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fair-skinned beauties often choose blonde when it comes to hair color for skin tone. If you’ve got yellow or even olive undertones choose a warm blonde color such as caramel, amber or butterscotch. Ashy blonde can wash olive skin out easily so choose something warm. Chances are, if you have light-colored eyes such as light **blue**, green, light hazel, or golden brown, then a warm blonde is for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   5. CLEAR: Dark medium brown to black hair. Very light or medium skin tone. Bright eye colours (green, **blue** or hazel) or dark brown (This one is MEEEE). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a darker look, draw inspiration from the beautiful Megan Fox. Her warm skin tone and amazing **blue** eyes work well with any number of hair **colors**, but she consistently chooses a deep brown with warm, lighter brown highlights. This gives the style a bit of body and dimension rather than being one color all over. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before dyeing your bleached hair light **blue**, you need to make sure that your hair is squeaky clean. Any buildup can cause the color to be distributed unevenly. The best way to get your hair clean is to purchase a special pre-color shampoo. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A midnight **blue** hair color shade is the perfect way to add a creative twist to dark hair. A dark **blue** hair shade is a **blue** color so rich that it has touches of black and purple. Avoid black clothes if you choose a dark **blue** hair color shade, and keep your look bright with yellows and metallic-hued clothes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This light **blue** shade is for those who want to make a superb style statement. It highlights your overall bold look with a brilliant shade of lighter **blue** on top. The goth in you is going to love this hair color more than anything because it creates an ideal contrast between your subtle **blue** hair and dark personality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not all dark **blue**s are the same. As you’ve seen in this article, there are all kinds of shades of dark **blue**, so that’s something to think carefully about when choosing a color. You don’t need to become a color theory expert. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re into darker shades, consider stealing this idea for your next trip to the hair salon. Dark chocolate with subtle sunkissed highlights can be your best choice if you have skin with warm undertones and gray or **blue** eyes. The soft hints of blonde make this hair look flattering and natural, and add an incredible glow to the face. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fashion **colors** are extremely popular right now and **blue** is a top contender. Blue hair lets you have a lot of freedom due to the variety of shades that you can choose from when going **blue**. This hair color also fades great and can last an extremely long time. When it comes to choosing a **blue** color for your hair, you can have a lot of fun with the color and your style. If you want to style your hair different and need a bigger change, **blue** is a great option to go with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you don’t want to be a blonde, you always have the option of going over to the dark side. One of the most amazing hair **colors** for those with **blue** eyes, fair skin, and a cool skin tone is jet black. This dramatic hair change is very striking. Follow in the footsteps of Alexis Bledel, Katy Perry and Zooey Deschanel with this show-stopping style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to go for a striking redhead look, opt for shades that have the same amount of warmth in them. If your skin gets freckly in the sun, a gentle cinnamon shade could enhance your skin and make those **blue** eyes pop. If you’re quite pale with warm undertones, choose a rich coppery red. If your skin is darker, go for a bright popping red, like Rihanna, whose lighter eyes look fantastic with such a contrasting style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light **blue** ombre looks especially fantastic when you mix different shades of **blue**. You can add a few purple strands to improve the look even further. Keep the darker color on top and lighter on the bottom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   4. Cinnamon brown: Imagine rich, warm brown with a hint of coppery shine where the light hits. Cinnamon brown looks stunning with **blue** eyes and pale skin, and you can customize how strong you want the copper to show through. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A short haircut is ideal to show off **blue** hair color. Dye the shoulder-length bob cut with bangs in a pastel **blue** shade with subtle darker patches in between. The electric green temples spice up this brisk look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Having **blue** eyes and fair skin means there’s a good chance that you have pink, **blue** or purple undertones in your skin. This doesn’t mean that you have pink or purple skin. It just means that you have ‘cool’ undertones. If you turn over your wrist, you’ll probably see **blue** and purple veins, whereas someone with warmer skin might see green veins. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not everyone wants to keep their hair within the natural shades most people are born with. If you’re looking for a playful color but have pale skin, avoid deep jewel tones that will look too harsh on pale skin. Unicorn **colors** in pastels will suit fair skin best.
