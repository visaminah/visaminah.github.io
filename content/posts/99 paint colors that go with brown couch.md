Whatever way you connect with brown, there are several **colors** to play with while finding the exact balance on your walls or other accent space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   7. White Wall Paint. If you decorate an old house and enjoy traditional home design, it is hard to find a **paint** color that would complete old furniture better than white. We can’t help admiring the charm of the old dark brown furniture (that is, by the way, 150-year-old and passed down in the family) and how the whites make it the star of the show. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Shades of brown – You can actually pair brown furniture with brown curtains. In fact, the color brown is one of the best **colors** to use in a monochromatic scheme. Pairing brown furniture with brown curtains are a perfect choice if you want to create a calm, subdued and sophisticated atmosphere. Contrary to popular belief, repeating the same hue from a single color family will not make your room appear dull or bland. Keeping the same color of curtains and furniture will help create an illusion that the room is bigger than it is. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A classic pairing of black and brown looks bold and sophisticated. Here, shiplap wall paneling is **paint**ed in the darkest shade of ebony, while a traditional dresser and matching throw pillows add warmth. Off-white curtains and bedding provide just the right amount of contrast and keep the bedroom design from feeling too dark and heavy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like pink, peach lightens up brown leather, keeping it from looking too serious. In this living room, the team at Regan Baker Design chose soft, sorbet-like **colors** to accent the neutral walls and sofa. The peach wall art, pillow, and ottoman give the space a sweet, summery vibe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pair your dark or light brown furniture with a beige **paint** color, as shown in this living room. The neutral walls complement the earthy nature of brown and result in a warm and inviting atmosphere. Take the scheme a step further with a brown and beige area rug and wood picture frames. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to heighten the drama in a space clad in dark or light brown,go with an eccentric shade of Fuchsia as your complementary **colors**. Rooms with shades of brown as the dominant color can easily go from bland to full of energy with the quirky hue of Fuchsia. Together, this lovely color combination results to a space that is rich, sophisticated and lively — a perfect blend of playful and formal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yellow is one of the brightest and most lively complimentary **colors** of brown. Combined with brown it can create an exceptionally cheery, energetic and bright atmosphere while also adding charm to a space. Bright shades of yellow like canary, tuscany, amber, honey, yellow gold and fire makes a room look lively and fun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Consider the color of your brown sofa and the overall color scheme. The actual color, hue and shade of your brown couch will also pretty much dictate which **colors** you can use. Does your brown sofa have a deep rich chocolate brown color, is it more of a light khaki to beige or does it have a bright reddish copper tinge to it? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here is a look at the best **paint** **colors** that go with brown furniture, classified according to the effect you want to achieve. You can mix and match these recommendations and apply it to the rest of the room (e.g. color of walls to go with brown floors) when brown is part of your color scheme: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rich earth tones, on the other hand, are unconventional choices yet effective wall **colors** that go well with brown furniture. These **colors** help heighten the drama in a space that is dominated by brown. Flushed with arm undertones, rich earth tones help make your space feel more welcoming and inviting when combined with brown furniture. Examples of rich earth tones that go with brown furniture are golds, yellows, mustard, oranges and rust and deep purples. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rose is one of the trendiest **colors** in the design scene today. Not only is it popularly used in fashion, but also in interiors as well. Considered to be more on the feminine side, rose can be used to create color schemes that are charming, sophisticated and luxurious. This subtle shade is soft on the eyes and just looks better and better the more you look at it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bring out the golden undertones of your brown furniture by **paint**ing your walls a sunny shade of yellow. In this bedroom, the combo adds an energizing pop of color without feeling overbearing. As demonstrated here, limit the vibrant hue to one accent wall behind the bed. The adjacent white walls and light flooring will temper the warm pairing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A more unexpected pairing that you might not come up with yourself is pairing browns with purple. Deeper shades of purples and browns can make larger spaces feel cozy in a way that brighter **colors** can’t achieve. When pairing purple and brown, always focus on the opposites. Darker woods like walnut pair well with pastel purples, and lighter brown woods pair well with deep shades of purple like plum or bright shades like amethyst. Brown and purple work very well in a room with yellow accents as well, if you’re looking to add a third color to your color scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, if both of those options I’ve mentioned are still not enough color for you then let me introduce you to two bold **colors** that work really well with brown sofas. Meet mustard yellow and tangerine orange. You of course don’t have to use them both but they work really well together in this space above. Add in some white accents and you have a very nicely balanced living room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Contrast is one of the key elements of interior design. This visual effect creates depth and adds a dimension to a space and can be achieved through the use of varying **colors** and textures. In contrast, you can visually heighten the drama in the space or tone down the warmth or coolness of color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The color blue, in general, is very calming and relaxing — in fact, this color is often associated with peace. When used in interior spaces, the color blue has the ability to create an appeasing atmosphere. It is one of the best **colors** to use in spaces where a relaxing ambiance is needed, like bedrooms, living rooms and studies. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you have a lot of wood pieces — like a coffee table, dining set, or dresser — or upholstered items flaunting a brown hue, the first thing to consider is: ​What's the overall vibe you're going for?​ Brown is a very grounding color, and depending on the shade, it can lean dark and moody or light and airy. The size of your space and the amount of light that it receives will also affect the look and feel. With all of that in mind, the following list of **colors** is a great place to start. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It will also depend on the intensity of the color of the furniture, whether it is dark brown or light brown. Ideally, if your furniture is dark brown like wenge, chocolate brown or umber, it is better to opt for a lighter wall color so as not to overwhelm the space and make it too heavy on the eyes — think light neutrals and light blues and greens. While if your furniture is leaned towards a lighter shade of brown, use medium to dark **paint** **colors** — such as muted greens and blues and medium neutrals. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Harmony is all about making all your design elements blend in the space. If you want your brown furniture to complement with the rest of the space, opt for a **paint** color that belongs to the same color family — which means your choices are limited to **paint** **colors** that are at least one to two shades lighter than your furniture. Think shades of brown like khahi, light tan,sand, mocha, tortilla or taupe. These **colors** add to the warm, cozy atmosphere and the organic feel of the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown furniture doesn’t have to be boring or reminiscent of hand-me-downs. Brown can be sophisticated, warm, earthy, soothing, glam, elegant, and more, depending on your vision for the space. Whether your furniture is wooden and naturally brown, upholstered, or **paint**ed, you can transform it into an envy-inspiring statement piece. You don’t need a full-scale renovation to design the room of your dreams, either. All you need is a coat of **paint** and a little creativity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   9. Green Walls. You may never go wrong mixing earth tones. Going darker on skirting, moldings, paneling, and doors is a great alternative to **paint**ing adjacent walls bold accent **colors**. This room with cardroom green **paint** and brown furniture is an ultimate proof. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here’s the deal, when decorating a space that has a brown couch as a focal point, you have to balance the heaviness of the brown furniture. You can balance the furniture with different shades of **paint**, window treatments, accessories, rugs, and even pillows. Consider this, if you have a dark chocolate brown sofa, dark moody walls, and then layer on darker accents like a rug – your space will feel dark. That is not always a bad thing. If you are looking for a moody and warm space, then that may work for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a monochromatic palette, consider various shades of cream, beige, tan, caramel, or mocha. You can add these into the room in various ways, whether through wall **paint** or through furniture, textiles, planters, frames, and artwork. Also consider combining light and dark shades for contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you absolutely do not want an orange room but still want to design a contemporary room, consider a deep, glossy brown for the walls. Brown on brown may seem redundant, but switching up the sheen can add interest while maintaining a sense of continuity. Plus, a high-gloss **paint** will reflect light and open up the space, as opposed to creating a cave-like atmosphere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Accentuate the warmth of brown leather with bold maroon. Whether you choose to incorporate the color through **paint**, throw pillows, or a rug, this deep shade of red will add an instant dose of drama to your space. In this room above, the patterned area rug breaks up the brown of the furniture and floors, while a large plant brings extra contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
