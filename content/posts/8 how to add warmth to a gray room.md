## 8 Tips for How To Add Warmth To A Gray Room | How To Add Warmth To A Cool Room
-   Large jute or other natural-fiber area rugs will add **warmth** and a pale color tone to your floors. The texture will add interest, too. And, greenery in large, leafy plants adds a lot of color with little effort. For a wider variety in colors and a quiet, cohesive look, find fabrics, throws, and pillows in mostly white or **gray**, but with stripes in indigo, pale turquoise, cognac, burgundy, or earthy tones. Or choose an area rug with a lot of colors you like, and use those colors for inspiration for your accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do: Choose Blues“When selecting **gray** paint, I like to pick colors with warm or blue undertones,” Owens says. “A couple of my favorite **gray** paint colors are Anew Gray by Sherwin Williams at 25 percent strength for a light fresh look or Bunny Gray by Benjamin Moore for cool undertones.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s been a sea change in the design world over the last few years when it comes to neutrals. Taupes, khakis, and other forms of beige have fallen to the wayside in favor of a new favorite tone: **gray**. With the calmness of a blue, **warmth** of a tan, and subtlety of a cream, **gray** is a versatile color that works well in both traditional spaces and über-modern ones, and is as useful as the backdrop to an eclectically outfitted home as it is the base for a minimal one. But with infinite shades to choose from, it can be hard to find the right hue. AD asked three designers for their top dos and don’ts when it comes to using **gray**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do: Work With Light“When you decide to paint a room or decorate with **gray**, consider the kind of lighting the room gets,” Huh says. “A sunny room may look best with a strong warm **gray**, while a northern-facing room with blue light may look best with a subtle cool **gray**.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Don’t: Veer Pink“It’s important to pick **gray** paint that doesn’t have any pink or purple undertones,” advises California-based designer Becki Owens. “You’d be surprised at the impact those subtle undertones will have on a space. They don’t work well as neutrals. You want colors that create a classic, soothing palette on which you can then build and layer the rest of your design.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do: Consider Tone“Not all **gray**s are alike,” says Young Huh, the founder and principal of New York–based Young Huh Interiors. “There are warm **gray**s and there are cool **gray**s, and in general it’s best to keep all colors in one of those two tonal lanes.” Don’t bog down a crisp **gray** with creamy whites, she warns: “If you’re painting a wall a cool blue **gray**, it’s best if you paint the trim a cool **gray** white. Warmer whites will make the room look dingy.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Q: I moved last fall into a brand-new apartment (a rental) and it's all **gray** inside — everything, including the floor, cabinets, counter, and walls. My furniture is mostly **gray**, too. Because there aren't a lot of windows, during the winter, the **gray** makes my place feel dark and cold. How can I warm things up without painting? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A: Grays and whites are extremely popular right now. And I have to be honest; I do love this trend. However, my house is mostly white, not **gray**, and the furnishings are where I brought in both light and dark **gray**s, with iron and wood tones. Too bad the builders of your apartment didn't contrast something — the floor, the cabinets, or the ceiling — with different shades of **gray** or white to add interest and an airy feeling, especially because you don't have a lot of natural light. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
