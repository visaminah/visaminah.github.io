## 83 Unexpected Facts About How To Save Burnt Grass | How To Fix Burnt Grass From Tarp
-   Burnt **grass** can make your lawn look unsightly. It could be from a fungal infection, hot weather, lack of water, or even watering your lawn during the wrong time of day. Whatever the cause, you want a green lawn again. But how do you get **burnt** **grass** to turn green? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fertilizer burns **grass** when it’s applied incorrectly. This is primarily due to mineral salts, which are the basic components of chemical fertilizers. For example, if you over-fertilize, minerals accumulate and dry out in the soil, resulting in yellow or brown **grass** and fertilizer burn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you know what your lawn is deficient in, or if there is room to add a little slow-release nutrition, now is the time to add these nutrients. Be sure to follow the directions provided by the manufacturer to a T. More fertilizer than recommended is never better and may result in more **burnt** **grass**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best way to fix **grass** that’s been burned by fertilizer is by watering it immediately. This process is simple; you need to soak the entire affected area of **grass** thoroughly. To do this, it’s best to set up your sprinkler system so it covers the entire affected area without disturbing the soil surface any more than necessary. If the **grass** remains yellow after this process, you may need to re-seed it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If a large area is **burnt**, you may find it difficult to water by hand, and you may need to deploy a sprinkler. To ensure the lawn gets watered at regular intervals, you might want to consider connecting the garden hose to a timer and programming the timer to come on in the early morning so the water has a chance to soak in before the sun comes out and bakes it off. Use a craft stick or a pipe cleaner to check the depth of moisture in the soil and set the run time long enough to moisten to a depth of at least 5 inches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether or not **burnt** **grass** will grow back depends on the extent of the damage. Grassroots often survive even when the blades are dead or damaged. This is how **grass** grows back after freezing temperatures or extreme drought. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Burnt **grass** is sometimes the result of heat or even flame. This can occur naturally — i.e., in the case of wildfire — or in areas containing firepits, grills, or heat-creating equipment. Lawns with deep root systems often survive mild or moderate damage caused by fire or extreme heat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I recommend fixing the issues that caused the **burnt** **grass** and then waiting to see if new growth emerges. This is the best way to determine if the **grass** is truly dead or not. While it could take some time for your lawn to completely grow back, you should see new growth within a couple of weeks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fertilizer burn can happen to all types of plants. It’s particularly common in Kentucky blue**grass** and St. Augustine **grass** since they’re fairly shallow-rooted, and fertilizer that’s applied too close to the surface can easily damage these types of **grass**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another thing to be aware of is leaf blight, also known as Ascochyta which is a fungus. This is a lawn disease that can appear overnight. It will cause shoots of **grass** to turn yellow or brown and it almost looks like the **grass** has a chemical burn. The main cause of this is stress and we start to see a lot of leaf blight in Colorado as soon as summer hits. There may be areas where the soil’s moisture is constantly fluctuating, having an irrigation system that is evenly watering the **grass** and aeration in the spring can be used as preventative measures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All dog owners are familiar with the toll their pet’s day-to-day bathroom habits can have on a lawn. Of course, it’s not just dogs that can damage turf **grass** in this way. But in most neighborhoods, they’re the most likely culprits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, if there is any fertilizer remaining on the lawn, sweep it up or vacuum to remove it from the **grass**. Soak the area until the ground can’t absorb any more, then water it deeply every day for at least a week to dilute and flush out the excessive mineral salts. As you keep watering your lawn with generous amounts of water, yellow and sometimes even brown **grass** will bounce back and recover in time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are three reasons- over-fertilization, drought, dog urine, for **burnt** **grass**. If the lawn turns brown after hard work, it will make upset the lawn owner or caretaker. We describe here about the repairing procedure of **burnt** **grass**es cause of over-fertilization. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may be relieved to learn that **burnt** **grass** is not necessarily a death sentence for your lawn. In many cases, it’s entirely possible to restore your lawn to its former glory. However, be prepared for the recovery process to take time and a bit of work on your behalf, especially if you want to achieve optimal results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When **grass** gets parched by the sun, the soil often becomes compacted, which prevents water from soaking in and deprives the roots of oxygen. Running over the lawn with a core aerator helps remedy this by loosening the soil and providing pockets into which water can seep. Refrain from mowing and stay off the **grass** as much as possible until it recovers and begins to turn green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When **grass** experiences fertilizer burn, it results in a loss of chlorophyll and cell death in the blade that turns yellow, brown, or even **burnt** looking. It might also become very thin and spottily colored. This typically is caused by too much fertilizer being applied and can even kill the lawn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Plants need the sun to survive. There’s also such a thing as too much of a good thing. Excess sun exposure, especially paired with heat or drought, often results in **burnt** **grass**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When there are more feet on it and higher heat, it doesn’t take much for the lawn to get scorched and die. The first step is to identify what the difference between dead **grass** and brown **grass** is. They both look similar and there is only really one way to find out which it is. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Burnt **grass** may present as yellow or brown **grass** with a dry texture. This foliar damage is indicative of something stressing the root system. Depending on the exact cause, you may notice burn damage develop in isolated patches or across your entire lawn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But with a pro on your side, you can feel confident that you’re taking steps in the right direction. If sun-scorching is a major issue, a pro should be able to guide you toward solutions that will help. Before you know it, you’ll be looking at thick, healthy **grass** again and enjoying your lawn to the fullest. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We have gotten to the part of the year where the temperatures are in the 90s and we aren’t getting much rain. The beautiful lush green **grass** you had in May is starting to look dry and even yellow in some places; these are signs of stress for your lawn. Here are some things on how to fix dry **grass** and make your lawn happy and green again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fertilizer consists of three things- Nitrogen (N), Potassium (K), Phosphorus (P). Chemical fertilizers include salts. A careless or excess fertilization increase the salt level of the soil. That’s why the **grass**es seem yellow or brown color. It is known as ‘fertilizer burn’. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you have leaf blight though, it’s better to treat it sooner than later. We offer a leaf blight treatment here at Erbert Lawns. It comes in the form of a spray and we use it on the specific areas where the leaf blight is. The spray kills the fungus and prevents it from coming back. This treatment needs at least 48 hours to attach itself to the top of the **grass** blades, so it is very important to NOT water your lawn during that time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If **grass** roots aren’t revived by watering, they likely aren’t coming back. At this point, you’ll need to remove the dead **grass** and apply fresh topsoil to the area. Save yourself some time later by taking the time now to rake the topsoil smooth and better prepare for seeding or sodding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   that cause roughly 6″ to 10″ straw-colored patches, and poor soil quality where the soil pH may be too high. acidic, or a sprinkler issue if you have one or larger distinct patches. Brown patches with white-tipped **grass** blades could indicate a chemical burn issue , where a weed killer or herbicide was used improperly and has spread to other plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the other hand, over-fertilization turns the **grass** yellow, which can be recover. But sometimes, it can ruin the **grass**. If the lawn becomes spoil because of over-fertilizing, if you know how to recover it, you can fix it patiently. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should mow to only remove one-third of a blade at a time. And though it’s more work, it’s ideal to mow more often (as often as one to two times per week) than to let the **grass** grow for a while before mowing. The latter puts too much stress on the lawn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although a little work intensive, the above process works well for natural **grass** lawns of all types, sizes, and damage levels. Stick to this plan instead of trying to go with a lawn patch kit. Although they may sound like a great all-in-one fix, these kits should be avoided at all costs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Burnt **grass** is just that, **grass** that looks **burnt** with fire. Technically, **burnt** **grass** can also refer to **grass** burned by a fire, but since Crab**grass**Lawns.com provides expert advice on lawn care, I am referring to spots in your lawn that have turned brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thatch is a natural layer of dead **grass** that builds up on the soil over time. You may notice a rapid increase in your lawn’s thatch layer following burn damage that kills the **grass** blades. A thin layer of thatch can protect the lawn’s roots and prevent things such as soil erosion. However, excess thatch can prevent water and other molecules from reaching the **grass**roots. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Slow-release fertilizer reduces the risk of fertilizer burn by releasing the salts into the soil gradually rather than all at once. Fertilizing with compost: Using compost eliminates the risk of fertilizer burn. Compost contains a host of micronutrients and microorganisms that improve the composition of the soil, making it much more hospitable to **grass**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you see that the **grass**es’ root turns brown, it means this will not be recoverable. It would be best if you decided to replant the area. At this time, follow the steps mention below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of the time, the symptoms be discovering after the day of application. There are several ways to try to recover **burnt** **grass** causes of over-fertilizing. Once you can be sure of the purpose of the damaging and current status of the forage, you can decide what process you should follow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In some cases, the burn is caused by applying fertilizer too close to a watering session. This can be as simple as putting down fertilizer immediately before you water your plants or vice versa. If you fertilize within twenty-four hours before or after a watering session, you risk causing damage to your **grass**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s natural for turf **grass** to go into dormancy during extended periods of drought. More drought-tolerant varieties can withstand several weeks. While the dormant **grass** will be dry and turn yellow or brown, green blades will emerge when conditions improve. If you’re growing a type of **grass** not built for dry weather or the situation is particularly extreme, however, the **grass** may die down to the roots. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You applied the fertilizer to your lawn and a few days later come out to see brown patches of dead **grass** all over it. No one goes out intending to damage their **grass**, but a miscalculation or misguided belief in that “more is better” can cause irreparable harm to the sod. Nitrogen burns, or fertilizer burns, happen when you use too much fertilizer on your lawn. It’s hard to predict how badly the **grass** was burned by the nitrogen, there are too many factors involved including the type of fertilizer that was used, and how quickly you respond. How well the lawn recovers will depend on the latter factor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We know that fertilizer is the food for **grass** or plants. Sprinkling too much fertilizer means you feed an excess of one type of nutrition. Here we are trying to let you know how to get green **grass** back if over-fertilization damage your lawn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Does **burnt** **grass** turn green again? It can, but only if the **grass** only has **burnt** tips. Anything more than 1/4” of burn will likely result in the blade dying back to the initial shoot or even the roots and new blades being produced to replace it. Below are the steps you should follow to get from a lawn that looks **burnt** to a green, healthy lawn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your **grass** is **burnt** because you overdid the lawn fertilizer or left your pet alone in the yard, the best way to flush the chemicals out of the soil is to water deeply every day until the **grass** turns green. Grass normally needs about an inch of water per week, but to heal **burnt** **grass**, you may need to water as much as an inch per day. The water needs to sink deep into the soil and reach the roots, which are often as deep as 5 or 6 inches below the surface. But it's also essential that the soil drains well, because the buildup of water to the point of sogginess can cause **grass** roots to rot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sod will be the easiest and quickest way to replace the **grass**, but you can also use seeds. Follow the instructions on the packet to know whether to spread by hand or with a fertilizer spreader. If using sod, be sure to work it into your soil so that roots can grow rapidly and firmly take hold. Let’s look at the different details of both options: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Check the roots of your **grass** to make sure they’re still alive and healthy. If the roots are moist, flexible, and seem to be in good health, you might be able to save the **grass**. If the roots appear to be dead and brittle, it’s likely that you’ll need to remove the **grass** and reseed it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Overfertilization is the top cause of fertilizer burn to **grass**. This happens when too much fertilizer is applied to the lawn. It can also happen if you use a slow or controlled-release fertilizer. One of the most common ways that people over-fertilize their lawns is by using a fertilizer containing too much nitrogen. While nitrogen is great for the lawn, it can be overdone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nitrogen toxicity causes **grass** blades to become light-green; eventually, they turn yellow. If left untreated, the yard becomes brown and dies. It’s important that weeds don’t take hold in dead areas of your yard because their root systems can go deeper than that of your **grass**, allowing them to compete with your **grass**es for nutrients. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now that you have removed all of the dead **grass** and are sure the same thing won’t happen for the same reason, it’s time to check your lawn’s nutrient levels. This includes nitrogen, calcium, and magnesium. These three nutrients are key to the recovery of any previously-**burnt** **grass**, as well as being necessary for the growth of any new **grass**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Healthy and moist roots mean the **grass** is alive till now, and only it’s top effects. So, the problem may recover with water. Sprinkle the area of **burnt** **grass** with water as soon as possible after you notice the problem. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remove about an inch of soil from where the dead **grass** was removed. The fertilizer that burned your **grass** will still be in this soil because it reached the roots of your **grass**. Removing this soil will keep your new **grass** from being poisoned by too much of the same culprit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Check to see if there are new **grass**roots. If there are, then you have successfully solved your problem. If nothing has happened, the damage is beyond repair and the only thing you can do now is planting new **grass**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your lawn has too much nitrogen, it will quickly turn brown or develop orange or yellow spots. This can be difficult to reverse, so the sooner you catch it, the better. Once the **grass** has been severely burned, there’s typically no turning back, so stop using any products containing phosphorus and potassium immediately. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll need to add water to your **grass** to find out… if it is dead, you will see no change and remain in a poor state. If it is just browning, it can be brought back to life. You’ll need to give it a few inches of consistent watering to get your results. It may result in being patchy so some parts may need to be restored. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your **grass** is not in a very healthy condition, apply fertilizer very lightly to easily bring it back to life. It’s normal to feel the urge to feed the **grass** heavily, but this will do it more harm than good. Weak **grass** is more prone to fertilizer burns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s difficult to predict whether the lawn will recover or not. It is up to the excess amount of fertilizer, moisture availability, and forage’s health. Yellow striped **grass**es have possibilities to be recover, but crunchy need to remove and to replant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Watering after you’ve applied fertilizer is essential to its proper absorption and distribution throughout the soil. Without water, fertilizer will not be able to penetrate dry spots or be taken up by plants; instead, it will sit on top of the soil (or damage **grass**) until it evaporates. Slow-release fertilizer: Slow-release fertilizer reduces the risk of fertilizer burn by releasing the salts into the soil gradually rather than all at once. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When top growth dies back, it can take 3 or more weeks for new growth to emerge from the remaining root system. Note that this waiting period generally won’t start until the **grass** senses it is safe to grow again — i.e. when the initial cause of burn damage is eliminated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your **grass** has been **burnt** by a spell of hot, dry weather, it has a good chance of recovering with regular watering, and you'll want to do this in the early morning or late evening. It may look terrible but don't assume it's dead until you've deep watered regularly for a week or so. Although you don't need to flush chemicals from the soil, you do need to get water to the roots, so use the same watering regimen you would use for chemically **burnt** **grass**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How long your **burnt** **grass** will take to recover depends on the severity of the burn, what caused it, and how quickly you were able to intervene. For example, if you have **burnt** tips on your **grass** from watering during a time of the day that was too sunny and hot, all you need to do is mow your lawn, wait a week, and mow again. As long as you keep watering your lawn in the early morning during this time and your soil is healthy, your lawn should be back to its usual green in 8 days. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another common occurrence is for the bag to accidentally drop on the lawn and spill onto your **grass**. It’s important to watch for spilling fertilizer and clean up any mishaps as they happen. Be sure to pick up any solid waste that may have fallen out of bags during the application, then use a rake or leaf blower to remove all dry matter from your lawn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Burnt **grass** may or may not be dead. However, already damaged blades will not heal even with treatment. If the root system remains intact, though, you will see new, green **grass** take the **burnt** blades’ place. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Burnt **grass** isn’t just unsightly. If your lawn is turning yellow or brown, it’s also a clear sign that something more is going on beneath the surface. More often than not, **burnt** **grass** is a direct symptom of stress or damage to the root system. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As the sun heats up, you’ll likely soon be slathering on the sunscreen and doing what you can to prevent sunburn. But one thing that you might not think much about is your lawn and the fact that it can’t escape the sun. In fact, you might be surprised to learn that a lawn can actually get sun**burnt** (or sun-scorched, as it’s also called). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We understand you are likely worried about whether sun**burnt** **grass** will grow back. The answer depends upon the severity. If your **grass** is truly dead, it isn’t going to miraculously grow back. But oftentimes, homeowners assume their lawn is dead when it’s really not. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here you could know how to fix **burnt** **grass** from over fertilizing. We hope it will help you a lot. It is unpredictable that your lawn will come back as before. But you should take a chance to repair it. If the **grass** is not dead, then a possibility remains to be cured. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because the **grass** is stressed, one treatment for **burnt** **grass** means water and lots of it. The roots need to absorb it, and the soil needs to be flushed out and cleansed. If you act quickly, the **grass** can recover in a week or so, but if you wait too long and the roots die, there's little recourse but to sow new seed or lay more turf. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may find that **burnt** **grass** grows back thinner or in patches. This is to be expected if the root system was partially damaged as well. In my experience, overseeding is typically the fastest and most effective fix. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is a surprising way that sugar can help to solve the problem. Sugar impregnate the soil, benefit the microbes to keep the **grass** alive. Measurement is one-pound sugar for 300 sq. feet area. Avoid weed killers, fertilizer while adding sugar. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pet urine can also be to blame. It contains huge amounts of nitrogen, which in high concentration, can harm your lawn. If you have been noticing patches of discolored **grass** lately, your four-legged friend could be the culprit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fixes for burned lawns may include watering more to leach the salts from the ground, fertilizing with a fertilizer containing lower percentages of nitrogen and potassium, or installing new **grass**. Ultimately, lawns with fertilizer burn require a generous amount of water to get back to normal. You may need to soak the affected areas for an hour every day for about a week. Once the lawn begins to green up again, you can resume your normal watering schedule. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mowing regularly and not cutting it too short. We recommend that your **grass** is cut at around 3 inches. This length is good because the **grass** can shade the soil and keep its roots safe from the sun. Cutting it shorter than that may look nice at first, but it won’t as soon as the **grass** begins to be stressed and it will look burned. Learn more about how to achieve a healthy root system here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fertilizer recommendations are given for a reason. Follow the instructions on the package to prevent over-fertilizing. Water well after fertilization: Watering after you’ve applied fertilizer is essential to its proper absorption and distribution throughout the soil. Without water, fertilizer will not be able to penetrate dry spots or be taken up by plants; instead, it will sit on top of the soil (or damage **grass**) until it evaporates. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a few things that you can do to remedy sun**burnt** **grass**. For one, you can attempt to prevent some of the problems in the first place by alleviating compaction with a good lawn care program that includes lawn aeration. The healthier your lawn is, the better it can stand up to stress (like the sun). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use a spade or other garden tool to dig up the dead **grass** and remove as much soil as possible. Use a sharp hoe to scrape away any excess bits of dead **grass**. Rake up all of the dead blades from your lawn and dispose of them immediately so they don’t return as a breeding ground for pests or disease. Apply fresh topsoil to fill in the holes where the **grass** was removed and loosen compacted soil with a shovel or rake. Spread **grass** seed or lay sod, then water to keep moist until new growth appears. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Prepare to plant new seeds. Warm seasonal **grass** for spring and cool-season seeds for the winter season. Mix the seeds with the soil in 1:3 proportion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your lawn is excessively dry or if you’ve had a dry spell and the **grass** is stressed, adding fertilizer can be too much for it to handle. During times of drought or stress, your **grass**es need water above all else. When you add water and nutrients during this time, it’s possible to cause damage to your lawn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Burnt **grass** will typically not turn green again. The dead, brown parts? They are dead and will no longer green up. The only way to get green **grass** is to remove these dead leaves or patches and support the seeds, sprouts, or root systems that can produce more green blades of **grass**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using compost eliminates the risk of fertilizer burn. Compost contains a host of micronutrients and microorganisms that improve the composition of the soil, making it much more hospitable to **grass**. Fertilizing with organic fertilizers: Using organic fertilizers eliminates the risk of fertilizer burn. These fertilizers are less concentrated than synthetic (chemical) alternatives and often contain other ingredients such as nitrogen-rich manures or kelp extracts that condition soil for improved plant growth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Over-fertilizing is most often a problem when using nitrogen-rich formulas. Since nitrogen is the most important nutrient for plant life, including **grass**, this fact can make proper nutrition a bit tricky for the average person. Measuring all fertilizer applications is crucial to maintaining your lawn and preventing root damage caused by overfeeding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your **grass** is just slightly yellowed, it may be saved. Crispy brown **grass**, on the other hand, may not. All in all, everything boils down to how quickly you act. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can prevent fertilizer burn by applying the fertilizer in moderation. Applying too much fertilizer depletes essential nutrients from the soil, especially nitrogen. It’s best to start with half the recommended rate of fertilizer to ensure the **grass** receives just enough nutrients to thrive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s easy to mistake fertiliser burn for other issues such as disease or insect damage. If you find that your lawn has gone a patchy brown colour the day after you fertilised, go out and take a closer look at one of the brown patches. If you can peel apart the thatch of the lawn and see fertiliser still on the surface, you can confirm it’s probably been **burnt**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Stressed **grass** can easily get over-fertilized too. This is especially true if you have neglected lawn maintenance for a while. Such **grass** will not properly absorb minerals and nutrients from the fertilizer, causing it more susceptible to salt accumulation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Several things can cause **burnt** **grass**. Some are more serious than others. The good news is that — when diagnosed and treated promptly — nearly all cases of **burnt** **grass** can be returned to their former green glory. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To fix sun**burnt** **grass** and prevent future problems, we would also recommend checking your mowing height. Oftentimes, homeowners mistakenly mow shorter than they really ought to. The ideal mowing height is determined by the primary **grass** type on your lawn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sodding has the advantages of quick results and the ability to provide a lawn suited to your specific needs (e.g., shade, **grass** type). However, the process is more expensive than seeding and requires more time before you can walk on it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Keep in mind that this applies primarily to perennial **grass**es. Annual **grass**es are unlikely to return after severe damage caused by drought or fertilizer burn. Unless you know for a fact that your lawn is planted with an annual **grass** — e.g., in the case of winter overseeding of warm-climate lawns — it’s safe to assume that you’re dealing with a perennial **grass** variety. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
