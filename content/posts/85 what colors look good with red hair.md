## 85 Tips to What Colors Look Good With Red Hair | Cool Undertone Colors To Wear
-   If your skin has a peachy undertone, nothing will work better than a coppery shade with a rose undertone finishing the look. A properly chosen shade of **red** hair can balance out the way your hair goes with your skin, forming a totally harmonic look. Therefore, if you’re about to add some **red**dish vibes to your locks, don’t forget to mix it with some rose or pink hues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adding highlights to any hair color will give the end look more depth. And when it comes to **red**heads, in specific, celebrity colorist and Matrix Brand Ambassador Rachel Bodt says that it boils down to low- and high-impact color goals. According to Bodt, low impact **red** hair is characterized by tone on tone color in a way that shows just enough dimension and texture in the most natural way possible, whereas high impact color is all about vibrant, bright hues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best way to ensure seamless blending, according to Madison Reed colorist Shvonne Perkins, is to opt for foil highlights of balayage. "Any type or placement of highlights that works for blondes will work for [**red** hair] highlights," she says. "However, while blondes are often fighting yellow and gold tones, **red**heads should absolutely be embracing these tones. If the base color is **red**, we really want to use soft gold and copper highlights to make the **red** look multi-tonal and soft." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cool-toned browns are definitely a favorite for a cool-toned skin. The brown looks natural and bereft of the warm tones, pairs extremely well with cool skin and blue eyes. This color looks great on all skin **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another way to determine your skin tone is by holding a white piece of paper against your face in a well-lit area with a mirror. If your skin appears to be yellow against the white, you are warm-toned. If your skin appears to be rosy or blueish-**red**, you have cool-toned skin. If it looks ashy, or if you can’t determine what undertones are dominant, you probably have olive skin. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This got me wondering about what **colors** look best with gray hair. So I’ve spent the past few weeks reading all about it online and in books like Anne Kreamer’s “Going Gray.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Auburn hair colour is a beautiful shade of **red** that falls somewhere between the pink and brown tones. It’s usually seen as more natural than other shades because it has hints of copper in its base colour. But don’t be fooled by this hue, there are many different variations to choose from. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Auburn is the so much desi**red** middle ground between **red** and brunette hair **colors**. Also, it’s a fantastic option for women who’d like to add a hint of **red**dish warmth to their brown locks without stepping out of their natural **colors**. Coat your brown shade, whatever it is, with a burning fiery auburn to bring out your hazel or green eyes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   While the deepest version of copper gives a more brunette finish, its lightest shade can bring you closer to the **red**-hair community. Light copper is meant for girls with pale or extremely light skin tones and light eye **colors** like green, blue, and pale hazel. That’s because it has a golden hue which regulates the temperature of the whole look and builds the perfect balance, making the light complexion less drastic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s safe to say that natural **red** hair will never go out of fashion. Everything you need is to find ways to accentuate its spectacular beauty. For instance, this lady opted for a classy wavy hairstyle with side parting that is sure to make her feel like a queen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A light brown complexion should choose their shade around wine **colors**. Yes, you read that right. “To enhance the glow of light brown skin tones, cool **red** shades that have a blue-violet tinge, reminiscent of a merlot wine, would be best,” Christine shares. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "People with blue eyes have quite a few options for hair **colors** that can make them stand out," Laura Gibson, Rusk's artistic director, told POPSUGAR. Hitomi Ikeda, master colorist at Rob Peetoom Salon in Williamsburg, added: " When you have a blue eye color, you can pretty much rock with any shade of blond and brown hair. "Blond is one of the most common hair **colors** for people with blue eyes, and it looks great because it's a natural-looking combo. Just look at celebrities like Gigi Hadid, Taylor Swift, and Jasmine Sanders. But the list of flattering color options doesn't stop there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How about a shade of **red** that can make you drunk once your eyes make a mere sip? It’s hard to imagine the visual impact on those who dare to behold the dimensional beauty of dark **red** **colors**. This deep, mysterious sangria **red** hair color will be a fantastic exclamation point to any girl who’s about to make a sexy statement. If you have a light complexion, the combination of deep dark roots and smooth transition to bloody **red** will bring out your noble look. As for those with medium to dark skin tones, you will love the way this burst of seduction warms up your look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red is different, dramatic, and unexpected. In the right hands, it can be anything. Anything but basic and boring!

-   Hair **colors** can go wrong if you do not consider things like skin tone and eye color. Certain shades would not suit your skin tone and eye color, and the amount you spend on coloring may go waste. So, before you decide the color you want to apply, be aware of your skin tone and the **colors** that complement your eye color. Following the instructions mentioned in the article will help you find out your skin tone. The article also discusses the hair **colors** for blue eyes and different skin tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Almost all shades of brown suit people with warm-toned skin with the exception of ashy shades. Darker shades, however, will do a better job at complementing your blue eye color. If you already have dark hair and want to play it safe, stick to warm browns that are two shades within your natural hair color. Warm browns work with light, medium, and dark skin **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Go for orange. You don't have to warble like the Tango Man to wear this vibrant shade - and for most **red**heads, it won't clash with your hair. Mix it up with subtle colours in a knitted scarf; or give your luggage something to sing about with a Globe Trotter suitcase. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s a colour that’s not as **red** as auburn, and not as bright orange as ginger. Copper is an orange-**red** hue that washes over your locks with hints of yellow and brown. If you’re looking to take your hair color up a notch, this could be the answer for you! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "The hair **colors** that typically look best with blue eyes are platinum blonds, sandy blonds, strawberry blonds, ginger **red**s, auburns, espresso browns, and raven blacks." said Matt Swinney, Rusk's global creative director. These **colors** all give you the "perfect amount of contrast to make blue eyes pop," according to Ikeda. Celebrities examples include Alexandra Daddario, Emma Stone, and Megan Fox, to name a few. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Mahogany is a brunette shade that resembles a rich, **red**dish-brown,” Christine shares. “Adding the touch of **red** to your brown will complement a deeper complexion. It’s similar to burgundy, which has a combination of **red** and purple tones to form a deep tonal **red** color that reflects well against dark brown skin tones.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When I wear them, it’s like the life has gone out of my face – all the color is gone. I start fading away, as I had fea**red**. But when I wear bright **colors** like hot pink or **red**, I look vibrant! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Color-depositing conditioner helps prolong vibrant color. Another way to keep an unnatural color looking vibrant is using a color-depositing conditioner in between salon visits. These pigmented conditioners layer additional color on top of dyed strands to make the color look more intense and help disguise any fading until you can get to the salon for your next touch-up. You can also use different shades of color-depositing conditioners to try out slightly different tones and **colors** on top of your existing fantasy shade! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hair coloring can be scary, especially if you have light eye color, like blue. With color options aplenty, it is so easy to go wrong. But there are some truly inc**red**ible hair **colors** for blue-eyed women that can make things right. We have compiled a list of hair **colors** that complement blue eyes and different skin tones. Continue reading to know more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Auburn can be as different as you want it to be. Since it’s a combination of warm **red** and deep brunette hair **colors**, you can always make one of the shades more or less intense, thus adjusting the temperature of your hair look. As for this glistening auburn, you can achieve it by adding a light **red** tint over your brunette base. Of course, the idea works best on fair complexions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While most peachy color ideas feature something soft and subtle, you can move in the opposite direction and show another side of the popular idea. Such contrastive looks can’t do without **red** ombre, which, in its turn, should form a seamless blend with your roots. The best thing is, a dramatic shade like this will suit any complexion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turn heads with this lush, juicy shade of copper. This hue looks great with fair to medium skin tones, and is a good choice for any hair length. However, keep in mind that such bright **colors** require proper maintenance to shine longer. So, ask your hair stylist about products that will help your locks stay bright. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light shades of **red** hair flatter women and girls whose natural hair color is dark blonde. These are going to bring out the playful note of your look, softening your facial features and adding a naughty spark to your eyes. If you have black or brunette hair, you may enhance it with a darker shade. Natural **red**heads also benefit from dyeing their lock, making the color richer and better defined. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Looking to stay light in your color? Christine says a rose gold will look great on anyone with an olive complexion. “If you’re staying on the lighter side, the best **red** shade that will avoid feeling washed out will be a rose gold tone,” she notes. “Olive skin tones suit **red**s with a blue-violet under, such as auburn, burgundy, and mahogany.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This meant that I would look great in “jewel-like” tones like sapphire blue, ruby **red**, and emerald green. (Being a rebellious teenager in the mid-1980s, and an art student in the late 1980s/early 1990s, I, of course, ditched those **colors** and only wore black. For freakin’ decades!) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Glossy hair colours are a good way to add some life into dull and damaged hair. A deep **red** pai**red** with a glossy finish will satisfy your need to keep the glamour quotient tuned to the maximum at all times. It also looks great with silk sarees! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another rich, illuminating, and lightweight **red** hair color that will leave everyone speechless. This shade will suit anything from light to medium complexions, giving a warm finish that will accentuate any outfits. Besides, if you start with a brunette base, you will have less damage, as this color consists of brown and golden-**red** shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   New hair color, new makeup choices. Because **red** hair is so vibrant, you want to choose makeup **colors** that don’t compete with it. Since I went **red**, I’ve relied on subtle greens and purples for pops of color. However, don’t steer away from **red** lipstick. Jessica Chastain is a perfect example of a **red**head who wears a **red** lip successfully. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purple is the perfect compromise when you cannot decide between a warm and cool-toned color. It has both, blue and **red** undertones which play well with the neutral skin tone. The blue undertones help bring out the blue of your eyes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have dark black color hair, simply adding a few highlights of balayage or ombré inspi**red** by **red** tones will do the trick. The benefit is you do not change your entire hair color, and only a few highlights bring out the blue color of your eyes. You could also add some carefully placed sections of deep **red** that intensify as you move down the hair length. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the summer, keep it sheer with tinted moisturizer in a slightly warmer shade to emphasize the color of your freckles. This shade should be somewhere between the color of your freckles and underlying skin tone. In the winter months, emphasize the underlying skin tone color and use thicker moisturizer and foundation. You can cancel out **red**ness with yellow-based foundation and concealer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pairing your brand new shade of **red** with your dark roots is a classy idea not only because it’s trendy. As a matter of fact, dark roots allow you to extend the life of your coloring. Make sure to find a professional who can apply the color so that it has a seamless transition with the roots. As a result, you will still have a decent shade when your roots start to grow out. Plus, ginger looks radiant with dark brunette roots. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your hair is silver, white, or mostly gray, you will find that silver or pewter jewelry will now look great. In fact, your gold earrings may clash with your hair. Two-tone gray hair (with lots of brown or **red** still mixed in) can wear gold or silver. Earrings of mixed gold and silver are a good investment as silver will pick up the new tones in your hair, while the gold allows you to wear gold bracelets, buttons or other gold accessories.

-   How about you to amaze everyone with the purest form of ombre? Yes, we’re talking about the good old dark-to-light combinations. Only this time, we’ll show you this idea in the **red** hair context. Those who have brunette hair **colors** can lighten up only the midshafts, while other bases will require total bleaching. An orange hue will be a breath of fresh air to your brunette base that will show off your bright self. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Color-safe shampoo is a must. One way you can stave off fading is by switching to a sulfate-free shampoo for colo**red** hair as soon as you get your hair dyed. These formulas are gentler and made without harsh ing**red**ients that can strip dye and fade your hair faster. Using color-safe shampoo from the start will help preserve your new color longer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Apart from playing around with intensiveness and temperature of your **red** hair, there’s one more detail to experiment with: the undertone. Peach cobbler is a growing trend born in LA. As you know, everything viral comes from LA, and this hair color is no exception: while looking like a classic copper, it has a soft golden and peachy tones hiding underneath. Needless to say, if you have a light complexion with a peachy undertone, you’ve just found your perfect shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cherry **red** is a whole new level of **red** hair. It has a purple undertone, yet still has a prevailing **red** base. From some perspective, it may reflect brunette vibes, and once the light shines on it, it will show its fiery side. In other words, if you like being different, you won’t go wrong with this shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Red hair is having a moment. From Jessica Chastain‘s bright copper to Amy Adams‘ strawberry blonde, the color made some show-stopping appearances on the **red** carpet this season. Thinking of going **red** yourself? Before you schedule your color job, consider whether you have what it takes to pull off the look. I spoke with Rick Wellman, co-owner of Patrick Melville Salon in New York City (who recently gave my locks a much needed copper touchup) about what you need to consider before committing to your own **red** hair makeover. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Shades of **red** look gorgeous on any hair length, but nothing can beat luscious long **red** hair. If you’re dying to try this look but can’t boast long locks, there’s nothing to worry about. You can always ask your hair stylist to add some extensions like this lady. We bet you didn’t even suspect she’s wearing them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When we say unnatural hair **colors** for blue eyes, we’re talking about vivid, fantasy **colors** that suit blue eyes. Blue eyes are somewhat rare, with only 1 in 6 people having this eye color in the U.S. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If a colorist thinks like an artist and takes the hair as a canvas for masterpieces, the color session results in not hair **colors**, but pieces of art. And this amber glaze is a perfect example of such color jobs! The way the amber is applied does look like a glaze: it covers the brunette base softly, yet saucily, providing tons of natural shine and dimension to the hair. What makes this idea so special is the color placement: it’s applied strategically to leave the charm of natural locks present. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have pale, fair skin, you can trust yellow, cool, and neutral tone ash hair color to suit your style perfectly. Some of the combinations you can consider are beige, champagne, bronde (brunette + blonde) and other cool undertones. These hair **colors** will add depth to your hair, making them look voluminous and attractive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Your hair needs to be very healthy before doing a fantasy color. Since unnatural **colors** need to be applied to bleached hair for the most color payoff, make sure your strands are in healthy condition first. Bleaching already-damaged hair can have disastrous consequences, from a mushy, gummy texture or dry, straw-like texture to an unexpected chemical haircut . If the condition is questionable, hold off on trying an unnatural color for now and focus on repairing the damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is an ideal shade for women with pale complexions. The mix of strawberry and rose **colors** adds warmth to cool toned complexions. Plus, it’s subdued enough to still work in conservative environments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the best ways to get body into thin hair without big curls is by flipping out the ends. This works best for medium length hair that has been laye**red**. Make sure to ask your stylist for long face-framing options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When choosing the most flattering **red** hair color for your skin tone, you need to take into account two main factors. First, it is your undertone and second, it is your complexion.

And when choosing the most suitable **red** hair color, you may opt for the shade that has an opposite or the same undertone as yours. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Zendaya’s soft-in-the-sun **red** shade is perfect for someone who is unsure about taking the plunge. It is still close to the caught-in-the-sun brown that we are used to and brings out brown eyes perfectly. A low-commitment **red** that keeps your hair looking wispy and youthful, what else do you need! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bright, vivid shades fade fast and require more maintenance. The most frustrating thing about vivid, bright **colors** is how quickly they fade. You’ll love the results and they’ll likely be intense and pigmented for a few weeks before the fading changes the overall look and shade of the color. For this reason, more touch-ups and maintenance is requi**red** to keep unnatural **colors** looking good. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ever wonde**red** what would happen if copper and deep **red** **colors** were mixed? Well, here’s the answer that goes beyond any expectations. The color is bright, yet deep, and **red**, yet with brownish hints. If you have a closer look at the idea, you will see that the coppery portion works for the glossy finish, and the **red** color builds balance with the brown base. Together, these shades give birth to the classiest **red** hair color that suits all complexions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Beyond thinking about how bold you want your **red** hair to look when all is said and done, celebrity colorist Rita Hazan says that it's important to book an appointment with a colorist who specializes in natural **red**heads. "Natural **red** hair is more difficult to lift and color," she explains. "Redheads don't really need highlights — they are so beautiful on their own — but if you [want them], I like them to be very subtle and blend well with the base color." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cool complexions look best with peach, pink, ginger, auburn, cinnamon, cool copper and more saturated **red** hair **colors**. If you have a warm undertone, you should consider bright and bold shades of **red**, such as a copper, chestnut, burgundy and chocolate cherry hair color. For neutral undertones, there are no restrictions. You can go for any **red** shade you like or mix **colors** that have opposite tonality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike platinum blonde hair, which only looks good on certain people, **red** can work for anyone. The trick is to finding the right **red** for your skin tone. “Freckles, pale skin and light eyes work best with strawberry blonde and copper **red**s. Darker eyes with cooler skin tones work best with deeper true **red**s and violet tones,” Rick explains. Emma Stone, a natural blonde, pulls off copper effortlessly while Rihanna’s complexion is compatible with a true **red**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll probably have to bleach your hair first. The best and brightest unnatural hair **colors** need to be applied to pre-lightened hair for the more intense, pigmented effect. If you apply fantasy **colors** to dark blonde or brunette hair, the outcome won’t be as color-rich. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best unnatural hair **colors** for blue eyes are high-contrast warm shades that are across from blue on the color wheel. This includes warm **colors** like orange, yellow, pink, and **red**. The best shades to compliment blue eyes include: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   You’re destined to steal all the looks with this stunning dark **red** hue. We’ve fallen for this perfect transition from dark roots to brighter **red** tones. Side parting and Hollywood waves seem to be the best match for this eye-catching cherry **red** hair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Those that have yellow undertones will look best in a fire engine **red** or dark/golden copper hue,” Christine mentions. “Pink undertones would suit a dark copper shade and cool undertones would look best in a luscious cherry **red**.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another trick to finding your color match? Look at the colo**red** flecks in your irises. “The gold/yellow flecks in the iris mean the warmer **red**s will be flattering,” Rick says. Cool blue or brown flecks mean cooler-toned **red** are the better option. Your jewelry choices can also be an indication: “Whether you are drawn to silver or gold jewelry can also point you towards your cool or warm **red** hair color compass.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As it turns out, copper and magenta can be a good team! Obviously, the secret of making these **colors** match lies in ombre.
