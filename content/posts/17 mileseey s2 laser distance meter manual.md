## 17 Things About Mileseey S2 Laser Distance Meter Manual | Geekbuying
-   For me, accuracy is the most important feature of any **laser** tape measure. If the measurements it is providing aren’t correct, then whatever you are trying to fit or make or cut just won’t work. And that will be highly frustrating. It will most certainly be costly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The quoted measurement range for the Atolla T201 60m/200ft **laser** tape measure is 60m or 200ft. When I tested it against a cream-coloured brick wall I achieved a distance of 45.682m. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have been using **laser** tape measures for over 15 years now since I bought my first Leica Disto. But before that the technology used by **laser** tape measure was found in total stations or EDM’s that I have used for many years before on large infrastructure projects throughout the UK. Where accurate measurements are crucial to the building of these projects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   [IP54 & Energy Saving] - The housing of this high-quality T201 is made of robust PC and ABS plastic. It is dustproof and protected from splashing water (IP54). Besides, the device has an Auto-Off function, which allows the **meter** to switch off after 3 mins of inactivity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I also found the accuracy was the worst of the three **laser** tape measures that I tested. Let me clarify that the accuracy was within the tolerance quoted, but only just. There is a way to fine tune the measurements on the Atolla T201 but why should you have too. They should work straight out of the box. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I was disappointed with the Atolla T201 for several reasons. The first was that it could not achieve the range specified. The accuracy of this **laser** measure was on the limit of the specification too. And the Atolla T201 I found was just a bit too small for my hands. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What impressed me the most about the Mileseey S2 was its accuracy. I tested it against my trusty Leica Disto A5 and found it to be just as accurate. In fact it gave the same distance measurement as the Leica Disto A5. This test was done straight out of the box. No adjustment to the Mileseey S2 **laser** tape measure was required. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   [Precise measurement]- Thanks to the advanced **laser** technology, a measuring accuracy of +/- 2mm is achieved. The multi 4-line backlit LCD is easy to read and can also be used in dark environments. There are 2 bubble levels installed for precise vertical and horizontal alignment of the **laser**. The measurement start reference point can be configured as the front or back of the device. If necessary, the measurement results can be adjusted by +/- 7mm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   [Extensive functions] - With this handy **laser** distance **meter** you can easily set the display unit between **meter**/inch/foot. Up to 20 records can be saved and retrieved. The device also has addition, subtraction, self-calibration, and mute buttons. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Buying a **laser** tape measure can be a difficult choice. Buying the right one for under £50 is even more difficult. There are a lot of **laser** measures available now for under £50 and not all of them are worthy of your hard earned money. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Buying any sophisticated equipment cheaply is fraught with danger. You think you are getting a bargain. But what you really get is a **laser** measure that doesn’t do what it is supposed to do. This is the most expensive equipment in value terms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ✦ LARGE LCD BACKLIGHT SCREEN & Mute Setting - Large backlight screen provides users with a better visibility.Mute setting allows your different needs .With accuracy up to ±1/16inch, the portable **laser** measure can perfectly finish a measure task ranging from 0.16 to 165 feet. Also 4 interchangeable units among m / in / ft/ ft+in are designed for people with different reading habits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **laser** tape manufacturers will quote the maximum range in favourable conditions. These will be low light and a good reflective surface. The test I did was during the day and on to a surface that anyone can measure against. Measurements that you and I would take day in day out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The quoted measurement range for the Mileseey S2 50m/165ft **laser** tape measure is 50m or 165ft. When I tested it against a cream-coloured brick wall I could only achieve a distance of 48.728m. This is a little bit short of the quoted range. While disappointing, I am not unduly concerned at this short fall in range. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I like the price. I paid under £20 for this model. But I think I would not pay more than £20 for this one. I think £20 is the upper limit in value for this **laser** tape measure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Leica Disto D1 has a range of 40m and a quoted accuracy of 2mm. The dia**meter** of the **laser** dot is 6mm at a distance of 10m from the instrument. This should be visible to most people in most daylight conditions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   [Easier & Compact] - The atolla **laser** distance **meter** provides a much simpler, faster and more precise measurement. Due to its compact design, it can be easily stored in a bag or jacket pocket. A removable hand strap provides safe handling. Check UK PriceCheck US Prtce - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
