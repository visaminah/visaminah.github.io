## 63 Tips for Can You Mount A Curved Monitor | Curved Monitor Vesa Mount
-   Samsung Odyssey G9 Gaming Monitor Best Very Large Ultrawide Panel for Racing Games, Flight Sims 4.0 Excellent Bottom Line: Flight-sim and racing fans will go ga-ga over Samsung's Odyssey G9, a gaming **monitor** with a **curved** 49-inch screen that gets incredibly bright while delivering smooth motion and vivid color. PROS Huge, luxurious wide-screen panel - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gamers have a different set of potential concerns. Depending on the actual title and your play style, ultrawides can a boon for multiplayer gaming, or a hindrance. The panels can afford a benefit in many MOBAs, battle royale titles, and real-time-strategy (RTS) games. But some serious esports competitors may actually want a more focused view of the proceedings; for example, enemies that may appear suddenly at the periphery of the screen can be a distraction. Some of these serious players will strongly prefer a compact 16:9 **monitor** to keep all the action in the primary field of view. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Do **curved** TVs need a special mount?” is a commonly asked question when it comes to **curved** TVs. Yes, it is correct. Are you curious as to why? Continue reading to find out more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The swing arms also need to be adjusted so they are a lot stiffer than what they were set for at the factory. I turned each adjustment bolt a good 3 full turns before even attempting to set the **monitor**s on them and that was close for the top but the bottom pretty much needed the adjustment turned all the way out. The Samsung weighs in at 15.4lbs without the stand and the AOC is a good 2-3lbs lighter so they within the weight limits and the stand seems to handle it perfectly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Naturally, ultrawide gaming **monitor**s have many features common to all gaming **monitor**s. Leading-edge models tend to have high refresh rates (up to 360Hz) and employ adaptive sync (AMD FreeSync or Nvidia's G-Sync). Ordinary productivity-focused panels tend to refresh at a 60Hz rate, the norm for mainstream **monitor**s. A higher refresh rate will let twitch-minded gamers see smoother, more reactive gameplay when the attached PC and video card can push consistent game frame rates in excess of 60 frames per second (fps). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many ultrawide business **monitor**s have **curved** screens, although their degree of curvature tends to be milder than those of **curved** gaming displays. (The amount of curvature can vary from model to model.) More on that in a moment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Philips Brilliance 499P9H Best Very Large Ultrawide Panel for Graphic Designers, Engineers 4.0 Excellent Bottom Line: The Philips Brilliance 499P9H offers a winning combination of a gigantic, ultra-wide **curved** screen—shining with a bright, vivid image—and extras like a Windows Hello-compatible webcam and a built-in KVM switch. PROS Immense ultra-wide screen with 5K horizontal resolution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many gaming-focused models employ a highly **curved** screen to provide for a more immersive experience. The curvature rating for gaming **monitor**s tends to be about 1800R, which means that if you were to place enough such **monitor**s side by side to form a circle, it would have a radius of 1,800mm, or 1.8 meters. The higher the curvature rating number, the gentler and shallower the amount of curve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   LG 35WN75C-B – 35” QHD (3440 x 1440) Curved Monitor This ultrawide **curved** **monitor** by LG can be another good option to pick when you are shopping online. This **monitor** is primarily suitable for gaming needs and the screen has a matte finishing. So, you will not get too much reflection of light when you are working or playing your favourite games in a well-lit room. The screen size is 35 inches and the quick refresh rate ensures a high-quality display at all times. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 16:9 ratio remains the most popular today. Familiar resolutions such as 720p (1,280 by 720 pixels), 1080p (1,920 by 1,080), 1440p/QHD (2,560 by 1,440), and UHD/4K (3,840 by 2,160) all have a 16:9 aspect ratio. The first 21:9 **monitor**s appeared in 2012, and 32:9 displays in 2017. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   6. Samsung CHG90 QLED One of the widest **curved** **monitor**s you can buy Specifications Screen Size: 48.9-inch Aspect Ratio: 32:9 Resolution: 3840 x 1080 Curvature radius: 1800R Panel type: VA Brightness: 350cd/m2 Color space coverage: 100% sRGB, 92% Adobe RGB Today's Best Deals View at Samsung (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Newegg (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Uber-wide aspect ratio + HDR support + Good 92% Adobe RGB coverage Reasons to avoid - Expensive - Only 1080p vertically - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Acer's Predator X34 is a gorgeously-designed gaming **monitor** with an extremely immersive 1900R curvature. It's an ultra-wide **monitor** (21:9 aspect ratio) that a display with a really high refresh rate and a super fast response time (0.5ms), both of which lend themselves to gamers. It even comes with a built-in pair of speakers. And it has a wide variety of ports (including USB-C) but does require a DisplayPort or HDMI connection to your computer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   LG 49WL95C-W Best Very Large Ultrawide Panel for Extreme Multitaskers 4.0 Excellent Bottom Line: The LG 49WL95C-W, a business-centered 49-inch **monitor**, is a multitasker's dream panel, letting you manage and view several full-size windows on your screen at once. PROS Spacious 49-inch screen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I'm divulging this information to you for free (you're welcome). If you seek the ideal home office setup, you need a **curved** ultrawide **monitor** with a second screen on the side in portrait orientation. It's the best combination for writing and gaming, with enough real estate for every task. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A specific mount is not required for the majority of **curved** TVs. Almost any mount or bracket that has been certified to work with your TV model should suffice. On the other hand, certain specific brackets, such as swivel brackets that enable the TV to be seen from various angles, work well with **curved** TVs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1. Use two magnetic swivel phone mounts directly onto the **monitor** bezel like this one: https://www.amazon.com/Magnet-Holder-Dashboard-Magnetic-Smartphones/dp/B06XCRZZTW/ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **curved** TV wall mount will give your home a contemporary appearance. The mount allows the wires and cords to be hidden behind the TV. This provides your space a sleek and clean look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Size: Curved **monitor**s generally come in larger sizes than their flat-screen counterparts. The average size of a **curved** **monitor** is around 34-inches, but it's fairly common to see smaller (around 24-inches) and much larger (around 49-inches) sizes. The most important is to get the size that works for you and your space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of all, ultrawide **monitor**s tend to be pricey, though part of that is simply the size of the panels—once you get above 32 inches, most displays of all kinds are ultrawide ones. Models in the 34-to-35-inch range run from a bit above $350 for a basic, general-purpose screen (or the barest-bones gaming one) to more than $2,000 for a fully tricked-out gaming panel. Most **monitor**s in that size range, though, go for under $1,000. The 49-inch models run from about $900 to $1,600. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The other thing with **curved** **monitor**s is that they generally come in bigger sizes than flat-screen **monitor**s. They wrap around you a little bit, meaning you fit a bigger screen in a tighter space. And this is great for productivity and multi-tasking as you can have more apps and windows open at the same time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While a **curved** television’s screen is **curved**, nearly all **curved** televisions include standard VESA compatible mounting holes on the back, much like a traditional (non-**curved**) television. The screws used to install these **curved** TVs are the same as those used to mount “regular” televisions. The main difference is that **curved** TVs need a few more space holders to ensure that the curvature fits around the wall mount. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here's proof that it is possible to get a huge 34-inch **curved**, ultrawide 21:9 **monitor** for a very fair price. The G34WQC doesn't even compromise on screen resolution, as it boasts the same 3440 x 1440 pixel density as displays costing two or three times the price. Sure, color space coverage isn't quite up there with the best, but 90% DCI-P3 coverage is still respectable. The screen's relatively tight 1500R curvature ensures an immersive viewing experience, while a 1ms response time and 144Hz refresh rate, along with AMD FreeSync support, ensures super-smooth gaming. The only drawback here - for photographers at least - is the **monitor**'s VA panel technology, which can't quite match the color and contrast consistency of an IPS display. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ports and Connectivity: Most **monitor**s require either a USB-C or an HDMI connection to hook up to your computer. This is important because a lot of new-age laptops, like a lot of recent MacBooks, only have USB-C ports and therefore would require you to use an extra dongle which isn't ideal. Additionally, most **monitor**s also have additional ports so you can connect (and charge) your other devices, like speakers or a microphone, without taking up the few ports on your computer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many advantages to hanging a television on the wall, both for the viewer and for your living room. You can get the greatest viewing angle for your **curved** TV by utilizing a **curved** TV wall mount, also known as a **curved** TV wall bracket. In addition, the wall mount allows you to install your **curved** TV and optimize the amount of open space in your living room. We created an incredibly thin wall mount to ensure that our wall mounts may be placed very near to the wall. Your television will take up almost no room this way! Furthermore, you won’t need a table or cabinet to put your TV on, saving you even more room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   BenQ MOBIUZ EX3415R 34-inch WQHD Ultrawide 1900R Curved Gaming Monitor If you want to buy an ultrawide **curved** **monitor** that is apt for professional gaming needs, this one can be a good option for you. Available with a high dynamic range, built-in speakers and adaptive sync, this **monitor** is good to elevate your gaming experience instantly. The eye care feature makes this **monitor** a good option even if you have to play games for a long time. So, you need not worry too much before buying it for your gaming needs. Available with a remote, this **monitor** is convenient to control. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Asus ProArt PA34VC is a simple-yet-beautiful ultra-wide **monitor** designed for photographers, video editors and other creative professionals. It's not a 4K **monitor**, but it's got a pretty high density (110 ppi) so colors appear vivid, sharp and realistic. It also has a high refresh rate (with support AMD's FreeSync), making it a decent gaming **monitor** when you're off the clock. It has a wide variety of ports but connects to your computer via HDMI. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you’re wondering if you can wall-mount a **curved** TV, the answer is yes. The majority of **curved** TVs can be wall-mounted since only the screen is **curved**. The mounting holes are all in the same place. The method of installing a **curved** TV is identical to that of attaching a flat-screen television. Most TV mounts and wall brackets are compatible with **curved** TVs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Philips Brilliance 49-inch Curved SuperWide Dual LCD Display The Philips Brilliance 49-inch Curved SuperWide Dual LCD Display comes with 5120 x 1440 resolution that is designed to replace multiscreen setups for massive wide view. It's like having two 27-Inch 16:9 Quad HD displays side-by-side. The screen is SuperWide and offers a screen area of dual **monitor**s without the complicated setup. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Curved televisions are extremely popular because they allow the spectator to be more immersed in the screen. Curved TVs also provide a decrease in reflections due to their gentle curvature. It’s essential to sit in the “sweet spot,” or exactly in front of your **curved** TV, to get the most out of it. However, since your TV is not usually directly in front of your sofa, this is problematic in many circumstances. In addition, your cabinet may not be at the proper height for your TV to be at eye level. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is one of the best bang-for-your-buck **curved** **monitor**s out there. It's a 34-inch **monitor** with a beautiful picture, a high refresh rate and an ultra-wide aspect ratio (21:9), making it a great option for people who want a **monitor** for work and gaming. The only real downside is that it has a fairly bland look (similar to a lot of Dell's **monitor**s, admittedly) and it doesn't have any USB-C ports, meaning it's not the best fit for a Mac. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a few drawbacks to **curved** screen **monitor**s. Due to their larger sizes and fancier designs, they tend to be more expensive. The viewing angles are more limited — you really need to be sitting dead-center. Because of the bigger screen, the image on a **curved** **monitor** is more prone to get stretched out and distorted (especially on cheaper models). And they don't really lend themselves to multiple **monitor** setups. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Big **curved** **monitor**s always exude wow factor, but Samsung's CL791 is particularly impressive for its size thanks to being slightly more **curved** than many rivals. Its 1500R curvature radius is tighter than the norm, resulting in a more immersive viewing experience, especially at closer viewing distances. Samsung's Quantum Dot LCD technology makes for excellent color space coverage - Samsung claims 125% of the sRGB color space - though this is not a wide-gamut display, so don't expect the same sky-high coverage of tougher standards like Adobe RGB or DCI-P3. What's more, this screen uses VA panel technology, not IPS, so while color and contrast fidelity may be high from an optimal viewing position, move slightly off centre and you can expect colors to become noticeably less saturated, and contrast more muted. But that said, this is less of an issue with a **curved** screen that wraps around you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   MSI Optix MPG341CQR Best Budget Ultrawide Panel for High-Refresh Gaming 4.0 Excellent Bottom Line: MSI's 34-inch ultrawide Optix MPG341CQR combines solid gaming performance with a raft of exclusive features, adding up to an ultra-quick **curved** panel that excels across nearly every metric that matters to gamers. PROS Innovative design and wide gamer feature set. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lenovo ThinkVision 34 inch VA Panel, Ultrawide Curved Monitor If you want to buy an ultrawide **curved** **monitor** for your professional needs, this one by Lenovo can be another good option that you can consider. The tilt of this **monitor** can be comfortably adjusted depending on your sitting position to help you work comfortably at all times. The high-quality display avoids blurring on the edges. So, you will not have much strain on your eyes when you have to work on multiple documents simultaneously. With multiple connectivity options, you can easily work or play games whenever you want. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A few **monitor**s in this class can also make use of the USB-C port for a virtual keyboard/video/mouse (KVM) switch. Such a feature would let you control two computers connected to the **monitor** via a single keyboard and mouse, as long as one computer is connected via the USB-C port. Users doing render work or data processing on a second computer might be attracted to this unusual, space-saving feature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With 4K becoming the standard in both video recording and **monitor** resolution, you may be surprised to hear that **curved** **monitor**s rarely even come close, let alone exceed, 4K. By far the most common resolution for a large **curved** 21:9 **monitor** is 3440 x 1440, which isn't far off 4K along the horizontal, but is quite a way short of the 2160 vertical resolution of 4K. In order to solve this, you'd need a rare, and very expensive, **monitor** with a '5K2K' screen res, equating to 5120 x 2160. Realistically then, if you must go **curved** and don't have bottomless pockets, screen resolution may have to be compromised. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cooler Master GM34-CWQ ARGB Best Ultrawide Gaming Monitor for Vivid Colors 4.0 Excellent Bottom Line: Cooler Master's GM34-CWQ ARGB gaming **monitor** offers a cool, **curved** 3,440-by-1,440 screen with vivid colors and low input lag. PROS Attractive design - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're serious about getting a **curved** **monitor**, you're much better off going for a larger, ultrawide display with an aspect ratio of 21:9 or wider. That way the curvature radius will really delivery a noticeable benefit versus a smaller screen, or a conventional 16:9 widescreen **monitor**. You'll get a lot more horizontal space to work on without having to set up multiple **monitor**s on the same desk. There are also an increasing number of **monitor**s that have even wider aspect ratios of 32:9, which can be useful if you want to display two 16:9 videos side by side without having to resort to dual screens. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   4. Dell UltraSharp 40 Curved U4021QW The best money-no-object **curved** **monitor** Specifications Screen Size: 39.7-inch Aspect Ratio: 21:9 Resolution: 5120 x 2160 Curvature radius: 2500R Panel type: IPS Brightness: 300cd/m2 Color space coverage: 100% sRGB, 100% Rec. 709, 98% DCI-P3 Today's Best Deals View at Newegg (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Dell (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Above 4K res + Superb color space coverage + Practical 21:9 aspect ratio Reasons to avoid - Not cheap, but price is fair - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Really serious esports players may optimize their systems to run at several times that in some hyper-competitive titles to gain an edge. (Much more on that in our roundup of the best gaming **monitor**s.) However, an important point: You will need a video card capable of pushing frames at the lofty native resolution that the top ultrawide gaming **monitor**s support. In competition, sticking to a more pedestrian 1080p may actually be an advantage. Gaming ultrawides also present some more caveats we'll get into below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ASUS's ProArt **monitor**s are designed specifically for color-critical photo and video, so it's no surprise that this **curved** entry in the range has all the hallmarks of top image quality. The 34-inch, 3440 x 1440 display can display 100% of the sRGB color space, and it's factory color calibrated to an accuracy of Delta-E less than 2. The screen also features uniformity compensation to ensure even back-lighting, and there's other useful extras like Thunderbolt 3 USB-C connectivity with up to 60w Power Delivery for powering a connected laptop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Invision Ultra Slim TV wall bracket is a great choice for TVs with a screen range of 26 – 55 inches. It’s compatible with most TVs: LCDs, LEDs, Plasmas, and **curved**. The notable features would be the swivel motion and easy tilt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The past few years have seen the introduction of a whole host of stunning ultrawide computer **monitor**s . They are designed to give discriminating office users, content creators, and gamers a more spacious, immersive view, delivering eye-popping visuals or simply extra room to work. Ultrawides, defined by their extra width relative to their height, come in panel sizes up to 49 inches, measured on the diagonal. This extra horizontal screen space can be beneficial, in different ways, across the professional, gaming, and productivity worlds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These panels are also a good substitute for multi-**monitor** arrays. A 32:9 **monitor** is twice the width of a 16:9 **monitor** with the same vertical pixel count. For example, a 49-inch **monitor** with a 32:9 aspect ratio has a screen size equivalent to that of two 27-inch **monitor**s placed side by side. (Remember, again, that screen size is measured diagonally, not straight across left to right.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The big advantage of an external **monitor** with a **curved** screen is that creates a level of immersion that a flat-screen **monitor** just can't compete with. You feel more like you're in a game or you're in a movie when experiencing it on a **curved** screen. And that's why **curved** **monitor**s have been a big hit in the gaming community. But **curved** **monitor**s have proven to be a big hit for all kinds of business and creative professionals, as well — basically, anybody who wants to feel more "in" their work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You simply need to measure the distance between the mounting holes of your TV or **monitor**. Measure the length and height using the millimeters, and that will be your VESA measurement. For example, 200×200 or 400×400. Naturally, the larger the TV, the larger the VESA. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're looking for the widest **curved** **monitor** on the market today, the huge Samsung CHG90 QLED (opens in new tab) is the one to get. At 49.5 inches it'll take up your entire desk, but the amount of workspace it offers is unbeatable. It has a staggering 3,840 x 1080 resolution and HDR support, so you'll be able to work on multiple photos or videos at once, with jaw-dropping visual impact. This is an inevitably expensive beast of a **monitor**, but worth the money if you want a huge canvas to work on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We answered your “do **curved** TVs need a special mount?” question and now it’s time for other. How to mount **curved** TV? ITOD has a large selection of **curved** TV wall mounts with a variety of choices. All of our wall mounts are ideal for **curved** televisions. Our flat wall mounts allow you to attach your TV to the wall in a permanent and stable position without needing to change the TV’s position. You can change the angle of your TV with our tilt and turn wall mounts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Asus ROG Swift PG35VQ Best Ultrawide Panel for Gamers, Price No Object 4.5 Outstanding Bottom Line: If you have the money to spend on the ultimate ultrawide gaming **monitor**, the Asus ROG Swift PG35VQ is the one to get. It has the features, the power, and the prowess to sit atop the segment for the foreseeable future. PROS Exceptional gaming experience at 200Hz refresh - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As a kid, I longed for a battle station with multiple **monitor**s, but that kind of setup was rare back then, found only in the offices of obsessive developers (or the lairs of supervillains). My first job after university was as a game tester. The indignity of regularly working 16-hour shifts in a converted closet with wires dangling from the ceiling was assuaged by the fact that I had two screens—one to play through the game and the other to log bugs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ultrawide business **monitor**s are a boon to multitaskers. Why? For starters, they let you open multiple full-size windows on the same screen, side by side. A few manufacturers, Dell among them, include software to help you split the giant screen into neatly arranged windows. That software can go beyond what the Windows 10-native window tiling, auto-resize, and snapping features can do. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The majority of **curved** TVs do not require a special mount. Almost any mount or bracket that has been rated as compatible with your TV model should do the trick. On the other hand, there are some special brackets that work best with **curved** TVs, such as swivel brackets that allow the TV to be viewed from multiple angles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1. Dell UltraSharp U3421WE The very best **curved** **monitor** you can buy Specifications Screen Size: 34.1-inch Aspect Ratio: 21:9 Resolution: 3440 x 1440 Curvature radius: 1900R Panel type: IPS Brightness: 300cd/m2 Color space coverage: 99% sRGB, 100% Rec. 709, 95% DC-P3 Today's Best Deals View at Dell (opens in new tab) View at Newegg (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Excellent color reproduction + USB-C with 90w Power Delivery + Factory color calibrated Reasons to avoid - Quite pricey - 'Only' 3440 x 1440 resolution - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   BenQ EX3501R Best Budget Ultrawide Monitor for Entertainment 4.0 Excellent Bottom Line: The BenQ EX3501R is a 35-inch ultra-wide entertainment **monitor** that can beautifully render HDR content, and delivers good color and tip-top grayscale performance. PROS Supports HDR content. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **monitor**s' exceptionally panoramic screens, especially at the 43-inch and 49-inch sizes, may be simply too large for a typical desk. Take measurements before diving in. You will probably want to enlist a second person to help you move the **monitor** into place, too. Carrying an ultrawide **monitor** is rather like carrying a beam of lumber; if you're not careful, the front and back may start to wag back and forth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In addition to their unique aspect ratios, ultrawide **monitor**s are, as the name suggests, physically wide. Most have measured-diagonal screen sizes of 34, 43, or 49 inches. The 49-inch models tend to really pack in the pixels, rated for native resolutions of either 5,120 by 1,440 pixels or 3,840 by 1,080 pixels at a 32:9 aspect ratio. Most ultrawide **monitor**s, especially the biggest ones, have large stands, often V-shaped, to support their weight and keep their wide chassis balanced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Though the current ultrawide wave is the most radical expression, computer **monitor**s have gotten progressively wider, compared with their height, over the decades. Around the turn of the millennium, many **monitor**s had a boxier 4:3 aspect ratio, which originally came from motion pictures. (It is the standard aspect ratio of 35mm film.) Around 2005, **monitor**s with a slightly wider 16:10 aspect ratio came into vogue, but their popularity was short-lived. Within five years they were largely supplanted by widescreen **monitor**s with a 16:9 ratio—the dimensions of a high-definition television (HDTV) image. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re wondering if a **curved** TV can be wall-mounted, the answer is yes. Since only the screen is **curved**, the majority of **curved** TVs can be wall-mounted. The mounting holes are all aligned. The process for mounting a **curved** TV is similar to mounting a regular flat screen. Most **curved** TVs are compatible with most TV mounts and wall brackets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   From my early days in game development to my current writing gig, I've been working at a desk for more than 25 years. Screens have always commanded my attention. Things had improved enormously since two chunky beige CRTs dominated my desk, but I still hadn't found the perfect **monitor** setup—until now. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **monitor** came with a bright dead pixel. Samsung's policy is only to replace these if you contact them within 7 days, but this isn't sufficient time to notice it and it's also not sufficient time to contact their support for RMA since the product isn't even listed properly on their RMA portal since it's a new product.
