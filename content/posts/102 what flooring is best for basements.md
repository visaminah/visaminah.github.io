## 102 Reference List: What Flooring Is Best For Basements | Carpets in the Park
-   Nothing is less appealing than a musty smelling basement. No homeowner wants to spend money on new **flooring**, only to have it take on mold, water damage, and a musty scent. If you’re new to your home, give your basement a year to be sure it doesn’t flood before tackling any huge basement finishing projects. Before installing new **flooring** take the following precautions to ensure a dry basement: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This depends on the installation process and the length of the floor’s exposure to water. Vinyl planks feature a lock mechanism with seams, through which liquids can seep into following prolonged exposure. However, installing a waterproof membrane underneath the vinyl can prevent floodwater that seeps through the seams from damaging the subfloor. Ultimately, vinyl plank **flooring** reinforced with a waterproof membrane underneath can survive flooding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you’re finishing your bare-bones basement or just renovating a small portion, choosing the right **flooring** for your space is usually a difficult decision. Basements floors typically need to be more durable than floors you might consider for your kitchen or dining room. Materials like hardwood, laminate and linoleum are out of the question if there’s any risk of dampness or flooding. Although those popular options might be off the table, there are a number of great materials that will work in any basement. Read on to find out the best **flooring** options for your basement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Engineered wood **flooring** possesses excellent sound absorption properties. It also boasts of a truly regal look among all basement **flooring** options. However, it is also relatively expensive. In case engineered hardwood is damaged by water and stapled to the subfloor, it isn’t easy to repair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Basement **flooring** options are much different than other kinds of conventional **flooring** for your basement kitchen or living room. It can potentially leach residual moisture even during dry weather. That is mostly because it perpetually remains in close contact with the ground. Water also has several other options to seep into your basement, especially during rains. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It can be hard to make the best decision on **flooring** for your basement. While some choices like hardwood or carpet may offer a different look to the space, they are not always the best option to protect your home from flooding. Flooding and moisture in your basement can cause some serious issues for mold growth. By sticking to ceramic **flooring** or vinyl tile, you are saving money and protecting your basement from water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally, the most durable **flooring** material for any below-grade space is one that exhibits superior moisture-resistant qualities. I would, therefore, recommend vinyl **flooring** as it’s the most adaptable **flooring** type. Vinyl comprises mainly plastic, an inorganic material, and can withstand prolonged moisture exposure. Here are some more reasons why vinyl **flooring** is the most durable option for your basement: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Basements, especially older ones, can have extremely uneven concrete surfaces. If the surface of your basement floor is uneven, it can cause problems when installing the new **flooring**. Before any new **flooring** is installed, make sure a professional uses a self-leveling compound that contains gypsum, which helps fight moisture, to create a level surface for your **flooring**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What makes this floor-covering material an excellent pick for **basements** is its resistance to moisture. For completely waterproof cork, check out the Amorim WISE line from Wicanders. The **flooring** is naturally antimicrobial, meaning it repels mold, mildew, and bacteria. Cork comes in the option of floating planks or direct-glue tiles, so it’s easy to install over concrete basement floors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Radiant heat in your basement is compatible with almost any **flooring** type – aside from carpet, tile, hardwood, etc. Choose a **flooring** that suits your basement’s environment and it will likely work well with radiant heat. Of course, mention your desire for radiant heat to your **flooring** contractor early in the process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Last year, the average Ontario water claim cost $28,000—and this average includes a lot of $5,000 clean-up jobs as well as a few massive $150,000 claims that require five or six months to repair, says one insurance insider. For cost-conscious homeowners, then, planning a basement renovation or remodel needs to include materials that water-resistant (or, at the very least, hold up well under damp conditions). Let’s start with **flooring**—the area most prone to pooling and water damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike sheet vinyl, which can be awkward to cut and install, planks don’t require adhesive or nails. Planks are a great choice if you ever plan on changing or replacing your **flooring**, or if you plan on selling your home. Future inhabitants of the home will have no trouble replacing the floor because they can easily remove it piece by piece. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike hardwood, bamboo is a grass and therefore naturally resistant to moisture. It’s far less likely to swell, warp and contort like traditional hardwood, making it a viable option for **basements**. Since bamboo **flooring** is resistant to moisture, your basement is less likely to have mold, and your general health will not be compromised. Plus, because it’s a type of grass, it’s allergy-friendly and very environmentally friendly—no VOCs, low carbon footprint, doesn’t add to deforestation, and is incredibly renewable. Also, solid bamboo can be glued down directly to a concrete subfloor, making for easier installation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “When homeowners are unhappy with their basement **flooring**, it’s often because their expectations were not in line with what the product could actually deliver,” he said. “With a purchase this big, make sure to work with a professional local retailer who listens to your needs and asks the right questions to help you select a product you’ll be happy with for years to come.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Floating floors can be any type, mainly laminate, luxury vinyl, and engineered hardwood. Each of these options comes bearing the undebatable convenience of floating floors, but without knowing how to utilize them entirely, you may end up missing out on the benefits thereof. That said, here are some of the tips on how to best use floating floors for **basements** depending on the **flooring** material in question. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can even do the tile **flooring** as a DIY project, as it is immune to rot and is resistant to any flooding. However, you may need professional assistance in order to install tile in larger areas. You will have to invest in radiant heating if you face problems regarding temperature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Luxury vinyl plank **flooring** looks more like hardwood or tile than ever before. They come in a wide variety of colors and patterns that closely imitate various types of wood **flooring**. Once they’re installed in your basement, you’ll be hard-pressed to tell the difference between them and real hardwood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It all narrows down to installing the best **flooring** for **basements** that flood. With this in place, you can say goodbye to consistent moisture damage and mold growth underneath your basement floor. Let’s dive into more details on some ideal **flooring** options for such situations to enable you to restore your basement’s former glory. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An economical choice as well as a stylish one, vinyl **flooring** can provide a variety of options for your water-prone spaces without breaking the bank. Flooring costs for vinyl can start as low as $3 per square foot. As an added bonus, they are usually the easiest to install for homeowners who like to tackle DIY projects. Choose from wood look-a-like varieties, solid colors, and even ones designed to look like more expensive squares of ceramic or marble tile. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hardwood and wood laminate **flooring** are highly susceptible to significant damage in the event of a flood and almost always have to be removed because of buckling and cupping. Even though laminate **flooring** is a great option because it is low maintenance, cheaper, and easy to clean: it is not as water resistant. The same issue goes for hardwood **flooring**. Any water issues should be dealt with before installing hardwood or wood laminate **flooring**. A homeowner should also consider installing a vapor barrier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes. Rubber is flood-proof and offers a variety of thicknesses and color options to choose from, depending on your budget. However, be sure to loosely lay the rubber **flooring** during installation, preferably using carpet tape for easy removal. Otherwise, you may use cured polyurethane adhesive to keep the **flooring** intact in the event of a flood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like laminate, LVF uses high-quality photos to imitate more expensive natural materials. However, unlike laminate, vinyl floors are well-suited for damp areas of the home like bathrooms, laundry rooms and, of course, **basements**. It’s also worth noting that the added layers in LVF make this option somewhat warmer than tile or sheet **flooring**. However, while a cork subfloor is not required, you’ll need to add a vapour barrier to prevent moisture from getting trapped between the concrete and the boards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the past, some homeowners were wary of vinyl floors and their dated designs. These days, not only does vinyl come in a variety of shapes and patterns, but most retailers carry tiles that closely resemble hardwood and stone. These higher-end vinyl products are called Luxury Vinyl Flooring, or LVF, and are often compared to laminate **flooring**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally speaking, inorganic materials are better suited for **basements** than organic counterparts. Inorganic materials, like tile, will not grow mold or rot when subject to moisture (which is likely in a basement). If your basement is prone to flooding but you’re still hoping for hardwood, you’re in luck. Manufacturers have started retailing tile plank floors cut to mimic the look of hardwood. This option will give you the look you’re going for with all the practical benefits of tile. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Laminate **flooring** is an excellent option because it looks great, is low maintenance, and is easy to clean. It is a great choice for those looking to finish their basement on a budget. However, laminate isn’t as resistant to moisture, so any water issues should be dealt with before installation, including installing a vapor barrier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is important that you survey your basement floor before hiring anyone to install your floors. Moisture checks need to happen before **flooring** is put down. You can easily do this by taping a cut open garage bag to the floor and sealing all the edges with tape. After 48 hours, check under the bag for moisture, if there is moisture on the bag that means you have a problem with moisture in your basement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vinyl floors can offer you a look and feel similar to that of hardwood, with a variety of designs into the bargain. It’s ideal if you’re on a tight budget as you don’t need a professional to install or uninstall the **flooring**. With grouted vinyl tile, you can get a finish similar to that of ceramic tile but warmer. Its inorganic components also enable it to withstand high traffic **basements**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But what about flooding? Well, we recommend any moisture issue be taken care of before any carpet installation takes place. In the Chicago area, about 60% of all **basements** are carpeted. Carpeted **basements** are popular because they make great family rooms, help make basement bedrooms more cozy, are soft for playing children, and provide great insulation for **basements** which are typically cooler areas of the home. Als, important for carpet (and any basement **flooring**, really): make sure you have a rider on your homeowners insurance policy that will pay for water damage in the basement to cover any replacement costs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is also a good thing if you ever need to make repairs. One damaged plank can be swapped out for an undamaged one. You just have to unlock the tiles by the wall, then unlock each one leading up to the damaged one. With other **flooring**, you might actually cause more damage trying to replace the section of **flooring** unless you hire a professional to do the repairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes. Vinyl **flooring** is perfect for damp areas such as **basements**. The floor type is both waterproof and water-resistant. You can have your vinyl floors exposed to wet conditions for days or weeks without significant damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing a **flooring** for your basement can be complicated. Find a **flooring** contractor you can trust, and they can help guide you through the process. At Carpets in the Park, we proudly offer free in-home estimates to find **flooring** and installation solutions perfectly tailored to you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At one time, vinyl had a reputation for looking, well, fake. Like its cousin, laminate, it was seen as something cheaper or lesser than actual hardwood **flooring** or even ceramic tile. But times have changed, and one of the most flexible **flooring** materials available today also happens to be some of the most attractive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As far as quick and clean installation goes, plank **flooring** is hard to beat. It snaps together like puzzle pieces over your concrete slab, making the a ‘floating’ floor. You don’t even need special tools for the job, most people have everything they need in their toolbox already. This makes installation much less work than most other types of **flooring**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In many cases, people decide that installing **flooring** on their own is too difficult or time-consuming, even if they are technically capable of doing the job. There’s something to be said for paying for a professional when you can afford to. A professional installation will give you access to your new **flooring** more quickly than you would have if you chose to DIY. A professional will also do a better, more precise job, meaning fewer headaches and hassles for you down the road. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Natural wood floors are beautiful but they don’t hold up to heavy traffic well. Vinyl plank **flooring** is more durable than either cork or bamboo, making it a great choice if your basement floor gets a lot of foot traffic. Some luxury vinyl planks have an extra thick top layer that’s even more durable and resistant to scuffs and minor scrapes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In addition to being notoriously damp, **basements** are also known for being cold. So, it’s no surprise that carpeting is a desired **flooring** choice for the lower level. If your basement is dry, this is a perfectly fine option, but Lambright says homeowners must be careful regarding the type of carpet padding they use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re undecided about what type of **flooring** to buy for your basement, vinyl plank should definitely be your top consideration, especially if you have ever had a wet floor. It looks great, rivals any hardwood floor in appearance, and installs quick and easy. Of course, the practicality of a material that’s completely impervious to water can’t be overlooked, which makes it a great option for bathrooms too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Carpeting is a popular **flooring** choice for a finished basement as it offers a softer, comfortable surface. Yet, any moisture issue should be taken care of before carpet installation takes place. The problem with carpet is that once exposed to flood water, the carpet and padding are very difficult to completely dry out and again are usually removed. Additionally, having carpet with locked-in moisture can cause huge issues with mold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While you can’t install solid hardwood below grade, you can install engineered hardwood. This type of **flooring** has a plywood base below a real wood veneer, which stands up better to limited amounts of moisture. Engineered hardwoods can be glued or floated on concrete sub-floors, but it’s important for the floor to be even. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Laminate **flooring** has been around for decades. The eco-friendly floor-covering material comes in tiles or planks that lock into place. Since laminate can be installed directly over concrete, it’s an excellent choice for **basements**. Also, the finished product can mimic real hardwood or be custom-designed in any color or pattern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tile is one of the most versatile basement **flooring** options when you’re remodeling your basement. Unlike concrete, it acts as a properly finished surface. At the same time, it possesses plenty of unique virtues of its own. You do not need to invest in any kind of additional treatment, unlike concrete. In fact, you can install porcelain or ceramic tile right on top of a concrete slab. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The cheapest option for basement **flooring** is simply to paint the existing concrete. Paint is cheap, easy to do yourself, and resistant to water, making it an excellent option in many cases. If you’re short on time or money, painting your basement floor is the best choice, although the results won’t be as transformative as installing a more involved type of **flooring**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Installing the wrong type of materials on your basement or bathroom floor can result in damage to your subfloor and even lead to another bathroom remodeling project a lot sooner than you’d like to. Your suitable **flooring** choices for these areas will be limited to types manufactured with water exposure (like from exiting the tub in the case of your bathroom or from rising groundwater in the case of your basement) in mind. However, this still leaves you with some beautiful and functional **flooring** types you’ll be happy to show off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, it’s important to have the correct backing on your vinyl. Like carpeting, you need a backing that won’t trap moisture, but will instead allow the concrete to breathe. There are also different installation styles. Some vinyl **flooring** can be glued directly to the concrete, while other options come in a floating style with planks that click together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For those with recurring moisture problems, a floating floor may be the only option. Floating floors allow for a moisture barrier to be installed over the concrete slab of the basement to allow for a stronger protection against any moisture that may be present. However, keep in mind ceiling height, as it might rob precious inches from your basement height. All laminates and engineered **flooring** products can be floated above the subfloor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some homeowners opt for carpet in their **basements**. This can work, as long as the space is waterproofed and sealed to prevent leaks and flooding. Also, you’ll probably need to install a subfloor before laying the carpet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before establishing the most waterproof **flooring**, it is essential to note the difference between a waterproof and a water-resistant floor. Waterproof **flooring** comprises permanently impervious materials, while the latter can only withstand exposure to liquids for a limited period. While 100% waterproof floors can withstand even floods, expect swelling or warping in the case of water-resistant floors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Other factors such as your budget and the purpose of your basement also come into play in selecting a suitable **flooring** option. While vinyl floors are often labeled as waterproof, be sure to confirm whether the product is a hundred percent waterproof, as this may not be the case for all of them. Rubber, concrete, and ceramic tile floors are effective solutions to flooding **basements**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best **flooring** for your basement mainly depends on the prevailing conditions and your desired outcome. While traditional **flooring** options are relatively affordable and grace you with variety, most require professional installation and are barely waterproof. Although ceramic tile is waterproof, it can barely withstand moisture that seeps from beneath the floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many **basements** already have low ceiling heights. Using a floating floor installation could subtract as little as an inch or two, which might cause your basement to violate local building codes. In Chicago, that threshold is 7’6” of ceiling height according to city code. If the ceiling height falls under that threshold, it might not count as compliant occupancy square footage, and will only be considered a storage area. If you live in another area, check with your local government to learn about basement living codes to make sure you maintain compliance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vinyl plank **flooring** is much more budget-friendly. It costs anywhere from $2 to $7 per square foot and are easier to install. If you install porcelain tile, you have the added expense of renting or buying a tile cutter and you’ll have buy thinset and grout too. Vinyl doesn’t require any special tools and cleanup is a breeze compared to porcelain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Porcelain basement **flooring** in the form of planks is immune to moisture. Its impeccably crafted textures can make it look unmistakably like actual wood. It is one of the most durable basement **flooring** options available in the market. Unlike conventional tiles, however, its edges are rectified. As a result, the tiles are arranged edge-to-edge without any mortared grout lines. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Despite its superior aesthetics, ceramic tile features poor insulation properties, and it is more costly as it requires professional installation. Additionally, below-grade spaces often exhibit cold temperatures, eliminating ceramic tile as an ideal option. Although popular, epoxy **flooring** is cold and hard underfoot and requires extra cushioning alongside a radiant heat source. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Elastomeric paint is best used in flood-prone **basements** thanks to its watertight nature and flexibility that allows easy expansion and contraction. If you’re dealing with an old basement floor, painting is ideal as it gives the floor a simple, fresh look while protecting it simultaneously. Paint cover’s the floor entirely, making it sufficiently impervious while concealing flaws such as patches and cracks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Courtesy of better image layer graphics and thicker surfaces for deeper embossing, laminate basement **flooring** is in high demand. However, it is also quite vulnerable to moisture. If its base material comes into contact with water, it gets swollen up permanently. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In Michigan real estate, the basement is a key bonus space with endless possibilities. It’s not only great for storage, but for many homeowners, it also serves as usable square footage for a family room, maybe a kids’ playroom, a “man cave,” or even a home gym. The problem with this area is that, being underground, it’s subject to issues like moisture and humidity that can damage certain types of **flooring**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Basements are notoriously cold and drafty, so many people install a subfloor layer to make their **basements** more livable. This is typically done by a professional contractor, although it’s possible to do it yourself if you have the time and skills. Subfloor layers provide extra insulation between the cold concrete and your feet, making them a good option for people who want to be comfortable while they spend time relaxing in their basement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Luxury vinyl should be your go-to if you use your basement frequently, owing to its ease of maintenance and sturdy wear layer. Vinyl **flooring** mainly encompasses synthetic materials with a tight interlocking mechanism that makes it impenetrable. However, luxury vinyl isn’t the best suit if you’re working with a limited budget, as it can cost you up to ten dollars per square foot, depending on the design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Alternatively, you can opt for pocket-friendly sheet vinyl that costs about one to two dollars per square foot. Sheet vinyl is ideal for flood-prone **basements** with minimal foot traffic because its wear layer isn’t as thick. Even better is that some of the designs feature an inbuilt underlayment, further cutting costs. With vinyl **flooring**, you will have a variety of designs to choose from, which makes it ideal if you prioritize aesthetics. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Often better suited for **basements** that will double as playrooms, laundry areas, or workout stations, rubber **flooring** can make a great choice for some. It’s waterproof, easy to install, and can be switched up as often as your tastes or needs change. Rubber tiles cost around $1 per square foot or $7 per square foot poured. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also opt for vinyl sheet **flooring** as an ideal waterproof **flooring** option. Vinyl planks can also be completely waterproof, but there’s a possibility of water seeping through the seams owing to the click-lock installation mechanism. Vinyl sheet counters this drawback as it’s seamless, and the base layer is entirely waterproof. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Laminate is another low-cost, low-maintenance basement **flooring** option that can give your basement a more homey feel. Laminate **flooring** comes in many different colors, textures, and designs, giving you plenty of room to flex your creative muscles. Some laminate floors provide the much sought-after wood look, while others mimic stone or slate floors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Low-maintenance laminate floors never need to be waxed or refinished, and they can last for up to 30 years in homes. Also, laminate is a water-resistant material. Aside from **basements**, it’s a top choice for kitchens, bathrooms, mudrooms, laundry rooms, and other moisture-prone spaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Porcelain plank floor tiling is being considered a status symbol over time. Thus, it now possesses significant resale value for new remodeling projects. It is waterproof and easy on the eyes. However, it is rather cold underfoot like all other ceramic tiles. Also, it is one of the more expensive basement **flooring** options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vinyl is a highly durable, low-maintenance, and versatile floor-covering solution. The synthetic material has a UV-cured urethane upper layer, making it resistant to scratches, stains, and moisture damage. Both sheet vinyl and luxury vinyl tile (LVT) are waterproof basement **flooring** options, which is crucial in the wet Pacific Northwest. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Solid hardwood is really the only **flooring** that is not recommended for **basements**,” he said. “Other than that, a lot depends on how you’ll use the area. We like to meet our clients at their homes to tour the space and ‘interview’ them to find out what’s most important. This helps us provide recommendations that will meet their expectations.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Porcelain seems to be a favorite for damp spaces like bathrooms and **basements**. It’s okay for small spaces, but if you’re covering a large area, porcelain can get very expensive pretty quickly. Low quality tiles start around $0.50 per square foot, but if you want good quality, you may pay up to $15 per square foot for porcelain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A solid choice for those looking to get creative or who want a more uniform look, ceramic tile lets you play around with the aesthetic of your **flooring**. You can opt to go with a single color, mix and match with a variety, or pick a pattern that will hide any messes your family may leave behind. Ceramic tile comes at a variety of price points but usually starts around $.49 per square foot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also called resilient **flooring**, vinyl **flooring** is one of the best basement **flooring** options that you can consider while remodeling. It is available in the form of planks, tiles, and sheets. Of these, sheet vinyl **flooring** creates a smooth and waterproof surface. It is ideal for places that are especially prone to water. On the other hand, tile vinyl **flooring** possesses multiple seams that are more vulnerable to accumulating moisture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Synthetic carpets are much better options for **basements** since they don’t hold moisture the way natural-fiber carpets do. Even if you opt for a synthetic fiber carpet, make sure to have a dehumidifier around to battle humidity and moisture when you need to. You’ll also have to do your due diligence to check for leaks since they can be harder to notice in a carpeted basement, depending on their location. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Compared to other basement **flooring** options, luxury vinyl **flooring** is one of the more recent choices. Unlike conventional **flooring** options, it is not joined to the subfloor using adhesives. Instead, every piece is joined individually in a floating floor manner. As an additional benefit, it closely resembles materials it mimics, such as stone or wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ceramic tile is essentially porcelain that’s finished (or glazed) with a thin ceramic coating. It’s typically more vibrant than unglazed porcelain and can be custom-ordered in a wide variety of hues and prints. Ceramic floors are also moisture-resistant and will never rot, so they work well in **basements**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For areas that see both moisture and heavy foot traffic, stone tile is an excellent option. The durable materials can stand up to a lot of activity. It’s often a pricier tile **flooring** option and can start around $6 per square foot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like most **flooring** options, the ceramic tile industry has evolved and graces you with various designs, some of which mimic wood and stone. This makes them ideal for lounges, playrooms, outdoor spaces; you name it. Additionally, they are completely waterproof, making them ideal for flood-prone **basements**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike other **flooring** types, carpet is easy to lift up and air out making it a cost-effective **flooring** option when it comes flood-prone **basements**. (Unless, of course, the flood was caused by a major sewer back-up.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once marketed as a great alternative to hardwood in places like the basement, we now know this is not really the case. While laminate does a bit better than hardwood when it comes to moisture tests—primarily because there is so much glue holding the product together—it’s the layer underneath the laminate that essentially self-destructs as soon as water touches it. For this reason alone, laminate it one of the worst **flooring** options for your basement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vinyl plank **flooring** is often used to mimic the aesthetics of solid hardwood at a fraction of the cost. While vinyl planks won’t fool anyone on a close inspection, they can give you much of the warm, cozy feeling of real wood **flooring** without the high costs needed for expensive upkeep. Vinyl holds up well in wet environments and is warm underfoot, giving your basement a homier vibe than bare or painted concrete. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Basements can have so much potential for imaginative homeowners— studio space, gym, family room, extra bedrooms (for the in-laws or teenagers). To realize that potential, **basements** need to be finished, which means installing **flooring**. But many homeowners and landlords aren’t sure which **flooring** material is appropriate for their basement. There are many considerations to take into account—budget, moisture, ceiling height, **flooring** materials, use case. People ask me questions about basement **flooring** almost everyday. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sheet vinyl **flooring** is also relatively cost-effective and warmer to touch, compared to concrete and ceramic tiles. However, it is also quite difficult to install by yourself. It also requires a relatively clean surface for adhesion. Many people consider it a relatively cheap fix. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At Floor Factors, we carry all the best basement **flooring** options. This includes engineered hardwood, cork, laminate, ceramic tile, carpet, and vinyl **flooring**. Our locally owned Portland **flooring** store offers myriad **flooring** materials for **basements**, kitchen and bathroom remodels, and more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These types of floors are made using several different planks, which are engineered out of materials that can stand up to moisture with a durable finish. Engineered wood costs around $8 per square foot to start. While this is higher than some of the other **flooring** options for these spaces, it can be a bargain for anyone who has had their heart’s set on a real wood look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although paint is more likely to chip after a while, you can counter this drawback by prepping the floor adequately. This entails identifying and patching all cracks and holes, edging and applying at least two coats depending on the manufacture’s specifications, while allowing each coat to cure completely. Epoxy-based sealants also go a long way for flood-prone **basements** due to their impeccable waterproof aspect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As common sense suggests, organic material like wood is quite vulnerable to moisture. Therefore, you should not even think of including solid hardwood among your basement **flooring** options. However, that is not the case with engineered wood. It is admirably durable by virtue of its cross-hatched plywood base under the actual wood veneer. That allows it to retain its shape when you expose it to mild amounts of moisture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vinyl **flooring** is made to be waterproof, not just water resistant. It can literally be exposed to wet conditions for days and obtain absolutely no damage. This makes it a great choice for areas where there might be a tendency for dampness to form, like in **basements**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You cannot restore it to its normal size by drying. As a result, the layers and top areas start to peel off. If your laminate **flooring** gets damaged to this extent, your only option is to replace it altogether. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Engineered hardwood **flooring** can work in **basements**. Just be sure to confirm with the manufacturer or your **flooring** supplier that the material is moisture-resistant and suitable for below-grade applications. That said, prefinished hardwoods should work in **basements** that have been waterproofed and sealed. Also, since the planks have to be nailed into place, you’ll need to install a subfloor over the concrete first. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether your looking for simplicity or are an aesthetics enthusiast, traditional basement **flooring** options got you covered. They offer different designs, colors, and patterns at your disposal, and most are relatively affordable. Depending on your budget and specific floor needs, you can choose from different types. These include: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sheet vinyl can be custom-made in virtually any color, pattern, or style. With luxury vinyl basement **flooring**, you can get tiles or planks that mimic the appearance of hardwoods, stone, and other natural materials. Installation isn’t complicated and most vinyl can be installed directly over concrete. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In many ways, luxury vinyl **flooring** is the opposite of painted concrete. Luxury vinyl **flooring** comes in two varieties: luxury vinyl planks and luxury vinyl tiles. Both versions of vinyl **flooring** offer a range of styles, colors, and designs, making vinyl a great option for basement living spaces and entertaining areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you need to cut a tile to fit a certain spot, you’d better have the right tools or you risk damaging the tile and winding up with a very unprofessional looking finished result. Tile floors are not for the faint of heart or casual DIY fan. Plank **flooring**, however, is literally a ‘snap’ to install and there’s nearly zero clean-up so you can install it in the basement in one day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for a simple, affordable, and convenient **flooring** solution, then this is it. Rubber **flooring** costs barely ten dollars per square foot without additional installation costs. In addition to easy maintenance, rubber offers a variety of designs to choose from, with durability into the bargain. However, due to its poor insulation property, you may want to use a radiant heat source to make the room feel cozier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vinyl **flooring** mainly comprises synthetic materials . Vinyl floors mainly entail PVC meaning little to no moisture can damage the floor. Additionally, synthetic materials prevent the growth of mold and mildew underneath. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you can see, moisture is the prime concern when it comes to basement **flooring**. This is what insurance companies across the globe thrive upon. Here we will cover the best basement **flooring** options presently available in the market. You can then choose an apt one to protect your floor from moisture and dry it out if it gets affected. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most people love the idea of having ceramic or other types of tile **flooring**. However, there’s a big investment of labor to consider when you install tile. There’s the careful measuring, the mess of the adhesive or grout that you use, and the stress of trying to make it all line up just right. It can be a huge undertaking, not to mention the mess that comes with the tiling process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although these options work for most **basements**, we recommend consulting with a pro before making any big commitments. You’ll want to be aware of any issues you may face down the line with moisture, flooding or humidity before selecting a material. When you’re ready to start your project, connect with a pro on HomeStars and get ready to enjoy your new living space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Concrete, among basement **flooring** options, is the most moisture-resistant material available. It also does not require any subfloor, which makes the basement remodeling process easier. However, since you cannot heat it from below, it can also be uncomfortably cold during winter. On top of that, it also requires extensive labor to install and maintain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main drawback to using laminate floors in a basement is moisture. Laminate floors don’t do well in moist environments, so you’ll have to install an underlayment between the laminate **flooring** and the concrete. Most people also install a basement subfloor before installing laminate **flooring**, giving them more protection from moisture and more insulation from the cold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Installing **flooring** in your basement is a home improvement project that’s within reach of most homeowners. Most people should be able to install carpet, rubber tiles, or vinyl **flooring** without the need to hire a professional contractor. Ceramic tile is more difficult to install, and most people are probably better off hiring a **flooring** expert if they want it for their basement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cold, damp **basements** aren’t much fun. Radiant heating, however, can help transform your humid basement into a cozy little den that’s perfect for the whole family to enjoy. Luckily radiant heating works really well with a floating vinyl plank floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the case of a flood-prone basement, consider opting for waterproof rather than water-resistant vinyl **flooring**. A hundred percent waterproof vinyl floors can withstand prolonged exposure to moisture and prevent infiltration, while the latter can only hold out against topical spills. Vinyl cores that are utterly waterproof include: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A cork floating floor is an excellent insulating product for cold **basements**. It is the best **flooring** for basement. Add in a cost effective 6mm cork underlayment and you will have built an “insulated” floor. By using 6mm cork underlay underneath a cork floating floor, you will have close to the same insulating value as 1 inch of solid Styrofoam at a fraction of the cost. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Laminate **flooring** is water resistant, to a point. If water pools and remains on top of laminate, it will eventually cause swelling and damage. Linoleum **flooring** looks waterproof, but it’s actually only water resistant. If water pools on linoleum, it can penetrate the material and cause it to peel away from the floor underneath. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
