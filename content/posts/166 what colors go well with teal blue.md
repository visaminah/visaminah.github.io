## 166 Unexpected Facts About What Colors Go Well With Teal Blue | Color Guide: How to Use Teal
-   If you want to bring out the neutral aspect of color, you should undoubtedly include **teal** in your living room, bathroom and bedrooms. Knowing colors that blend with **teal** is a step in your interior design skills. But what colors go with **teal**? Here are a few options to help you explore the color **teal**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Taupe, as gorgeous and serene a color as it is, tends to feel a little blah when left to fend for itself in design. With its lovely **blue**y-green aesthetic, the color **teal** brings in that element of water and life that immediately picks up the energy and the fresh appeal of a taupe-neutral space. Of course, interesting silhouettes such as this abstract golden branch pendant, will always raise the level of visual interest in any space, regardless of the color combination. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As a hue with a fair amount of **blue** in it, **teal** is a calming color tone that you can bring into almost any space you’re looking to imbue with a regenerative, soothing vibe. As such, it’s a great color for a living room, bedroom, bathroom, or anywhere you’re looking to relax in style. Pair **teal** accents up with a cool gray shade in your bathroom for a sophisticated look befitting a chic beach house or cottage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The next most stunning color you can match with **teal** is black. Specifically, this combo creates a deep, elegant look. A fashionable look can also be the result of this combination. However, the elegance is more prominent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you've been dreaming of an ultra-moody living room, take note of this drama-filled design belonging to Amelia from Audenza and paint your walls, trim, and ceiling a rich shade of **teal**. Then, to amp up the wow factor even more, throw in a vibrant yellow couch. Hot pink accents fit right in and complete the maximalist scene. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since green is created by blending **blue** and yellow, by adjusting the color ratios, you can create a green that is either warmer or cooler. For example, lime is considered a warmer green as it contains more yellow. You also get warmer **blue**s that have more of a purple bias than a green one, while cool **blue**s will have a green bias. As you can see, there is a lot more to creating the perfect turquoise than a mix of **blue** and green. The colors you are starting with must be correct to get the desired turquoise color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Teal pops with bright white, and its color wheel match is coral. But it also works with cream, navy, pinks and especially gold and brown tones. Nothing looks quite so good as a gold-framed mirror against a **teal** wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A sea of taupe would be soothing, of course, what with its blended greyish-brown (or is it brownish-grey?). But strategic pops of a saturated color like **teal** creates points of visual interest throughout the taupe space, without detracting from the beautiful neutral itself. Teal is a lovely color to consider in spaces that involve food, such as this dining room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Teal — that elusive shade of **blue**-green that’s not quite turquoise **blue** or light **blue**, and still different from aqua or sky **blue**. Teal **blue** manages to be its own color and still come in a variety of its own shades, whether they are more **teal** greens or more cloudy, dark **teal**s. A timeless color that can be seen in artwork as old as that of the ancient Egyptians, the color **teal** is making a major comeback. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With mustard, **teal**, and purple all in the same room, this space has a lot going on. The purple and mustard are both carried in various elements throughout the room, making the chairs the main element. With muted tones, the gray and purple rug ties the space together and gives the eye a good place to rest so the mix of colors doesn't become too much. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Jeff Schlarb Design Studio brings our first inspiration for today, showing how easy it is to integrate **teal** as part of a contemporary living room setup. You can see how the couch and armchairs are covered in **teal** upholstery, with the **teal** rug making everything come together. Everything stands out even more thanks to the neutral grays and silvers that are also part of the decor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turquoise is made by mixing **blue** and green. The amounts of each color that you add to a mixture determine the shade of turquoise you will get. Turquoise falls between **blue** and green on the color wheel, so shades of turquoise can range from predominantly **blue** to predominantly green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Navy is one of those timeless hues that can bring an infinite amount of refinement to almost any area. However, it’s normal to want to avoid your navy from being too dark or conventional, in which case a flash of **teal** is an excellent way to liven up a moody area. If you opt for a **teal** accent wall, you can always turn to navy decor pieces of even something bigger and boulders, like a couch or a sofa set with navy upholstery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the other hand, you can consider adding an extra color such as white to be a complementary color to your **teal**-black decor.

Here, a floor-to-ceiling wallpapered accent wall is the star of the show, while black dining chairs and a matching sideboard add a sophisticated edge. The rich wood furniture finish softens the look and acts as a visual buffer between the bold colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Perhaps you're looking for a color scheme with a bit more warmth? In that case, pair **teal** with a neutral hue such as tan. Kate Marker Interiors shows us how to pull off the look in this dining room complete with dark **teal** wallpaper above white wainscoting and light brown pieces of furniture and decor. The three-tier chandelier is the icing on the cake. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Greens such as **teal** looks stunning in glass, whether it’s bottles, mirrors, glass chandeliers, or even glass doors. Teal green is the ideal color for the glass bottles that adorn your bar and are used to store fine wine and liquor. Because liquids such as wine and juices may be exposed to light without destroying their flavors, they are frequently packaged in green glass. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

However, as witnessed in this modern living room by Elizabeth Roberts, the duo doesn't have to be overwhelming.

-   With the color being made up of greens and **blue**s, it is not surprising that some people might think that these are the best and most complementary colors that go well with **teal**. This actually couldn’t be more wrong! If **teal** was on (an expanded version of) the ROYGBIV (red, orange, yellow, green, **blue**, indigo, violet) color wheel, the shades of green and **blue** would probably end up on either side of it. This means that these colors are analogous to **teal**. While useful for creating a gradual, gradient-like effect, the problem with analogous color schemes is that it is difficult for an individual color to stand out because all the colors involved are visually similar to one another, This means that if you are seeking colors that look good with **teal**, green and **blue** are not the answer because these shades will only mute the impact of the hue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   “Value” refers to the relative level of lightness or darkness of a color. It’s typical for colors with a lighter value (more white added), like a light sea green, to translate as lighter and calmer.

Yellow can also be added in small amounts along with **blue** and green to achieve a more subdued shade of turquoise. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some people might be afraid or shy away from pairing **teal** and black, as the contrast is quite striking, but those people would be wrong.

-   Selecting a color for your kitchen cabinets comes down to the look and feel you want your space to have. While many opt for "safer" hues such as white or light gray, we're fans of pushing the envelope. Instead, try a bolder option such as **teal** — it's not as scary as you might think, especially when paired with a neutral color like white. Here, the white walls, ceiling, and marble countertops work together to temper the intensity of the cabinets, proving that dark shades don't have to be overbearing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Blue has wavelengths between about 450 and 495 nanometers, and green has wavelengths between about 492 to 577 nanometers. An object our eyes perceive as turquoise has a makeup that causes it to absorb all wavelengths of light except those that are between 450 and 577 nanometers in length.

If you have a small, low-light room, you might want to opt for a less dramatic combination such as **teal** and white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Sometimes all color bounces off an object to make it appear white. A black object will reflect no colors, which makes it appear black.
