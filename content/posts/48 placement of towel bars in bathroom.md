## 48 Fun Facts Placement Of Towel Bars In Bathroom | Shower Grab Bars For Elderly
-   The height and location of other items in the **bathroom** can help you decide where to place **towel** bars. For example, some people like to mount **towel** bars even with the vanity top to continue the line across the room. Take the toilet paper holder height into consideration if you're mounting the **towel** rack over it. You'll need to leave enough space between the bottom of the **towel** and the toilet paper holder. Consider the same height issues if you mount the **towel** bar above other fixtures in the **bathroom**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The top of a **bathroom** or wall mirror should be 55 to 60 inches above the ground. This is eye level for most people. For ADA-compliant guidelines, mirrors should be between 38 and 42 inches above the floor. The measurement applies to the bottom edge of the mirror. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Towel racks are similar in design to **towel** bars. However, they have some common differences as well. For example, the biggest difference is the number of bars. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In our **bathroom**, we don’t have a hand **towel** ring or even a hand **towel** rail, so I drape our hand **towel** through our vanity handle. No need to drill into tiles, the vanity or the plaster wall. If you want a designated holder which is easy to install, you could consider a Fusion-Loc **towel** ring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Well, all the above options can hold your **towel**s in different ways. So, we can understand that it’s hard to choose the right one. In some typical **bathroom** designs, you will see **towel** racks or rings as they are convenient and easy to install. But modern designs include **towel** bars and racks based on their interiors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For those who are wondering, let us tell you that there cannot be a standardized **towel** bar height. When deciding upon the **towel** bar height, you need to check the **bathroom** for a number of things. Every person has a different-looking **bathroom** with fixtures in certain places. In this section, we will be listing down all the essential points to remember before making a choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Towel hooks are another great option to hang **towel**s in your **bathroom**. These are useful and convenient and do not take much space. And the best part is, if you don’t have enough room on the walls for **towel**s, then you can simply install them on the backside of your door to save some space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Towel rings are usually common for hand **towel**s. However, you can use them for larger **towel**s as well. You can install one **towel** ring next to the sink so you can easily choose a conveniently located **towel** near you. This is the most beautiful, comfortable, and easiest way to grab a **towel** both in terms of accessibility and convenience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The more you concentrate on your **bathroom**’s cleanliness, the better you can maintain the health of every family member. Especially if multiple people are using your **bathroom** and the first thing they do is grab the **towel**, then it’s important to maintain its cleanliness. The cleaner your **towel**s are, the healthier and happier you and your **bathroom** will be in the long run. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a small **bathroom**, then space management is a key factor that needs to be taken care of. You will need to consider the placement and the **towel** bar height from the floor. Also, ensure that the **towel** bars are at least 4-5 inches away from the power switch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, the highest **towel** bar should be easily reachable by you and every family member. Kids may not be able to reach them. Hence, you can just keep their bath **towel**s in a lower **towel** rack. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you have bars or rings to house hand **towel**s near the sink, position them so they can be reached while you stand at the sink. As for height, place the bars or rings so the **towel**s can be hung without touching the countertop, sink or other furnishings in the **bathroom**. Use visual cues to help pick an ideal height and position for the **towel** bars; for instance, if the top of a freestanding **bathroom** sink is 35 inches above the floor, hang the **towel** bar or ring at the same height for continuity. If the bar or ring hangs over a countertop or cabinet, halve the height difference between a wall sconce and the countertop for another visually pleasing option -- if the sconce sits at 60 inches off the ground and the counter is at 30 inches off the ground, 40 inches may work well. Again, it's mostly a matter of personal taste as to what seems functionally efficient for you while still looking good in its space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, kids may not be able to reach high up. If you have many kids in the house, then the **towel** bar height could be between 30 to 36 inches. Next, we will also be considering people in wheelchairs. For them, it is best to lower the height further so that they can reach for their own **towel**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These are much similar to **towel** bars, and you can also heat them for drying **towel**s. You can enjoy the same benefits of cleaning and drying your **bathroom** **towel**. So, if you have many people using the same **bathroom** and every person has a separate **towel** then he can easily place them in different racks in one place. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re installing a new **towel** bar, look for a model with a non-mechanical mounting system. These types of no-drill **towel** bars typically come with adhesive strips. The catch here is that the strips can weaken quickly due to the humidity in a **bathroom**. We recommend using a stronger adhesive for longer life. The last section in this guide will tell you what to look for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So, we will recommend that you first hold the structure against the wall to ensure that it is at least 15 inches above the floor. This will vary depending on the number of racks and the size of bath **towel**s. Some people also hang **towel** rings along the side of **towel** bars if there are many things to hang. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Towels are the most essential accessory in every **bathroom**, which is why you need to install a proper place to hang **towel**s. Sometimes they are beside your shower or bathtub. Towel bars, racks, and hooks are common in every home and useful in hanging **towel**s. These racks and bars are available with plenty of amazing benefits and also look very stylish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some people have tiles or wainscoting done in the room, and the placement of the **towel** bar then becomes a personal preference. You should hold up the bar on the wall to check. Then see if you want the **towel**s to be touching the tiles. If not then, you might have to go for a slightly higher height than the standard 48 inches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With this, we are ready to wrap up, and you should be able to attach a **towel** bar easily by now. If you have any other concerns relating to the placement of a **towel** bar, leave us a comment below. We will try to address it in our future guides. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The ideal **towel** bar height can vary for different people. However, the standard height for a **bathroom** **towel** bar is 48 inches above the ground. That guideline should also work for a **towel** rack over a toilet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another option to consider is floor-standing **towel** racks. You can easily move them to your preferred location. It’s also possible to fold them and then store them somewhere in your closet or any other convenient location. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Other features in the room can also play a role in how high you put the **towel** bar. For example, if you have wainscoting or tiling on the lower half of the room, you may need to hold the bar up to the wall to see how far above that section you want to hang it. The exact location is often a matter of personal preference. Even if your **bathroom** doesn't have wainscoting or tile on the bottom portion of the walls, testing out different heights to see what looks best to you can help you make the final decision. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, please take into consideration the wall colors and tiles before making a decision. For wet rooms, the **towel**s will need to be placed outside or in a corner. Towel rings are the best option in this case. The last thing that you would want is for the **towel** bar to be standing out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How high should a **towel** bar be? That depends largely on who needs to reach the **towel**s and your personal preference. You'll also want to look at the other fixtures and details in the room. Start with the normal **towel** bar height range, and adjust from there to fit your personal needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What if the **bathroom** needs to comply with ADA rules? Towel bars can still be 48 inches above the ground unless there are obstructing features. For example, if you are installing a hand **towel** bar above a protruding vanity, that is an obstruction. In this case, it should be 42 inches above the ground. How high should a **towel** bar be in a children's **bathroom**? For smaller children, an ideal height is 36 inches above the floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mounted **bathroom** storage features are convenient. There are mounted **bathroom** wall cabinets, **towel** bars, toilet paper holders and more. Also, many people install grab bars for safety and easier movement. If you want to add mounted features and are unsure of ideal heights, you came to the right place. This guide will explain ideal heights and provide mounting instruction overviews. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remember to check out the color of the **towel** bar so that it matches the **bathroom** colors. Wooden **towel** bars will match taupe-colored **bathroom**s very well. You can take ideas from the internet as inspiration before beginning the project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remember that the people using the **bathroom** should be able to reach out and grab a **towel** while they are standing. Also, if you have a vanity cabinet over which you want to place the **towel** bar, then measure its height beforehand. It should typically be between 30 to 32 inches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You will find that a **towel** rack may have a continuous series of bars instead of just one bar. If you want to hold different **towel**s separately, then this type of rack works well. So instead of laying one **towel** on another, this type of rack is very useful in accommodating every **towel** separately. If you have multiple family members, each can hold his **towel** in a separate rack. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Additionally, you need to consider the toilet paper holder height if you are going to place the rack over it. The **towel** should not hang over the toilet paper holder in any case. Take the help of another person and ask them to hold the **towel** bar for you. You can then mark the height with a pen before attaching the **towel** bar. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another factor is who will be using the **towel**s on the bar. An average-height adult can reach **towel**s easily at most heights within the standard range. Kids may need a lower bar to be able to reach and hang **towel**s on it. Aim for a height of 30 to 36 inches if you have young kids in the home. A lower **towel** bar can also be useful for people in wheelchairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another thing is if your shower features a door, it’s most possible that it has a bar on the back. So, it won’t be an issue for you. But if that’s not your situation, then the **towel** bar should be near to the shower anywhere. It’s also best to include multiple **towel** bars. However, make sure at least one of them is accessible so you can easily grab the **towel** whenever you want. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, if you use extra-large **towel**s, then they might not fit on lower shelves. In this case, fold the **towel** in half and hang it on a **towel** bar. Then place it at a proper height where the **towel** does not touch the floor. Once you do that, you can proceed to attach the bar to the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The industry-standard height of a **towel** bar is 48 inches from the floor. This can be reached by adults of an average height easily. You can fold your **towel** in half and hang it from the rod to check before attaching the bar. Some people believe in using double rods for **towel**s as that provides more space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Towel bars, rings, and racks can work effectively in different sizes of **bathroom**s. Some homeowners find an issue in incorporating a **towel** rack as they are comparatively bigger. But you can replace it with wall mounted **towel** rack or ring as they take less space. Especially if you have a small **bathroom**, then it is recommended to choose **towel** rings or hooks as they don’t take up enough space like **towel** racks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What about a hand **towel** holder ring? The answer is 48 inches above the ground as well. On a **towel** ring, the mounting piece is higher than the bottom of the ring where the **towel** hangs. Because of this, the bottom of the ring should be 48 inches off the ground. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After that, you need to evaluate the overall space you have in the **bathroom**. If your **bathroom** features a big separate tub as well as a shower area, then you may have enough space to keep **towel**s separately. But if the **bathroom** is compact, and there is a combined shower and bathtub, then you can keep one **towel** bar somewhere you can easily reach. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If hanging a **towel** rack along a wall just behind a bathtub,the rack may be slightly higher than 48 inches and within reach for an adult standing in the tub or sitting on the side of the tub. This also helps keep the ends of the **towel** out of the way for a reclining bather. A rack for hand **towel**s may be even higher for a **towel** that hangs above a countertop, so the **towel** doesn't touch the counter. For a **towel** bar near a children's sink, placement below 30 inches is an option, especially if the adjacent sink basin is also low. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Common **towel** bar placement falls between 42 and 48 inches as measured from the **bathroom** floor, but they can range anywhere from 30 to 52 inches. A height of 48 inches is a common option. It gives you plenty of room for hanging **towel**s while keeping everything accessible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To determine where to put the top installation piece, you will need a ruler or tape measure. Measure the distance from the bottom part of the **towel** ring to the screw holes or installation point. This rule also applies if you are installing it over a standard vanity. The average height of a **bathroom** vanity is between 30 and 32 inches off the ground. An average hand **towel** folded widthwise will not touch the vanity on a holder 48 inches high. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In a disability-accessible **bathroom**, grab bars are critical for those living with disabilities. Whether the bars are located in a shower, stall, or around a toilet, having accurate measurements is not only important for all, it’s a potential lawsuit for the business if not done correctly. Grab bar code requirements are included in the standard ANSII-ICC A117.1 of the International Code Council per the Americans with Disability Act. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   According to the CDC, 81% of **bathroom** injuries in the U.S. are caused by falls. This can usually be avoided by installing a shower grab rail. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can choose the finish and design based on your **bathroom** style. For example, a brass **bathroom** **towel** ring can beautifully complement the vintage **bathroom** design. While for a chrome-centered **bathroom** design, it’s possible to get something that matches the interior. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re wondering if installing **towel** bars on plaster is different from mounting **towel** bars on tile, don’t worry. The process is the same on both surfaces. Here’s how to proceed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are using a single **towel** rack, then there should not be much problem attaching it to the wall. You can just attach it, keeping in mind the standard **towel** bar height. But if you are planning to get a model with multiple **towel** bars, you will have to be more careful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first thing is, your **towel** bar should be accessible and always in your reach. If you are standing in the shower, the next thing you would want is to grab the **towel** and dry your hair. But if it’s not in your reach, you would need to walk a few steps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the other hand, you can hang the smaller hand **towel**s on the lower shelves. That will give you ample space to hang large items on the top shelves. For a guest **bathroom**, you might not need to keep too many **towel**s, and hence, you can use **towel** hangs and **towel** rings along with one **towel** bar. The **towel** ring height can be the same as the bar making it more convenient. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So, this actually depends on what style you prefer and what’s best according to your **bathroom** needs. Some homeowners prefer to choose all the styles as each method offers unique benefits. It’s better to think about the one option that you feel is comfortable and reliable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
