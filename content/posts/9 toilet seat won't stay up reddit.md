## 9 Fun Facts Toilet Seat Won'T Stay Up Reddit | When your slow-close toilet seat won't stay up
-   You can make a **toilet** **seat** close softly by installing a soft close **toilet** **seat**. Soft close **toilet** **seat**s are designed to prevent slams, by slowly lowering the **seat** down to the bowl. Alternatively, you could use rubber bumpers or lid covers to slightly soften the impact of a **toilet** closing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Word of caution, don’t push the shims in too hard too fast. There’s a wax ring under your **toilet** that keeps the nasty water from leaking out. If you push too hard or lift too far, you could move or damage this ring and then you’d have a bigger problem on your hands. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can adjust a **toilet** **seat** by loosening the two screws that hold it to the **toilet** bowl. Once the screws are loose, reposition your **toilet** **seat** to the correct location. Then refasten the screws while holding the **seat** firmly in position. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Two screws attach your lid and **seat** to your **toilet**. Loosen these screws just enough so you can move the **seat**. You may need to use a wrench to get them started. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most common reason **toilet** **seat**s won’t stay up is because the **seat** was installed too far back towards the tank. Unscrew the **seat**, pull it as far forward as you can, and retighten. This should give your **seat** the extra angle it needs to stay upright. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use a screwdriver on the top of the screw to loosen it. If it spins without loosening then you’ll need a wrench or a pair of pliers. Use these to hold the nut on the underside of your **toilet** so you can loosen the screws. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your **toilet** slants forward, what you need are some **toilet** wedges or **toilet** shims. These little plastic guys look like miniature door stops. They’re used to slide under the base of your **toilet** to make it level. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some **toilet**s hide the tops of the screws under a small plastic cover so check your **toilet** to see if you have this. If you do, just gently pop the cover up to get access to the screw. Then it just snaps back closed when you’re finished. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To install them, remove the **toilet** **seat** the same way as you did before. Then, simply place the washers between the top of the screw and your **toilet**. Secure your **seat** and you should be good to go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
