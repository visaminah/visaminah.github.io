-   Known for its assertiveness and spontaneity, **red** is a color that breathes energy into a room. When it comes to your decor it can be a showstopping focal point or a stimulating accent. It all depends on your design style and the atmosphere you want to create. Whether you’re going for down to earth or modern and eclectic, a **red** color palette gives you a variety of options to explore.

-   Some of the misconceptions? Well, generally speaking, we’re advised to swerve using **red** in rooms which are intended to be restful by nature - bedrooms mainly. However, this shouldn’t be taken as gospel, as we discover. And whilst it is a firey character amongst its color counterparts, it can be used to create beautifully whimsical room scenarios too, like a dream dining room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That is not to say that white should be abandoned as a part of interior design – far from it. White provides much needed neutrality and can create a calming space. However, it is important to balance that neutral space with the little colour accents that stimulate the creative and emotional sides of your psyche. One of the best colours for this is, somewhat surprisingly, the colour **red**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Go bold with patterns when using **red**. The black and white leopard spot wallpaper is an aggressive choice—but up against a bright **red** and bold washstand it totally suits. The gold finishes add a lighter touch so as to not outdo anything in the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a more muted and calm room, try the pairing of **red** and tan. Tan is a calming color and looks great on walls. It gives you that neutral vibe, but if you want just a hint of color, throw in little pops of **red** here and there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Contemporary Homes: pops of bold **red**. Most often neutral elements throughout the home with pops of **red** here and there. Think bright **red** lamp shades or curtains. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My fellow **red**heads, I hope you all enjoyed Tuesdays revelries… or, for most of you, the weekends debauchery. Even if you have no Irish ancestry, as a **red**head, St. Patrick’s is your day. People rub your head for good luck, call you a leprechaun (or is that just me…?), and above all, definitely expect you to be wearing green. That is our color, right? We’ve all heard it… most likely more than once…. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Turquoise. Yes, yes and yes! This may seem oddly specific. I mean, why didn’t I just say blue? But there’s just something about this particular shade of blue that makes our **red** hair pop! Throw in some additional **red** accents (a necklace or bold **red** lips) and you’ll have a show stopper look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wear **red** with bravery. Certain color pairings can tone the charge of **red** down, making it look relatively subtle, while other **colors** enhance its warmth. Because **red** is such a forceful hue, it’s easy to create interesting sartorial conversations by simply juxtaposing it with other **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Oh, **red**. It’s such a tricky color to work with in the design world. Too much **red** can be overwhelming, and it’s even said that it can raise the heart rate. But **red** most certainly does have a place in the home when done correctly. The key to working with **red** is to pair it with other **colors** that are complementary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   4. Red and Orange. Using tertiary **colors** introduces vibrance to the space. According to the general color matching rules, orange is one of the **colors** that go with **red**. The gorgeous deep **red** dresser is a captivating statement piece, complemented with orange wall art. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With **red** and white, you can’t go wrong. Any shade of **red** looks good with white but especially a deep shade of **red**. Using white subway tile going halfway up the wall provides a simplistic finish and allows for the **red** cabinetry and dog pillows in the mudroom to really stand out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   White makes **red** feel crisp, clean, and fresh. A pair of fiery **red** pants are perfect with your favorite well worn white T-shirt, or wear a **red** blazer such with a sophisticated white dress. Look pulled together in a long, **red** knit dress worn with ivory heeled loafers. You also can’t go wrong with a white trench with an attention demanding **red** dress. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Incorporating **red** is a fun process, as they play with the color spectrum to achieve the desi**red** effect. Complementary **colors** are located on the opposite side of the color wheel, so pairing them creates contrast. On the other hand, a monochromatic color scheme features a primary hue and lighter and darker versions. Designers would pick the **colors** according to the effect they want to achieve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The key to wearing **red** is taking another bite at the cherry and rethinking your preconceived notions of the color. Weave it into your wardrobe by pairing it with fresh, sophisticated, and unexpected tones—think couplings such as mint and tourmaline, icicle and strawberry, and onyx and wine. It’s time to recontextualize the loud, vibrant color and set your outfits aflame. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red is imbued with symbolism—historically, **red** clothing served as a marker of social status (**red** dye was a luxury), political authority, and even religious rank. Red has long been representative of power, courage, and passion. Due in part to its rich history and in part to the intensity of its pigment, **red** is a statement tone—and as such, the thought of wearing it can be intimidating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The color **red** means business. This fiery hue bleeds excitement and demands your attention. Bridge the gap between subtle and statement by pairing **red** with another color. Yes, it’s official: these are the best **colors** that go with **red**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   4. That little Red dress. Yes I said it! Every **red**head should have at least one **red** dress. Make sure to pick a shade of **red** that doesn’t match your hair. The same rules for finding the right shade of **red** lipstick apply. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   28. Secondary Colors. Orange and green are secondary **colors**, as they are created by mixing two **colors**. Add **red** to create a vivid palette that elevates the space. The peachy orange and muted green add freshness, while the **red** carpet anchors the seating area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. Cinnamon. As Neil Young said, we are the Cinnamon Girl. The **red**dish/brown tint of cinnamon looks amazing with many a **red**head’s locks. Again, add some **red** accents! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red and black pai**red** together are a retro classic. The black and white check wallpaper gives this laundry room a totally retro vibe and complements nicely with the classic **red** cabinetry. The free-standing black vintage-style sink adds a nice touch, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – if you’re struggling to find the exact right shade of **red**, remember in most cases that less is more. Also, you won’t commit yourself to a shade that you will tire of quickly. Commitment is a scary thing – if you’re just starting out and want to add **red** but are a little leary, don’t go too big. Try adding in a **red** book, blanket, or a few pillows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whilst baby blue and bright **red** are very much opposites on the color spectrum, there’s a definite and somewhat surprising harmony when pai**red** together, and crimson really is one of the **colors** that go with blue. To get the **colors** really right then consider the finish of the paint you use. The trick is to select a matt and chalky powder blue finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Forget thinking about only Christmas when dealing with **red** and green. When it comes to decorating your home, you can totally use **red** and green and it doesn’t have to be December. The trick is to make sure you choose more muted shades of both **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   8. Red and Green. Pairing a deep shade of **red** and green creates an elegant space. The **red** accents stand out with their dynamic energy, while the dark green shade keeps it serene. A blue green or olive green would ideally complement a vibrant **red**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   13. Brighter Reds and Emerald. Brighter **red**s with a warm undertone pair perfectly with deep emerald tones. The space features a focal wall that stands out. The **red** sofa makes a striking statement, while the warm neutrals ground the color palette. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pair deep or wine **red**s with mustard yellows for a boho laid back look. If you’re after a calm space, make sure you don’t overdo the **red**. Crushed velvet textures soften the space as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – on that same note, you can add in **red** foliage as a non-committal way to see if you will like **red**. Something like a little **red** eucalyptus in a vase is a great start. Test swatches – if painting your walls **red**, always do test swatches. You want to make sure you get the right shade you are after. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mint green, Listerine, and sage, which are also unexpected choices, bring the depth and heat of **red** out, and create high contrast looks that work. Think an aqua green top, worn with a matcha green bracelet, and a bright **red** handbag. Tuck a mint green tank top into a dressy **red** skirt. Or make a minty silk dress more interesting with a show-stopping **red** accessory. A little **red** goes a long way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   26. Red Kitchen Cabinetry. With an elegant muted tone, this **red** kitchen makes a remarkable statement. The walls and built-in shelves follow the same monochrome concept. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   14. Coral Red and Minty Green. Coral **red** is a vibrant color that elevates the space. The mint green c**red**enza contrasts the gorgeous hue while standing out with the charming design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Colors that go with **red** are tricky to pin down - **red** is one of the punchiest **colors** in the color wheel. Danger, fire, love, and anger. These are just a few of the things which, throughout life and for better or worse, we are told the color **red** represents and because of this it is often deemed too strong for decorating certain rooms at home - the very opposite of all the soothing **colors** that go with grey. But is that always the case, we ask? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink is the perfect complementary color to **red**. It is **red**'s closest color friend, and as a result, the combination makes for a well-matched decorating scheme. For best results opt for a softer Etruscan or earthy **red** tone when thinking about **colors** to go with pink, as it tends to pair together more tonally than brights. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   18. Red Color Accents. When the neutral color scheme looks too flat, it is time to add bold accents. Adding cozy throw pillows in a rich **red** tone will instantly update the space. It pairs perfectly with bright white and creamy tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Which direction does your bedroom face? If the window faces south, then you’re onto a winner. South-facing rooms have an ever-glow characteristic. They sit facing south, and as such have the best placement towards natural - warm - sunlight. Match a south-facing window bedroom with the right color of **red**. Ideally, this is a chalky, matt color of **red**, such as this Sang De Boeuf shade from paint brand Edward Bulmer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink is an unexpected choice, and yet it works—especially a light pink. Try a pale pink dress, or one that combines both hues for a simpler choice. If you’re just foraying into wearing **red**, adding a **red** handbag is a great option. You can even bring a powerful punch to your work wardrobe with a **red** tote bag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – if you’re just starting out and want to add **red** but are a little leary, don’t go too big. Try adding in a **red** book, blanket, or a few pillows. Try foliage – on that same note, you can add in **red** foliage as a non-committal way to see if you will like **red**. Something like a little **red** eucalyptus in a vase is a great start. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lilac greys work well with **red** in a living room. Red can look particularly sumptuous in a living room, but “avoid teaming with white”, says Farrow & Ball color creator Joa Studholme. This contradicts the general inclination and move that most people make when forming living room ideas, which is to try and balance a strong **red** with the most popular neutral - white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Modern Homes: pretty much any shade of **red** will do. Classic shades to deep and dark shades and everything in between. Think modern art with bright shades of **red**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like a classic **red** lipstick, the color **red** in an interior design scheme is timeless, bold, and undeniably sexy. Whether you dress it up—or pare it down—the versatility of the shade makes it workable in all spaces. From cherry **red** lacquer to muted brick **red**, there are endless color pairings to bring the shade into the mix. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The other trick to working with pink and **red** is to let the pink be the star of the show. Add in just a pop of **red** and you can really make a wow effect. Something as simple as a piece of modern art on the wall or a little pop of **red** in a blanket or pillow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red and purple aren’t usually the first two **colors** you would think to pair together given that they are located on opposite ends of the spectrum—but they can deliver quite the punch. It really all comes down to picking the right hues. You will want to make sure that the **colors** you choose are in the same tone range. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Powder blue is actually the perfect partner for a bright and bold pillar box **red** shade," says paint and decorating guru Annie Sloan. “It instantly cools the fiery tendencies of the **red** and has connotations of fun and playful mid-century decor. Think American Diner, or indeed those beautifully playful blue and **red** Italian kitchens and cafe schemes of the 1950s era - powder blue and pillar box **red**? It’s tried and tested!” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   12. Pairing Red Violet and Green. A gorgeous violet **red** is a bold color choice for an elegant bedroom. A bright green will help it stand out while letting the **red** remain the dominant color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Denim is spectacular with **red**—it makes it casual and cool. Keep it simple in a **red** sweater, an inc**red**ible turtleneck, a silk button-down, or a cherry-and-white classic Breton shirt with a pair of jeans, or, for work, a pair of denim trousers. Any fade will work, from very washed to navy blue. Elevate denim and **red** with a chic black or camel handbag. If you’re wearing an all-**red** outfit, tone it down with a pair of playful and chic denim sneakers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You know how people always say it's important to find your power color? Essentially, the idea is to pinpoint that one color (or a few) that you can count on to look best on you no matter what. Well, that decision comes down to how well a shade complements your natural coloring. While previously, we've investigated which **colors** look best on blondes, today we're tackling another hair color–and-clothing challenge: which hues **red**heads should embrace. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Bright Red Accents. Vibrant shades are ideal for accents. When the space feels too plain, enhance it with brighter shades of **red**. A fresh coat of **red** paint will give an instant update to the front door, complementing the cheque**red** flooring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
