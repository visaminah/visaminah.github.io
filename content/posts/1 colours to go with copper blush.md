## 1 Tips to Colours To Go With Copper Blush | #cc907b Hex Color Code
-   I first featured the Dulux Colour of the Year for 2015 back in November last year (2014). Copper Blush is the perfect hue for 2015 as the trend for **copper** has just skyrocketed this year. Not that I’m complaining because I adore **copper** as it’s such a warm and versatile material. I have just received news from Dulux that the face of Copper Blush has been announced as singer, song-writer and ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ starlet Sophie Ellis-Bextor. I thought you might be interested to see some of the beautiful photos revealing Sophie’s first moments of the day as she wakes in a nightgown and comes to life as dawn breaks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
