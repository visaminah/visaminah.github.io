## 5 Things About How To Cut Hole For Undermount Sink In Butcher Block | Undermount Sink Butcher Block
-   I know many worry about wood around a **sink**, with good reason. But this oil protects so well, I'm not worried about the wood counters at all. We do wipe up around the **sink** after using it but we did that with laminate and granite too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before I did any more sanding, I cut out the hole for the **sink**. Since I’m using an undermount **sink**, and the edges need to look nice and finished, this part made me very nervous. I could just see myself ruining all of the hard work that I had put into this countertop so far. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes! Absolutely! If you have beginner to intermediate building/woodworking skills, and have some basic tools, you should be able to build your own **butcher** block countertops. There are probably several ways to go about it, and it will depend on how you want to use them. For this bathroom project, I’m building a 1/5-inch thick, durable **butcher** block countertop that could accommodate an undermount **sink**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before I start at the beginning and how you how I built this DIY **butcher** block countertop, let me show you the progress so far. I’m off to a good start, but it’s far from finished. I got it put together, did a preliminary sanding with 60-grit sandpaper, cut out the **sink** hole, got all of the cracks filled with wood filler, and then sanded it down to a smooth finish with 150-grit sandpaper. It still needs staining, lacquering, and sanding (I want a hand-rubbed finish), but it’ll get there. But so far, this is what it looks like. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, I took some measurements on the vanity, marked where the center of the countertop would be, and then determined the position of the **sink**. I used the template that came with my **sink** to draw where the **sink** would go. My marks at this point didn’t have to be precise, as this **sink** outline wouldn’t actually be the cut line I use to cut the **sink** hole. I just needed an idea of where to the **sink** would be so that I didn’t put screws in or right up next to the **sink** hole. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
