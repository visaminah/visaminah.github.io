It's not insolvable to remove when it's dry, but it'll be a bit tricker. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This method is a lot easier than the prior way. We know that laminated cards are sturdy compared to regular cards, so it can be a great tool to remove **acrylic** nails without spending much cost. Check on your wallet and see if there's an unworkable business card or any other laminated cards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My friend uses a plastic paint tray, and doesnt clean the tray between colors very well. So the **acrylic** dries in layers and was never really cleaned except when she used a knife on it to scrape off the dried paint. When she put her tray in the sink i thought id clean it for her and found this page. I am so glad I did! this saved a lot of elbow grease. I won't ever forget about using alchol on the plastice, I'm sure it would work wonders on glass and ceramic paint trays as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What? That is lazy mans talk. You must be made of money! Personally, dried **acrylic** paint is one of the easy things to remove. Try removing ink stains. So far isopropyl is the best thing for ink and it only works to remove 75% of the stain! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Question: I have a 5 gallon bucket with a printed image on it. I tried alcohol and **acetone**. I'm not sure how it was stenciled on. What can I try next? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Answer: First, marble cannot be treated with ANY acid or acid-containing product. Now with that, I would say put either denatured or rubbing alcohol on the **acrylic** and let it sit for 15 minutes. Then use a scratch-free sponge. Marble is kind of soft as a mineral and would scratch with harsh treatment. Once removed, you can then use a marble polish to bring the shine back. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thanks for your tips. I painted cabinets with **acrylic** paint and didn't realize I had accidentally got some paint on the wall, which I am thinking is latex. It's dried for a week. Can I do anything to get the **acrylic** paint off without removing the latex? Please no sarcastic comments, I know it was a dumb thing to do. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mineral spirits will not do unless the **acrylic** was specifically formulated with it. Lacquer thinner or **acetone** would work. If possible, I would paint over the blemish with a chalk paint or equivalent that can be lightly sanded smooth and color over it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I was making some titanium white **acrylic** since I have a pound of 99.5% pure titanium dioxide from my soap making days that I need to get rid of. I actually enjoy getting messy making paint BTW! Anyhow, I discovered, I could scrub my tools and such with a slurry of laundry detergent powder. I will eventually write a blog post or a hub about it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We stained our driveway with a silicone **acrylic** concrete stain. Our hoa wants it reversed. We are trying to cooperate, but cannot find anyone to do it or a solvent that will remove it. Help. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, and we will explain a few simple options to get you started. The first solution is to use soapy water. It is not as intensive on your brushes and makes use of existing products in your home. If this does not work, using **acetone** or an alcohol-based solution will work too – all you need to do is pour the solution into a jar, let the brush sit for a few minutes, and then wash with soapy water. As a last resort, you can always cut the bristles to remove any stubborn paint clumps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most high quality nail brushes are made from Kolinsky (or similar breed) sable. This is a very high quality hair, that can damage easily. If it is exposed to dehydrating liquids (scrub fresh/ **acetone**, etc) then you will actually strip the hair folicle and alter it's ability to hold monomer in it's belly and between the fibres.. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Instead of filing your nails in the usual way (along the top edge of the nail), you'll need to thin out the entire area the **acrylic** covers. "Using a coarse grit file, file off as much of the **acrylic** product as possible," Walker says. "You need a really good file for this; an emery board would be useless." Look for a , which is coarse enough to file down the surface of the **acrylic**s, or a nail drill. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If neither of these methods work, there is one more thing you can do. The last resort is to soak the bristles in nail polish remover until the dried **acrylic**s melt away. But before trying this method out, ensure that you have already tried diluting and prying the nail **acrylic**s from the brush with a solvent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   4. Use the nail buffer to clean and shape the natural nails after removing all the **acrylic** nails. Clean the nails thoroughly to be able to sustain its shape for the subsequent curing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using a glass jar, pour enough alcohol or **acetone** in it to cover the brushes’ bristles. Leave your brush to soak in the solution for a few minutes. Once the brush has soaked, remove it from the solution and wash it thoroughly with soapy water. Dishwashing soap is our preferred option as it can penetrate the bristles and provide a more thorough wash. Repeat this process if there are still bits of **acrylic** paint that need to be washed off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The problem is that **acrylic** and latex are nearly the same. Latex is water based paint with **acrylic** and polyvinyl acetate blended. Premium latex paint is 100% **acrylic** resin so you pay the price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 6: Repeat steps 4-5 until you have achieved the desired thickness. Remember that the more coats you apply, the longer your nails will last. However, be careful not to apply too many coats or your **acrylic** nails will start to feel really thick. Normally people apply around 3-5 coats for a long lasting set of nails. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I don't know if the paint is **acrylic**, its the original paint of the sunglasses, and its quite solid and have a kinda glossy finish. I've tried alcohol on it, but, it did'nt worked. I have to try the hot water yet, bu i think its not strong enough though. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hi Jason, I am about to move into a large studio with concrete polished flooring. I was going to lay down vinyl to protect it but that will be expensive and require removing the double sided tape at the end of the lease as well. Your article suggests that I could actually likely get a professional to remove the **acrylic** and re-polish the concrete floor. Is that correct? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painterman, **acetone** will do the trick with ease. I'm not sure how much you would need for a 90cm cube, but when buying it in larger quantities the price per litre drops to laughable lows. I think the more difficult question will be what kind of container you would need to use for the project as **acetone** attacks most of the plastics available. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Alcohol, **acetone**, and lacquer thinner should work on bare, unornamentedwood. However, hot adulatory water is the only way, If the wood is varnished and gets **acrylic** dried on it. Although alcohol won't strip shield per se, it may dull the shine or discolor it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Good old cheap household ammonia is quite effective in removing semidry and dry **acrylic** paint from nonporous surfaces, such as metal, glass, and plastics. This is because ammonia is often used to stabilize **acrylic** emulsions by raising the pH. The sudsy variety might actually be best since it contains detergent to keep the loosened particles suspended for easier rinsing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
