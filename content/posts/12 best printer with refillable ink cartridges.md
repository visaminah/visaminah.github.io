## 12 Things You Should Know About Best Printer With Refillable Ink Cartridges | Printer For Rare Use
-   For those few months, consumers have no other option to supply their printer, and must purchase these grossly inflated original **cartridges**. This is where Ink Tank Printers thrive in the market today. There's not a lot of competition from third-party manufacturers at the moment, a lot of the Ink Tank technology is still new and always being updated. Some consumers use other alternatives such as Costco ink refill to cut down on printing costs; however, more often than not, they're faced with diminished print quality, which makes the process counterintuitive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All of the **refillable** ink **cartridges** Ink Express sell have undergone strenuous testing in the machines they are built for. Before a product is even considered for selling it has to undergo a rigorous stress test to ensure the end user gets a quality product. If a product does not meet out requirements it will never be sold by us. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I want to call it highway robbery, but the average consumer wouldn't really see it that way, and that's the brilliance of the concept. For years, people have become fed up by paying outrageous prices for original ink **cartridges**. Now, they are finally able to break free from this extortion by opting for ink cartridge refill, but only if they purchase the $500 Ink Tank Printer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first Ink Tank Printer was brought to store shelves in 2015. The 'ET' stands for EcoTank, which would spin off into its own subset of printers within the coming years, such as the Epson ET 2720. The Eco Tank was a feature in which the printer would be equipped with an internal reservoir. This **refillable** reservoir holds a set amount of ink and can be replenished by purchasing an additional printer ink refill. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fast forward to now, with the introduction of Ink Tank Printers, they are doing the exact opposite. They're enticing you with the promises of cheap ink, but only if you purchase their original ink tank printer at an artificially inflated price. The kicker in this situation is they're still selling you ink at a markup. Granted, a smaller mark up than original ink **cartridges**, but the ink bottles on the market are still inflated in price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not only are you saving money by buying ink in its raw form, you are also saving the environment. For every bottle of ink purchased you are saving up to 15 **cartridges** from going into landfill. Going green has never been so appealing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Multiply these figures out and 100ml of ink from Epson Original **cartridges** costs £262, and compatible 100ml costs £99. Multiply this by 4 to get an entire cartridge set and original **cartridges** would have cost you £1048! Compatibles would have been £396. The cost of a full **refillable** ink cartridge starter pack for the T1285 series? £42! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're trying to get away from ink **cartridges** in general, using a laser printer might solve all of your issues. Laser printers admittedly are more costly than inkjet printers, but they will actually save you money in the long run. By running on toner **cartridges**, these printer toners last much longer and are able to yield you way more pages than an ink cartridge ever could. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The massive shift from cartridge to bottle caught a lot of third-party companies off guard. While still in its infancy, it's hard to tell whether **refillable** ink bottles will be here to stay or fade into obscurity like a fad. Ink cartridge refill may sound good in theory but not so much in practice. Regardless, consumers should feel better knowing that 1ink.com can always help them save on all their printing needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The way things have worked in the past is: brands would sell you their printers with very thin profit margins. They would essentially sell you their printer for the same price it costs them to produce it. The low price of a printer is the enticing factor for the consumer and is more likely to purchase one because they believe they are getting a good deal. However, they artificially inflate the price of their original ink **cartridges** to recoup the loss from the printer sale. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Big brands frown upon the idea of providing you with premium ink **cartridges** at an affordable price. As a third-party vendor, we have absolutely no stake in the printer business. Other brands sell their printers at a cost in order to rope you into buying original ink **cartridges** at an inflated price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whenever a brand-new type of cartridge is on the market, we have to develop, design, and rigorously test our own version of that cartridge in order to not infringe on the intellectual property rights of the original. Adapting to new technology admittedly slows us down. This may take a few months to fully develop these **cartridges** before we can bring them to the market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
