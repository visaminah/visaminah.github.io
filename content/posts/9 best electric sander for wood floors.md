## 9 Interesting Facts Best Electric Sander For Wood Floors | Best Sander For Hardwood Floor Edges
-   Wood flooring is a versatile material that can last centuries if adequately taken care of. Homes dating back more than a hundred years still have their original wood flooring. To keep **floors** looking their best throughout this significant lifespan, occasional sanding is necessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An excellent option for wood sanding is the OF16S. It's a 16" **sander** that can be used for sanding interior **floors** and smoothing exterior decks. With 120V power and a low speed of 500rpm, it's an excellent choice for beginners and powerful enough for contractors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An average disc **sander** is the most common choice. These machines use a sanding disc or buffing pad to remove old finishes. They can also be used to level out uneven flooring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing the right floor **sander** for your project is crucial. For wood, you need to look for a machine that balances power with a low speed to not damage the material. Always choose a machine that falls within your experience level. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Some **sander**s are designed for use on concrete, and these require higher speeds because the surface is more difficult to grind. Wood, however, is soft and requires a lower speed.
