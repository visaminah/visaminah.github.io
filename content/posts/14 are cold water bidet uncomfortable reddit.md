## 14 Things About Are Cold Water Bidet Uncomfortable Reddit | Toto Washlet
-   They’ll say that **bidet** water isn’t uncomfortable. But, as we’ll see, it certainly can be. But, don’t worry. If you live in a particularly **cold** area, you do have options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Today we’re looking at whether **bidet** water tends to be **cold**. This is probably one of the most common questions posed by newcomers to the subject. It’s a great question. If **bidet** water is icy **cold**, then the phrase, “freezing one’s butt off” would no longer just be a metaphor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I'm sure Reddit would have me beheaded for this opinion, but I don't know where to start. For one, I'm 100% certain that a good amount of the sentiment for **bidet**s here on Reddit is fuelled by a combination of wanting to be "in the know" of how unspeakably amazing these things are, and very Reddit-like attempted humour by praising your "squeaky clean balloon knot". When I come across a **bidet** discussion in a random thread, it is always like this and it annoys me every time. I don't think I've literally ever come across negative **bidet** sentiment on Reddit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Again, the water isn’t necessarily **cold**, but it’s unheated. This could be a problem depending on where you live, the time of year, etc. Living in the southern US, I know my water runs extra **cold** during winter months. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cold water **bidet**s are generally considered comfortable. The water is unheated but not necessarily **cold**. But, they can be uncomfortable for those who live in **cold**er climates. Both the location of the user and the time of year determine how **cold** **bidet** water gets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most non-electric **bidet**s clean with unheated or “**cold**” water (~40 to 70 F ̊). While unheated, most don’t find cool tap water to be uncomfortable. Electric **bidet**s have warm water (~90 to 104 F ̊) that can be adjusted via remote control. “Dual temp” non-electric **bidet**s exist that provide warm water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A standalone **bidet** is a separate washbasin. They’re located next to the toilet and are about toilet height. After conducting your business on the commode, you make your way to the **bidet** and wash off with fresh flowing water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you purchase the kind that hooks up to a faucet, then you may find that you have to hook the **bidet** up with each use, unless you don’t mind having an unsightly supply hose suspended from your faucet 24/7. The water has to warm up (faucet **bidet**s). The warm water comes from the home’s plumbing. So, just like with a sink, you’ll have to turn the **bidet** on for a bit before it starts to run warm. While it may sound like a minor inconvenience, a lot of folks find that they’re done cleaning before they feel the water become warm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most non-electric **bidet**s spray unheated water (~40 to 70 F ̊), while electric **bidet**s cleanse with warm water (~90 to 104 F ̊). With unheated **bidet**s, the water can feel **cold** depending on location and time of year. “Dual temp” non-electric **bidet**s exist that spray warm water, but they’re less common. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both electric seats and **bidet**-toilet combos provide warm water. Models vary but the remote control (or side panel) typically allows for adjusting the water temp between 90 – 104 °F (or 32.2-104 °C). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Non-electric **bidet**s include **bidet** attachments, non-electric seats, handheld sprayers, and standalone **bidet**s. It’s the former three (attachments, sprayers, and non-electric seats) that are known for using **cold** water. Standalone **bidet**s are basically small sinks so they’re hooked into the home’s plumbing thus proving warm water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By the way I've been to Japan and they have these everywhere - hotels, hostels, train stations, restaurants, Starbucks, 7-11s. You name it, it has a space toilet. More often than not I didn't go with the **bidet** option in public toilets, but my point is I've tried enough different ones that the problem wasn't lack of good options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’ll always recommend electric **bidet**s. I have one and it’s awesome. But, non-electric units are still a hundred times better than toilet paper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Edit: for clarification, I mean the toilet-integrated (or attached) **bidet**s. I'm also European and we have standalone **bidet**s in most houses but I've never heard of anyone actually using one. So no sir, not gonna use my hands there - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
