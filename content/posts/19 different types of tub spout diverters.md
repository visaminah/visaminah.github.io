## 19 Reference List: Different Types Of Tub Spout Diverters | Types of Tub Spouts
-   If you see a small knob at the top of the bathtub **spout**, you have a diverter bathtub. Lack of a knob indicates that you have a non-diverter tub **spout**. If your **spout** is connected to the water supply pipe using a small screw underneath it you have a slip-on **spout**, otherwise you have threaded **spout**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A bathtub **spout** can last for many years depending on its quality among other factors. Nonetheless, at one point or another you will need to replace it. To do that you will first need to know the type of bathtub you have. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The slip-on type of tub **spout** features a setscrew, which is a tiny screw that you can find on the bottom of the **spout**. A slip-on tub **spout** is intended to be slipped onto a pipe that is 1/2 inch in size without using any threads. You must take precaution when using this type of tub **spout** so that the end of the copper that is inserted is free of any rough edges or burrs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In essence front-ended threaded **spout**s (non-diverter) will need a longer pipe than wall-ended (diverter) threaded **spout**s. If you are installing a front-end **spout**, measure the entire length of the pipe and order a **spout** of that size. Wall-end threaded **spout**s will need a nipple of not more than ½ inch while telescoping threaded nipples need a nipple of not more than 1 3/8 inches in length. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Telescoping tub **spout**s – Telescoping threaded bathtub **spout**s as their name suggest affords you some flexibility by letting you make adjustments of up to 1 inch from the finished wall. You can therefore push them away or towards the wall within the range of 1 inch. They attach to ½ or ¾ nipple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   New bathtub **spout**s come with these specifications. What you want to see on the **spout**’s specification sheet is the recommended pipe length and diameter of the pipe. The type of threads also matter. Slip-on tub **spout**s will need a 1- 2 7/8 inches pipe in length. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thread the tub **spout** on the pipe, starting off slowly. A good trick to thread properly is to first turn the **spout** to the left and after engaging the first thread turn it to the right. This way you avoid cross threading. Tighten the **spout** in place but not crazy tight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ideally, slip-on bathtub **spout**s are installed on a ½-inch water supply pipe (usually copper) which must be of the correct length and without dents/burrs. You must therefore be very careful while removing the old one to prevent damaging it. A burred water pipe will often cause leaks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Slip-on bathtub **spout**s are connected to the water supply line using a screw at the bottom of the **spout**. They are the easiest to remove and install. The only tool you need is an Allen wrench to loosen/tighten the screw. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The front of the brass adapter is threaded while the rear has an O-ring to provide a water seal. When the adapter is connected to the pipe, the **spout** is then threaded on the adapter. The design allows you to adjust the position of the **spout** (back or forth) depending on the position of the brass adapter on the pipe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes you have a slip-on or threaded tub **spout** that instead of being connected directly to the water supply pipe on the wall it is attached to a brass adapter. They are rare though. The brass adapter is either threaded, slipped-on or soldered soldered on the pipe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rear-threaded tub **spout** – A rear-threaded also known as wall-ended bathtub **spout** is more versatile than the front-end threaded **spout**. It can be connected to a ½ or ¾-inch **spout** stub-out nipple at the wall end of the **spout**. Rear-threaded tub **spout**s can be used with the usual shower **diverters** or even with a secondary outlet that allows the use of hand-held showers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The telescoping type of tub **spout** is another version of the threaded tub **spout**. This **spout** allows for flexibility in many kinds of installation situations by permitting you to make adjustments of up to 1 inch for the wall that has been finished. This type of tub **spout** connects to 1/2 to 3/4-inch long nipples with the Celcon bushing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grab the **spout** with both hand and pull it out gently. If it is not coming out freely stop and make sure that the screw is completely loose. If the **spout** has been in there for a couple of years, it will not come out smoothly. Twist it right and left as pull you it out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The front-end threaded type of tub **spout** does not feature a setscrew. Instead, it will simply twist off of either the pipe itself or the nipple. Use a front-end threaded tub **spout** in two ways, either with a tub valve without a shower or with a tub valve that features a shower diverter built right into the tub valve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The rear-end threaded type of tub **spout** will provide additional convenience. It may be attached to a tub **spout** stub-out nipple either 1/2 or 3/4 inch long. It can be attached at the wall end of a tub **spout** that features a Celcon bushing. Use a rear-end threaded type for new construction as well as remodeling jobs. A selection of different models is available, such as those with a special outlet attachment or those that feature a regular diverter close to the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Seeing the screw under the tub might not be easy so you might need to bend and look keenly. Grab a flashlight and check under and at the back of **spout**. You can also use your finger to feel the groove where the screw is located. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Diverter bathtub **spout**s are the bathtub **spout**s you see in bathtub-shower-combinations. There is a knob at the top of the **spout** for diverting the water from the tub **spout** to the shower head. But how does a diverter bathtub work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Push and thread the new tub **spout** on the brass adapter being careful not to damage the O-ring. The **spout** should only be hand tight. Make sure that you tighten it all the way to the wall but with the right orientation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
