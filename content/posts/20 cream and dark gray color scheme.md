## 20 Tips for Cream And Dark Gray Color Scheme | 11 Cozy Living Room Color Schemes To Make Color Harmony In Your Living Room
-   This slate **gray** has blue undertones that blend perfectly with the blue wall. Like with natural brown tones, blue is also considered to be an earthy color. How? Because many natural stones of the world also have blue undertones! You might be calling the wall dark blue, but, to help you out, I have the exact name and ID number! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This deliciously sophisticated living room is done up in Neapolitan ice **cream** colors of chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. The tones of chocolate and beige on the walls add a sense of coziness; pink pillows and a gold table and lamp bring glamour to the room. The leopard print pillows are actually considered neutrals, which will complement almost any color scheme. A stark black and white painting lends an edgy contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a more bold statement, this stucco house is a stormy, blue **gray** (although some of it has chipped off with age). The red window frames are a bright color contrast from the main color. If you remember an art class or you simply have decent knowledge of colors, you’ll know that red and blue are contrasting colors. This means they sit opposite from each other on the color wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another recurring color combo you’ll see is **gray** on **gray**. Different shades of **gray** complement each other wonderfully. Light shades, dark shades, or even a medium shade of **gray** are free game for your color palette. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Slate **gray** again! This time it has been paired with a fellow earth tone: brown. The scattered brown and beige brick of this home’s exterior is just as timeless as the classic red brick. Brick and stone are both a classic and modern design that will be sticking with us for a very long time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not that there is anything wrong with choosing exterior paint colors that are dark – of course there isn’t! And this photo acts as the prime proof of that. The dark **gray** siding has been set off by an even darker **gray** paint for the trim color. That’s right: you won’t be seeing any white trim here! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Curl up with a steaming cup of coffee or tea and a novel in this soothing contemporary family room. The palette is composed of cool neutrals—monochromatic browns, **cream**, and **gray**. The rich brown sectional sofa is accented with **cream** and **gray**-patterned throw pillows. A plush tan carpet warms up the floor. Light **gray** wall paint pulls the coordinating **gray** elements from the patterned pillows and lends a calming influence. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This home in Cape Cod sports a lighter shade of **gray**, teetering between being **gray** and appearing white or **cream**. You only see bits of white trim on this house, and your attention is probably captured by the bold choice of a red door smack center of the design. The choice of the classic brick of the chimney has also been used for the steps up to that door with their own little design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark **gray** shutters have been used for the two first floor windows on the front of the house – purely decorative, of course. Now, the best part of this home design, two deep shades of **gray** can be seen on the roof of the home. Patterned shingles like these have been on the rise and can be found in different colors, which is absolutely amazing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gray (grey), like white, black, and beige, is a neutral color. The great thing about neutral colors is that they can be paired with practically anything and look good. Today, we’ll be sticking more toward the popular and trending **gray** exterior color combinations but you might see something a bit out of the ordinary, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sandy tones of light beige make this beachy living room exude comfort. Notice how the carpet, walls, couch, and coffee table are all tones of the same color, creating a soft harmony. Contrasting sea green and white elements are added in the form of throw pillows and wall art set upon a decorative ledge. A **gray** pillow and picture frame lend a soothing calm to the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you take a closer look at the deep **gray** exterior paint used on this rustic home, you will notice that it’s actually a brownish **gray**. This effect can be achieved by painting over brown with your dark grey color but doing so with a dry brush – this is how a lot of rustic looks are made. Yes, it can be quite the process but you might deem it to be worthy when you get a glance at the end result. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The grey of this home has some visible green undertones, but the star of this show is the clay tile roofing. This particular brand of orange can be a bit difficult to design with. Luckily for us, we’re talking about **gray** paint. Which, like I said before, can be paired with just about anything. White gutters, downspouts, and window framing are another effortless pairing on this home’s exterior. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You might have noticed that this slate **gray** has been a very popular choice for light **gray** house exterior color schemes and you’re right. Thanks to the earthy tones of this favorite color (in any shade, too), it can be both comforting and cool at the same time. I don’t know about you, but I’m a sucker for cool **gray**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Along with the white trim around the windows, a blue-**gray** fascia skirts the edge of the roof. It has a very sweet and delicate design that contrasts the hardness of the stone and dark grey color. The same color is also used to frame the door. Who knows, maybe they’ll make it the trim color, too! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Steel **gray** metal or paint was used for the garage doors, effectively shimmering in the light. Finally, we come down to another dose of light stone. This time it has been used for the bottom section of the house, showing where the basement or lower floor is since the home sits on an uneven hill, and for the base of the columns of the porch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main color you see here is the light **gray** siding, used both horizontally and vertically as paneling. This shade of **gray** is great for keeping your house light, bright, and approachable. Especially when complemented by white trim! The dark **gray** complement comes in as the shingled roof color, but still plays an undeniable role in the appearance and color palette of this beautiful home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But what are harmonious colors? They can be different tones and shades of the same color, known as a monochromatic color scheme. Many people think that only black, **gray**, and white are monochromatics, but in truth, any color can be used in a monochromatic color palette. Analogous color is another type of harmonious color combination. These are colors which are next to each other on the color wheel. Some examples are blue and green, red and orange, and purple and blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Coming back to **gray** on **gray**, this stunning three-garage home is made of a faded, light **gray** stone. The roofing, garage doors, and trim color are a much darker **gray**, sleek and smooth. This is a perfect example of using two contrasting shades of **gray** and pulling it off, without a doubt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re like me, you’ve probably been thinking about painting your house grey. But you’ve also probably been wondering what shade of **gray**, and what color palette to choose that will go with it. It can be a hassle to scroll through all the thousands of photos of grey houses just to find the right exterior paint color for your own home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
