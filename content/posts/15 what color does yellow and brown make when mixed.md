## 15 Interesting Facts What Color Does Yellow And Brown Make When Mixed | Brown + Yellow + White = What Color
-   Don’t worry too much about **color** temperature. You’d be better off learning the actual hues of each of your brown **color**s. In other words, where does each brown exist on the **color** wheel? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Locate some of the pre-made browns in your paint box. Some artists refer to these browns as earth tones. Why? These **color**s traditionally got their pigmentation via naturally occurring deposits in the earth. They’re typically various manifestations of iron oxides that were mined from the earth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s plenty of ways to arrive at a brown **color**. I’ll certainly cover some of the more complex ways later (and answer any questions in the comments section too). But for now I’m going to explain putting together brown **color**s by using a warm hue with the addition of black and white paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By using this logic brown can be **yellow**. Some browns are **yellow**-orange. Many browns are red-orange and of course a brown can be orange in **color** too! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   STEP FOUR: From here you can adjust the value of the newly created brown **color**. Simply add white to lighten it or black to make a dark brown. If at any time you feel your brown is becoming too gray (too little saturation) simply add some more orange paint into the mix! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I can, for example make a burnt sienna more saturated by adding red-orange to it. If I need to paint a dark, low-saturation **yellow**-**yellow**-orange I simply reach for my raw umber as a starting point. You guessed it… raw umber is a low-chroma, dark-valued **yellow**-ish **color**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Flaw #1: Hue Shifts – Yep, your purple and **yellow** are probably not perfect complements and as such you will not only be altering your saturation (lowering **yellow**’s saturation) but you’ll inadvertently be shifting the brown’s hue as well. If the purple is more of a red-purple your **yellow** will become more **yellow**-orange. If the purple is more of a blue-purple, well then your **yellow** becomes more of a **yellow** green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just to recap… To make my own **color** that matched burnt sienna… I mixed cadmium red with cadmium orange to get the correct hue: red-orange. I controlled the saturation via the gray that I pre-mixed before adding it to the red orange. Finally I used black to darken the value of the final brown mixture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I keep a full range of browns on my palette that span from **yellow** to red. These naturally occurring earth tones are my go to source when I need a brown paint. I have a knowledge of each brown’s hue, value and saturation level right from the start. As such I choose the **color** most suitable and alter it as needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of the brown mixing examples I use here use paint as the medium. Everything you learn here can be certainly be applied to drawing or even graphical media as well. If you’re into **color**ed pencils, pastels, or even graphic design, stick around this all applies to you too! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you attempt to make brown paint you really should understand what brown is. Unfortunately the term brown is an extremely vague term. Every time somebody calls something “brown” they can be referring to any number of **color**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Flaw#3: How to Darken? – If you refuse to use black paint, how on earth are you going to darken your brown? Take the brown by means of **yellow** + purple for example. You’ll end up with a brown that’s more or less light in value. If you add more purple you’ll mix a **color** that looks too purple. Most artists try to solve this darkening problem by throwing a bunch of darker hues at the paint mixture but this leads to an awful lot of drastic hue shifts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Browns can be light, dark, or even medium in value. Brown **color**s can also be considered cooler or warmer. I’ll refer to the **color** temperature of brown later. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For example, one might say that burnt umber is warmer than raw umber. This is because the burnt umber is closer to red as far as the **color** spectrum is concerned while raw umber sits closer to **yellow**. A similar case can be made for burnt sienna vs. raw sienna. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here’s your challenge: Try to match each of your earth tones by starting with a pure, saturated **color** and only adding various amounts of white and black. You might even have to adjust your hue as well. For example, you might have to add a tiny amount of orange to your **yellow** if you need to adjust the **yellow** hue over to a **yellow**-**yellow**-orange hue! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
