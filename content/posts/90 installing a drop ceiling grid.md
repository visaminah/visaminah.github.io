## 90 Tips to Installing A Drop Ceiling Grid | How to Install a Drop Ceiling (in 5 Simple Steps)
-   Most rooms will need some tiles that are not full size. For those areas, measure the opening in the **grid**, and add 3/8 inch to your measurement. Using a utility knife, trim any edge tiles down as needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Material – Many **ceiling** tiles are fabricated from materials that are lightweight and not particularly dense or rigid. Materials such as mineral fiber, gypsum, fiberglass, and composites, are relatively inexpensive and have qualities (e.g., acoustical) that are highly suitable for **ceiling** tiles. However, tiles made from these materials tend to be very rigid and stiff and need to be handled with care. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For an inexperienced do-it-yourselfer, getting the **ceiling** tiles into the framework of the support **grid** can be the most difficult part of the installation. The process of tilting a tile seemingly in every direction imaginable, then readjusting, re-angling, and finally, starting all over again when the tile refuses to lay evenly, can be a daunting task. And depending on the overall size of the **ceiling**, it is a process that must be repeated numerous times, all the while balancing on a ladder or stepstool. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are starting from scratch and installing your drop **ceiling**, experts advise that you begin laying out your **ceiling** **grid** using graph paper. Measure and sketch your **ceiling** so you can correctly position the **grid**. You will also be able to add up any materials you need, and it helps provide you with the same size panels for each side of your room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Learning how to install **ceiling** tiles without breaking them requires an understanding of the material you are working with and what you are trying to accomplish. A technique that works for installing a **ceiling** tile of one particular material, shape, or size, may not necessarily work for another. Often, not fully appreciating the limits of the specific type of **ceiling** tile you are working with can lead to breakage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The same principle applies to how **ceiling** tiles are stored away or staged awaiting installation. Whenever possible, **ceiling** tiles should be stored in their original boxes in an upright position. (Source: Ceilume) Avoid leaning tiles against a wall or storing them at an angle, as this may place pressure on them, causing them to bend or flex. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the damage to the tile is excessive, as in larger than an inch or so, or if a section of the tile has broken off, it may be salvageable for use as a border or perimeter tile (e.g., where the **ceiling** adjoins a wall). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drywall **ceiling**s are quite affordable. According to ImproveNet, most average drywall **ceiling** constructions cost $1.50 to $3 per square foot. The materials for a 140-square-foot **ceiling** cost about $250, plus the cost of installation. Labor costs are also generally low. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll also need a step ladder to access the **ceiling** to complete the installation. Other necessary items include a cordless drill, a level and a utility knife. Also, don’t forego a pair of safety goggles because the process of cutting the tiles to fit can create lots of debris. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Improper handling of certain types of **ceiling** tiles can result in damage or breakage before they are even installed. Materials such as mineral fiber and gypsum are popular because of their great acoustical properties and their lightweight construction. They are also typically the lowest cost option when it comes to drop **ceiling** tiles. However, they are also the most fragile and are easily damaged or broken. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By design, drop **ceiling**s offer built-in decoupling, which is the necessary component of adequate and effective soundproofing for any space. For sound to move between levels of your home, vibrations must be able to find their way through your **ceiling**. If there is a physical route for these vibrations to take, it makes it easier for folks above you to hear what’s going on below them. The design of the drop **ceiling**, with its suspended panels installed on a dropped-down **grid**, disrupts that pathway, effectively reducing vibrations and sound. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drop **ceiling** (also known as suspended **ceiling**) tiles – This type of **ceiling** tile is very commonly found in commercial buildings, schools, and retail structures. You know those 2-foot by 4-foot white **ceiling** tiles with holes or perforations punched in them? Those are examples of typical drop **ceiling** tiles. With a growing number of stylish colors and textures that are becoming available, drop **ceiling**s are becoming increasingly popular in residential applications. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Similarly, the **ceiling** attenuation class (CAC) rating also measures the soundproofing abilities of **ceiling** tiles. CAC measures how well the tile keeps sound from transmitting through it. This is especially useful for applications where you wish to prevent noise from rising from the basement to the next story of a home. For the best performance, choose **ceiling** tiles with CAC ratings of 35 or more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hangers installed, time for the suspension wire! Suspension wire comes as a coil, and must be measured and cut to length, then straightened in preparation for your main runners. The length of your wire would be dictated by the drop from your existing **ceiling**. For example, if you are dropping the **ceiling** 400mm below existing **ceiling** level, you would need to cut the wire 700mm.The extra 300mm is to allow us to wrap the wire around itself at the top and bottom. If you are wanting to straighten your wire using a drill, add more to the length of each hanger to allow for straightening. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The easiest part of the entire process is adding your **ceiling** panels or tiles. Lift them just above the framework of the **ceiling**, tilt them a bit and drop them into place. Be sure that your tiles are level as you drop them in. If you notice that one is not level, you need to adjust the runners on the **grid** prior to adding additional tiles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A drop **ceiling** can help reduce noise levels even further if you install special tiles or panels that are rated for noise reduction. The soundproofing capacity of **ceiling** tiles is determined by two different ratings. The first is the noise reduction coefficient (NRC), a measurement that runs from 0 to 1 as an indicator of the amount of sound absorbed by the tile. A tile with an NRC of 0 reflects all sounds back into the room, while a rating of 1 absorbs all sounds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While you probably think of the **ceiling**s in your home as being solid and unchangeable — much like your home’s overall structure — the truth is that a drop **ceiling** is something else altogether. As Bob Vila puts it, a drop **ceiling** is more like a screen that’s formed by a metal **grid** framework. This system holds and supports movable tiles of your choice, ranging from wood-look panels to old-timey tiles made from tin. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can scribe holes using a drywall circle gauge. Then, make any cuts with a drywall saw for areas that require a cut-out for recessed lights or a **ceiling** fan. These tools allow you to make cuts in any size. Once done, you can place them in the **ceiling** **grid**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Check Your Local Building Codes Before you purchase a drop **ceiling**, contact your local building authority. Depending on the state where you live, you may need a building permit before starting your project. Some municipalities even require you to submit your drop **ceiling** designs in advance. You can also ask your local authority about any minimum **ceiling** height requirements when you reach out. Most drop **ceiling** styles require at least 4 inches of clearance from the structural **ceiling** of a room to allow access above, so you’ll need to verify whether a drop **ceiling** is feasible in your space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the suspended or drop **ceiling** seems like a lot of work, there is an alternative — especially for rooms where you don’t need to hide ductwork, pipes or cables. Direct-to-**ceiling** tiles can be installed without the **grid**, using clips and tacks, screws or adhesives. This type of **ceiling** can be just as beautiful as a drop **ceiling** without all the elbow grease of placing the drop-in framework. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Final Thoughts Preparations help the drop **ceiling** installation process go faster and more smoothly. Take your time and get ready to be surprised by how handy you are. Also, be sure to check out videos, more how-tos, and the full set of installation instructions below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should whip up the graph paper to lay out the plans of the **grid**s. Make a scale of conversion of your room’s perimeter and plot it on graph paper. Trust us; it will make your job a lot easier! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After you’ve completed your **ceiling** **grid**, you will need to fit it with tiles. Suspended **ceiling** tiles provide a sleek, finished look to the **ceiling** that can be interspersed with lights to provide a modern look. Ceiling tiles are the finishing touch to the **ceiling** and hide all the wiring, ducting and any pipes in the **ceiling** space - but they may also contain insulation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Make your next **ceiling** install easier with the QuickHang™ 6” Drop Ceiling Grid Hook Hanging Kit. QuickHang hooks and brackets offer you a new way to install your drop **ceiling** system directly to joists more quickly and easily than with hanger wire. The kit has enough hooks, brackets, and nails to install 160 square feet of **ceiling** **grid** when used with other standard **grid** components. You can use the kits for your own DIY **ceiling** project, or your contractor can use them; the kit is for residential use only. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Create Your Ceiling Perimeter Keeping any local regulations in mind, choose a height for your **ceiling**—using a hand level and pencil, place marks on the walls around the room at your desired height. You can also use a laser level for simplicity. Snap a chalk line to connect your pencil marks into a level perimeter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For instance, mineral fiber and gypsum are most commonly used in the manufacture of drop **ceiling** tiles, and these materials are rather chalky and crumbly in terms of consistency. They can easily snap under light to moderate pressure. Certain tiles made from fiberglass and ceramic materials are brittle and can also break if forced into tight spaces or if mishandled. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The knife-edge should penetrate the finished surface (e.g., the visible side when the **ceiling** tile is installed on the **ceiling**) first, and the unfinished side last so that any rough or torn bits will be hidden from view. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How to Install a Drop Ceiling Learning to do a drop **ceiling** installation can be a rewarding experience and a money-saving skill. Get ready for your install with safety reminders, helpful hints, a list of tools needed, and detailed instructions. Learn about how to install a drop **ceiling**, including what materials and tools are needed to complete your project. From layout and planning to execution, this guide will walk you through the key steps of installing a **ceiling**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Manufacturers have many interesting names for their tile patterns. Matrix, Quattro and Allusion are all tile names with different shapes on them. You can more easily pick **ceiling** tiles by having a look at them, not by their names. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is the last step to install a suspended **ceiling** **grid** system perfectly. You need to start with full Ts and after they are completed move to the edges. Remember to cut each T in size you measured. Square up the **grid** by dropping in couple full tiles in order to ensure **grid**s are perfectly installed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **ceiling** laser level uses red lasers that can emit 360-degree lights that have the self-leveling feature. It’s a cheap option for 360-degree lines on both the X and Y-axis. If you get this laser level for your projects, you won’t have to worry about fatal flaws or breaking your bank. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Simply disposing of **ceiling** tiles after removing them is one thing, but re-using or re-installing them after removal (e.g., taking them down to clean or paint them) is where things get challenging, and extra care must be exercised to avoid breakage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Plan the location of each **ceiling** panel for an even layout. If your new drop **ceiling** installation will have border panels, make sure that the opposite sides of the room have the same border width. Always cut panels face up with a sharp utility knife. Place all **ceiling** and **grid** materials in one location. Be sure to check out the drop **ceiling** calculator tool to help with the layout and a list of the materials needed for your project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although the installation of **ceiling** tiles cannot be accurately described as being easy, it does not need to be difficult or frustrating either. Half the battle is learning what pitfalls to avoid. Armed with a bit of knowledge, some elbow grease, and some care, you can avoid damaging or breaking any **ceiling** tiles during the installation process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These are panel supports, and their job is to span the distance between walls. They run perpendicular to the **ceiling**’s joists. Wall molding or angles: Necessary for supporting the tiles or panels on one edge, these are L-shaped metal wall molding strips that run along the perimeter of the **ceiling**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now for the fun part – the cuts! Around the perimeter of your **ceiling**, you will more than likely have smaller spaces, where tiles need to be cut down to fit. To do this, you need a measuring tape and a sharp knife. Begin by measuring the internal spacing between your wall angle and **ceiling** **grid**, now use these measurements to mark your **ceiling** tile ready to be cut. With the face of the tile pointing to the ground, score your tile using a straightedge and sharp knife, which should then allow you to split the tile, without damaging the face. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Armstrong **ceiling** **grid** systems are the worlds most renowned solution to suspended **ceiling** **grid** systems. The carefully designed components create a durable yet cost effective system that will be suitable for all types of applications including homes, schools, colleges etc. We stock the most popular type of Armstrong system which is the Armstrong Prelude T24 & T15. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even for those experienced in working with various types of **ceiling** tiles, accidental damage or breakage to tiles can occur in preparation for, or during, installation. Most instances are the result of mishandling **ceiling** tiles or using excessive force when installing them. For instance, when trying to get them nested properly into the support **grid** beams and cross-members, many **ceiling** tiles are damaged. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you establish the border tile row’s size, measure backward from your cross-tee slots. Then, cut the main tees to the appropriate size. Never assume you are working with a straight wall. Instead, use your string to ensure all cross-tee slots are appropriately aligned for your **ceiling** tile installation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You are hoping to increase energy efficiency in your room. Because a suspended **ceiling** lowers the overall height of your room, it also reduces the amount of space that you need to heat and cool. This can directly impact your energy costs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   T channel is an important element that runs parallel to the floor joist. You need to place your first main piece of T-channel away from your wall as per according to the layout of your **grid**. The T channel will be supported by L channel on either end, and eyelets & wire spaced will support from the middle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Installing 24” X 24” Drop Ceiling Panels Install 24” x 24” panels in the same manner as 24” x 48” panels, with the following exceptions: In a 24” x 24” panel installation, the first main beam can be the border panel size or border panel plus 24” from the wall. Install 4’ cross tees perpendicular to the main beam, creating an even **grid** visual. 4’ cross tees should be 24” apart on center. Now install your 2’ cross tees parallel to the main beams to create the 24” x 24” opening - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you have determined the exact position for your drop **ceiling**, use a level to mark a line around the perimeter of your room to indicate where the wall angles will be installed. When marking this line, remember that you shouldn’t assume the **ceiling** is level, so don’t base the line you draw on the existing **ceiling**. Securely fasten wall angles at all necessary points, using screw anchors, masonry fasteners or nails. Miter the corners. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, you need to install the T-channel. These pieces of metal provide support for panels and other items that you’ll add for the drop **ceiling**. There are wire threads throughout to provide support for the metal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **ceiling** in a room is sometimes referred to as the fifth (and often forgotten) wall. More than just a plain surface overhead, **ceiling**s can be adapted to particular purposes or aesthetics by installing **ceiling** tiles. While installing **ceiling** tiles is certainly a project that most do-it-yourselfers are capable of handling, care must be taken when installing **ceiling** tiles so as not to break or damage them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now it’s time for the technical work, you need to determine the height of the **ceiling**. Measure the parameter of your room from the floor joist to that drop. Mark the location of the wall studs and adhere the L channel by self-tapping drywall. You need to be focused in order to install suspended **ceiling** **grid** system perfectly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are some drawbacks associated with suspended or drop **ceiling**s. For starters, drop **ceiling**s deteriorate more quickly than other types of **ceiling**s, such as drywall **ceiling**s. Leaks tend to stain them easily, necessitating the replacement of affected tiles. Over time, tiles and panels tend to take on a droopy, sagging look that can really age your room beyond its years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the tile is through the **ceiling** **grid** and into the plenum space, the battle is more than half won. The remaining task is to get the tile to sit properly on the **grid**’s beams and cross-members. It is important that the **ceiling** tile lay flat and evenly, with no visible gaps between the edges of the tile and any of the beams and cross members. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Working from your layout plan, take your 1200mmcross tees and click them into place of the connection holes between two main runners. Where there is only a single main runner at each end, cut the tee down to click in at one end, and rest on the edge trim at the other. Repeat this down the length of your main runners every 600mm to create a rectangular **grid** shape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Necessary for supporting the tiles or panels on one edge, these are L-shaped metal wall molding strips that run along the perimeter of the **ceiling**. Cross tees: Like main beams, cross tees are also panel supports. They are meant to be installed between the **grid**’s main beams and parallel to the joists. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Installing your **ceiling** tiles is the most straightforward yet repetitive stage of the build. You need to lay a tile in to each **grid** space without damaging the edges on the way in. So, what is the easiest way to do this? The answer is simple. Angle each tile at a diagonal as you feed it up and through your **ceiling** **grid**, this will make it much easier to get the tiles through without scuffing and damaging the edges. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Hanger wire alternative; a faster, easier way to install and level a drop **ceiling**. Hardware includes hooks and brackets. On center – term used to describe the distance from the middle of one main beam to the middle of the next - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The supplies needed for a DIY drop **ceiling** installation can be purchased by a la carte, or you can buy a drop **ceiling** kit. Drop **ceiling** kits make the whole process easier for DIYers because they include everything needed to install the **ceiling**, minus the guesswork that might come along with planning a project on their own. This can be useful for obvious reasons, plus kits may be cheaper than the cost of buying everything separately. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dimensions – Drop **ceiling** tiles are supported along four edges while seated on the support **grid**, which is quite stable, but the real challenge is putting them there. Typical drop **ceiling** tiles are twice as long as they are wide (2’ by 4’). At a thickness of around half an inch, these dimensions make them rather flimsy when they are not properly supported. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first step to install a suspended **ceiling** **grid** system perfectly is to draw the “To Scale” drawing of rooms where you need to install suspended **ceiling**. Layout the **ceiling** tiles on the floor to check how your **ceiling** will look like. Know the tiles that are too small to get perfectly fit to place them evenly. If you are having a perfectly squared room, then it could be easy for you to install **ceiling** **grid**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Looking for basement **ceiling** ideas? Drop **ceiling**s can provide a stylish cover for unsightly drywall stains or exposed ductwork and plumbing. With careful preparation, installing a drop **ceiling** is an easy and rewarding DIY project that saves you money and refreshes the look of your space. Our guide walks you through the key steps for a drop **ceiling** installation, from planning your **ceiling** layout to suspending it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Suspended **ceiling** tiles are a key part of suspended **ceiling** systems. The most common size for tiles is 600x600 and you can buy many modern designs. Cleaning after installation is simple and involves removing the tile from the **grid** and using a general-purpose cleaner to wipe off any dust or dirt. In place of tiles, it is possible to add lighting or LED panels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A drop **ceiling** is a unique way to cover the top of a room. It provides an extra layer of **ceiling** that hangs below the main structural **ceiling**. You often see drop **ceiling**s in basements, classrooms, and locations where an intricate design is desired for the top of the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Identify a point on the room’s wall that you want to be the height of the **ceiling**. Now, place a measuring rod on that point and attach the laser level to it. You can install an L-channel and stick the laser level to it as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The removal of **ceiling** tiles can be nearly as challenging as installing them, whether the **ceiling** type is of the dropped or surface mount variety. Depending on the type of **ceiling** tile you are removing, damage or breakage of tiles can easily occur during the removal process, especially when dealing with flimsy tiles and drop **ceiling** support **grid**s. (Source: DoItYourself.com) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The number of tiles that will need to be modified, along with the exact dimensions needed, will be known when the support **grid** is designed, laid out, and installed. In the case of surface mount **ceiling**s, the mapping process will determine the number of full-size and modified tiles that will be needed to complete the project. Typically, the tiles along the border (where the **ceiling** meets walls) are ones that need to be cut down to proper size. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adjust the L-channels’ height from the floor by using a laser level. We’ve reviewed some of the best laser levels for drop **ceiling** installation. Use any one of them and find the level at which you are going to install the L-channels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Select the lowest **ceiling** height where a **ceiling** tile can clear without obstruction, like ductwork, electrical, or plumbing lines. Nail the angle at each stud using 1 ¼” drywall nails. Avoid nailing near or on corner beads, as this is a quick way to generate cracks and nail pops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Experts advise having all necessary tools before beginning drop **ceiling** tile installation. Doing so will save time. You’ll be aware of any missing items and save on the frustration of searching for things you need. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you put tiles into the **grid**, it is best to put them in at an angle so they have enough room to clear the **grid** without snagging. Once cleared, push them up, angle them into place, and lower them into the **grid**. And that's it! That's all you need to know for drop **ceiling** installation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Installing drop **ceiling** tiles isn’t a complicated process, but it is time-consuming. We begin by instructing you on installing drop **ceiling** tiles from scratch, starting with installing the **grid** panel. If you only need to know how to install the tiles, you can scroll to the end of the article. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For the price, there are three individual lasers with 360-degrees of angle that can fill up an entire room with lines of guides. You won’t have to worry the slightest for any flaws in measurements. This type of beam orientation is essential when it comes to installing a drop **ceiling** too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you go all-in on this DIY project, you should know that installing a drop **ceiling** is a fairly labor- and time-intensive task that comes with numerous challenges. However, the final result is well worth it. The following installation overview should tell you everything you need to know to install your drop **ceiling** like a pro. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When installing **ceiling** tiles in any room, it is a near certainty that some tiles will need to be cut or trimmed to fit the dimensions of a **ceiling** and provide full, even coverage. This is another stage of **ceiling** tile installation during which breakage can occur. More accurately stated, improper scoring and cutting techniques can result in rough cuts, inaccurate lines, and misshapen tiles. Just like broken ones, mis-cut **ceiling** tiles cannot be used and will wind up on the waste pile. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This step speeds up the riveting method for your suspended **ceiling**. Drilling the hole is okay, but it is slow. Grid punches will save time, especially if you have more than one project in mind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A word of caution: Although one of the benefits of a drop **ceiling** is the ease with which tiles can be lifted to access the space above the support **grid** (e.g., to inspect water pipes or electrical wiring), repeated lifting of certain types of drop **ceiling** tiles can cause them to weaken and break. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Plan a pattern for the **ceiling**. According to DIY Network, these patterns can be 2-foot by 2-foot squares or 2-foot by 4-foot rectangles, depending on the tiles or panels you choose. The pattern you select can also determine the materials needed. As a general rule, with the 2-foot by 4-foot pattern, you need to space your 4-foot cross tees exactly 2 feet from one another. With a 2-foot by 2-foot pattern, you can do the same thing, then add 2-foot cross tees between the 4-foot cross tees’ midpoints. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like main beams, cross tees are also panel supports. They are meant to be installed between the **grid**’s main beams and parallel to the joists. Hanger wire and fasteners: These hardware essentials tie the **grid**’s main beams to the joists in the **ceiling**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Accidents and mishaps during do-it-yourself projects are a common occurrence, and fortunately, minor damage to **ceiling** tiles can be easily repaired, and the results are hardly noticeable. Small nicks, cuts, and holes can be patched by applying caulk (the same type commonly used around the house for weatherproofing or waterproofing) to the affected area. Smooth the area out with a putty knife, and if necessary, paint the area to finish the repair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are adding recessed lighting, place the wiring prior to hanging your **ceiling**’s suspension wires. There are special drop-in lighting fixtures that are made specifically for dropped **ceiling**s. Some fluorescent lights center over the panels, or you can find whole light-up panels for easy installation. Planning on installing a **ceiling** fan? Place those wires, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thickness – On average, drop **ceiling** tiles are roughly half an inch thick, with the overwhelming majority being between 5/8” to 3/4” in thickness. When combined with a standard size of 2’ by 4’, this can make for an awkward and delicate piece of material to work with, especially when manipulating it through an opening in a **grid** system and getting it to nest properly. (Source: Grainger – Drop Ceiling Tiles) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your room needs a new look. Ceiling tiles and panels come in designs aplenty these days — far beyond the basic vanilla, commercial look of yesteryear’s options. You can find them in colors, materials and designs that mesh nicely with your room's vibe to make your **ceiling** a true showpiece in your space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Metal tiles: Metal tiles are perfect for the middle or sides of the room, and provide a reflective surface that can help to disperse light. Metal **ceiling** systems also resist heat and moisture. Metal tiles are usually made from rust-proof tin or aluminium, which are also lightweight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The right way to install your **ceiling** tiles will depend on the suspended **ceiling** **grid** that you have. Clip-in, hook-in and lay-in **ceiling** **grid**s all have slightly different mechanisms. You can explore these in more detail on our suspended **ceiling** **grid** guide. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first, yet most important step of every **ceiling** install, is to plan out you’re **ceiling** accurately. This will include lining your main runners up, to ensure that you have an even tile cut on each side of your room.
