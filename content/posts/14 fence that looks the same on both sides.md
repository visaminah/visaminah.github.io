## 14 Tips to Fence That Looks The Same On Both Sides | Hit And Miss Fence Panels
-   Our double sided wood sections are made to look exactly the same on both **sides**. They are a tongue and groove picket system sandwiched between 1” x 4” boards. They are what we call in the industry a “neighbor friendly “ section. All double sided sections are pool code compliant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A shadowbox **fence** is a specific style of privacy fencing. Contractors use tall pickets to create a **fence** that resembles a standard picket or dog-ear **fence** when you look at it head on. However, rather than attach the pickets all on one side of the rail, they alternate the boards. The pickets are two to three inches apart, and the construction creates spaces in the **fence**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Frustrated? We’re on your side 100%. After all, you’re paying to turn your yard into a backyard oasis for you and your family—not your neighbors. So why should they get to see the clean, attractive side of your **fence**? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But we understand the need for the rule, too. Privacy **fence**s can be a contentious issue between neighbors. Forcing a new neighbor to look at the back of a **fence** can raise tensions—something nobody wants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The exact construction of a shadow box **fence** features the standard posts with three rails spanning in between. Contractors affix a picket to one side of the rails then another picket on the other side of the rails, with a slight overlap to obscure the view. They keep up this alternating pattern, and it yields just that - a pattern. Wood and light work together to create an attractive interplay. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vinyl **fence**s provide the same level of privacy as a wooden **fence** and are much lower maintenance in the long run. Vinyl **fence**s are becoming increasingly popular—it’s easy to see why. These sturdy, showpiece **fence**s are perfect for creating a clean and elegant modern style. Finally, even though vinyl has the reputation for being the most deluxe **fence** on the market, the price is still comparable to a quality wooden **fence**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Facing the wrong side of the **fence** towards your neighbor, either when installing your **fence** on your own or working with a contractor, can lead to you being legally forced to switch the **fence**—at your own expense. This rule applies for all manner of wooden privacy **fence**s, whether or not you paint or stain either or both **sides** of the **fence**. The nice side of the **fence** needs to face outwards for almost every type of common wooden privacy **fence**, including: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For those who love the rustic look of real wood, a shadow box **fence**—also known as a good neighbor **fence**—is exactly what you need. These stylish wooden **fence**s feature a stringer around the **fence** post on both **sides**. Just like a vinyl privacy **fence**, a shadowbox **fence** looks identical on both **sides**—problem solved. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While there’s a good reason for this rule, we understand if you don’t want to see an unfinished **fence** when you look out over your picturesque backyard. We may have the best solution, too. Check out some of our **fence**s that get around this rule—by looking gorgeous on both **sides**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Picture the above construction from your side. Now, imagine the same **fence** from your neighbor's side. The view will be virtually the same on both **sides**. The only real difference is in the posts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The finished side of a **fence** is often called the “face” while the unfinished side is called the “back.” Regardless of whether you paint it or dress it up, the back of the **fence** is the one that contains the horizontal **fence** supports (also called stringers) and the in-ground **fence** posts. The **fence** posts and stringers are the supports that keep your **fence** sturdy, but they aren’t as aesthetically appealing as the clean face of a **fence**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Indeed, what makes shadowboxes most appealing is the fact that there's no front or back of the **fence**. Your neighbor gets the same pleasing view you do. This feature is also ideal for the yard itself. Homeowners often orient a privacy **fence** so the front faces the street to enhance curb appeal, leaving the yard looking at the backside. You don't have to look at the back of the **fence** when you have a shadowbox **fence**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the main advantages of privacy fencing, beyond hiding your yard, is that your **fence** is longlasting. With proper maintenance, any privacy **fence** can last for years. However, shadowbox **fence**s are especially durable because of the alternating pickets. They distribute the weight evenly between the rails, so you don't have to worry about sagging or falling pickets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Head-on, shadowbox **fence**s are just as opaque as a standard privacy **fence**. However, if you're up close, you can peer through the spaces to the other side. This aspect is ideal for curious pets and children, thus discouraging climbing or jumping. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
