## 127 Tips for How To Kill A Tree With Rock Salt | What Kills Tree Roots Quickly
-   Fill a bucket with 3 gallons (11L) of water and dilute around 15 cups (approximately 3 kg) of Epsom **salt** in it. Use a trowel to dig around the stump and try to reveal the roots. Use a drill to make holes in the roots in all directions and fill them with the Epsom **salt** solution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With that big old **tree** now chopped down, it’s no longer a hazard to the power lines. And there’s more light flooding into your home. The problem, though, is that it left a mark – specifically a large stump – that’s now become an eyesore in your landscape. So how do you get rid of it? Do you even know how to kill a **tree** stump? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Epsom **salt** and rock **salt** will do an effective job in killing **tree** stumps and roots. You can also make a foaming solution of hot water, vinegar, baking soda, and table **salt**. Spray the mix on top of the roots, or flush it down the toilet. Repeat several times until the clog is no more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here’s a budget-friendly stump killer that does exactly what it says on the bottle. The easy-to-pour Spectracide Stump Remover goes straight to the root and accelerates the decomposition process. This chemical stump killer is in granule form, and depending on the size of your **tree** stump, it can take several weeks or months for the decomposition process to complete. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A freshly cut **tree** stump is an open way through which you can reach all the branches of the root system. So, the most effective root-killing chemicals penetrate the stumps and roots, killing them in one go. However, not all of the usual household chemicals will work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bleach: Bleach presents many dangers to the environment surrounding the **tree** stump because it’s not meant to be a herbicide. A high concentration of bleach may kill the **tree** stump. However, nearby flowers, grass, **tree**s, and shrubs may also be exposed to the high levels of chlorine found in bleach. Bleach can also raise the pH levels of the soil, which can result in your surrounding plants withering away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The time it takes to remove **tree** stumps depends mainly on the method you’re using. Grinding or digging the **tree** stump out may only take one day, depending on how large the stump is, the equipment used, and how extensive its root system is. Natural methods, like Epsom **salt** or forced darkness, are effective but take months to kill the **tree** stump off fully. Chemical **tree** stump removers can accelerate the process and usually take four to six weeks. Consider hiring a **tree** stump removal professional if you’re looking for the fastest results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 1: Start by drilling holes with a 1-inch diameter drill bit. Drill 8 inches deep into the trunk before pouring the Epsom **salt** mixture deep into the stump core and around the stump itself. Drill the holes a few inches apart. Make sure you use a power drill, we recommend a 10 Amp drill. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The quickest way to remove the stump is to rent a **tree** stump grinder. They are readily available at tool hire stores for around $100-$200 USD per day, or in the UK prices are a little bit higher at £120 GBP per day. Then you need to consider if you can collect the stump grinder or need to pay for delivery. You will not fit a tool of this size in your car it will need a truck or van to transport it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Digging: Digging out a **tree** stump is the first approach that would come to mind for most people because it’s quite logical. However, this is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. For **tree** stumps 12 inches in diameter or less , digging will be efficient as the root system is relatively small. However, large stumps would require bigger tools and more expensive machines because the roots are thicker and more extensive. Unless you’re used to this kind of labor, it’s best to hire experienced professionals to do it for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There will be many of you who prefer to now use synthetic chemical products on your landscape. Maybe you follow an organic approach and need to find more natural alternatives. Epsom **salt** is a good option in these circumstances. You can use the same application methods as you would with the chemical stump killers but instead use a natural product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although rock **salt** will indeed kill **tree** roots on contact, flushing it down your sewer line in crystalline form could add to the blockage and cause even more damage. You could use a liquid solution of rock **salt**, but that will likely bypass the roots entirely when traveling through the sewer line without making enough contact to kill them. However, a liquid rock **salt** solution is a great preventative measure since it can stop new **tree** roots from entering your pipes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To use rock **salt** to kill a **tree** stump, start by drilling holes into the **tree** stump. Then, pack the holes with rock **salt** and cover the stump with rock **salt**. Add a thick layer of soil and mulch on top of the stump, then pour water on top of the soil and mulch layer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Soak strips of rag or cloth in a flammable liquid such as BBQ lighter, white spirit, or similar, and push the cloth through the drill holes, deep into the **tree** trunk. Pour flammable liquid onto the dry **tree** stump allowing it to soak in. Repeat this process for a few days building up a good level of flammability within the wood. Just like preparing coal for a BBQ, let it soak in for a good steady burn. Remember to cover the stump to protect it from rainwater or any other form of moisture whilst you go through the soaking process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s not uncommon to see some **tree**s grow too tall and mess with power cables or shade a lawn so grass can’t grow the way it should. In that case, felling **tree**s is justified. However, you’re left with an ugly stump, and unless it’s the right size to be turned into a small outdoor table, it needs to go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Motor oil has its own use – and it doesn’t include killing **tree** stumps. It’s not only messy to use and works slowly, but it also will cost you more. Think about it. The cost of a quart of motor oil is almost the same as that of a chemical stump killer – and you’ll need large quantities for the motor oil to be marginally effective. You’re not only wasting time but also money. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Supposedly the heat from the water will kill the **tree**. I just don’t see this working. My thoughts are if anyone actually tried this the **tree** probably died from cutting it down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The primary difference with the bleach method is in the timing of the application. You cut the small or medium **tree** down and apply the bleach immediately to the wet trunk surface, right across the fresh cut. This will allow the bleach to flow into the **tree** trunk and throughout the root system, ultimately killing it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This compound is a highly effective stump killer, but you have to know how to use it. You first need to drill some holes at least 4 inches deep and apart with a drill bit, and then fill them with **salt**peter. After that, slowly pour hot water into the holes so the potassium nitrate can do its job. Fill the holes again if necessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The fastest and most promising way to kill **tree** stumps and roots is by using chemical herbicides. The best herbicides for this purpose are triclopyr and glyphosate. You just have to find the percentage that suits you, and your garden will soon be **tree** stump and root-free. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here is another inexpensive technique you can use to kill **tree** stumps. Covering the stump kills it by denying it of its basic needs — sunlight and water. The basic idea is to prevent these necessities from reaching the **tree** stump. It will effectively stop the stump’s growth and will eventually lead to its death. While this method is slower than the boiling water method, it’s also less drastic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Epsom **salt** is a popular method for removing **tree** roots and stumps because it accelerates the decomposition of organic material. When you use Epsom **salt** on a **tree** stump, you can speed up the decaying process by up to seven years. Here’s how to do it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most effective one is installing a physical root barrier that prevents roots from reaching the house’s foundations. Chemical barriers also exist, but these are not recommended if you don’t want to kill a **tree**. Another option is to use commercially available root growth inhibitors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hiring a professional stump grinder is the fastest way to remove a **tree** stump. It also causes the least damage to your garden soil structure. The downside of this approach is the physical nature of the job itself and the cost of hiring such a large and potentially dangerous tool. Stump grinders are heavy, noisy, and require a certain level of competency to operate them safely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So I have read about this working but I am skeptical if it will actually work. The steps are fresh cut your **tree** stump and then pour boiling hot water on the fresh cut stump. It sounds like torture to me but it may work so give it a shot and let me know. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The speed at which your **tree** stump will rot is dependent on a number of factors, some of which you won’t be able to influence. For example, a hardwood **tree** will take longer for the stump to rot than a softwood **tree**. But you can take some proactive extra steps to accelerate stump rot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Plan ahead and make sure you can move the stump grinder from the delivery point curbside, to where the **tree** stump is located. You don’t want to push this lump of a machine across your front path to find you cannot fit it through your garden gate to where the **tree** stump is located. Your neighbors will have a good laugh about it …but I’m not sure you will find it all that funny. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The only difference is you would need to drill bigger holes because rock **salt** is usually in pretty big chunks. You could also get a **salt** block and put on top. The only problem is it will attract deer if they are close by. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Start by uncovering as much of the **tree** stump’s root structure as you can. Then, drill holes in the roots and on top of the stump to expose the **tree** stump to the boiling water. Once the roots are exposed and your holes are drilled, pour boiling water on top of them. The boiling hot water will shock the **tree** stump and its root system, resulting in severe damage and eventual death. After the stump dies, natural decomposition will begin. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 1: Use a chainsaw or good-quality saw to remove as much of the stump as you can, cutting low to the ground. Be sure to wear protective gloves and goggles for this task. Remove the **tree** bark as it contains a sort of waterproofing that can slow down decomposition. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Place your BBQ close to your **tree** stump and light up some coals just like you were preparing to cook. When the coals are ready and glowing hot, carefully move them onto the **tree** stump surface. The coals will burn and break up, allowing them to fall into the grooves or drill holes that you have prepared in your stump. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To dig out a **tree** stump, start digging around the stump and find as many roots as possible. Then, use a hatchet, handsaw, or chainsaw to chop the more extensive roots. You can cut smaller roots with loppers or clippers. After dealing with all the roots, you should be able to lift the **tree** stump out of the ground. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not all homeowners have a large amount of Epsom **salt** available at home. So if you’re looking for the most inexpensive **tree** stump removal method, this is perfect for you. In fact, this is also one of the quickest ways to do it, as the extremely hot water can cause intense damage to the root system, effectively shocking and killing the stump. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, this method has its own downsides. Too much of copper sulfate can kill the entire **tree** and corrode your sewer pipes. So you need to use it sparingly to avoid killing the entire **tree**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You could probably use a horse to kill a **tree** this way as well. If you didn’t want to get an animal to do it you could try doing it yourself by continually cutting off all the branches that come up and it should eventually die. It would just be a lot more work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First I fresh cut the stump, cut it down where the **tree** was alive still. Then I drilled a ton of holes deep into the stump. I filled all the holes with Epsom **salt**s and covered it with a tarp and let it sit for several months. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I put this idea first because most **tree**s will die if you just cut them down. Here is a list of which **tree**s can just be cut down and which ones need to be killed. For example, all conifers, pines and maple **tree**s can just be cut down and remove the stump and the stump roots and all will die. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 3: Leave the copper nails in the trunk for as long as possible. A small **tree** of around 3 inches in diameter will rot within a month. For medium-sized trunks, it may take up to 3 months or more. But you will see the stump dying within a matter of weeks, but leave them in place until the stump feel rotten. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can always convert a **tree** stump into something appealing, like a coffee table or a planter. But sometimes you just want to remove it to clear space in your yard. While you can simply ignore or conceal the **tree** trunk, keep in mind that you’re also giving it a chance to grow back. It would be better to get rid of the stump entirely by choosing one of the following **tree** stump killer methods. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may find the bleach application has not been successful. In this situation cut the **tree** trunk lower to the ground and reapply the bleach in the same way. Then be patient, leave it for at least a few weeks and look for signs of a dying **tree** stump. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And there you have it, that’s how to kill a **tree** stump. Once the unsightly stump is gone, you can spruce up the area with some fresh plants or even start a vegetable garden in its place. Check out our guide on the best vegetables to grow in your garden for more information. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After months of research, I have compiled 12 ways to kill **tree** stumps naturally. Most **tree**s will die if you just cut them down. For **tree** stumps that won’t die this way you can try: sealing stump with a plastic bag, goats (my favorite way), Epsom **salt**s, copper nails, boiling water, anaerobic compost tea, make it a fairy garden, use a tractor, vinegar, rock **salt**, and burn it. Keep reading to learn all the necessary steps to killing **tree** stumps naturally with each of these methods. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Alternatively, you can flush rock **salt** or a homemade mix of hot water, vinegar, baking soda, and table **salt**. There are also some commercially-available solutions. If **tree** roots keep invading your pipes, you should consider physically removing them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Insecticide-based stump remover: If your purpose is to kill the stump, you must use this product immediately after cutting down the **tree**. Doing so will allow the chemicals to penetrate deeper and faster down the roots. The insecticide will help kill the stump and restrict any regrowth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Copper is a metal that interferes with the **tree**’s growth metabolism so yes it will kill a **tree** over time. Using the copper nail method has proven to be quite effective when it comes to killing small and medium-sized **tree** trunks, whilst keeping serious chemicals out of your yard. So let’s touch on how to go about using them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Removing a **tree** from a yard is already a tedious process on its own. But when you’re left with a **tree** stump that’s an eyesore in your yard, it can make the situation more frustrating. With the stump firmly rooted to the earth, you’ll need to apply one of the removal methods mentioned above to help you get rid of it sooner than years later. Want to get rid of your **tree** stump fast, with no effort on your part? Connect with experienced professionals in your area today. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tree stump remover: Purchase a **tree** stump remover product for the best results. Many **tree** stump killer products have potassium nitrate, which naturally reduces the decaying process to as little as four to six weeks, rather than the years which a **tree** stump would generally need to decay. These products are also designed to be safer for the environment. You can easily find these products at your local garden supply store or on Amazon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'Dig several four inch holes into the cut surface of the **tree** trunk. Additionally, you can also drill some holes in the exposed roots (if present),' she says. 'Fill the holes with rock **salt** and pour water into them so the holes are filled to the top. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fortunately, there are several ways to kill **tree** stumps besides hiring a professional to extract them. You can take the DIY route and save a lot of money, but you also have to be patient and diligent. Most of all, you need to know the proper steps to get rid of the dead stump. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The application of bleach is a little more awkward than using chemical **tree** killer granules, as it’s a liquid. Plus the run-off effect that bleach may have on surrounding vegetation or wildlife. It’s just a crude way of handling a **tree** stump. But it will work on smaller **tree**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 2: Apply a thick layer of **salt** for the best results. This natural method prevents the roots from absorbing water and nutrients. Pour some water over the **salt** to dissolve it so it soaks into the stump. Cover the stump with plastic to prevent rain from washing off the **salt**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 1: Hammer the copper nails to the base of the trunk. Go as low as you can by placing the nails at a downward angle as close to the roots as possible. Continue hammering the copper nails at 1 or 1.5-inch intervals around the circumference of the stump. With small **tree**s, cut the stump as low to the ground as you can, then nail downwards from the top of the cut stump. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The reason goats are great stump killers is because they are browsers, not grazers like cows and sheep. Browsers favorite food are leaves, bushes, and **tree**s. If you tie your goat up on a rope next to the stump or put a fence around it any stump will die. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using rock **salt** is a popular way of getting rid of **tree** roots from a sewer or pipes. It does seem too good to be true, but many claim it works. You simply have to flush some rock **salt** down the toilet, and that’s pretty much it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this system for killing the **tree**s, we have to follow some steps. First, we have to make some holes in the exposed roots. If there are no exposed roots then by digging the soil we have to expose the roots after doing holes on these roots and pouring boiling water on them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Reapply water once every few days to ensure the **salt** mixture remains moist. Keeping the stump moist is necessary because it supports the growth of the fungi that will eventually kill the **tree** stump. To speed the process up, you can supplement the fungi with a fertilizer that contains potassium nitrate. Note that this method requires rock **salt**—standard table **salt** will not be strong enough to kill the stump fully. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A chemical herbicide is the quickest way to kill a **tree**’s roots. You should treat the **tree** stump with the herbicide immediately after the **tree** is cut down. If days have passed since it was cut, use a saw to make a fresh cut across the top of the stump. This will expose new flesh. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One way to physically kill the **tree** stump is by exhausting the **tree**’s food reserves. This method may take years, depending on how large the **tree** was and its current health. If you continue cutting the **tree**’s sprouts off, you can eventually exhaust the **tree**’s food reserves, resulting in the **tree**’s death. This method is effective, but you must be very consistent and immediately remove all spouts for this technique to work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You cannot kill **tree** roots with boiling water. There is a theory that you can kill **tree** roots with boiling water, by exposing as much of them – and the stump if it's still intact – and drilling holes into them. Pour boiling water into the holes is said to cause heat-shock to the roots. This will not work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Expose the maximum surface area possible. Cut the stump as low to the ground as possible. Remove the bark, Separate any shallow roots from the stump using an ax or shovel. Saw, slice, or hack the surface of the wood to create deep grooves to increase the woods surface area Water the stump and surrounding soil once per week during the rotting cycle If possible loosen the soil around the **tree** roots to improve soil aeration - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have read enough places that copper nails do kill **tree**s but it just takes a long time like over a year. If you have time for the copper nails to slowly poison your stump then go for it. I haven’t tried this yet because I don’t want to wait a year to see if it actually works. I’ll just use goats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tree stumps can be an eyesore in your otherwise beautiful yard. We hope our article on killing a **tree** stump gave you some great ideas on how you can go about killing the **tree** stump using a simple and easy technique. Don’t forget to consider what you may want to plant in place of the **tree** stump after it’s removed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s worth noting this product is designed to be used on old seasoned **tree** stumps of 12 month+ for rotting. It is fine to use on fresh-cut stumps to prevent re-sprouting. Then a second application can be made after 12 months to rot the stump down by breaking down the stump cellulose layers and making the wood porous. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But worry not! This article will explain how to kill **tree** roots quickly and efficiently. Whether you want to remove the whole root system or zap the roots causing problems, we have you covered. We’ll guide you through the most effective methods to ease the process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If it is not necessary then you do not kill the **tree** roots, because after cutting the **tree** roots the **tree** also shall be killed. That also leaves a huge effect on the atmosphere. But sometimes we have to kill the roots because they can destroy our home walls, foundations, floor, etc. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The fastest way to get rid of a **tree** stump will be a physical **tree** stump removal technique, such as burning, grinding, or digging. These methods can be accomplished within a day, especially if you rent professional equipment to get the job done quickly. Digging and grinding can be performed using specialty tools, ultimately resulting in the dead **tree** stump and its roots being removed entirely from the ground. On the other hand, burning the **tree** stump will kill the plant itself and allow you to remove its ashes. Please note that burning a **tree** stump is illegal in some areas due to fire codes, so always check your local laws before attempting to burn a **tree** stump. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s the clean and easy applicator cap that wins its place on our shortlist. Simply pour the granules deep into **tree** stumps and keep your hands clean. Check the latest price here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Trees are resilient organisms. For example, did you know that **tree** roots can sense moisture and will naturally grow in the direction of water sources? This fascinating fact can cause nightmares for homeowners. Since sewer lines are located underground, **tree** roots can seek them out as a source of water. Any damaged areas or gaps in your sewer pipes are gateways for them to slowly ease their way in. Once the roots absorb the moisture from the pipe, they expand, causing severe damage that can lead to costly repairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tree roots can cause major damage to your sewer line and lead to a whole host of problems, including sewage backup and expensive repairs. Luckily, there are many ways you can get rid of **tree** roots in a sewer line before they cause problems. You don't have to wait until there's sewage backing up into your drains before taking action. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here is another method similar to Epsom **salt**, but you’ll be using rock **salt** instead. Rock **salt** has bigger chunks of **salt** crystals than ordinary table **salt**. It can be harmful to the plants in your landscaping, especially those near the **tree** stump. In fact, common **salt** (sodium chloride) has been used in ancient biological warfare to destroy fields and crops. That’s why it’s better to try killing the **tree** stump using Epsom **salt** first before resorting to this method. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rock **salt** is similar in composition to Epsom **salt**, which means that it can also be effective at killing off a **tree** stump. However, its method of action is a bit different than Epsom **salt**’s, so you’ll need to take slightly different steps when applying it. Here’s how to kill a **tree** stump using rock **salt**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are lots of chemical compounds readily available that make the process of killing **tree** stumps very easy. The downside is that it takes longer than the other processes. But it is much safer and required less hard work. Chemical products such as RoundUp, Organic compounds like Epsom **salt**s, or alternative methods like copper nails are all options worth exploring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bleach can’t penetrate **tree** roots through the stump, so it’s ineffective in killing them. That said, concentrated bleach can damage young and smaller **tree**s beyond recovery and kill them. However, using bleach can create a bigger problem — raising the pH value above optimal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using chemical **tree** stump killers is often the slowest method, but also the least labor-intensive and safest way to get rid of your stump, and its roots. So it stands to reason that it is also the most popular DIY approach. So Let’s start here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The saw and burn method involves cutting a grid on the top of the **tree** stump with a chainsaw or pole saw. Cut down deep to create a grid of 2x2-inch wooden uprights. This provides a great way of getting the fire to penetrate deep down into the **tree** stump for a very fast and effective but. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best part of this stump killer is that it comes in a handy squirt bottle. You can easily apply the liquid directly on the stump or drill holes through the outer layer to get the product deep into the **tree** core. This popular product is available from general hardware stores and you can get it online from Amazon.com. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bleach is never intended to be used as an herbicide. While you could still kill a **tree** stump by pouring large quantities of bleach over it, you’re also putting the surrounding plants at risk. High concentration of chlorine significantly raises the soil pH, which is very toxic to plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I will be adding to this list as I experiment and learn of more ways for how to kill **tree**s naturally. I am sure I am just scratching the surface. You would be amazed at everyone I tell about this site has their own way of killing **tree**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Killing a **tree** stump and allowing it to decompose before removal has one major flaw – it can take a lot of time. Physically removing a stump is the fastest method. Yes, it would require much effort, especially if the root system is expansive. But it will get rid of the eyesore in your yard much faster. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your purpose is to kill the stump, you must use this product immediately after cutting down the **tree**. Doing so will allow the chemicals to penetrate deeper and faster down the roots. The insecticide will help kill the stump and restrict any regrowth. Tree stump remover: If the stump is already dead, it can take a long time for the natural decomposition to happen. Using a **tree** stump remover like Spectracide can help reduce the waiting time from years to as little as six weeks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Burning is a great method of killing a **tree** stump. The burning process will take around 24-48 hours depending on the size of the stump. But you will also need to spend a few days preparing the **tree** stump by cutting burning slots or drilling out holes, and soaking the stump with fuel or oil to assist the burning process. Clearly, this method comes with a hazard warning when working with fire and its unpredictability. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The nice part about using Epsom **salt**s versus rock **salt** is that Epsom **salt** is actually is good for your plants. Rock **salt** is not. Maybe if I would have used rock **salt** instead of Epsom **salt**s my **tree** stump would have died. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
