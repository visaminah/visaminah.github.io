## 43 Things About Best Material For Kitchen Counters 2020 | Corian
-   Stainless steel worktops blend beautiful aesthetics with exceptional functional features for your functional **kitchen**. Because many big **kitchen** appliances now sport stainless steel finishes, you may pick a countertop material that perfectly combines with your refrigerator, dishwasher, and more. These kinds of countertops are more typically prevalent in retro-inspired **kitchen** designs. It gives off a clean, attractive, and efficient aspect to the room and blends perfectly with modern lighting and decorations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Soapstone is another natural stone that is usually dark gray with a smooth and silky feel. It has seen a recent surge as an alternative to granite. Furthermore, soapstone is common in historic homes, but you can also find it in modern homes as both a countertop and sink material. Over time, soapstone takes an antique design structure that can be very attractive in specific **kitchen** styles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ah, the granite countertop – still the reigning queen of **kitchen** countertop materials. Throughout Ottawa, granite is one of our most-requested materials for new **kitchen** designs and a very popular choice for bathroom vanities as well. Let’s face it: it’s gorgeous and instantly adds elegance to your **kitchen** with a deep, glossy shine. Made of natural granite stone, every slab has a unique design, from a subtle pattern to big, bold markings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In terms of longevity, some of the best options for your **kitchen** countertop come from a selection of natural stones. This includes materials like granite, quartz and Marble. Natural stones are extremely durable and can last in a **kitchen** for over 100 years, so you likely won’t have to worry about replacing them at any point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A natural looking **kitchen** countertop, made from materials such as oak or walnut, this is a perfect look for all **kitchen** style types. When properly sealed and if well maintained, hardwood countertops can be long-lasting and durable. Having said this, you still shouldn’t use these surfaces as a chopping board as it might scratch, nor should you put anything hot on top as it can scorch the material. In addition, hardwood countertop surfaces need to be maintained bi-annually with oil, to avoid stains. Hardwood countertops are more affordable than some other materials, they can also be cut and installed much easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Large Islands Popular: Following a **kitchen** renovation, one in five homeowners say that a top activity at their island is work, up 4% from 2021. Homeowners are making space for this activity, with nearly two in five islands stretching more than 7 feet in length, up five percentage points from last year. Homeowners are also making the space brighter, with the vast majority installing new light fixtures above islands (92%). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Appliances Get a Boost from High-Tech Features: Appliances are the second most common feature that homeowners splurge on during **kitchen** renovations (27%). Over a third of upgraded appliances include high-tech features, up six percentage points from the previous year.

-   The man-made alternative to granite, quartz is fortified with resin, to make it a hard-wearing, and customisable, **kitchen** work surface. Like the granite countertop, the quartz countertop is extremely hard-wearing and durable, it is heat resistant, antibacterial and easy to clean, as well as being naturally scratch resistant. Unlike the granite, with a quartz countertop you are not limited in colour choice, which makes achieving your design goals much more achievable. Because of this, the quartz countertop is perfect for any **kitchen** of any style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Poor laminate. It often gets left behind in the style stampede towards the more upscale or natural stone countertops. The truth is that laminate (also known by the brand name Formica) is low maintenance and incredibly budget-friendly. If your **kitchen** is in a starter home or you have an Ottawa property you plan to rent, you might be completely satisfied with laminate. In addition, newer modern laminates can be really stylish; they’re offered in virtually any colour or pattern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Although it has many pros, like heat resistance and no need for a sealant, it certainly isn’t maintenance-free. It’s a “soft” stone surface, prone to nicks and scratches. Oiling can keep these imperfections at bay, but soapstone will develop a patina over time. This creates an antique look that is perfect for some **kitchen** design styles. If you aren’t willing to embrace a vintage look, you might want to consider another countertop surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

However, now they are considered mid-tier; still, solid-surface materials are among the best countertop options for a mid-range **kitchen**. Further, it can also be a good countertop material in a high-end **kitchen** with lots of space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tile is another long-lasting, **kitchen** countertop material. There are many different types of tiles to choose from, but ceramic and porcelain tiles are among the best.

-   To greatly reduce the presence of bacteria, viruses and other potentially harmful substances, like fungus or mold, we recommend you install a non-porous, man-made countertop in your **kitchen**.

-   The reason Indian food tastes so good is because of the amount of work that goes into making it. But ask anyone who has ever cooked Indian curries and they will tell you all about the aftermath of cleaning the **kitchen** post a heavy meal. If you pick a lighter colour for the **kitchen** countertop, you might have to live with the stains for months and if you take metal, it might trap heat and make it unbearable to stand around. If you are stuck between wanting a good looking, modern Indian **kitchen** design and one that fits Indian cooking, then these options might be suitable for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

The ideal texture is often smooth, since it is simpler to operate on soft surfaces and easier to clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We’ll give an honorable mention goes to concrete countertops. With a lifespan of half of the other three materials listed, 50 years is still a considerable amount of time for any household fixture. Concrete is extremely durable and tough, and it has the benefit of being able to be repaired if it is broken or chipped. On the other hand, concrete is rather expensive. As it won’t be saving you any money, it may be best to consider other **kitchen** countertop materials that will guarantee you a lifetime of use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the downsides, however, is that natural stone countertops are very expensive. As one of the more expensive options, it may not be affordable for everyone to install into their **kitchen**s. Natural stone also requires proper maintenance in cleaning, polishing and sealing for it to reach its long lifespan. If not properly maintained, natural stones can lose their beautiful shine and color and give into the wear and tear of **kitchen** use, eventually needing to be replaced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Unique and divine in its look, the marble countertop is sure to add the wow factor to any **kitchen**. The marble material is incomparable to any other, which is why it has always been a popular **kitchen** work surface. Marble countertops are often more affordable than granite, quartz and stainless steel, however, there are less durable. Marble is often softer and more porous, which means it can stain or become scratched. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the most important factors to consider is the cost of the material. Exotic materials, such as zinc, bamboo, and stainless steel, may prove prohibitively costly and difficult to maintain for most individuals. Materials such as engineered stone, slab granite, solid surface material, classic laminates, and ceramic tile may be valuable and affordable. However, the key to finding out that one material that best suits your **kitchen** needs is to learn more about the available options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
