-   Wall colors for dark **furniture** are an important choice as they will define the mood set in that room. Painting the walls grey in a room with dark **furniture** adds a feeling of calm and elegance to the room. The low contrast forms a bubble that envelops all who enter. Especially if your food **furniture** has a slight hint of cherry or maple, then you will not go wrong with the grey wall color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Consider the size of the room you’re decorating and what kind of feeling you want to create – a large room with high ceilings can handle a lot of brown (in any shade) without it creating an overwhelming heaviness, whereas in a smaller space with average ceiling height and no grand architectural features, a dark tone can feel oppressive if there’s a lot of it. In smaller spaces, less is more, so go for gentle accents such as cushions, footstools, artwork or antique pieces of **furniture**, but use the colour in moderation and lean towards lighter shades of caramel and tobacco if you’re still not sure. The exception to this would be if you’re purposely creating a cosy winter snug, in which case the feeling of a darker, enveloping space wouldn’t be a bad thing, so go forth and complement deep terracotta or ochre walls with chocolate brown velvet curtains and punchy printed armchairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Much like the purples, dark reds will transform a room and add much-needed light. Dark red walls with dark wood **furniture** can give the room a more historic feel. Wine reds are extremely popular and complement **furniture** made with walnut, maple, and mahogany wood. If you want your living room to stand out, then this may be a fun, bold choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here’s the deal, when decorating a space that has a brown couch as a focal point, you have to balance the heaviness of the brown **furniture**. You can balance the **furniture** with different shades of **paint**, window treatments, accessories, rugs, and even pillows. Consider this, if you have a dark chocolate brown sofa, dark moody walls, and then layer on darker accents like a rug – your space will feel dark. That is not always a bad thing. If you are looking for a moody and warm space, then that may work for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Its fresh new appeal could be linked to the tactile and warm approach to minimalism described by trend forecasting experts WGSN as ‘soulful minimalism’, where cool tones and sharp lines are being replaced by natural materials, texture and a neutral colour palette of warm whites, browns and greens. Or perhaps it’s the strong association between shades of tan and brown and the 1970s, another current trend that we’re seeing in various interior designers’ work and – frankly – all over social media and Pinterest. We don’t mean Austin Powers-esque shag carpets and swirly orange prints. Think tan leather **furniture**, rich brown velvet, muted abstract art and Yves Saint Laurent’s Paris apartment. All the best parts of the Seventies with none of the hot sweats of garish nostalgia. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Go green! Everyone's doing it—a number of **paint** companies named green the color of the year for 2022. Feel like taking part in this trend? Here's how to best pair green with your brown **furniture**. "We went with Essex Green by Benjamin Moore for this bedroom lounge to pair with the brown leather sofa," designer Bryan Yates says of the space shown here. "By using a richer color, we were able to offset the brown piece helping blend the space together and not making it feel so heavy." Coordinating accents—such as a plush throw blanket and patterned pillows featuring a similar green hue—help to cozy up this space even further and make it feel more complete. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   White walls and dark **furniture** are bound together in this perfectly classy marriage that adds so much charm to a room. A white living room color with dark **furniture** will make that room look clean and spacious. It will give it a look of organization yet warmth. There is a quiet distinction in white walls that lightens a room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Green walls used in rooms with dark **furniture** are extremely natural. It is widely used in the designing world for it represents the most basic of our instincts and provides us with a feeling of coming home. Brown and green are the most prevalent colors in nature so surely, they are perfect partners in design. With green and dark wood, you cannot go wrong. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ochre is a hue that when combined with green and with dark **furniture** can give your room a look from the fairytales. This magical combination of colors with dark wood **furniture** is whimsical whilst having a calming effect. Wall colors for dark **furniture** must give the room a reason to be, to showcase the beauty of the dark wood itself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yellow is a color that complements brown beautifully to make any room look incredibly aesthetic. Bright shades of yellow look lively and fun and when blended correctly with brown adds a splash of energetic charm to your living space. The yellow undertones in the bookshelf and the bright **furniture** in the room pop wonderfully against the neutral background bringing together the best of both traditional and modern looks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take a sample of your brown **furniture** color into the **paint** store. Match it against store **paint** samples or an artist's color wheel finding shades that please you. If you are unsure, purchase a few colored **paint** sample sizes and try them on a small scale prior to committing to the color in the entire room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many different types of **paint** colors go with dark **furniture**, there is no one right answer or one wrong answer. This depends greatly on your tastes and moods at the time of the design. But isn’t it time to redecorate and take a risk, maybe step out of your comfort zone, and give your room with dark **furniture** a new life with a new wall color? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although brown and gray blend naturally outdoors, they may seem like a less natural color combination for indoor spaces. Gray walls need coaxing to complement brown **furniture**, but are easily qualified for the task. Ultimately, cool gray can add a sense of subtle sophistication to the warmth of brown wood **furniture**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown leather couches are really such a classic piece of **furniture**. It’s not just their aesthetic that keeps them in style, I think it’s also the comfort. Leather is a sophisticated-looking fabric and I think that can turn off some people but I really love it. I think brown leather sofas are great for family homes and can be used in a variety of spaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Traditionally, blue walls don’t usually align themselves too well with dark wood **furniture** because they can make a room look darker. In small rooms, the combination of the 2 may be the wrong choice. However, blue walls are known to have a calming effect and can add a significant amount of warmth to a room. It has also become trendy these days to combine dark wood **furniture** with blue walls provided the room is large and receives loads of natural light. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Have lots of brown **furniture** in your home? You probably own more brown pieces than you think: Just consider that leather sofa in the family room, the wooden desk in your office, and the brown velvet chairs in your dining room, for example. While brown **furniture** is quite common, but many homeowners struggle with the issue of what color **paint** to pair with such pieces. Should you go bright and bold? Keep it neutral? Opt for something in between? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gold wall with brown **furniture** Another color scheme that works wonderfully with brown **furniture** is a golden accent wall. The rest of the walls can be either white, beige, or even cherry red. Going for a golden shade is definitely an exquisite choice! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
