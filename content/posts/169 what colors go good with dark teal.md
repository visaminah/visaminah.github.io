-   When considering color theory, **colors** can have a color bias, meaning they can either lean towards warmer or cooler **colors**. So, since **teal** is made up of blue and green, these are both cooler **colors** and that makes **teal** a cool color as well. However, you can also create warmer undertones by using different tones of blue or green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Teal is a color that can be more outstanding or subdued depending on how it is used in the living or workspace. Teal can also add to a sophisticated and elegant color palette.
