## 11 Tips to Best Light Gray Paint For Living Room Sherwin Williams | All About Agreeable Gray – The Good and Bad
-   This **paint** color makes a room look grim in low or cool light. The fleshy purple tones that are hidden in the bright light make their way out to the surface so that the room looks like a dingy icky prison. I’m not sure if I can be more eloquent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sherwin-Williams Agreeable Gray (SW 7029) is an IMMENSELY popular Sherwin-Williams greige **paint** color (Sample Here). It is an iconic warm gray with barely-there green undertones. This is one of the most written-about colors in North America. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy – bloggers write about the color because its popular and does well in web searches (forgive my cynicism). Readers use the color and make it more popular. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Benjamin Moore Revere Pewter is a cleaner and crisper gray/greige color than Agreeable Gray. They are both warm greige **paint** colors with green undertones, but Agreeable has a splash of violet undertones compared to Revere. If your room has tons of natural light, Agreeable Gray would likely be the better choice. If one of these colors looks good in a room, the other will probably also look nice because they have similar undertones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The quick answer is YES! This color is an iconic Sherwin-Williams greige **paint** color, and is still one of the 50 most popular colors on the Sherwin-Williams website. White wall colors are very popular right now, but they can be cold and difficult to decorate with. Not everyone wants a white house. For those who want a warmer and friendlier **paint** color, Agreeable gray could be the color for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We **paint**ed the rooms that had low light or shifting light with other colors. We kept Agreeable Gray in the basement, where we have lots of artificial light. The bedrooms all had tons of beautiful light, but most of the main floor with East facing windows and low light conditions have been **paint**ed other colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Agreeable Gray is a glorious warm greige **paint** color with green undertones. It looks great in rooms with lots of natural or artificial light. If you have a room with low light, the hidden violet undertones will look fleshy and Agreeable Gray will make the room look like a prison. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now we have SAMPLIZE, 9X14″ Pre-Painted peel-and-stick **paint** samples. They are EASY to use, AFFORDABLE ($5.95/ea), and ECO-FRIENDLY – no messy **paint**ing or cleanup without half-used **paint** samples in your back closet, and they can deliver the NEXT DAY! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   NEVER, EVER use **paint** matches from a different brand than the one specified. Results are poor and there are no standards for the sheens. Even though your **paint**er may truly believe it can be done, don’t do it. See results from **paint** matching here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We love your comments! Please note that the blog is meant as general advice, and it is not possible to give out specific answers to your **paint** questions. If you want more specific advice, please consider purchasing a color consultation. Thank you for your understanding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Please note: All the photos in this post come from Color Concierge projects and are part of our portfolio. These are not professional photos, and most are customer photos that give a realistic look of the **paint** color. These photos are not color-edited. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Agreeable Gray is one of those colors that really doesn’t have a close match in the Benjamin Moore **paint** catalog. If you want a **paint** color that behaves similarly, choose from BM Revere Pewter or BM Edgecomb Gray. They aren’t exactly the same, but they are both greige colors with green undertones that I would use in similar situations. Edgecomb is probably the closest one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
