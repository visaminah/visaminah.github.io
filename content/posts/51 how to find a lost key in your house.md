## 51 Reference List: How To Find A Lost Key In Your House | How To Find Your Keys
-   The most common way that your **key**s are stolen is through open pockets and bags. An expert thief would be able to grab something from your pocket or bag without you knowing in seconds. To prevent this make sure you put your **key**s in a pocket that is closed by a popper or zip and **key**s that are in your bags should be in an internal zipped compartment. This will reduce your risk of losing your **key**s through pick-pocketing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   : Our eyes and minds are often distracted by messes. If you retrace your steps and methodically clean as you look, you’ll be more likely to find your missing **key**s. Stop moving and think: Often, you know exactly where you left your **key**s, but you’re so worried about having **lost** them that you can’t remember! Try taking a few deep breaths and thinking back to the last time you used them. Hopefully, you’ll remember exactly where they should be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Chipolo ONE Spot is basically a cheaper AirTag alternative and uses the Find My network to help track your **key**s down. While the iOS-exclusive connectivity is limiting, the benefits of being on the Find My network are huge, and the ONE Spot is located in the same way as the AirTag. The selling point here is the 120-decibel alarm to help you locate missing **key**s even faster. Another bonus here over the AirTag? The built-in hole makes it easy to throw on your **key**s without adding a separate **key** ring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We are all guilty of trying to get all our bags from the car to the house in one go. In this situation its very easy to place them down somewhere lie the roof or the boot while you juggle the bags. You place them down and it leaves your mind. When you come to look for your **key**s, you can’t remember where you put them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tile has been one of the leaders in **key** finders all along, and two of its products made it onto this list. The cheaper of the two—the Mate—is a fantastic middle-ground finder. Compatible with both iOS and Android devices via a third-party app, it's an affordable way to track your **lost** **key**s. The battery is not replaceable in the newest Mate, but it's built to last three years—you'll then have to replace the tracker itself. With a respectable Bluetooth range of 250 feet and a handy QR code on the back that can be scanned if found, it's a great option that won't break the bank. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But hey, this is the 21st century. We have technology. In this case, they're called **key** finders, and they use Bluetooth to locate your **lost** **key**s. But **key**s aren't the only thing these devices can find; they're also great for tracking down **lost** wallets, purses, phones, pets, and luggage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While these tips are great for finding **lost** **key**s, the best solution is prevention. Consider attaching a **key** tracker to your **key**chain and designating a specific place for your **key**s. That way, you’ll know exactly where to look for your **key**s, and you can use your phone to track them if you do end up losing them again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Metal detectors are not very expensive. You can get a basic and affordable device that will help you find your **key**s within minutes. For this task, I highly recommend the bounty hunter tracker 4. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Setting aside a set place for your **key**s will help to stop misplacing them when at home. A bowl or a set of hooks on the wall are easy places that you can throw your **key**s on when you get home. So when you get that sudden rush of panic ‘where are my **key**s’, you know that you would have put them in their designated space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are four different types of Amazon Tile you can get. The Tile Mate, Tile Pro, Tile Slim and the Tile Sticker. Each track your **key**s, but some come with better features than others. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Samsung's answer to the AirTag comes in the form of the cheaper SmartTag—but, like with Apple, it is only compatible with a certain device: in this case, the Galaxy smartphone. That said, it functions in the same style as the AirTag, but with a few added bonuses. The SmartTag uses its Galaxy Find network and traces its last-known location, and the connectivity range of just under 400 feet is impressive. A unique feature is the ability to control other Samsung smart home devices with just the press of a button, and it even has a built-in hole for easy installation onto your **key** ring. No need for expensive accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Check the pockets of the outfits you were wearing the day before. Its very common for people to place the **key**s in the pocket and forget about them. This can be very bad for your washing machine (another place you can look for missing **key**s). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, keep in mind that replacing your **key**s may take time. If we do not have blank **key**s for your vehicle, we’ll have to order one. Our technicians will have to remove the old **key** from the car’s database and reprogram it to accept a new **key**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unfortunately, you seldom realize your **key**s are **lost** when it’s convenient. Whether you’re rushing out the door or on your way home from work, it’s easy to get frustrated in this situation. Before panic sets in, take a deep breath. Follow this step-by-step list to go from **lost** **key**s to peace of mind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Detectors only work outdoor. If you are certain that you **lost** your **key**s inside the house. Don’t bother finding it with a detector. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Imagination is your friend. Recreate a mental image of what happened when you last saw the **key**s. Every small detail is important. Make the mental image as rich as possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Alright, so that’s a tad harsh. Even then, however, your **key** fobs are one of the most important parts of your daily grind. Imagine misplacing it – how can you get to work? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   That’s where the tech experts from the Good Housekeeping Institute come in. Our engineers rigorously evaluate tech products like fitness trackers and waterproof speakers to make sure we're recommending the best products for your needs. While there's no one-size fits all for **key** locators, to find the best ones, we used feedback from Lab reviews, road testing of newer products, and real user feedback. Our Lab pros have logged dozens of hours with these trackers, considering hundreds of data points that factor in things like how far the range is (how far can your phone be separated from the **key** finder before the app loses connection), the loudness of the alerts using a decibel reader, ease of replacing the batteries, and how easy it is to use the apps. Our picks below are a mix of top-tested items and highly-rated picks from brands our Lab pros know and trust. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One concern with **key** finders is that they're just another thing to add to your **key** ring. In reality, this really isn't a problem. They're designed to be small and inconspicuous, not to add bulk. We think the benefits these little things provide are way worth the addition. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. Conduct a thorough search. Once you have a mental list of places where your **key**s might be, search them to see if your **key**s are hiding out somewhere nearby. Whenever possible, return to all these places and examine them yourself. Make your search more effective by following these suggestions: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Chipolo One has a history of producing trackers with very loud alarms; this makes it easier to find anything you have **lost**. It has a reasonable range of 40-50 feet and a nifty feature is that it will buzz if you go out of range of your **key**s (phone/wallet), meaning it will prevent you from leaving them anywhere. Unlike the Tile these extra features are included in the price, so there are no extra fees. The Chipolo One is best used when looking for your **key**s in your home and at £21 it’s a cheaper alternative to the Tile. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finding missing **key**s is particularly difficult because they switch places several times each day. To prevent **lost** **key**s, get a smart **key** finder that you can attach to the **key**s and link to your smartphone. Next time you lose your **key**s, use your phone to find them! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
