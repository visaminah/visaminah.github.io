## 8 Facts Best Monitor Arm For Drawing Tablet | Wacom Flex Arm
-   Note that this arm is only compatible with the newest Cintiq Pro models, not the older Cintiq 22HD. The arm is also not designed to be attached to a wall and can’t support different “heads” such as a VESA mount. However, you can buy a Wacom Cintiq VESA mount separately (again only for the Pro 24 and 32 models) and then use any **monitor** arm you like. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The drawing **tablet**s arm should attach to the desk with a clamp that will hold it tightly in place. This is usually achieved with two screws, which are tightened from underneath the table surface. One screw attaches firmly into the back of your drawing **tablet** and holds onto its edge by pulling it tight against the other side of this clip. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ergotron make standard **monitor** arms with a clamp on the back of your desk. However, to use a Cintiq Pro, you would need to also buy the Wacom Cintiq VESA mount. Without this, you would not be able to connect to a standard **monitor** arm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The arm will also contain some cable management functions, allowing you to safely stow away any cables, keeping it looking pretty. Some **tablet**s suffer from having too many cables connected which can get in the way. With these cable tidy clips and straps, the wires will never be a problem again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Less desk space for your drawing **tablet**s. You will need to find a spot that is not being used for the clamp, which can be difficult in some cases. This may mean you have less room on your keyboard tray or never use a pen at all when drawing (an unfortunate consequence). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A drawing **tablet** stand will allow you to position your device at the right angle for drawing. The stands sit on the desk and have a lockable hinge, or adjustable legs to alter the angle. You can sit the **tablet**s on the stand and use it very naturally. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A drawing **tablet** arm should not be made of flimsy plastic or materials that bend too easily. When it comes to build quality or material, the best drawing **tablet** arms are usually metal because they have a sturdier base than other materials and won’t break as quickly if something falls on them. The straps for holding your **tablet**s in place need to be durable too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One drawback of using a standard **monitor** arm to support your pen display is that they are not designed to be flexible. The Wacom Flex Arm provides many different degrees of movement, whereas a **monitor** arm is designed to be more static. The mounting pole allows for you to pull the **monitor** or screen closer to you but you may struggle to adjust the tilt and angle without resorting to finding that Allen Key. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
