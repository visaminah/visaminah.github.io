## 12 Things You Should Know About Can Epoxy Resin Be Sanded And Polished | Resin Sanding & Polishing
-   Actually, there are not many pitfalls lurking in cast **resin** polishing. Nevertheless, you should always work very carefully and thoughtfully during this step in order to get a nice shiny surface in the end. With the right polishing paste, for example, **epoxy** **resin** can be made to shine very well. Further factors for an optimal result are the choice of the polishing sponge used and the set speed of the polishing machine used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to regularly polish larger areas of **epoxy**, then the purchase of a polishing machine specially designed for this purpose will certainly pay off. With such a machine you can use different polishing sponges for polishing the **resin**. Also, the speed of the polishing machine can be adjusted in such a way that an optimal polishing result is possible. With a reduced number of revolutions, you make sure that the surface of your work-piece does not get too hot due to the frictional heat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If only smaller objects or shapes made of **resin** are to be polished, it is sufficient to use an ordinary power drill with a polishing attachment suitable for this purpose. Usually, you can choose between polishing discs and polishing sponges in different sizes in the corresponding assortment. With a small polishing ball head, you can even polish very small workpieces mechanically. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When sanding, you start with a coarse 120 grit and work your way carefully in circular movements to a fine 3000 grit. You can do the wet sanding by hand without any mechanical assistance. Alternatively, you can also use a random orbital sander. When you have finished wet sanding, the surfaces of your **epoxy** **resin** work-piece should be even and smooth. After that, however, the actual **epoxy** polishing will only begin. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When choosing a suitable polishing compound, you may be spoilt for choice given the wide range of different products on the market. The number of different product variants reflects the multitude of possible areas of application. However, there are also polishing pastes with very different coarse or fine polishing grains. In most cases, the simple rule of thumb applies: With polishing pastes for use on wooden surfaces, you can also make **epoxy** **resin** shine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In some cases, your work-piece may already have largely smooth surfaces after casting. This is a huge benefit when using silicone molds in particular. In such a case, you can shorten the sanding process easily and sometimes you only need to use a relatively fine grain of sanding paper for wet sanding. Sometimes you can even dispense with wet sanding altogether and continue your work directly with the **epoxy** **resin** polish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tip 1: After a few minutes of patient polishing, doubts often arise as to whether the surface will ever have the desired shine. It is not uncommon, however, that the matt appearance of an **epoxy** **resin** surface is actually only due to residues of the polishing paste on the **epoxy** **resin**. If, on the other hand, you regularly wipe off these polishing residues with a soft, clean cloth, you will always be able to keep a close eye on the progress of polishing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rub with the cloth in careful circular movements over the surfaces of your **resin** work-piece to be polished. You should apply light pressure. But don’t be surprised if you notice a visible effect only after some time. It may take a little longer until the surface you are working on finally reaches the desired gloss. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this first step, you start with the sanding of **epoxy** **resin** through the so-called wet sanding. First of all, you need ordinary tap water and special sandpaper that is suitable for use in wet conditions. The decisive criterion for this is the application of the abrasive grains on a waterproof fabric that cannot tear when wet under mechanical stress. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For polishing larger **epoxy** **resin** surfaces, such as sealed floor surfaces or extravagantly designed tabletops, you should use a suitable polishing machine if possible. The difference between a drill and a polishing machine is easy to explain (apart from the possibility of controlling the rotational speed): While the drilling machine rotates only rigidly around an axis, the polishing attachment on a polishing machine moves in elliptical or eccentric movements. This has a positive effect on the result of the polishing process. Especially as a beginner, you can achieve particularly brilliant results when polishing **epoxy** with a polishing machine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Polishing **epoxy** **resin**, like all other steps, is actually an indispensable part of working with **epoxy** **resin** in various projects. Only with careful polishing can the shine be created that turns a nice craft idea into a true work of art. But this only works if you lay the foundation for a perfectly polished **resin** surface by sanding (with different degrees of grain size) before the actual polishing. If unsightly sanding marks are not removed carefully enough during this initial step, even the final polishing cannot produce the desired surface quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In principle, it is possible to carefully polish the surface of almost any type of work-piece or **resin** sealant for a great shine. Of course, this works easier with a corresponding size of the work-piece or a larger area of the sealant than it might be the case with very small work-pieces with many edges. Epoxy polishing usually works without any problems for the following applications: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
