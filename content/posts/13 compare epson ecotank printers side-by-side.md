## 13 Fun Facts Compare Epson Ecotank Printers Side-By-Side | Epson Ecotank Et-2850
-   Epson **printers** are the best in class, and they work on a very simple principle. The printer has an ink cartridge that is filled with different colours of ink. When you print something, it uses these coloured inks to create your desired output. It works by using heat-sensitive paper that reacts when exposed to heat from the printer head or laser beam (depending upon what type of Epson **printers** you have). This process creates images on the paper as per your instructions given through computer software like MS Word etc. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Aimed at home and micro offices, the $499.99 Epson EcoTank Wireless ET-4850 All-in-One is the top-of-the line letter- and legal-size printer in Epson's latest batch of EcoTank all-in-one **printers** (not to be confused with the EcoTank Pro line). In its compact size, features, and performance, the ET-4850 is roughly equivalent to the much less expensive Editors' Choice–winning Brother MFC-J4335DW, but the Brother uses cartridges, whereas the ET-4850's key draw is low-cost ink. If you don't print much, the Brother printer will be the better option, but if you do, the ET-4850 will be a bargain in the long run. That makes it our new Editors' Choice for heavy-duty personal and home-office use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How we test Every printer we review goes through a series of uniform checks designed to gauge key things including print quality, speed and cost. We’ll also compare the features with other **printers** at the same price point to see if you’re getting good value for your money. Tested printing with monochrome and coloured ink Measured the time it takes to print with various paper Compared print quality with other **printers** - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many alternatives to Epson **printers**. The most popular alternative is the HP printer, which has a very good reputation for quality and reliability. Another option would be Brother Printers, which have been known to produce high-quality prints at an affordable price point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Epson **printers** are the best in class, and they work on a very simple principle. The printer has an ink cartridge that is filled with different colours of ink. When you print something, it uses these coloured inks to create your desired output. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I was impressed with the quality of the prints that the ET-2850 produced. When compared side by side, Epson appears to have made some improvements over the ET-2750, with richer, darker colours in our photo tests. It still falls behind six-colour ink tank **printers** such as the Canon Pixma G650, however, and the best cartridge **printers** such as the Canon Pixma TS8350. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The ET-4850's performance ratings aren't impressive for the price, at 15.5ppm for monochrome black pages and 8.5ppm for color, but it delivered respectable performance compared with similarly priced inkjet tank **printers** and some less-expensive cartridge **printers**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Make sure you compare Epson **printers** of the same type. For example, if you want to buy a printer for your home use, then it is better to look at all-in-one models with fax and scanner functions. If you are looking for an office model that can print in colour or black & white – choose one accordingly. Also pay attention to the number of pages per minute (ppm) when comparing different devices from this manufacturer, as well as their maximum resolution (dpi). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 300- and 500-page options don’t work out as cheap as printing from your own ink, costing 2.6p and 2p per page respectively, but that’s still better value than most cartridge **printers**. The unlimited print option looks more attractive, but you’ll need to print thousands of pages per month to get close to the 0.2p per page cost delivered by simply buying the printer and ink outright. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Good Epson **printers** should be easy to use, and also have a lot of features. It must work well with the operating system on your computer, as well as be compatible with other software applications that you may want to install in the future. You will need an affordable price for it too; however, if you are looking for something cheap but still works great, then there is nothing better than Epson WorkForce WF-3640 Wireless Colour Inkjet Printer (Black). This printer has all these qualities and more! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to print a lot of pages and don’t care about quality, the Epson ET2850’s draft mode is much faster, churning out the same document at 16.5ppm. Print quality is light and fairly rough looking but it outpaces both the aforementioned **printers** by a significant margin. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Connection choices include USB, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Wi-Fi Direct. For my performance tests, I connected by Ethernet. For Android or iOS mobile printing, Epson's Smart Panel app lets you print from or scan to your mobile devices as well as set up and monitor the printer. And, like most current Epson **printers**, the ET-4850 supports Epson Email Print and Epson Remote print, which let you send files to the printer via the internet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The real strength of the printer comes in its printing costs. Refill ink comes in large bottles with enough ink to print thousands of pages, and this means the price per page is very low: 0.2p per page for mono prints and 0.4p per page for colour. This makes it one of the best-value **printers** around; it costs about the same to run as Canon’s current ink tank **printers**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
