## 17 Tips to What Color Does Blue Purple And White Make | What Color Does Purple And Green Make
-   So what two colors make **purple** in subtractive mixing? Red and **blue**! Mixing red and **blue** paint or dye actually mixes different wavelengths of light. Red paint reflects one wavelength, and **blue** paint reflects another wavelength. When combined, the compounds in the mixture reflect the red and **blue** wavelengths back in a new way. That combo of reflected light is what we see as **purple**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue and red are essential to creating **purple**, but you can mix in other colors to create different shades of **purple**. Adding white, yellow, or gray to your mixture of **blue** and red will give you a lighter **purple**. Incorporating black into your **blue** and red mixture will give you a darker shade of **purple**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So what colors make **purple**? Purple is a combination of red light and **blue** light. An object that we perceive as **purple** has a makeup that causes it to absorb all wavelengths of light except those that fall around 700 nanometers and 475 nanometers in length. The object reflects those exact wavelengths mixed together, which gives the impression that the object is **purple**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red, a primary component of **purple**, is approximately 700 nanometers in wavelength. Red is one of the longer wavelengths that our eyes can see. The distance from crest to crest is only a little bit thicker than the membrane of a soap bubble. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So what two colors make **purple** through additive mixing? In additive mixing, you can make **purple** by combining the wavelengths of **blue** light and red light in different proportions. Depending on the combination, you can get a pale **purple** like lavender...or a bold, dark **purple** like merlot! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To learn how to make **purple**, you need to have an understanding of the science behind color mixing. In this article, we’ll teach you everything you need to know about how to use colors to make **purple**. We’ll cover the following: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Subtractive mixing creates color by removing wavelengths of visible light by using physical elements like paints, pigments, or dyes. This process is called subtractive mixing because some wavelengths of light are absorbed instead of being reflected back as colored pigments are mixed together . When it comes to how to make **purple** paint, for instance, you’d want to use subtractive mixing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Saturation” refers to the amount of color in a hue relative to the amount of white or black. The more white or black added to a color, the less intense it will be. So a **purple** color like mauve isn’t very saturated because there’s a higher proportion of white to color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A tint is made when you add white to another color. Pink is an example of a tint because it is made by combining red with white. So by mixing **purple** with white, you can create a tint of **purple**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mixing **blue** and red together makes **purple**. The amount of **blue** and red that you add to your mixture will determine the exact shade of **purple** you produce. More red will create a redder **purple**, and more **blue** will create a **blue**r **purple**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purple is sometimes confused with violet. But **purple** and violet are different colors. Here is the difference between **purple** and violet: violet refers to the color of a single wavelength, but **purple** comes from a combination of wavelengths. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Violet is considered a spectral color. Like **blue** and red, violet is created through a single wavelength of light which falls on the visible spectrum between 380 and 450 nanometers. Purple is not a spectral color. Instead, **purple** becomes visible to our eyes when the wavelengths of the spectral colors red and **blue** are mixed together and reflected by an object. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In general, **purple** refers to any color with a hue that is between red and **blue**. But getting the perfect shade of **purple** is a little more complicated than simply mixing these two colors. This is where the science of color comes in! Understanding the science behind making **purple** will help you make **purple** all on your own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What color does red and **blue** make when you add black or white? Adding black or white to a mixture of **blue** and red allows you to create many different types of **purple**. Tints of **purple** are created by mixing red, **blue**, and white. These tints will be lighter colors, like orchid. Shades of **purple** are made by mixing red, **blue**, and black. Shades will be darker and deeper colors, like indigo. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So **blue** and red are the dominant wavelengths that combine to create **purple**. This means that the shade of **purple** you’ll end up with totally depends on the red and **blue** colors you start out with. If you want a warmer shade of **purple**, use a warmer shade of red as your base. Warm reds have orange or yellow undertones. If you want a cooler **purple**, start with a cooler shade of **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to **purple**, adding in either white or black to a mixture of red and **blue** will adjust the value. If you’re going for a lighter **purple**, like periwinkle, add more white. If you want a darker **purple**, like deep violet, add more black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A shade is created by combining black with another color. So when you add black to **purple**, you get a shade of **purple**. The brightness or intensity of a color is also determined by how much black or white is added to it. The proportion of black or white to color is called “saturation.” A saturated color has little black or white added to it, whereas a desaturated color is combined with a lot of black or white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
