-   When installing **laminate** flooring in a basement, it must be well prepared to make installation go smoothly. Certain precautions, like cleaning gutters and downspouts, are important to reduce humidity. Also, ensure that the surface levels and drains are not exposed to direct rainwater. Before installation, the humidity level should be checked using a moisture meter and brought under control so that the boards do not expand or contract too much. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The condition of the basement substrate should be examined thoroughly. Look for and seal cracks, fissures, and slopes before installing the **laminate**. Be sure to control the moisture level as well before you start. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a concrete subfloor, it should be poured and set at least 60 days before the **laminate** is installed. This is because newer concrete has higher moisture content than old concrete and constantly loses moisture which can affect **laminate** installation. Also, a steady humidity and temperature should be maintained in the basement. The temperature should be 60° F to 75° F; humidity, 35% to 50%. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Basements, mudrooms and any areas in your house where humidity fluctuates require special attention. If you are considering **laminate** or similar flooring materials, there are several stores to explore in Toronto. Laminate flooring is a popular choice for basements, and if you take note of the factors and criteria listed above, it should work out for your home perfectly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing the right flooring for your basement and other areas of your house where humidity fluctuates must be done with care. The aim is to make sure the flooring lasts a long time and does not get damaged by moisture. If your basement is well ventilated and treated properly, you can use flooring materials like **laminate** and engineered wood. Many homeowners opt for **laminate** because it is more cost effective and looks beautiful. If you prepare the basement subfloor properly, **laminate** flooring is a viable option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Basements are susceptible to flooding for various reasons, which means that your basement flooring should be durable enough to withstand that flooding. This could be due to heavy rainfall or leaky pipes, but the effects on **laminate** flooring can be adverse. Flooding can also happen due to malfunctioning appliances like washing machine, dishwashers and water heaters which many homeowners install in the basement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
