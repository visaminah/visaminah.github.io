## 5 Fun Facts Gas Stove Top With Downdraft Reviews | 6 Burner Gas Cooktop With Downdraft
-   Most **downdraft** cooktops come with the option to use either a ductless system or a duct system to ventilate captured cooking fumes. A traditional ducting system runs ducts (pipes for air) from the cooktop to the outside of your home to safely ventilate the fumes. A ductless system uses a filter system to clean the air and then recirculate it back into the kitchen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re considering purchasing an electric cooktop with a **downdraft** system, it’s worth considering a couple of key factors before making a final decision. The first and most obvious is whether or not a **downdraft** system is the best option for your home and kitchen layout. You should also consider the airflowmeasured in CFM or cubic feet per minute—required for your kitchen and cooking needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most traditional kitchen set-ups include a range hood mounted above the **stove** with fans to filter cooking fumes, chemicals and more out of your home. Range hoods are especially important when using a natural gas or propane burning **stove** to avoid dangerous carbon monoxide fumes. Household air pollution is responsible for approximately four million deaths according to the WHO News Room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another important consideration when determining if a **downdraft** system is best for you is to calculate the airflow needed to properly ventilate your cooktop.For a quick and easy calculation, take the total BTU or British thermal units of heat output of your cooktop and divide that number by 100. This represents the low end of required airflow for your **downdraft** system. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gas **stove**s are generally more expensive than their electric counterparts, and can even cost more than induction, depending on what features are involved. Keep in mind that this initial expense will be offset by a decrease in your electric bill—gas is much cheaper than electricity. If you need to install gas hookups to make the switch, however, the utility bill savings might not entirely cover the cost. Depending on where you live and your home’s design, installing a gas hookup can range from expensive or impossible: We recommend getting a quote before committing to a gas cooktop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
