-   A bright yellow and dark **green** creates a luxurious, mysterious, and elegant aesthetic.

-   Green and **blue**, color wheel neighbors, are cool colors that make a relaxing mixture. For a dramatic look, use vibrant shades of these comparable colors on the furniture and wall. For example, the vibrant cerulean **blue** wall color in this spectacular sitting room is matched by an equivalently bold apple **green**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   White and **blue** create a sharp color mixture that generates a clean feeling, making it ideal for spaces such as the bathroom. Classic aspects, such as hexagon floor tiles and beaded-board walls, take on a more contemporary feel in this space when offset by decorated **blue** wallpaper. The vibrant color scheme in the bathroom transforms the small space into a central focus. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The colour matches beautifully with other hues to light up homes and offices. Both, warm and cool colours pair well with it, as do bold and soft tones.

-   Green is a secondary colour that’s created by combining primary colours **blue** and yellow. Colour theory usually dictates that secondary colours match well with the colours that make them up: so if you want something bold and bright, try pastel **blue** with lime **green**. Going for a little subtle or subdued? Mint **green** with royal yellow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue is another great shirt color to pair with **green**. A **blue** top will bring out the cooler tone of your olive pants. You can even pull off a vivid ultramarine top because the trousers will temper its brightness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is why when you consider what colour to paint your room, **green** is a great option. It promotes a sense of harmony with Mother Nature and that’s why, any room painted **green** provides a space of nurturing. This is so important for spaces like bedrooms. Further, the ‘natural’ feeling works for kitchens too: it’s a place where fruits and vegetables abound. It is also associated with luck. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A lot of people think that pink and **green** should never be seen together. But, no! After a brief rise in popularity several years ago, this color mixture is gaining traction once more. And, in reality, it isn’t as intense a match as it sounds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pastel yellows and **green**s are soft and appealing. They can make a room look fresh and welcoming, particularly when added as accents to a white background. Softer yellows and **green** have a springtime vibe, often linked to visuals of flower-covered fields. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The cool color temp of **blue** contrasts strongly with the warm end of wood furnishings, floors, or trim. Pick a powerful **blue** that won’t fade in contrast for medium- to dark-toned wood touches. Profound azure kitchen design contrasts with abundantly discolored wood floors in this open kitchen to make a warm and comfortable, modern cooking space. The dark **blue** cabinetry is kept from overwhelming the design by big open windows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As mentioned, you can team olive pants up with clothes that have yellow hues in them. Browns and tans, for example, accentuate olive **green**’s earth tone. This is great for professorial outfits and outdoorsy styles. Think **green** trousers with a tan button-down and tweed jacket, or olive jeans with a brown flannel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Bright purples are too bold to pair with **green** pants. The combination is too reminiscent of The Joker. Instead, wear olive **green** pants with the darkest shades of purple, like raisin or royal ruby. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Again, never wear **green** pants with red or anything in the red family. This includes pink, magenta, and salmon. You’ll also want to steer clear of colors that are too close to red on the color wheel. True orange with **green** is only appropriate on St. Patrick’s Day, just as primary red with **green** is only appropriate on a holiday sweater. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The second reason why **green** is a great color for pants, is that it’s a common neutral in nature. That’s why it’s used for camo. People are accustomed to seeing it paired with a wide range of shades and tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Green is everywhere – and sometimes that makes it a little difficult to pick a good complement. And if you ever have a lot of house plants or **green**ery in your home, you’ll definitely need to design around that. But with a little effort, you’ll find that there’s a wide array of shades that you can mix and match with **green** for any effect you’re looking for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wearing **blue** jeans with a **green** military-inspired utility shirt is a timeless casual combination. Switch the colors up by pairing dark olive jeans or chinos with a navy utility shirt. It’s different enough to be fashionable, but familiar enough that any guy can pull it off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Neighbors on the color wheel, **green** and **blue** are cool colors that form a refreshing combination. Choose vibrant shades of these analogous colors on walls and furniture for a bold look. In this dramatic sitting room, vivid cerulean **blue** wall color is balanced by an equally bold apple **green**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally What matches with dark **green** pants? Almost every color you’d wear with **blue** or black jeans pair well with **green** pants. Black, white, beige, grey, **blue**, and tan are excellent colors to wear. To dress well in **green** pants, consider how you want to look. Think about whether you want a monochromatic outfit or one with contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you need a quick pick to match a **green** carpet or **green** walls, going with any shade of grey is a good choice. It’s often what colour furniture comes in, and is a good offset to any shade of **green**. It’s also a chic choice for clothing, especially when it comes to formal outfits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you like colorful dress shoes, just follow the color wheel rule and avoid red shades. Crimson suede monks pair well with gray trousers and a red tie, but would be too loud when worn with **green** pants. Whereas tan Norwegian shoes work perfectly well as pictured below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Green and red are a classic combo. This mixture of colors is loved by many people. You just have to choose the right shade from each and style them together nicely. This outfit above is a really good example of red and **green** tones that go well together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I've heard statements such as red+**blue** not matching. Heard varying opinions that you shouldn't match brown with black(even with casual clothes). Heard people say that you shouldn't wear more than 3 colors in an outfit(but then I see someone having 3 colors in their outfit, and then a different color jacket). Then I hear people say that they wouldn't match a certain color with black, because Black is more of a "Bold Color" and dominating , even though other people say it's neutral and goes with everything. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are a huge fan of **blue**, feel free to incorporate multiple tones of **blue** into a monochromatic palette. Look for **blue**s with comparable undertones, such as dark teal and **blue**-**green** turquoise, to ensure the combination works well together. To achieve a rich, layered appearance, repeat the colors on the curtains, walls, rugs, and other design features. To keep the layout from looking stale, use a wide range of fabric textures and scales of patterns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For you sneakerheads, avoid pairing **green** pants with any shoe that features bright primary red or orange as its dominant color. This means anything in the realm of red Converses or orange Nike Dunks. A splash of wheat works very well, for example, the Clae Malone Whites would pair beautifully: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
