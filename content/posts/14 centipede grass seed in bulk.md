-   If you do not want to install **seed** or sod, then you can install **centipede** grass plugs. Start off by tilling the area of the yard that you want to plant the grass plugs and add an extra layer of fertilizer. Remove any previous grass from the areas. Next, install the **centipede** grass plugs using a sod plug drill bit. Space the plugs about 1 foot apart from each point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
