## 92 Shocking Facts About Fun Things To Make With Paracord | 101 Paracord Projects
-   The idea is to simply thread the keyring with your **paracord** and create a chain of box knots. Once you’re happy with the length of the crown sinnet, tighten the last knot, snip off the edges, and singe it with a lighter. And that’s it! You’ve got yourself a **paracord** keychain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This trilobite key fob may look very small, but it can already give you about 4 feet of **paracord**. That’s enough to get you out of most survival situations. The loops at the beginning can be a bit daunting for newbies, but don’t worry. We’ve picked out a very easy-to-follow tutorial just for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ranger beads or pace counters are must-haves when you love spending time outdoors. They’re vital in keeping your pace on the trail and in keeping you from getting lost. Instead of purchasing ranger beads, you can make your own by tying multiple Celtic button knots on a length of **paracord**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Button knots make excellent stoppers for single-strand bracelets. One of the most common button knots to put together is the Celtic Button Knot. Unlike the basic stopper knot discussed above, Celtic Button Knots require a bit more complexity, with one end of the **paracord** weaving in and out of multiple loops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to level up, you can always make a **paracord** pet harness. This one is a bit more complex than the lazy man’s dog leash since it’s made of two components, but it’s also safer and more comfortable for your pets. You’ll need a foot of **paracord** for every inch. To secure the leash, prepare a buckle and D-ring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First off, it’s a quick deploy bracelet, meaning you can actually unravel it in a matter of seconds. Second, the sturdy millipede style uses at least 16 feet of **paracord**, which can really save your neck in a survival situation. Don’t forget to have a screw pin shackle handy to lock everything in place. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While it would take an extreme amount of complicated knots to make an entire hammock out of **paracord**, you could definitely use some fabric like a few blankets and some **paracord** to make a hammock a bit faster. Be sure to loop the **paracord** around the tree a few times to ensure it’s secure. You could also use a larger rope attached to your **paracord** to loop around for added protection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do a Google or Pinterest search for "**paracord** animals" and you won't be dissappointed. People have made everything from lizards to dolphins to spiders to elephants. I am going to try to make this dolphin when I have some time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I touched upon a number of uses in the description above but that was merely a sampling. There is more – a lot more. Today I share 60+ different uses of **paracord** for prepping and survival purposes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A shepherd’s sling can come in handy when hunting for food in the wild. You can also use it to fire projectiles like rocks or ball bearings for self-defense. To create a shepherd’s sling, measure out two to three feet of **paracord** for the handle and then weave a little “basket” with the remaining length of cord. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So get to know **paracord**! It’s easy, **fun** and many projects you can complete in a weekend if not an afternoon. You’ll be pleased with the results and can give **paracord** DIY projects as gifts to friends and family. The texture and feel of **paracord** is very comforting and sturdy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My love affair with **paracord** continues. Not only is it strong and useful for a myriad of tasks, it is colorful and **fun** to work with. Time spent making a **paracord** bracelet, **paracord** lanyard, **paracord** belt, and other **paracord** projects is time well spent. I know I am not the only one that feels this way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While technically you might consider **paracord** a rope in itself, when braided or knotted in various ways it can be made to be extremely sturdy and able to support very high weight loads. The knotting and braiding effect also makes it less likely to break just because it is harder for the cords to separate under loads and gives you more time to react if a breakage starts to happen. Sometimes rope is the better option, but this is a cool **paracord** use that you can try. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like the Crown Sinnet Keychain, anybody can make this quick-deploy **paracord** key fob. This **paracord** project only involves a single strand of **paracord**, but it’s quite robust and sturdy. All you’ll need is around 5-6 feet of cord and…well, that’s actually all you need. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This project highlights the **paracord**’s strength and versatility. You can use this net to catch fish out in the wild, as a net bag, or as a hammock for when you’re resting. Your imagination is the limit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Snake Knot makes for badass-looking bracelets and lanyards. This distinct weave takes on a round snakeskin pattern when done and stores a moderate amount of **paracord**. It needs a moderate skill level, though, so make sure to practice tying it often. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you need to tie down solar panels then you can use some **paracord** to tie them off to something nearby, lash to a fence post you put in the ground, or you can use tent stakes or similar to create a tie-down point. This is a great way to secure panels short term. Over time even **paracord** will wear out when exposed to weather so longer term you will need to replace it with something else or just occasionally replace it with a fresh cord. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is one of the more complex **paracord** projects on this list. The phone sleeve is rectangular shaped and involves a couple of stitches. The frame or the outer edge of the pouch is a basic cobra weave, while the rest of the phone sleeve is made by weaving another length of **paracord** across the frame. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While most people prefer the **paracord** bracelet, you can create a **paracord** necklace to carry tools around your neck. Pocket knives are a good example of a tool that is easy to carry with a **paracord** necklace. When I was a little girl I carried my lockback folder on a cord so I could get to it when I needed it and not worry about losing it out of my pocket or I could wear it while wearing a dress! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The “lazy man” braid used in this project is so simple that anyone can whip it out in a jiffy. It’s durable, so you can make one for bigger dog breeds. It also stores lots of **paracord**. To create a lazy man dog leash about 4 feet long, you’ll need about 17 feet of **paracord**. You’ll also need a snap hook or a small carabiner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I would recommend getting a large spool of **paracord** in OD green as a base stash over other cordage. You can always cut some off for trade and store in zip ocs. This can be a good way to do it so you have it where you need it around your place or in your vehicle. Just remember to use a lighter to lightly heat and seal the ends to prevent unwanted fraying. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paracord keychains are so simple that even newbies can make them in one sitting. You can make this crown sinnet keychain by stacking one box knot on top of the other. All you need are two lengths of **paracord**, each about 35 inches long (different colors for extra cool points), and a keyring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another item that is often needed are collars. Dogs, cats, and livestock can go through a lot of them over the years due to wear and tear and also from growing. You can make a cute custom **paracord** dog collar and even add adornments if you like. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Micro **paracord** works great for string art! Using **paracord** opens up so many color options! Check out our #95 **paracord** or micro cord to make your own. We decided to try our hand at making the Paracord Planet logo. How do you think it turned out? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **paracord** project looks difficult at first, but don’t be fooled. It’s just a combination of crown and diamond knots. You can also use a length of rope to create a bigger toy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cut a small piece of **paracord** from either color. I didn’t measure – maybe 6 inches long? Fold it over and put a small piece of tape around it to make it easier to work with. Set it inside the loop. This will bulk up the core for this part of the snake, making the head larger than the body. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This water bottle **paracord** cozy is perfect for both EDC and the outdoors. It can store lots of **paracord**, it’s relatively easy to make, and it’s even easier to deploy. Spend a relaxing time weaving this bottle holder while watching a game on TV, hanging out at camp, or just chilling out at home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To make the **paracord** lanyard, you’ll need a lot of **paracord** (about 17 feet in total), two pairs of buckles, and an s-biner. Start by folding the **paracord** in half and tying the buckles on both ends. Make sure that the **paracord**s are of equal length before beginning. Then it’s just a matter of making nice Cobra weaves from one end to the other. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This project uses a gutted **paracord**, which means that the inner cords have already been taken out. Gutting the **paracord** allows the wrap to lie flat when done, but it won’t be as strong as a standard **paracord** when deployed. You’ll be doing a bit of weaving, so you’ll also need a mandrel and a flat lacing needle to complete this **paracord** project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before we dive into advanced **paracord** projects, let’s lay down some basics. Knots are the foundation of any **paracord** project. Familiarizing yourself with these basic **paracord** knots allows you to easily make patterns, mix and match designs, and complete **paracord** projects faster. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To get started, fuse your two sections of **paracord** together by melting the ends with the lighter and sticking them together. Caution – the **paracord** gets very hot and stays hot for a few minutes! Definitely an adult job, but it’s not hard to do. In the photo below, my seam turned out sort of brown because I had too much of the white center strands hanging out and they burned. It still worked fine though. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The usual rule when making **paracord** projects like this is that you’d need one foot of **paracord** for every inch. For example, this tutorial wanted to create a 40-inch belt, so they used 40 feet of tan and brown **paracord**. A shorter length of black core cord was thrown in the mix, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are different types of **paracord** thatcomes in different lengths. Buying **paracord** in a giant spool is often the most economical way to get it but sometimes you can get a real bargain on precut lengths. The advantages of the smaller lengths is that they are packaged and ready for trade or barter and you can place them strategically around your home, office, business, or vehicle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 1: Start with the basic **paracord** knot, called the cobra. Start with the dark green strand and make an L shape. Then weave the light green strand under and through the other side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I will leave it up to you to find the info on how to make these. The internet is full of them. I will say that you can use **paracord** to hang fish hooks off of for a barricade if you want something a bit less tangly then fishing line. Green **paracord** blends in well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you haven't seen the Moab Monkeys' **paracord** space net over Horseshoe Canyon in Utah, check them out on Instagram or take a look at our **paracord** creator's page. This net has seen a lot of action. It has hosted yoga sessions, acrobatics, slacklining, and even a wedding! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gardeners often have the need to bundle and dry herbs, garlic, etc. Paracord is strong and it doesn’t rot or absorb water readily. Simply loop the **paracord** around the bundle and use the excess to hang from the ceiling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Warren Schoedel built a giant woolly mammoth sculpture out of **paracord** and rebar. He did so to raise awareness of climate change. He says next he plans to make a polar bear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the most overlooked items in EDC gear is the wallet. Your wallet can make a big difference in your day to day activities. Make an ultra slim tactical **paracord** wallet with **paracord**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While it may not last long in some applications, **paracord** can be used to replace those pull start cords that are prone to breakage over time. Lawnmowers, boats, small 2 wheel tractors, and more can be made to run again. This can get you out of a tight spot if your out on the water and you go to start your engine and it doesn’t run. Also what if you are running your tiller or tractor out in a far field and need to get it back into the barn? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **paracord** projects demonstrate their versatility. You can weave **paracord** into bracelets, use the cord to catch dinner, or make an entire hammock out of the stuff. These projects are also a great way to unleash some of your creativity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a ton of useful knots that can help you out in a pinch but you need to practice them beforehand! There are some great books on knot tying out there and **paracord** is great stuff for learning how to tie knots. Plus since you are going to be using **paracord** or will have it on hand, it is good to practice with what you are going to be using for rope and such so you can experiment with what knots seem to work best for you. Check out our article on “How To Tie A Monkey Fist Knot”. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are not completely satisfied with your purchase*, you may return it to us in its original condition with in 30 days of receiving your delivery or collection notification email for a re**fun**d. Except for damaged items or delivery issues the cost of return postage is borne by the buyer. Your statutory rights are not affected. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These little guys make great keychains and zipper pulls. You can customize them any way you want. We've even seen them made with lego heads! The best part about these **paracord** people is how easy they are to make! All you need to know is two knots. To get started, read our blog post by clicking on the picture below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Position the seam between the two colors off to one side. You don’t want it to be exactly in the center because this end will be the snake’s mouth. One of mine looks kind of **fun**ny because of the seam. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fishtail knots may look fancy, but they’re super durable, too. This knot requires a bit of skill and two lengths of **paracord**, but don’t let that scare you. The tutorial above is extremely easy to follow. When done right, you’ll end up with one clean-looking bracelet and a lot of **paracord** at your disposal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This project takes a bit of time (and a whole lot of **paracord**), but after, you can literally just hang out anywhere and relax with your handiwork. To make the construction easier, you’ll need a frame and some space to weave this all out. Make a rope border to prevent your hammock from unraveling, then just weave away like how it’s done in the video. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In addition to that, a **paracord** bracelet can be a **fun** thing to make and wear. Remember, if you make one... MAKE IT COLORFUL! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While I would not recommend using this unless you are in very dire circumstances,–like a survival scenario– inner threads could be used to sew up a wound but the downside to this is these stitches would have to be removed later since **paracord** does not really break down. There is also the fact that stitches are something that should only be done within the first hour or so a wound is created. Blood stop powder and butterfly closures or Steri Strips are usually much better for a wound. Paracord is not in any way sterile either but I suppose you could sterilize it by soaking in antiseptic first. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A little reminder, though: like the lighter wrap, this wallet involves gutting the **paracord**. This significantly decreases the cord’s strength and it might not be able to do heavy-duty tasks. Still, it looks pretty cool, so if you’re itching for an easy and **fun**ctional **paracord** project, this might be the one for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tie both strands of **paracord** around the hook, or find something else to tie it to. The distance between the hook and the pencil should be 12-13 inches. It doesn’t have to be exact, but don’t make it longer than 13 inches or you’ll run out of **paracord**. The finished snake will be just slightly longer than this – you’ll see why below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This project is great for you to use on an open blade to protect your hands from being cut up. It’s also great to make the handle of your blade more comfortable to use. See the video below for complete instructions so that you can easily create this **paracord** knife handle wrap! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paracords, albeit their **fun**ctionality, are often underrated. Some people just don’t realize their potential and importance as a survival tool. The truth is if you’ve got a **paracord** on you or somewhere in your pack, you can get out of any tough situation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The inner threads can be used for fishing line. Some fish like trout can be hard to catch with really thick line so the fine inner threads would work better than trying to use the whole cord. Of course not everyone lives where fish are small use your judgment call as to what test of line you will need. You can always use multiple threads if needed or make a **paracord** jig. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some of you may have read my article on perimeter security, well **paracord** can also be used to secure areas. There are a lot of booby traps you can make but you should probably not use them unless absolutely necessary because they can actually be deadly. Watch where you step when creating these. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Homesteading has swept the nation, if not the world. Many enjoy camping and living off the land. If you like practical crafts then survival **paracord** projects are for you. Create **paracord** items that will withstand daily use and potentially help you survive the zombie apocalypse. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You know what’s better than having a Swiss army knife in your EDC kit? It’s having a Swiss army knife and a matching **paracord** knife case in your EDC kit. A case helps secure your knife and keeps it from getting lost in your bag or glove compartment. It also protects your other gear from getting scratched. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **paracord** belt has many more uses than a leather belt. You can take it apart and use it for many things so it’s much more efficient for you to have on hand. So get started on making your belt today with the video below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What’s cool is that this bracelet uses a simple cobra weave done in dark green—anyone can make it. Instead of a fixed buckle, the bracelet uses a stopper knot at the very end. This feature makes the bracelet adjustable. This **paracord** project involves making really tight knots towards the end, so don’t forget to keep your fids nearby. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a lot of situations where a trip wire might come in handy. For starters, they can help slow down trespassers during a SHTF scenario. As far as **paracord** survival tools go, this **paracord** project is less harmful than setting booby traps, but still an effective security measure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While I would not use just a single piece of **paracord** for this, you could double it up, loop around, or tie off from multiple points to secure your watercraft as you would with a rope. Braided **paracord** could also work. Larger boats are not going to stay tied with **paracord** so use some common sense. It would take a lot of **paracord** woven together to even try to do this, so just keep things simple and use a rope. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cutting out the inside cord and attaching it to the outer cord using a square knot will often yield hundreds of feet worth of cord, which can be used for fishing, sewing, building shelters, among other things. Paracord bracelets are good insurance for anyone who might find themselves in a survival situation unexpectedly. Usually made with a side release buckle, they can also be made with shackles, a simple knot and loop, or even a whistle buckle. Using a whistle buckle as your connection piece for your **paracord** bracelet can be a plus, since creating noise is often useful when attempting to find help. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The snakes are flexible, so you can pose them to look like they are slithering. I love all the different colors of **paracord**! We also made a black and turquoise snake that didn’t make it into the pictures. I still want to make a purple and neon green one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is an easy project for beginners. It may take a little while to learn the technique, but most kids ages 8+ will be able to master this. 8-11 year olds will likely need help figuring out the steps, while teens can master it on their own. Adult help will be needed to fuse the **paracord** since it involves a lighter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **paracord** project uses a diamond knot for a stopper and a standard cobra knot for its body. All you gotta do to complete the pouch is grab a fid and tie the sides. You can also use this same method to create a pouch for other EDC gear like multitools and flashlights. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We experimented a little with the eyes – I made one snake with bead eyes by threading pony beads onto the **paracord** in the head. None of us liked the bead eyes as well as the googly eyes. I ended up taking the beads back off, but I wish I had taken a picture first. It’s definitely an option, and more in the “spirit of **paracord**” than gluing on googly ones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Totally Awesome Paracord Crafts has over 50 pages of full-color **paracord** tutorials. Make 10 different projects from bracelets to lanyards to dream catchers to headphone wraps. This ingenious guide makes **paracord** **fun** for kids of all ages! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Good support is important for us ladies. You can definitely use **paracord** to repair a bra strap and I have to say you can use **paracord** and a little fabric to make a very supportive and long lasting bra that is custom sized for you. Dress straps made out of **paracord** look pretty snazzy and edgy at the same time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paracord is useful for tying trees and other plants to stakes for support but it doesn’t rot so you will have to go back and remove or cut the **paracord** at some point unlike with jute and other twines that rot over time. On the other hand, **paracord** is much stronger than jute and other garden twines so if you have a big job, it might not be a bad idea. Simply loop the cord around the plants and posts and tie a knot to get the job done. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   66. Trap animals or intruders by making a **paracord** pit trap. This is one of the more formidable **paracord** uses and must be used with extreme caution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paracord can be used to attach logs together to make something that could be used to float yourself and gear or even just help you out with taking gear across some water. It might take a lot of **paracord** to do this and ensure sturdiness but it could be done. Alternatively, if you have a rope to loop around it may be a better option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course OD green is the most popular and common color but **paracord** also comes in a lot of other shades that can be useful in different situations. Khaki colored cord or black cord is useful to have because it can blend into places that OD green cannot. For crafts, there are some different colors like Starry Night. You can also use several colors to blend together to make tactical **paracord** bracelets and other **fun** things. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can tie knots and run the cord through soaked in bore cleaner to clean your rifle if you don’t have a bore cleaner brush. The beauty of this is that you can tie the knots to match the size of any of your bores so you don’t have to worry about having several sizes of rods or bore cleaner tips during an emergency, A gun cleaning kit is always nice and ideal but it sure is good to know how to clean a gun when you are not under ideal circumstances. As a bonus, you can make a **paracord** rifle sling to keep on hand for this purpose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Who doesn’t like a cool watch band? This **paracord** project uses a trilobite weave from a single strand of cord. You’ll need approximately 10 feet of **paracord** and a buckle. The trilobite weave is comfy and flexible, so it shouldn’t feel too rigid around your wrist. This style even allows you to conveniently change the watch’s batteries. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tying down things to protect them during storms, flooding, and other weather can save you a lot of losses and frustration. Paracord can be doubled or tripled up for additional strength. A single line may not be enough for extremely high winds or large objects, especially those that are big yet lightweight. You may also want to look at different types of **paracord** to use, depending on your location. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ever feel like you don’t have enough hands? Well **paracord** can help you out by allowing you to tie tools to your belt for easy access or simply to prevent loss when moving from Point A to Point B when in a survival situation. You don’t have to have traditional rope. Paracord rope will serve you well in many different situations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Knot **paracord** around a medium to large rock and then braid a handle that is long enough that you can sling it around with ease. This is a makeshift weapon that is super cheap to make and can definitely give you some advantages in hand to hand combat situations. Make sure your knots are secure before unleashing the weapon! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Slings can be good for adding extra support to injured arms. While a few doubled up lengths of **paracord** can make a big difference you can also braid, cobra weave, or macrame it to make it more solid and stronger. If at a later time you need to use the **paracord** you can always unravel it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your pet wears a collar, it’s easy to make them one with **paracord** materials. But there’s lots more you can do with **paracord**. Pet owners and crafters like **paracord** because it is durable and washable, perfect for pets! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1. Securing a tent against the wind or other inclement weather is easier with **paracord**. Simply tie off from your tent stakes, poles, or other points for increased strength. You can also use this to stretch a tarp over your tent for increased shelter and protection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A Paracord bracelet is a bracelet woven out of **paracord**. Paracord bracelets are also known as survival bracelets, 550 cord bracelets, or parachute cord bracelets and are considered a survival tool. The bracelets are worn by survivalists, hikers, climbers, campers, or anyone who enjoys the outdoors. These bracelets become extremely handy in survival or emergency situations. The cord itself is made up of 7 inner strands which each contain three inner strands of their own, which gives you a fair amount of cord to work with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **paracord** lanyard is great for a variety of things. You can attach them to knife or make a fashionable survival necklace with a charm. Paracord keychain lanyards will help you keep track of your keys or you could even keep ID attached at work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To make this monkey fist, you’ll need a monkey fist jig, around 12 feet of **paracord**, and a one-inch steel ball. Start by measuring out a length of **paracord** for the monkey fist handle (around 6 feet in total). Then, weave your remaining **paracord** around the jig five times per direction over as shown in the video above. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Who says **paracord**s are only for us humans? Treat your four-legged pals to some **paracord** **fun** by making these dog bone chew toys. They’re great for when you’re spending time out at camp or at home. You can even use these sturdy chew toys to train pets or service dogs how to fetch and pick up objects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dig a hole and use some sticks as anchor points down in the mouth. Create a web of **paracord** that can support leaves or other ground cover to make it look like the rest of the surroundings.
