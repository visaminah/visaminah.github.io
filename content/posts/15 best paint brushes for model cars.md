## 15 Facts Best Paint Brushes For Model Cars | Winsor And Newton Brushes
-   Before we go into describing the process of **paint**ing a model car, we would like to answer some of the preliminary questions. Firstly, you would need acrylic modeling **paint** to **paint** a model car. Other methods do work, but the acrylic offers the luster that the model car owners usually look for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, you would need to prepare the surface of the car for accepting the **paint**. The process is pretty simple for acrylic **paint**s. All you need to do is clean the surface with cold water and dish soap. Use a rag to wash the car properly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the car is fully prepared to accept the **paint**, start applying the **paint**. Make sure that you shake the car properly before using it, or else the **paint** coming from the can will not have the same consistency. Also, ensure that you are putting even coats on the surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First and foremost, you need to thin out the **paint** a little. Acrylic **paint**s, on their own, are too thick. The amount of thickness they have will make it hard to spread on the surface of the model car. For that reason, you need to thin them out a little bit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, we found that not all of our members knew how to **paint** model cars properly. Some were leaving streaks of **paint** at places where they should not be. And even though there are plenty of guides available on the internet, most fails at one crucial thing: keeping the whole guide simple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nonetheless, if you can not find a **paint** thinner, you can make it on your own. You will need distilled water and propyl alcohol. Mix these two in a 1:1 ratio. In other words, 50 percent of the solution will be distilled water, while the rest 50 percent will be propyl alcohol. Mix this solution with the **paint** accordingly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So, we have decided to take things into our hands. And in this article, we will go through the most straightforward guide on **paint**ing model cars. We will also cover each of the details that most of the guides usually skip. So, if you want to know all about the topic, read through the entire thing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now that you are done handling both the large and the small pieces, you need to let lave them out in the air to make the **paint** dry. We would recommend leaving them like for at least 12 hours. That amount of time is more than enough to make the acrylic **paint** dry to the very bone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, you would need to get the old finish out of the surface. For this, we usually use sandpaper that is from 1200 grit to 1500 grit. Sand the entire surface and take off the old **paint** totally. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You would need to disassemble the car in this process. Take apart as many parts as possible because that will make the whole **paint**ing process easy and hassle-free. Then, dip the brush into the **paint** and stroke out the intricate pieces of the model first. Use a wide variety of brush sizes to **paint** these pieces effectively. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Learning to **paint** model cars is not that hard at all. However, most of the guides make it seem like rocket science. But we hope that you did find our guide simple and easy to follow. Nonetheless, if you follow the steps correctly, you are sure to end up with a new-looking model car. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you are done with the small pieces, it would be time to move along to the large pieces. Use the same **brushes** you were using for the small parts and continue **paint**ing over the entire surface. Do not scrape or dab with the brush unless you are planning to do a specific detailing on the surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Constructing model cars is a fun little hobby that we love to do as a team of **paint**ers. We find it pretty engaging and enjoyable at the same time. However, when it comes to constructing model cars, paying attention to small details is pretty crucial. That is where our **paint**ing skills come into play. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After the **paint** dries off, you need to do a final washing and sanding. Use the 36000 grit sandpaper to lightly sand the surface. It will offer a luster and shine that will make the whole thing look good. Wash the residues and dust particles using water. And reassemble the model car. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just opt for a **paint** thinner that is specifically for model cars. However, we would recommend using the thinner that is from the same brand of **paint**. That will ensure that the mix is appropriate and it spreads effectively on the surface. Follow the guidelines stated on the tube of thinner and mix the **paint** with it inside a jar. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
