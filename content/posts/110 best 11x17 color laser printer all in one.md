## 110 Things About Best 11X17 Color Laser Printer All In One | What Is The Best 11X17 Color Laser Printer
-   There's no Wi-Fi option, although it will support AirPrint if connected to a wireless network. There's no scanning or faxing. And overall, it lacks some of the sophisticated features of other models on this list. But if you're just looking for a hardworking, high-volume **printer** this does offers excellent value. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We have already established that buying a modern **printer** is to increase convenience and reduce the hassle of having to do all things manually. A duplex **printer** is a **printer** that can print both sides of the paper either manually or automatically. An automatic duplex **printer** is the best **printer** for offices or small business. However, duplex printing is a headache if you have to do it manually, and your small business will suffer if that is the case. In addition, you can accidentally confuse the arrangement and completely mess up the printing process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Still, if you want to know about our top pick, it has to be the Epson EcoTank Wireless Printer. From superior wireless connectivity to superb printing quality, the **printer** can cater to all your printing needs and improve workplace efficiency. Since it’s a Supertank **printer**, it’ll also lower your ink replacement costs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Besides that, this is a very capable multifunctional **printer**, offering mono printing, scanning and copying (although not faxing). You can print via Ethernet, USB or Wi-Fi. On the negative side, there's no duplex printing, the paper capacity is limited to 150 sheets, and the small LCD display isn't the best. But overall, this is a good, solid performer that delivers quality results, time after time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is always safe to turn them off when not in use when using any electronic. Turning the electronics off increases the system's longevity and reduces the running costs tremendously. However, if you are busy and do not have the time to move around switching off electronics, an auto-off feature on the electronic will make work very easy for you. For example, you can have an easy time knowing your **printer** will not be running all night, even if you forget to switch it off. In addition, commercial environments can use an auto-off feature on electronics because no one will claim responsibility in a sea of employees if something goes wrong. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moving on with our list, we bring you the Canon imagePROGRAF wide-format color **printer** for architects. It delivers gallery-quality prints that can bring your architectural diagrams and designs to life. The superior inkjet printing technology makes printing so much easier and enhances your productivity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **laser** **printer** from HP has the name 'Neverstop' because it uses a refillable toner tank instead of disposable cartridges. This isn't just good for the environment, it also saves you money: up to 60 per cent on toner each time you reload. Not to mention that you're already getting 5,000 pages of toner right out of the box. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Printers have a minimum print quality of 600x600, and prints with that quality are black and white **printer**s. A wide format **printer** that prints in color can have a resolution of up to 4800x2400. Such a **printer** prints pictures with excellent quality that can do well in a commercial setting. Laser **printer**s do pretty well because of the printing technique, which is accurate and advanced. An all-in-one **printer** will get you the images that make sense in an office setting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It also offers auto-duplex printing and convenient media handling, along with an excellent speed that allows you to print stacks of documents instantly. It offers print speeds of 9.2 ISO PPM for black-and-white and 9.0 ISO PPM for color prints. Also, thanks to its fast wireless connectivity, the **printer** supports printing documents and photos directly from your laptops, Android tablets, or iPhones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you will buy a **laser** **printer**, then it is vital to know the difference between **laser** **printer**s and inkjet **printer**s. The **printer**s, more often than not, give similar results. However, a **laser** **printer** is more accurate and crisp than your typical inkjet **printer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the other hand, a **laser** **printer** utilizes static electricity to create characters on the sheet of paper in the **printer**. Static electricity uses the principle of negatives and positives attracting to create prints on a sheet of paper. Of course, different paper types will react differently to the static charge, but that is nothing to worry about. Once the static electricity is created on the sheet of paper, you will get your print. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although the **printer** offers wireless connectivity and supports your Alexa device, you might face certain network glitches. Connecting the machine with your personal Wi-Fi network can be a bit troublesome, and it might take some time to establish a strong connection. So, its poor connectivity can be a letdown while printing important documents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not only does it offer wide-format printing, but also delivers exceptional quality in your **printer** photos and documents. Thanks to its high printing speed, you can develop color and monochrome prints instantly. Moreover, you can use different paper sizes ranging from 3″ x 5″ to 11″ x 17″ as per your requirements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   4. Xerox WorkCentre 6515dni **printer** The best colour **laser** **printer** for a small office Specifications Output: Color Multifunctional: Yes Wi-Fi: Yes Print speed: 28ppm Paper capacity: 250 Resolution: 1,200 x 2,400dpi Dimensions: 42 x 50.6 x 50cm Weight: 30.7kg Today's Best Deals View at Adorama (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + High resolution prints + Connect up to 7 people + Scan, copy and fax Reasons to avoid - Expensive - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Epson Workforce multifunction **printer** is a **printer** you will love working with. The **printer** embodies its name as a workforce and delivers good results. The **printer** has an auto-duple function which massively saves your work and makes your life easier. Having to figure out where which print goes on the back can be a bit frustrating, and the **printer** gets that taken care of. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Effortless paper handling is another important criterion to consider while purchasing a **printer**. Always select **printer**s that come with a large feeder tray with a capacity of 250 to 500 sheets. In that way, you don’t need to worry about replacing the papers frequently. Better paper handling facilitates top-notch print speed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Epson WorkForce Pro is a great **printer** for architects as it is highly versatile and durable. It allows high-quality borderless prints, thanks to its PrecisionCore technology. Also, it is compatible with Ethernet and Wi-Fi Direct, thereby offering easy wireless printing. You can also pair it with your Alexa device and use voice commands to control all printing operations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We can look at 11x17 color **laser** **printer**s in two ways; paper size and printing techniques. An 11x17 **laser** **printer** is a wide format **printer** and print sizes up to A3, which not many office **printer**s do. In addition, the 11x17 color **laser** can be considered an all-in-one **printer** because of the inbuilt and automated functions. You no longer have to manually do anything because of features like the auto document feeder. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note that this is a one-use **printer**: there's no scanning, copying or faxing. And while there is a touchscreen display, it's pretty small and basic. But that helps keeps the cost down, and so as long as none of these are deal-breakers, this is an excellent value buy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a more obvious reason that affects the printing speed. Tabloid **printer**s have technical specifications that directly impact the printing speed. For example, if you buy a **laser** **printer** and an inkjet **printer** and put them side by side, the paper will not come out at the same time. This is because the **printer**s use different technologies to print the paper, and therefore can not have similar results. Two **printer**s can print the same tabloid size but not at the same rate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **laser** **printer**s are better than traditional **printer**s in terms of ink usage and ink cost efficiency. They usually come with a larger ink capacity, offering uninterrupted printing. The **laser** **printer** inks are much more affordable than traditional cartridges, so you can save a lot of money on ink replacements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This color **laser** **printer** is one the expensive side, but you do get good value for money. The Brother MFC-L3770CDW allows you to print, copy, scan and fax, via Wi-Fi or USB. It has a lovely 9.3cm color touchscreen, that makes it easy to access the **printer**'s wide range of document handling functions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. Brother HL-L5100DN The best cheap **laser** **printer** Specifications Output: Mono Print speed: 40ppm Multifunctional: No Wi-Fi: No Paper capacity: 300 Resolution: 1,200dpi Dimensions: 485 x 450 x 377 mm Weight: 10.7kg Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Newegg (opens in new tab) View at Walmart (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Low price + Fast print speeds Reasons to avoid - No faxing or scanning - No Wi-Fi - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Additionally, having a **printer** that connects via an ethernet cable or a USB port is an advantage because you can still print when the Wi-Fi is low. Furthermore, having options will ensure you do not get stuck under any circumstances. Finally, having Google cloud print will be one of the best features you can get on a **printer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It starts with a perfect balance of print speed and connectivity. So you will want an 11×17 advanced **printer** with various connectivity options such as Ethernet, Wireless direct printing, Apple Air Print, Google Cloud Print, and is Wi-Fi certified. The best 11×17 **printer** should be fast with colour print speeds of up to 40 pages per minute as the average but look for one with faster printing speed if you need it. Although some come at an affordable price, don’t scrimp on quality. Look for an all-in-one **printer** with an excellent build, compact design, and outstanding production-level performance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   7. HP Neverstop 1202nw Laser Printer The best **laser** **printer** with refillable toner Specifications Output: Mono Multifunctional: Yes Wi-Fi: Yes Print speed: 20ppm Paper capacity: 150 Resolution: 600dpi Dimensions: 38 x 38.5 x 52cm Weight: 8.78kg Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + 5,000 pages of toner included + Saves money over time + Multifunctional Reasons to avoid - Lacks duplex printing - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A newer **printer** will be more efficient than an older generation **printer**. While the technology may be similar, one machine can be more efficient in executing the same technology compared to the other machine. One page will take a shorter time to print on the latest technology, and the running costs will differ tremendously. Tabloid size printing speed will slightly differ in the different machines depending on the efficiency. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next up, we bring you the Epson WorkForce Prowide-format **printer** that comes with inkjet technology and offers superior professional printing. Like the Epson EcoTank model, it is also an all-in-one **printer** with copy, fax, and scan functions. Thanks to its wireless quality, printing photos has become quick and hassle-free for professional architects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What is the biggest difference between a **laser** **printer** and an inkjet **printer**? The printing technique is what makes the biggest difference between the two **printer**s. An inkjet **printer** has small nozzles that spray ink droplets on the paper as the paper passes through the **printer**. The inkjet **printer** uses electricity to create heat, forcing the ink to expand into a bubble and squirt on the paper, creating a print. Once the ink bubble is out, a vacuum is created, and more ink is drawn into the nozzle. As a result, many droplets have to be released to form a single character at any given time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Xerox is known for high quality and performance, but its **printer**s are generally pretty expensive. Here's a notable exception. The Xerox B215 offers mono printing, via Ethernet, Wi-Fi or USB, as well as scanning, faxing and copying, at an affordable price. And it's a very decent performer too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It comes with a 250-sheet paper tray and a rear feed tray for specialty paper, making it ideal for office use. The duplex printing feature allows automatic two-sided printing and can help you save paper. Since it is a wide-format color **printer**, you can use it for scanning and printing large documents. Its 35-page auto document feeder also makes paper handling quite effortless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That’s not all; this **printer** comes with a 50-sheet rear tray and a 500-sheet large front tray for effortless paper handling. It also allows automatic two-sided printing that can significantly reduce your cost per page when you are printing in bulk, thereby offering great value for money. It is safe to say that this is one of the best inkjet **printer**s on the market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can easily control its operations using the intuitive 2.65″ color touchscreen. It makes the entire process much easier and allows PC-free printing. Talking about PC-free printing, you can use this HP **printer** to directly print from your smartphones and tablets because of its super-fast wireless connectivity. Overall, it can be a great addition to your office to maintain a seamless workflow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best **laser** **printer** will cost more than an inkjet, and not be that great at printing photos. (If that's your priority, see our roundup of the best photo **printer**s). But when it comes to printing and copying documents, the quality will be much better. And if you're printing a lot, you'll find a **laser** **printer** much faster, and with lower running costs overall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Canon **printer** comes with eight dye-based inks that offer amazing and rich color gradients. The three grayscale inks deliver beautiful and sharp black and white prints, while the other inks are excellent for printing colored photos. It also has an image generating system for producing the right colors through optimum ink placement and combination. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Laser **printer**s are pretty good. However, you need to understand that you can pick the resolution you want for your prints. The resolution you use will depend on your reason for printing. For example, if you are working at home and are printing non-commercial prints, there is no need to get a super-high quality **printer** that will print the crispest images. However, if you are in a commercial setting, a wide format **printer** with the most detailed images will need for the business to grow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Check the color gradients that the **printer** inks offer before purchasing any **printer**. It’s best to look at **printer**s that deliver an enhanced color gamut producing vivid and stunning color prints. You can choose **laser** **printer**s or traditional **printer**s, but make sure they come with different ink colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An inkjet **printer** does about 15 pages every minute for black ink. A wide-format color inkjet would take slightly longer than a single-colored **printer**. If you are printing larger documents, the printing time will take slightly longer than printing smaller ones. An A4 paper takes a shorter time to print than an A3 paper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Buying a **printer** is dead easy, you run a search on Google and it gets you the best picks. But getting something that makes a difference is important. Don’t you think? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   This Canon PIXMA **printer** is on the heavier side and weighs around 43.4 pounds, so it’s not easily portable and takes up a lot of space. Before you purchase this **printer**, make sure you have ample room on the work desk to set it up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The automatic document feeder works by slotting sheets of paper into the **printer** without any human aid of any kind. The automatic feeder ensures that the **printer** can be in another room while in your office. The automatic feeder makes work easier for everyone and reduces the time it takes to fit a paper in the **printer** carefully. The automatic document feeder is advanced enough to suit all the paper sizes appropriate for the **printer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This versatile **printer** from Epson comes with a 2.7″ color touchscreen that allows easy navigation and control. So, whether you want to print, copy, scan, or fax a document, you can easily do all that with a few clicks on the touchscreen. It is undoubtedly one of the best wide-format **printer**s out there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, when it comes to printing quality and printing speed, **laser** **printer**s are not that different from traditional cartridge **printer**s. Also, the traditional cartridges might be more expensive, but they are easily available on the market. So, it basically comes down to your preferences and requirements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nothing is as convenient as direct printing in any home or office setup. The days when wires would run from the CPU to the **printer** are long gone, and you can print directly from your device without having to leave the comfort of your seat.

On top of this, the LCD display enables you to control all the operations of this machine to maintain printing speed and improve your productivity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best way to reduce the cost of printing is to look for a **printer** that allows auto-duplex or manual duplex prints. You can easily print on both sides of the sheet and reduce the printing cost per page significantly. Even though manual duplex can be a bit troublesome, it can still effectively lower your printing budget. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

In addition, the **printer** connects to mobile devices for easy printing and is easy to set up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Getting a **printer** that can scan for your home office is even better. Your projects need to be stored online for safety reasons and future reference. Most people who buy **printer**s for home use utilize the scanning function more than the printing function. If you have to share physical documents with others, scanning them becomes necessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Hence, you can print stacks of documents without compromising the printing quality with this **printer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

A document feeder is a feature that almost all **printer**s have in this day and age, and you can expect to find one in all the **printer**s available in the market. However, it is vital to know how efficient the document feeder is because the efficiency of a **printer** will impact the printing costs in the long run. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

But, with so many good **printer**s out there, making the right decision can be overwhelming. That’s why we’re here to review the best 11×17 **printer**s suitable for architects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This HP LaserJet Enterprise model is one of the best **laser**jet **printer**s that offers high print quality with excellent color output. It comes with an enhanced color mode that offers a wider color range and delivers extra gloss and vividness. So, you can trust this **printer** to deliver stunning color prints that can stand the test of time without fading. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A bigger sheet size like 11 x 17 printing is not possible for every **printer**. The solution is to opt for a reliable 11×17 Laser Printer that eases your job.

Most **printer**s can print directly from hardware drives, or different cloud printing applications could prove helpful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Not to mention a generous capacity of 251 sheets plus a tilting, 3.5 inch color touchscreen, which makes this **laser** **printer** easy and convenient to use. On the downside, it takes a little time to warm up, but on the whole this is quite the bargain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Odd as it may sound, ink costs are a huge factor when you own a **printer**. This is because you are bound to run out of ink at some point, and you will need to replace it. Therefore, you need to know the price of the ink to know how much your printing services will be in case you need to offer them. Additionally, the **printer** or scanner has a quality measured by the number of dots per square inch. Therefore, the **printer** will determine the number of dots per inch printed on paper, and in turn, how much ink you will be using in a month. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Canon **printer** is not an all-in-one **printer** and offers only printing functions. You cannot use it for copying, scanning, or faxing work. Hence, the applications of this **printer** are somewhat limited, which can be a letdown if you want to use it for office work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, try to choose a **printer** having an automatic document feeder. It can deliver uninterrupted printing and ensure automatic double-sided printing without you needing to lift a finger. Smooth paper handling can also prevent the paper from getting jammed inside the **printer** and reduce printing waste. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **printer** uses Canon’s Professional Print and Layout (PPL) software, allowing smooth image editing that integrates seamlessly into your workflow. The 3.0″ LCD color display makes it quite easy to control the **printer** operations, monitor ink levels, and check the **printer** status. Thus, you can put all your printing woes to rest with this professional inkjet photo **printer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most impressive quality of this **printer** is its revolutionary ink tank system that’s specially designed to have a larger ink capacity than other **printer**s.

So, you can save a lot of money on cartridge replacement with this **printer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Even though this all-in-one **printer** from Epson is great for wireless printing, it doesn’t have a memory card slot. As a professional architect, you might need to print important documents and designs stored in your memory card. In that case, you have to transfer the documents to your laptop or PC before using this **printer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Epson Workforce Pro offers poor wireless connectivity as it doesn’t stay connected to the Internet for a long time. It can often disconnect from your Wi-Fi or Ethernet network and disrupt the entire printing process.

So, in this section, we’ll answer some of the commonly asked questions about **printer**s and highlight certain key features that you can consider for making a well-informed decision. Let’s take a look! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The concepts of 11×17 inkjet **printer** and **laser**jet **printer**s are a bit different from each other. Inkjet **printer**s use ink pigmentation to print on the pages. However, **laser** **printer**s do come with multiple toners. These toners are manufactured to last much longer. They are not based on ink, but the toners use carbon printing to cut the price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Canon PIXMA **printer** doesn’t come with any extra backup ink that you can use for uninterrupted printing. Once the ink runs out, finding the 8-color dye-based inks for the **printer** can be a bit troublesome. In fact, many customers have complained about this ink shortage problem. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The concept of printing 11 x 17 pages is quite the same as printing any A4 page. Printers with multiple page capacity may print much bigger size of sheets easily. You can find both InkJet **printer**s as well as Laser **printer**s to do this job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, we have another professional photo **printer** for architects from the Canon PIXMA series that offers easy wireless connectivity and delivers excellent print quality. It is great for printing stunning color photos and documents using different types of media. You can use it to develop professional-quality large-format prints without any glitches or color distortions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moreover, the fast photo printing quality of the machine enables you to print stacks of photos quickly. It can produce bordered A3+ color prints within 90 seconds. You can significantly increase your productivity and work efficiency using this Canon PIXMA **printer**. It uses the ChromaLife100+ CLI-65 ink that enhances the color gamut of the prints. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even though the Epson EcoTank **printer** delivers professional-quality prints, setting it up can be quite a hassle. The instruction manual is difficult to understand, making the installation process of this **printer** even more complicated. You might end up spending hours before you can print a decent photo using this **printer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The EcoTank **printer** from Epson offers versatile and professional handling, allowing uninterrupted printing without any jamming of papers inside the machine.

-   The HP DesignJet **printer** doesn’t have a detailed user manual on setting it up. If you are a beginner, it can be a bit troublesome. You can get a PDF version of the user manual once you visit the HP customer support site, but it is not included in the pack. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The ability to print 11 x 17 is not for all **printer**s. Most wide format **laser** **printer**s do come with multiple size adjustment options. However, most **printer**s cannot print such page sizes. Specific large format **laser** **printer** having a flatbed scanner that comes with a wide tray will print in such a format. Usually, wide **laser** **printer**s can do this, and you can get a fabulous result. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It supports both large-format and wide-format prints. The 24-inch media rolls are excellent for large-format prints, while the **printer** uses 13″ x 19″ sheets for wide-format prints.

-   As a professional architect, you often need to develop designs, blueprints, and diagrams in landscape format or in different paper sizes. With wide-format **printer**s, developing borderless landscape prints of up to 13″ x 19″ becomes much easier. They produce vivid, borderless wide prints that can be perfect for printing larger documents and for tabloid-size printing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moreover, the **printer** offers auto-duplex printing and allows you to save a lot of money on the printing cost per page.

-   If you are looking for a wide-format **printer** that offers professional photo printing, this Epson Expression **printer** can be an ideal choice.
