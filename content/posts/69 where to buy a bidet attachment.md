## 69 Tips for Where To Buy A Bidet Attachment | Bidet Attachments
-   This **bidet** **attachment** allows you to control the water pressure. The **attachment** is excellent for women who have just given birth. It helps relieve pain or irritation that toilet paper or cloth may make worse. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you know what sort of **bidet** you want, you now have to ensure that it fits on your toilet. In general, the first thing you’ll want to check is if you have a one-piece toilet or a two-piece toilet. A one-piece toilet has no separation between the bowl and the tank behind it, whereas a two-piece has a gap between those two elements. Basically all **bidet**s will fit a two-piece toilet (you’ll just have to check bowl shape, but more on that in a second), but some one-piece designs don’t leave enough room to fit an **attachment**. So if you have a one-piece toilet you’ll want to make sure you don’t have one with a French curve (where the frame of the toilet between the bowl and the tank curves up), and you should always measure the space between the bowl and the tank to make sure it matches your desired **bidet**’s requirements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Alpha JX **bidet** seat was the best overall **bidet** seat we tested, featuring the most desirable technologies at the lowest price. However, while the Alpha JX ended up on top, the race between it and our runner-up, the Toto Washlet C2, was incredibly close. Both have plenty of features you expect in a **bidet** at this price range, including a heated seat, dryer, full control of the stream’s pressure and direction, plus warm water. However, the Alpha JX has an unlimited warm water supply compared to the Toto’s limited one, which is what ended up pushing the Alpha into our winning spot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Instead of a remote like the Alpha JX, the Toto C2’s controls are mounted on a sidearm. If you want a remote for the extra convenience, or you’re worried a **bidet** with an arm won’t fit in your bathroom, the Toto Washlet C5 is basically the same as the C2 but features a remote and added user profiles for about $50 more. However, we actually liked the sidearm better because unlike on the remote, all the buttons are labeled, so there’s no need to decipher and memorize symbols, which means it’s simple to use even if you’ve never sat on a **bidet** before. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since a toilet only has a cold water supply, to get warm water with a simple **attachment** like the Tushy, you have to hook it up to your sink’s hot water supply. There’s no internal heater, so your water temperature is completely dependent on how quickly your sink’s water gets hot, and even then you still have to flush out the water that’s been sitting in the hose before you get a warm wash. For that reason, we recommend you get the Tushy Classic over the Tushy Spa and avoid **attachment**s altogether if you want to use warm water. If you do prefer a heated wash, we suggest you upgrade to a full **bidet** seat, like one of our picks, the Alpha JX or Toto Washlet C2. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On top of an extremely comfortable and effective wash, the Toto also has some extra features that aren’t must-haves but definitely make your bathroom experience all the more luxurious. One of these functions is a pre-mist feature, which is only available on Toto **bidet**s. It turns on automatically when it senses someone sitting on the seat and sprays a mist onto your toilet bowl to lubricate the surface, which helps keep it clean. The deodorizer is also automatic, activating once you stand up to help your bathroom stay fresh. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Easy installation and maintenance: Bidet **attachment**s don’t need complicated, messy and time-consuming installation and maintenance work. Simply unscrew the toilet seat, fit the **attachment**, and replace the seat and you are good to go. The same applies to any maintenance work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here in the States, we've grown up with marketing that's reinforced that the only way to be clean in the bathroom is to use toilet paper, and there may be misconceptions that **bidet**s are unhygienic, messy, and difficult to use. The opposite is actually true. Think of it this way — if you got the same stuff on your hands, would you grab a paper towel and rub it off? No. You'd turn on the faucet and wash your hands. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Tushy Classic 3.0 is a fantastic **bidet** for beginners and a great value at just under $100. No other **bidet** **attachment** was as comfortable to use as the Tushy, and it has a gentle yet effective stream, simple installation and easy-to-use controls along with adjustable pressure and direction. However, if you want more features such as warm water, a heated seat or a dryer, then you’ll have to shell out some more cash — but trust us, it’s worth it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Out of the **attachment**s, the Tushy Classic 3.0 had the most comfortable stream by far, and its adjustable nozzle made it much easier than others to get a thorough clean. While it’s a bare-bones **bidet**, you still get a solid range of pressure and directional adjustability so you can find what feels right for you. With **attachment**s in general, we found ourselves using low pressures, as their streams felt more aggressive than their electric counterparts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want an electric **bidet** seat, next you’ll have to measure your bowl to see if it’s elongated or round. Most come in varieties to fit both, so you’ll want to ensure the **bidet** you purchase fits correctly. To see which measurements are which, check out this compatibility guide from BidetKing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for a low-cost **bidet** that’s simple to set up, effective and not overly complicated, the Tushy Classic 3.0 is definitely the **bidet** for you. While working on this story, we actually tested the Tushy Spa, not the Classic. (We’ve used the Tushy Classic in the past, but we didn’t officially test it again for this story.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "This **bidet** **attachment** is a dream to use," reviewer Pug Martin says. "It took a bit of practice to know exactly where to sit so that both nozzles are aiming where they should, but now it's second nature." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can bring the **bidet** experience with you wherever you go with the handheld Tushy Travel. Fill this portable **bidet** with water and squeeze it to spray. It's retractable, subtle and is available in four colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "The **bidet** does a great job of cleaning," reviewer Joel Steverson says. "We're definitely using less toilet paper than before." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the **bidet** has both hot and cold-water controls, turn on the hot water. Open the spray valve until the water sprays six to eight inches high. When the water is hot to the touch, turn the cold-water valve until the water is comfortable. Be careful not to let the spray exceed twelve inches in height. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, let us explain what a **bidet** is. Bidets are specialized toilet bowls that use a stream of water to clean your butt and/or vagina after using the bathroom, rather than wiping with toilet paper. (If you've ever been to a fancy hotel, it's the fountain-looking thing usually found next to your toilet.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Toto Washlet C2’s stream is really its main selling point. It was the most comfortable out of all the **bidet**s we tested, with a thick, aerated spray that gave us the best cleaning experience. The oscillation function on the Toto was a great way to get a fuller, more thorough clean, and it also features a front wash and pulsating feature, although we didn’t find the pulsing function to add much to the experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re one of the many adopting a **bidet** for the first time, it can be a confusing and intimidating process to find the right one. That’s why we spent more than three months meticulously testing 19 of the most popular **bidet**s on the market to find the very best. Here are four we love. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Convinced? You don't have to call your handy person to install a full-on **bidet** in your bathroom. If you're ready to try one out, these seven **bidet** **attachment**s below go right on to your toilet for the utmost ease and convenience. Your butt's going to thank you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use caution when you turn on the water. Many **bidet**s have a high jet of water with only a slight turn of the control. Be sure you know where the water will come from, so you don’t get a surprise shower. Some **bidet**s require you hold the control to keep the jets on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While I'm talking about Tushy, I couldn't not mention their latest product. The Tushy Stand helps cut down on the amount of paper you use at the end of your session (since these **bidet**s are non-electric, there's no drying built in). Instead of toilet paper, you fill the Tushy Stand with boxes of their 4-ply bamboo tissues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Brondell Swash 1400 and Omigo Luxury Bidet seemed to be the exact same **bidet** seat with different branding. The Swash 1400 didn’t have the most comfortable stream, and its dryer felt like it was only hitting half of the area it needed to. If you’re going to spend this much money on a **bidet**, we’d recommend the Toto K300 or the Bio Bidet Bliss BB-2000. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Besides infinite hot water, the Alpha JX features a heated seat, a dryer and a fully customizable stream, all adjustable from a remote control. With clear buttons that are all labeled, it’s super easy to go through a wash and dry cycle, even if you’ve never used a **bidet** before. You can adjust the position, strength and temperature of the spray and see what level your settings are at with the small screen. Plus, the Alpha JX has a “Wash & Dry” button that runs through a complete wash and dry cycle with just one press. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Reduction in plumbing risks:Since you might abandon or use less toilet paper than before, less toilet paper will go through your toilet pipes. Using a **bidet**s seat minimizes the risk of clogging. However, it mostly applies to people who use flushable wipes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Bidetmega 150’s spray wasn’t nearly as comfortable as the Toto’s or the Alpha JX’s, and the dryer wasn’t as effective as either of our picks either. Plus, installing the Coway **bidet**s was by far the hardest out of all the options we tested. The T-valve you use to connect your **bidet** to your bathroom’s water line is divided into parts, meaning you have to find the properly sized adapters to attach the **bidet**. It adds an extra, confusing step and also gives the connection more points where it could leak. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Luxe Bidet **bidet** **attachment** has a second "feminine nozzle" with a softer spray that's helpful postpartum or during menstruation. Like the other options above, it too features a temperature-control knob. Another standout feature: Its nozzle automatically retracts behind a guard gate after each wash to help ensure it stays clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The only real setback of the K300 is that it only comes in an elongated shape, which means if you have a round toilet, you’re out of luck. If you do have a round toilet and still want a luxurious **bidet**, we loved the Bio Bidet Bliss BB-2000, which is available in round shapes. The BB-2000 had the second-most-comfortable spray experience, and on top of the oscillation stream you’ll find on many **bidet** seats, it had a fantastic massage function that was our favorite spray pattern of any **bidet** we tested. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want a luxury **bidet** but can’t find the Toto K300, we’d pick the Bio Bidet BB-2000 Bliss. It didn’t perform quite as well as the Toto K300, but it has a very comfortable spray and dryer, and its massage function was our favorite stream pattern out of all the **bidet**s we tested. The remote is more complicated than the Toto’s, so it takes a while to learn what all the symbols mean and what they do. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you've got an electrical outlet within 3-4 feet of your toilet, then you're in luck. You can upgrade to **bidet**s that do practically everything except actually go for you. They're considerably more expensive — but you're getting a premium bathroom experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There's a reason that the rest of the world uses **bidet**s. It's only prudishness that keeps us addicted to TP. If you're ready to *ahem* dive in, here's a list of options, from basic underseat options to the best **bidet** **attachment**s to full smart toilet replacements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another option is replacing your toilet seat for a **bidet** toilet seat. This Kohler **bidet** toilet seat does not require electricity. You can control the intensity of its water and adjust its spray position. This toilet seat's **bidet** wand automatically rinses after each use for hygiene purposes. Find this toilet seat in two colors and two shapes for different toilets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Tushy Classic was also relatively easy to install, and the clear instructions are simple to follow, even if you’re not particularly handy. However, when installing any **bidet**, the most important aspect is making sure it’s compatible with your toilet. You should also find the water connections and try taking off your toilet seat beforehand so you know how everything works. Luckily, the Tushy Classic fits all two-piece toilets and most one-piece toilets (more on this below). If you’re still not sure if the Tushy will fit your specific toilet, you can check out more about Tushy’s compatibility here and even browse through its searchable list of toilets here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bidet **attachment**s from Bio Bidet by Bemis combine innovative features and unrivaled value. An attachable **bidet** makes it easy to install and enjoy **bidet** functionality on almost any toilet. With easy DIY installation and exceptional customer support, you’ll have no trouble finding just the right **bidet** toilet **attachment** for your bathroom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Kohler C3-430: The water consistently stayed at the temperature I wanted, the pressure was strong and adjustable, and the remote control was easy to use once I get the hang of it. But, at this price point, I'd expect the **bidet** to have a dryer. I also couldn't get this to stay securely in place. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want predictable, adjustable heating and more control over the stream, you’ll have to upgrade to an electric **bidet** seat. Electric **bidet** seats definitely cost more, but for the investment you get a big upgrade in experience. The streams are gentler and more effective, the water actually gets warm and you get other technologies like a heated seat and — our favorite feature — the dryer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If 2021 taught us anything, it was the true value of toilet paper in our lives. Between the toilet paper shortages and buying limits, most of us realized how much our personal sense of wellbeing depends on the those white, pillowy rolls. But for people around the world who rely on **bidet**s, the shortages weren't a problem. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Coway Bidetmega 400 had a similarly frustrating installation process as the cheaper Coway **bidet**s. The Bidetmega 400 has more features than the 150 and 200, however, its spray wasn’t as comfortable or effective as other top contenders, even though it automatically goes through a four-stage washing cycle unique to Coway **bidet**s. It’s a nice luxury **bidet**, but if you’re willing to spend a little more we think you’ll be better served by a Toto or the Bio Bidet Bliss BB-2000. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both options have similar **bidet** spouts that shoot water at an angle from the back of the toilet up to your bum (or wherever you desire). Many are also adjustable to make sure you get the angle just right. Or, if you want the most direct and controlled wash, you can get a handheld **bidet** sprayer that docks on or beside the toilet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The spray on the Brondell Swash DS275 wasn’t as good as that on the Toto Washlets. And similar to the other Brondell **bidet**s, we didn’t think the dryer was as effective as the Toto’s. It does come with a massage function and a deodorizer, but we think the oscillation of the Toto C2 and Alpha JX do the job better, and if you want a deodorizer, go with a Toto. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, we get to my favorite **bidet** brand. Toto has been creating luxury bathroom fixtures and seriously lux toilets in Japan for decades. I'm excited to finally see their products in the U.S. This plug-in **bidet** has an auto open and close lid, a heated seat, night light, pre-mists the bowl to keep things from sticking, cleans the wand and the toilet bowl completely after each use, instantly warms the water with a tankless heater, has a built in dryer, deodorizes the air, and has a remote control! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, electric **bidet** seats vary a lot in price due to the wide range of features and technologies available. Typically, tankless units (that use a coil heater to provide unlimited hot water) are more expensive than those that use a reserve tank to store enough hot water for a single use. Most **bidet**s with endless hot water will cost you somewhere around $600, though our top pick, the Alpha JX, comes in a couple of hundred dollars cheaper, making it a great buy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Straddle the **bidet**, align your anus with the column of water. Note that most **bidet**s don’t have seats. They are still meant to sit on. Open the spray valve until you have the right pressure to flush any remaining feces away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Getting the superior spray of the Toto **bidet**s paired with endless warm water results in a truly luxurious wash. Plus, the K300 has all the extra fancy features of the C2 and C5, including an automatic pre-mist and deodorizer, along with the same remote as the C5. In addition to more convenient control, this remote gives you the ability to set user presets. So when you find your perfect seat temperature, water temperature and dry temperature, on top of your preferred pressure and position, you can save it to one of two presets so you can quickly access the perfect wash at the press of a button. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **bidet** is a shallow, sink-like toilet that uses water to watch your private parts and the area around them. They are separate from your toilet. However, there are other options. You can purchase **bidet** seats or there is an **attachment** option. Attachments fit your existing toilet and seat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With standalone **bidet**s you can face the **bidet**’s water controls or sit facing away from them, as you would on a toilet. It’s easier if you face the controls. However, if you are wearing pants, you’ll need to remove them to straddle the **bidet**. There are various **bidet** designs, so the configuration of the jets and the part of your body that you wish to clean will help you decide which way to face. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **bidet** should come with an adapter that you then attach to the water source. This will route water through the **bidet** nozzle before it ever reaches the toilet tank. It’s the same water you shower and brush your teeth with, so you will not be cleaning yourself with dirty toilet water. Then you simply pop the toilet seat back on, which will completely cover the base of the **attachment**, so the only visible part will be the nozzle that slightly protrudes just below the back of the seat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are plenty of pros and cons between the Alpha JX and the Toto Washlet C2. Both are fantastic **bidet**s that you’ll love having on your toilet. The Alpha JX has endless warm water, but the stream and dryer performance of the Toto C2 is slightly better. If you want that comfortable experience and don’t mind a tank heating system, read on for our full thoughts on the Toto Washlet C2. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brondell Swash S102 Non-Electric: The S102 features a warm water hookup that attaches to the hot water connection under your sink — like the Tushy Spa. The pressure is outstanding, and it has an attractive appearance. However, the knobs are hard to read, and as with other non-electric **bidet**s, you're missing a lot of features that make a **bidet** a luxury experience. If you're going non-electric, we think you'd be better off with the more affordable Tushy Spa. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Think of these as training wheels...for your butt. If you're not looking to replace your seat or toilet and you don't have an electrical outlet handy, these non-electric underseat **bidet**s will get the job done for less than $100. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Depending on the **bidet** model and settings, **bidet**s clean you after you use the toilet via a stream of warm or room temperature water that comes out of a nozzle. Devotees claim the **bidet** experience leaves them feeling cleaner than using toilet paper. Plus, **bidet**s are more environmentally friendly and more affordable (in the long run) than toilet paper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tushy's Spa 3.0 features an adjustable temperature setting and an automatic self-cleaning nozzle. It comes with a 9-foot hot water hose and does not require electricity or additional plumbing (though Tushy says the **bidet** will need to be near a sink to work correctly). You can choose from 10 different knob and **attachment** color combinations, making it one of the most aesthetically pleasing **bidet** choices of the bunch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This left-handed **bidet** toilet seat **attachment** only has a cold water setting. It’s non-electric with a self-cleaning nozzle and is excellent for personal care and hygiene. This **bidet** is made from high-quality ABS material with full copper fittings and braided metal tubing. This **attachment** can be connected directly to your sink or toilet. The water pressure control allows you to set the spray where you find it the most comfortable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Electric **bidet** seats with a good dryer are a great purchase because not only do they give you a better experience on the toilet, but if you use the dryer after your wash, you end up using less toilet paper, which is great both for the earth and your wallet. We were expecting to use less toilet paper with all the **bidet**s we tested but quickly found that **bidet** **attachment**s leave you needing to pat dry, which often takes just as much toilet paper as you’d normally use. For that reason, if cutting back on toilet paper is a big motivation for your **bidet** purchase, we’d definitely recommend getting one with a dryer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This electric **bidet** toilet seat has a heated seat, plus water pressure and temperature control. This seat is anti-bacterial and anti-microbial. It has aerated, oscillation/pulse, feminine, power wash, massage and child wash modes. It also has a dryer feature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We won’t walk you through **bidet** installation step by step, as it is surprisingly simple — not much more difficult than installing any replacement toilet seat, plus a little plumbing — and most instruction manuals are quite clear, but it is good to note that for all **bidet**s, you’ll have to remove your existing toilet seat. With **attachment**s you’ll put the seat right back on, but with electric **bidet** seats you’ll mount the **bidet** onto your toilet and get rid of your old seat and lid. It’s good to check out how your current seat mounts beforehand, as some lids have a quick-release function, while others screw off, so be sure you know how yours works, as it could affect your installation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **bidet** can be quite useful to get your bottom cleaner than just wiping with toilet paper. Bidets are used in eighty percent of the world and are popular in Europe, South America, Asia, and the Middle East. In the United State they are just now catching on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're looking for a few more options in a full seat replacement **bidet**, then upgrade to the battery-powered Slim Zero from Bio Bidet. It has dual wands for front and back cleansing, an easy-to-use lever on the side of the unit and a battery-powered night light. It does this all in a very slim package. Even with the battery pack, it avoids the hump of the Kohler unit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most are made for right-handed users and attach for use on the right side of the toilet. Today we’ll review some of the best ones for left-handed users. First some information on what a **bidet** is and how to use them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The question should not be whether you should get a Bidet toilet seat. It should be, why you don't own one already. Compared to its toilet paper counterpart, a **bidet** toilet seat is miles better and more beneficial than other means. The benefits provided below will directly answer the topic of discussion: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The SouthSpa Dual Nozzle Bidet is made for left-handed people and those who may need a **bidet** **attachment** with controls on the left side. The operation of this model is straightforward and intuitive. You can adjust the water pressure by turning the smooth dial. The nozzles can be positioned so that you get a precise and thorough cleaning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are advantages to using a **bidet** over toilet paper. Environmental impact is a big advantage because **bidet**s can reduce the use of toilet paper by 75% or more. The best reason to use a **bidet** is that they are cleaner, more comfortable, and more hygienic than using toilet paper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **bidet** **attachment** is not going to introduce bacteria into the vagina when used correctly, said board-certified OB-GYN Dr. Anna Cabeca, chief medical officer at Golden Isles Medical Spa and author of the book MenuPause. (Similar to wiping front to back, some **attachment**s have a feminine wash setting that directs the water from front to back.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bidets may also be less likely to spread bacteria. In one 2022 study published in the Journal of Water and Health, 32 participants used toilet paper or an electric toilet seat with water spray after a bowel movement. The researchers found that the study subjects had fewer bacteria on their hands with the use of the **bidet** than with toilet paper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Luxelet E890 from Luxe Bidet offers a slim and smart toilet seat replacement **bidet** with all the features of the previous devices, night light, heating, etc., but at a fraction of the cost. The stainless steel wand is self-cleaning, has UV sanitization, and two nozzles for different types of washing. It can even “auto wash” where it runs through a spray and dry cycle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are other perks of **bidet**s. You can save money on toilet paper, and cutting back on toilet paper is also good for the environment. (After you rinse, you generally need just a bit of toilet tissue to pat dry, unless there’s a dry function that lets you avoid the need for toilet paper altogether.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Bidet Attachment comes with a hot and cold setting with water temperature regulation that comes in handy if you have a heating system pre-installed. This **attachment** also features a self-cleaning dual nozzle that allows you to control the ejecting water pressure. Designed with left-handers in mind, it’s excellent for personal care and hygiene. Before using the hot water setting, it’s advised to use the self-cleaning feature and drain the cold water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Operation of the **bidet** itself is all done through a very discreet wand that sticks out of the side of the seat. Twist it away from you to turn it on and adjust the wand up and down to change the angle. It's all rather intuitive and avoids cheeky operational icons. What's particularly nice is that you can switch out caps on the wand to adjust for your water pressure. The mid-level cap comes installed, but you can increase or decrease the intensity of the stream with one of the other caps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
