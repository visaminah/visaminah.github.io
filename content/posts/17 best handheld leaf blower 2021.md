## 17 Shocking Facts About Best Handheld Leaf Blower 2021 | best handheld leaf blower 2021
-   This Worx **leaf** **blower** is so light and compact that it’s hard to imagine it blowing the skin off a rice pudding; you can easily use it one-handed and, with the nozzle at its least extended, it’s under 80cm long. Yet the clever design uses air amplifier technology to drive more air through the tube than you might expect, at speeds of up to 209km/h. This gives it more than enough puff to separate soggy leaves from a lawn or driveway, and scatter dryer leaves in all directions. In fact, it’s worth switching down to the lower power setting just to give you a better chance of shaping them into some kind of pile. It’s also great for clearing debris off your decking, or even drying off the car post-wash. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is the lightest **leaf** **blower** we’ve tried: you can easily use it one-handed, yet it has plenty of oomph, which means its 12-minute battery life is enough to clear a small garden of all but the most stubborn wet leaves. The long, narrow nozzle is a godsend for hard-to-reach areas and makes it easy to direct the leaves towards your pile, “sweep” the patio and clear out cobwebs. The lithium battery, which can also be used with other cordless Bosch tools, takes around three and a half hours to charge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Worx WG543E drops a NIFTY £20 for Black Friday Our favourite compact **leaf** **blower**, the Worx WG543E is surprisingly light and easy to carry considering its solid blowing power. On average, its been selling at a respectable £173 on Amazon, however, a Black Friday price drop has brought it down to an even more attractive £153. Amazon was £173 now £153 Buy Now - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Worx sells the WG543E with a 4A PowerShare battery and charger, and this will give you enough charge for a good 20 minutes of blasting, and slightly more at the lower power setting. You can also use other Worx PowerShare batteries, though the most common 2A units will only give you half that lifespan. It might be small, but don’t underestimate it: this compact, convenient **blower** can get the job done in style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Get a NEAT £10 off this Bosch **leaf** **blower** for Black Friday Light enough to carry in one hand, nice and powerful, and designed with a narrow nozzle that makes it easy to direct leaves, this Bosch **leaf** **blower** is perfect for smaller gardens. Normally selling at an average price of £98 on Amazon, you can currently pick this model up for just £88 - a neat £10 Black Friday saving. Amazon was £98 now £88 Buy Now - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Corded **blower**s tend to be lighter and more powerful since there is no battery to carry and fewer constraints on the motor. However, cordless models have improved dramatically over the last few years, thanks to more efficient motors, lighter batteries and streamlined designs, and naturally have a huge advantage in that you can take them anywhere without running out of cable. Instead, your biggest worry will be running out of charge, so make sure the battery life will cover your needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Never underestimate the importance of good ergonomics. A heavy **blower** with poor weight distribution won’t be an issue in a small garden, but if you’ve got a big area to clear then it’s going to get tough on your arms, back and shoulders. Look for straps or grips that ease the burden. Similarly, models that vibrate a lot can be uncomfortable to use, and some **leaf** **blower**s can be incredibly noisy; you’ll need ear defenders and understanding neighbours. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many **leaf** **blower**s and **blower** vacuums lack oomph, however, while others are horribly noisy or don’t last. We’ve tested the market leaders for power, noise levels, durability and more. Be sure to check out our buyer’s guide too – there’s a lot of variation between **leaf** **blower**s so it pays to do a bit of homework before buying. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cordless **blower**s are also more expensive, particularly if you need a battery and charger, too. However, you should be able to find models that may work with the batteries and chargers of your existing garden or power tools. Models from Bosch, Worx or Ryobi, for example, will work with the same batteries that power their cordless grass trimmers, hedge trimmers, lawnmowers and even electric drills and sanders. What’s more, some manufacturers have joined forces around a battery standard, so that if you buy a **leaf** **blower** that uses Bosch’s Power 4 All battery, you can share batteries and chargers with compatible equipment from Gardena and Flymo. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is another **blower**/vacuum combo where the transformation gets a little tiresome. You attach the slimline nozzle for **leaf**-blowing duties, or a larger pipe and bag when you want to start your vacuuming. The process takes a few minutes and involves attaching or detaching a handle, but it’s worth it, as you get a dual-purpose garden tidying machine that actually does both jobs well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s a class act on both counts, too. It’s surprisingly quiet in **leaf** **blower** mode, thanks to Bosch’s ProSilence technology, yet it still does a great job of blowing leaves around and lifting any damp ones off the lawn or driveway. As a vacuum, it can then mulch the leaves and twigs to pack more into the 45-litre bag, while repelling dirt and moisture to keep the collected debris reasonably dry. It’s light enough to be used without much aggro to your shoulder, but still fantastically well-built. It hasn’t quite got the convenience of the cordless models or the raw grunt of the Flymo PowerVac, but the UniversalGardenTidy makes clearing leaves easy, and almost fun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a large garden – or just prefer petrol-powered machinery – this **blower** will suit you perfectly. It runs for an impressive 60 minutes on a tank of unleaded petrol and is surprisingly quiet even on full throttle. The four-stroke engine means it doesn’t guzzle petrol, hardly uses any oil and has low emissions, while the compact body and two-part **blower** tube mean it’s easier to store away than most petrol machines. What’s more, while many petrol **leaf** **blower**s weigh a ton, this one really doesn’t. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As well as single-purpose **leaf** **blower**s, you’ll also find garden vacuums which, instead of blowing leaves into a pile, suck them up into a collection bag, along with small hedge clippings and general garden mess. You can also find combo devices that do both jobs, switching between them with a change of nozzles or the flick of a switch – although some require more reconfiguration than others. Several of these machines will even mulch your leaves and clippings for you, cramming more into a bag and making it easier to get rid of your garden waste. With these garden vacuums and convertibles, you need plenty of power to suck the waste in, a solid, leak-proof bag and – ideally – a durable blade that can chomp through your leaves and clippings without taking any damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Leaf **blower**s use a powerful engine and fan to blow your leaves into a pile that you can then dispose of. They range from lightweight models you can use one-handed to the kind of heavyweight **blower**s you’ll see used by council workers and professional gardeners. These bigger options can clear larger areas and shift piles of damp leaves and debris off the ground with ease due to the greater power they impart. For the average-sized garden you won’t need anything that chunky, but buy something too weedy and you might find that it struggles to clear any soggy leaves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's heavy, at 4kg, and also noisy, dishing out around 83dB at full blast. Still, that’s nothing some ear protectors won’t block out. In fact, the only thing that really counts against it is that converting it from one form to another is a bit of a pain; you have to detach the **blower** tube and a fan guard then fit the bag and vacuum tube every time you switch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Worx WG583E has a similar design to the Flymo PowerVac and the Bosch UniversalGardenTidy, but with two big differences. First, the conversion from **blower** to vacuum and back feels easier and, second, there’s no trailing cable. It’s a beefy little beast as well, hurling out huge amounts of air on its highest power setting to send leaves flying across the lawn. Switch to vacuum mode and it’ll suck up great piles of them in seconds, then neatly shred them and compact them so that they barely fill the 35-litre collection bag. Big, damp leaves aren’t a problem, and it even tackled patches of moss thrown down by the local seagulls and conifer clippings from a hedge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Clearing up the autumn leaves with a rake is a tedious and time-consuming job. With a **leaf** **blower**, you can blow them all into a neat pile in a fraction of the time. You don’t even have to scoop up the leaves afterwards: choose a **blower** vac and you can simply suck them up like a vacuum cleaner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
