## 105 Tips to Turn Off Water From Hot Water Tank | turn off water gas hot water heater
-   Since the T&P relief valve is a safety device, and if this is the source of your leak, it's important that the valve is either replaced, or a plumber is called as soon as possible. A T&P relief valve issue does not necessarily mean you'll need to purchase a new **water** heater, but the leak does need to be addressed. Once you determine that the problem is coming from the T&P valve we'll do some additional troubleshooting to try to isolate the problem. If the solution is to replace the valve, we'll show you how. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This isolated the problem to within the tank. 3 yr old tank. Hot **water** present at the relief valve, drained the tank, virtually no sediment in the bottom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Be sure there isn’t any gas present. Smell around for a rotten egg smell and make sure all the gas valves are **off**. This would include a gas line from the **water** heater and the Pilot knob setting to the “**off**” position. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Washing Machines – Nearly all washing machines have two **water** inlet valves – one for hot **water** and one for cold **water**. If your laundry has a utility sink, you will find these valves there. You may find these valves in a recessed box in the wall near the machine. It is straightforward to turn these valves **off** before your machine washing is repaired. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Press down on the piezo ignitor striker. This could be a small button or look like the ignitor button on a grill. While pressing this button, you should be viewing the pilot window to ensure the pilot light is now lit. If it doesn’t light, press it again to try again, but be aware of how much time has passed between attempts to limit the amount of gas accumulating. If too much time has passed, release the red button and turn the pilot knob to **off** and wait for the gas to dissipate before trying again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do you have a **water** leak? Prevent/Reduce **water** damage by turning **off** the **water**. You can turn the **water** **off** at several places: 1) the leaking **water** heater, 2) the leaking plumbing fixture or 3) the main **water** line to the house. Follow these instructions as appropriate based on the location of your **water** leak. For your convenience, we have also provided an instructional video to walk you through it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you find your **water** heater leaking, you need to take action immediately. A leaking **water** heater may seem like a minor inconvenience, but in reality, it can quickly turn into a major problem. The average **water** heater has a 50-gallon tank and whenever **water** leaves the tank (drawn or leaking) cold **water** will quickly refill it to capacity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, turn the cold **water** supply back on by adjusting the valve you turned **off**. Next, go to the breaker panel and locate the **water** heater breaker switch. It should still be in the Off position. Move it into the On position. Go to the **water** heater and listen for any low sounds that indicate it is on and working. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Continue to hold down the button in step 5 for 30 to 60 seconds before slowly releasing it. Make sure the pilot light stays lit after releasing the button. Modern **water** heaters with a thermocouple device will shut **off** the gas valve **off** if the temperature is too low, so holding the button will keep the gas flowing to the pilot light until the thermocouple is ready to regulate it itself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many homeowners may not want to drain the **water** heater themselves if they are not experienced in these types of home repairs. If this is the case for you, you should stop after turning **off** the gas or electricity to your **water** heater and then call a professional plumber from FLAME Heating and Cooling at (888) 234-2340. Chances are, if you notice anything awry with your **water** heater, you will need a professional there to fix it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   @Inspectapedia Com Moderator, I was told that the pipe that was incorrectly installed was a dip tube. It was installed on the hot **water** line and shouldn't have been there. I guess it was put in by the manufacturer by mistake or by the distributor before it was shipped. I was told it isn't needed so the current setup does not have it installed. Lots of hot **water** so no issue there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Go to the breaker panel and flip the **water** heater’s breaker switch back into the On position. Turn the **water** supply valves for all three lines back on to allow **water** into and out of the tankless **water** heater. Make sure the **water** heater is set to your preferred temperature once it is back on. Turn on a hot **water** tap at the faucet furthest from the **water** heater to purge any trapped air from the system. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Several home appliances and fixtures run on some form of **water** supply. Washing machines, refrigerators, and dishwashers are some common appliances you can find in nearly every home. Toilets, showers, sink faucets, and bathtubs are some standard fixtures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Installed a new 30 gallon Hot Water tank. Has existing recirculating system. Cannot get continuous **water** flow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just had a new 80 gallon electric solar **water** heater installed. Very little hot **water** is getting to the fixtures. The pipe coming out of the **water** heater feels hot, but **water** coming out of the faucets are not. What is going on here? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After thaw from the historic polar vortex, the flow from the hot **water** faucets is very week. Cold **water** is weak at some faucets but strong from shower after removing the head. The hot **water** gets hot though. I would chalk it up to sediment but the hot side of the shower is as weak as the faucets. Got me stumped, - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For an electric hot **water** system, you need to turn on the circuit breaker or a labelled control switch. You should see the circuit breaker or switch as being clearly marked as Hot Water or maybe HWS and with a clear indication of ‘On’ and ‘Off’ direction. If you can’t find the circuit breaker or switch, you can contact us for guidance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Find the gas shut-**off** valve and turn it to the **off** position. When you do this, wait five minutes and check if there is any smell of gas. If there is a smell of gas, make sure the system is turned **off** and call us (you may have a leak). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a pressurised cylinder, you’ll need to turn **off** the stop valve or isolation valve on the cold feed pipe. You can turn **off** the mains stopcock if you can’t find this. As previously mentioned, the mains stopcock is usually located near the kitchen sink, perhaps in the cupboard underneath it. Note that closing the mains stopcock will also shut **off** the **water** to every tap and outlet in your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A hot **water** system may seem like a pretty technical piece of equipment, but getting it started is certainly one thing that you can manage on your own. There are a few little differences between the different types of hot **water** systems – i.e. gas, electric, solar – but there are some core steps common to all hot **water** systems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If it is a gas **water** heater, go to your thermostat and switch the dial on top into the **off** position. If you have an electric **water** heater, switch **off** the corresponding circuit breaker Turn **off** your **water** by locating the **water** valve and turning it as far as you can clockwise. Locate the drain valve at the bottom of your **water** heater’s tank Attach a hose to the drain valve and run the other end of the hose to somewhere that hot **water** can safely be drained Open one of the hot **water** faucets in your home to let air into the tank so that the hot **water** can begin being drained Flip the handle of the relief valve so that it is sticking straight up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our first problem was hot **water** was going into the toilet when it flushed. So we fixed a valve and soldered a pipe. Now theres no hot **water** coming into some showers and some sinks. And there is hot **water** coming out of the fridge. What happened? Help please! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let’s keep this short and simple: nothing ruins a home quite like **water** or fire. Water damage can result from frozen pipes, leaking supply lines, dripping **water** heaters, or other causes. Any damage will be greatly reduced by turning **off** the **water** before you go on vacation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have figured out that if I turn on the hot **water** at the laundry basin in the basement, it will restore pressure. .thoughts? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Locate the circuit breaker panel and identify the switch that corresponds to the tankless **water** heater. You can also use the control panel on the unit if there is one present, but it’s better to do this directly at the breaker. M ake sure the power is **off** by turning on hot **water** faucets and ensuring the **water** is not being heated. Once the power is **off** to the unit, close the three **water** valves connected to the tankless **water** heater (cold, hot, and primary). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In modern gas-fueled type **water** heaters feature valves that automatically close the supply of gas when the pilot light goes out. This involves a thermocouple device to detect if the pilot light is on via temperature and if it is not, then the voltage drops which in turn causes the gas valve to close. If you don’t have a modern **water** heater with this safety feature than when your pilot light goes out, there may be a gas leak and it could be dangerous to relight the pilot without clearing the gas first. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, turn on the hot **water** taps connected to the system. This should flush out any air in the system. Run the taps for around 1 or 2 minutes then leave **off**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Refrigerators – A fixture shut**off** valve or a small saddle valve is usually attached to the small mesh or copper supply tube connected to the fridge. This valve can be shut to turn **off** the **water** supply to the refrigerator. Sometimes, a refrigerator’s supply tube taps into a **water** supply line underneath the sink, somewhat close to the sink faucet supply tubes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, turn on a hot **water** tap connected to the system. This should flush out any air bubbles in the system and check there is **water** flowing through the **water** heater at the constant flow rate to operate the switch inside the heater that sends the power to the element . Run the taps for around 1 or 2 minutes and then turn **off**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using the cold **water** inlet control valve which is usually located at the bottom of the **water** heater if the storage tank is on ground level. This can be turned on by twisting the valve generally anti clockwise. With Solar systems that have tanks on the roof the valve is generally located up on the roof next to the storage tank . If you are not a person who is comfortable on roofs then do not attempt this . An alternative is to turn the **water** on or **off** at the **water** meter to the home instead . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Start by finding the breaker box for your home's electricity supply and turn **off** the line to your **water** heater. You can usually find the breaker box on an external wall. If you plan on flushing your **water** heater, now is a good time. Turn **off** the **water** supply valve, then switch **off** the air supply valve to allow the tank to fill with air. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the T&P valve opens intermittently, or even daily, the cause may be due to normal **water** pressure expansion. This can be resolved by installing an expansion tank. Read our extensive article on expansion tanks HERE. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turn the temperature knob to the lowest settings. Turn the knob that has “On”, “Off” and “Pilot” markings to the “**off**” position. This should have cut the gas and turned **off** the pilot light. To confirm, remove the panel and view in the little window to see if the pilot light is out. It may take a bit as there may be still some gas in the line that will burn away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   T&P Relief Valve The temperature & pressure relief valve (T&P relief valve) is a safety device required on all **water** heaters. When pressure builds within the tank to an unsafe level, the T&P valve relieves the tank pressure by opening the valve and allowing some of the **water** out of the tank. This will prevent the tank from bursting or exploding! You can find the T&P relief valve on the top of your **water** heater or on the side. Look for a copper or PVC pipe that runs down the side of the tank towards the floor. This is the T&P drain pipe and it connects to the relief valve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   - Ball valves have a lever type handle. Pull or turn the handle down to shut **off** the **water** supply. Dial Valve - Dial valves (also called gate valves) have a wheel that needs to be turned clockwise to turn **off** the **water** supply. Turn the dial until it stops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cold Water Inlet / Hot Water Outlet Repairs If you have a leak coming from the area where the cold **water** inlet or hot **water** outlet connects to the **water** heater, you may be able to fix it by tightening the connections with a pipe wrench. If tightening the connectors doesn't stop the leak, then you should replace the flex lines that supply the cold **water** (or hot **water**). The video below will show you how. Watch the Video - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Less than 5 minutes later my husband opened all faucets in both bathrooms and hot and cold **water** came back. Full pressure. Same for other faucets downstairs. What is causing this issue? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A pilot light is a small flame that is responsible for lighting the burner on a gas type **water** heater. If you have a gas stove, you might also have a pilot light for similar reasons. When you turn on your appliance, gas is released to the main burner and the pilot light ignites the gas to turn on the burner. An electric type **water** heater doesn’t have a pilot light as it uses an electric heater element and not gas to heat the unit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As with other types of hot **water** systems, you will need to turn on all of the hot **water** taps in your home. Next, open the cold **water** isolation valve fully. Allow the taps to run until **water** comes freely out of them. When **water** is flowing freely, this should mean all air has been expelled from the line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rather than leave it to the last minute before you head **off**, find it and turn it **off** to test if the **water** stops flowing in your house beforehand. Once you’re sure it all works, you can shut the **water** **off** just before you head **off** on vacation. You will be able to leave, safe in the knowledge that if something bursts or leaks while you’re away, the only **water** that can possibly run out is the **water** already in the lines. That’s a whole lot better than a continuous flow all the while you’re gone! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So if you have no hot **water**, then your heater is either out of fuel or is not turning on. But these devices can be tricky: you need a fast-enough **water** flow through the heater to activate it. So running the hot **water** very slowly or very weak building **water** pressure could be the problem. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After shutting the main **water** supply **off**, open up an outside faucet to allow the pressure to be relieved and excess **water** in the system to drain outside. Shut **off** the main **water** supply from the city, located in the **water** meter box, usually underground near the street. A street key is required for access. You can also call your local **water** department or our friendly staff for assistance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   During the deep freeze in texas the hot **water** stopped flowing to all faucets in my house (0 flow). The cold **water** flow is normal. I opened the TP relief valve briefly and hot **water** comes out of it. Also the cold inlet gets "more cold" when the valve closes. The hot **water** heater is electric, it is located in the garage, I have been running a space heater in the garage and the temperature there is now 50 degrees, any thoughts? I really need a shower - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a couple of situations when you should consider turning your **water** heater **off**. If your main **water** supply is turned **off** for any reason, it's best to shut down the **water** heater as a precaution until the supply resumes. Continuing to run your **water** heater when the tank isn't full could cause heat damage to the internal components. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are unable to keep the pilot light lit or it won’t light after repeated attempts, you may have a problem that a professional should fix. This could be the pilot light or thermocouple may need cleaning or there may be an issue with your gas line, either way having gas being released without a properly working burner or pilot light could be dangerous. Please call Wittmaier Plumbing at (856) 858-1965, immediately if you suspect a faulty **water** heater with gas or pressure issues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We have a solar hot **water** tank on the roof. We started having flow problems with the hot **water** about a month ago. (All taps are hot/cold mixers and the cold flow is fine.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Electrical solar **water** heaters have either an electrical booster element or a gas booster . Whether there is gas or electricity supplying the hot **water** boosting this will need to be turned on . Some electrical boosters are on 24hr power supply and have a switch conveniently located inside the home that may also have an indicator light . In most situations the booster will be on an **off** peak tariff and the switch will be located at the meter board for the home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Have we made it clear that you shouldn’t turn **off** your **water** heater when you go on vacation? We’re hoping so. But, if you’ve really got your knickers in a twist about the cost of leaving your **water** heater on, try this. Just turn your **water** heater’s temperature down to the lowest setting. This keeps your **water** from freezing, but also means you’re not wasting money keeping your **water** piping hot (hint: you should be keeping your **water** heater at 120 degrees for normal household use). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Locate the cold **water** supply pipe. This pipe leads from the main **water** line into the top of the **water** heater. When working properly, the **water** stops flowing when the tank is full, but because of the burst, the tank pushes the **water** out into the room as soon as it comes in from the pipe. Turn **off** the cold **water** supply line by twisting the valve clockwise until it cannot turn anymore. This will stop the flow of **water** that continues to fill the hot **water** heater and spill out from the burst seams. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a gas **water** heater, then you have a pilot light that is responsible for lighting the burner on a gas type **water** heater and you should know how to turn it **off** and on. There are a few reasons to turn **off** the pilot light on your **water** heater including the most common reasons: maintenance and vacancy. You might consider turning **off** the pilot light if you are leaving the house vacant for long periods of time. If you have a modern type **water** heater there are various features built in that may make it not necessary to turn of your pilot light such as “vacation” mode that will leave the light lit but cut of access to the gas to prevent a possible gas leak. However if you have an older type one, it’s important to know how a pilot light works to prevent igniting leaking gas as well as knowing how the **water** heater works to prevent turning on the heat to high and cause scalding burns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Furthermore, you'll have to wait for around an hour for the **water** heater to produce enough hot **water** for a bath or shower after you turn it back on, which is bad news if you're in a rush and don't leave enough time. Switching your **water** heater on also puts it under extra stress, which could cause it to malfunction if you do it again and again. However, there are some situations when you'll need to turn your **water** heater **off**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When i turn on the hot **water** in the kitchen it flows perfectly until the **water** turns hot. The other fixtures all have steady, regular hot **water**. If the hot tap was always slow i would suspect blockage but since it only slows when the **water** warms up. Any ideas? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How to Turn Off a Gas Water Heater Locate the valve on the gas supply line. The line is usually within a couple feet of your **water** heater. It's located near the bottom and connects to the gas control valve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the drain valve is open it should flush out debris. If it's been awhile since you've flushed your **water** heater tank, it's possible that your drain valve will clog. Here's how to address the clog. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The master bedroom bathroom shower had no hot **water** and only a trickle of cold. The separate garden tub in the same bathroom had only cold **water** and pressure was fine. The sink faucets only had cold **water** and pressure was fine. The guest bathroom had no **water** in at all in the tub/shower. There was cold **water** in the sink. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, flip the correct breaker switch back to the On position. Next, double-check the temperature your tankless **water** heater is set to. Most models have a digital screen that allows you to set the temperature. Finally, turn the three **water** supply valves and gas supply back on. Turn on the hot **water** tap at the faucet furthest from the **water** heater to purge any trapped air from your plumbing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is essential that you identify each of the two valves because they are always located very close to each other. Water heaters use color-coding to allow for such identification and avoid any mishaps. The cold **water** inlet valve has a blue handle, and the hot **water** outlet valve has a red handle. If it weren’t for this color coding, it would be difficult to identify the valve that you need to close. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re going to be gone for an extended period of time, you should get a house sitter. Even if it’s the neighbor’s kid who comes over to watch TV for a few hours, that’s better than nothing. A potential robber is going to look for activity in the home, and if they see lights on and hear noise, they’ll find somewhere else to pilfer. That being said, your house guest might need to use the hot **water** to run some dishes, take a shower, or otherwise. It’s best to leave the hot **water** heater on so you don’t have to give your guest instructions on how to do so. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As with an electric instantaneous system, you need to first turn **off** the circuit breaker that supplies the power. This should be clearly labelled at the power supply board. This could be named Main Switch Hot Water or HWS and will be a larger circuit breaker than others due to this system needing 415 volts which is three phase power to operate. Some older buildings can also have just one 415 volt main switch independent of three fuse bases located close to the switch . If you’re not sure of your hot **water** power switches then call us for help . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Otherwise the flow rate of **water** would be too fast for the **water** to be heated. In addition that that's the most common location for mineral scale clogging. The fact that hot **water** pressure is less than cold can be a confirmation of a scale clogging problem. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Showers & Bathtubs – Locating the shut**off** valves for showers and tubs can be a bit challenging. These are usually located in an access panel that can be found around the tub or shower. It often is on the other side of the wall or in the basement under the floor or in the ceiling access panel of the lower level. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remove any undamaged furniture, boxes or other salvageable items from the **water**-damaged area. Take photos of the items that are damaged; as well as the walls, floors and other fixtures that are covered or soaked with **water**. The photos will help your homeowner’s insurance company determine the cost to repair or replace the items. Use a wet/dry vacuum to remove the standing **water** from the area around the tank and any carpeted areas where the **water** has seeped. Run a dehumidifier, if you have one, to inhibit the growth of mold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the problem appears to be minor, and you have experience doing your own home plumbing repairs, you may choose to fix your leaking **water** heater yourself. But many homeowners are more comfortable hiring a plumber to make the repairs. The decision really depends on your comfort level and the complexity of the repairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, you need to switch **off** the gas supply to the heater. If you have a lever, turn it so that it's perpendicular to the supply line. If you have a knob, twist it clockwise until it won't go any further. Finally, turn the air relief valve **off** to let air inside the tank. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many different types of boilers such as combi, regular or system, so you will need to know whether it is direct feed or indirect feed. If you have a combi boiler then the hot **water** is supplied direct, so by closing the mains stop valve it will shut **off** the **water**. However, if you have a hot **water** cylinder this will be an indirect supply and there will be a valve on the pipe from the cold **water** storage cistern to the hot **water** cylinder. You will need to find this and turn it **off**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We recommend that you drain the **water** supply pipes entirely by getting rid of the **water** that would be standing in the plumbing system. It will ensure that no **water** spills out when the repair work is commenced. You can follow these simple steps to get this done: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turn **off** the gas valve. You may have a lever or a knob along the gas line from the **water** heater. Turn the valve to turn the gas going to the **water** heater **off**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sure we all make check-lists for when we are preparing to leave on vacation…but do we make checklists when we’re coming back home? If you aren’t one to turn your **water** heater **off** and on on a regular basis, then you’re very likely going to forget to turn it back on when you get home. This means you might have done two loads of laundry, a load of dishes, and only when you’ve gone to take your hot shower the next morning do you realize that your **water** heater has been **off** since you came home. Do yourself a favor and just leave the thing on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many people turn **off** the mains but forget to isolate other **water** supplies which are fed indirectly. Water stored in a cylinder or cistern in the loft for example would supply **water** to the bathroom and other parts of the home. To turn this **off** you’ll need to turn **off** the valve on the cylinder or cisterns outlet supply. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   @Inspectapedia Com Moderator, I will have that checked. The installer thinks that the pipes are mislabeled and is why there is no hot **water**. I doubt this could be the case but could there be a chance that this is the problem? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A majority of homes nowadays come equipped with branch valves along with the main valve. Branch valves can be used to turn **off** the **water** supply to specific branch **water** lines in the house. You can locate these valves along the branch **water** pipes in accessible utility areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We have all faced the annoying situations of a leaking pipe or plumbing fixture. While some of the common plumbing problems can be fixed without seeing professional help, others are beyond the DIY capabilities of homeowners. But, whether you call a plumber or not, you can quickly shut **off** the **water** supply without any tools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You will need to turn on the gas valve located generally at the bottom of the hot **water** system. The valve handle in picture below is in the **off** position .The valve handle should be in line with the pipe to be in the on position. For Modern style instantaneous **water** heaters that have a plug & lead connected to a power point at the **water** heater position, this will need turning on for the electronic ignition to work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I would look closely at the debris that is clogging those filters to see if you can identify it and therefore trace it to a source. There may be a different problem that can be found and corrected to stop producing the debris. For example a deteriorating anode in a **water** heater can produce a large volume of particulate debris. You might also check faucets trainers in the home to see if the debris is appearing everywhere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have the same problem everything worked fine before I changed out the faucets now when one shut **off** is **off** the other don't flow any **water** through in my bathroom faucets. When they are both open no issues. Any ideas? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On a Fortic cylinder, there probably won’t be a gate valve on the cold supply pipe, because the cold supply pipe is probably concealed under the cylinder’s foam insulation. If there is a gate valve on the hot outlet pipe, it’ll be on the pipe coming out of the very top of the hot **water** compartment. (Should there be two pipes lower than this in line with each other, then these are the flow and return from the boiler, which you can ignore.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You will need to locate the fixture shut**off** valve to shut the **water**. It can vary in location and appearance, but it will always be close to the appliance or fixture. While it is preferable that you turn **off** **water** at the problem’s source, if you cannot find the appliance or fixture shut**off** valve, you can turn **off** **water** non-locally as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1. If you have a gas **water** heater, turn the gas shut-**off** valve to OFF. If it’s an electric heater, turn the power switch to OFF, or turn your circuit breaker to the OFF position. If you’re not sure which kind you have, electric **water** heaters have AC power cables vs. a wide vent pipe on top. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. To avoid **water** damage to your home, drain the heater by attaching a standard garden hose to the drain faucet at the bottom of the unit. Place the other end of the hose in a lower location that can’t be damaged by hot rusty **water**. Then, twist the drain faucet counter-clockwise. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Turn the **water** supply clockwise, until it stops. Or, turn **off** the main **water** valve to your house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   4. Pull the pressure relief valve so air can enter the tank while it’s draining. You can achieve the same result by turning on any hot **water** faucet in your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   @Inspectapedia Com Moderator, Turns out there was a tube in one of the pipes. Once it was removed, hot **water** was flowing. Thanks for all the info. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As the tank is constantly refilling from the **water** heater leak, the area surrounding your tank will flood. Even a small amount of **water** leaking from your **water** heater can cause damage to your floors, sub-floors and walls. A significant flood could lead to hefty repair bills and damage to personal property. Water heater leaks can also be a health concern and lead to mold and mildew. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should follow a bottom-up approach when trying to turn **off** the **water** for plumbing repairs. Remember to always try to eliminate the **water** flow only where the repair is needed. It is crucial that you turn **off** the **water** before replacing or repairing any fixture or appliance, if you still feel even the the slightest shiver of uncertainty, call a plumber, there are everywhere and they **off**er you certain guarantees, just recently we had an awesome experience with a plumber in the Western Suburbs of Sydney, he saved us a tremendous amount of time! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your home may have isolation valves fitted. This means you can turn **off** the **water** supply without having to shut **off** other outlets. Isolating valves are either lever or screw head operated and are positioned on pipes leading up to the appliance such as a washing machine or dishwasher. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Simply draining the hot **water** tank might not fix the problem. For example, a chunk of mineral debris may have escaped the tank and is clogging a pipe, elbow, or valve. If during draining you found clots of mineral scale, that adds to the suspicion of a scale problem and blockage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the morning the hot **water** flow and pressure is fine. Also at lunch time and again when showering in the afternoon although sometimes the shower hot **water** pulses for 30 seconds until we get a steady flow. This is a recent development. However, in the evening the hot **water** flow to all taps often ceases altogether. Sometimes if the hot tap is left open the flow returns after a few minutes but normally we have to wait until a few hours later for it to return. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We suddenly lost hot **water** pressure [only] in the whole house, a month ago (15 year house 2 stories). My husband checked valves. He then ended up working on the **water** heater and we we had hot **water** again. Less than a week later, same thing. He worked on the **water** heater again and the hot **water** came back. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cold Water Inlet / Hot Water Outlet If your **water** heater has a pool of **water** on top, there's a good chance that the source of the leak is either the incoming **water** supply valve, cold **water** inlet, or the hot **water** outlet. Whenever there are pipe connections, there's a higher chance of a leak. Follow the cold and hot **water** pipes. Do you see any **water**? Are the fittings tight? Is there any leakage around the shut**off** valve on the cold **water** supply line? The fix to any of these problems could be pretty easy and you may be able to do it yourself. Here's what to do. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turn Off the Gas or Electricity to the Water Heater. For Gas Water Heaters: Turn the knob on top of the thermostat clockwise to the **off** position. The thermostat is located near the bottom of the **water** heater. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now set the system to your desired temperature. Once again, the recommended heat is 50 degrees for bathing and most instantaneous **water** heaters are internally pre -set to this temperature. Some installations can have separate temperature control pads installed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a combi boiler, you can turn **off** the hot **water** by turning **off** the mains stopcock. You can usually find the mains stopcock in the vicinity of the kitchen sink. It may be in the cupboard under the sink, or it may be on an adjacent pipe. Turning **off** mains stopcock will also shut **off** the **water** to every outlet in your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're concerned that you haven't turned your **water** heater **off** correctly, try turning on a faucet for a couple of minutes to ensure that the **water** runs cold. You can also try listening to the heater to check that it's silent. While a **water** heater should be reasonably quiet if it's in good working order, most make a low noise that will alert you if it’s still running. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This obviously means that even if you turn **off** the cold supply, the hot **water** cylinder will still be full of **water**. This is a safety precaution which prevents the immersion heaters or the boiler from trying to heat an empty cylinder. If you need to drain the hot **water** cylinder, take a look at the how-to guide for this task. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Could there be a valve/washer somewhere that heats up and expands and stops the hot **water** flow? (My very amateur diagnosis!) The solar tank manufacturer was quite sure (of course) that it was not a fault with the tank. Any advice. Thank you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although the majority of **water** heaters have a shut**off** valve on their **water** supply line, some do not. In this case, you may need to turn the **water** **off** using your home's main shut-**off** valve. This will shut down all the incoming **water** to your house, including the **water** supply to your **water** heater. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Only one shower can be used at a time or the pressure drops to a trickle. In fact if one is in use and hot **water** is turned ANYWHERE else in the house the same thing happens. There is a mixing valve in the system as well as a circ pump. Finally, the overalll pressure is slighter better in cold supply than hot **water**. Any ideas? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Toilets – Since toilets use only cold **water**, there is only one shut**off** valve located near the floor. It is below the **water** supply valve at the bottom of the **water** tank. The **water** supply valve is usually found near the tank’s bottom left side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The other time you should always turn **off** a **water** heater is if it starts leaking. This is a sign of a faulty valve or could indicate that your heater is simply too old and needs replacing. A **water** leak from your heater could cause damage to your walls or floors, so turn it **off** until you can get support from a professional plumber. You'll also need to turn **off** an electric **water** heater before you flush it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main shut**off** valve is usually located near the entrance of the main **water** line in utility space. If you cannot find it there, it will probably be located near the **water** meter on an outside wall. Finding this valve should not be difficult because it is quite large and is always located on the **water** meter’s house-side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you live in a cold climate, you definitely need to keep this first one in mind. Your **water** heater doesn’t just give you hot **water** for showers and laundry, it also prevents your **water** from freezing inside the pipes. Have you ever had frozen pipes before? It’s not pretty. Frozen pipes can cause cracks, leaks, or totally destroyed and burst pipes. Just avoid it altogether and keep your **water** heater on during vacation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’ve ever had a flooded home, you’ll never enjoy another vacation again unless you turn **off** the **water** at the mains next time you go away. In fact, it’s important for everyone to do this even for an overnight trip away. Why? There are plenty of good reasons. Here are three of the main ones: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are some signs to look for regarding **water** heaters that every homeowner should be aware of. When you notice these signs, the first thing you should do is turn **off** your **water** heater. If your **water** heater is making strange noises, overheating, or doing anything out of the ordinary, or if you smell gas anywhere in the house, these are all signs that you should turn it **off**. The longer you allow it, the more likely it is that the problem will get worse. The next step is to actually turn **off** the **water** heater. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you need to turn your **water** **off** for any reason, it's always safer to turn your **water** heater **off**, too. While many **water** heaters will be fine for a while without a **water** supply, reduced **water** pressure or a low **water** level inside the tank could cause the heater's components to overheat and burn. This could cause significant, expensive damage to your **water** heater. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   : If the T&P relief valve is in the position and **water** is flowing from the attached pipe, the valve is defective and needs to be replaced. Inspect the Valve: If the T&P relief valve is in the open position, it may be relieving excessive pressure from the tank (which is forcing the valve open). If this is the case, the leak is generally fixable, but the situation should be taken very seriously. We highly recommend calling a professional plumber. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
