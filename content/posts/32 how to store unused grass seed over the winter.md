## 32 Facts How To Store Unused Grass Seed Over The Winter | Grass Seed Storage Containers
-   The **seed** should begin to germinate within 5 to 10 days producing a stubble of **grass**. Mow the **grass** when it is 8 to 10cm high but removing only 2cm off the top until it begins to thicken. After 6 weeks, fertilise with a lawn fertiliser to help push it along again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the **seed**s are planted, never let them dry out. Seeds absorb oxygen as they germinate, so too much water can deprive them of this vital gas. Aim to keep the soil evenly moist. Seed starting soil is designed to provide both water retention and drainage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Avoiding the label on your bag can be a stupid choice. Consider saving the expiry/testing date on the label in the form of a note. Otherwise, when you decide to plant those leftover **seed**s finally, you may be wasting time watering, nurturing, and feeding them fertilizers – only to find out they have been dead for a while. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most importantly, make sure rodents, and insects cannot access your **seed** bag location. Irrespective of your **seed** type and age, these little creatures will make a delicious meal of it, especially in the winter season. Keeping these **seed** bags off the floor can help avoid rodents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Consider doing a germination test before you decide to use these leftover **seed**s finally. Place 8-12 **seed**s in a wet paper towel and wrap them up. Place this in a sealed bag for a week and then count the sprouted **seed**s after. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may have purchased some extra **grass** **seed** and left it in the shed. These **grass** **seed**s, whether planted or dormant, are yet alive. When exposed to the open air, they react with the environment. Even well-packed **seed**s that stay in the bag can undergo cellular changes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A sealed package type is the preferred option as moisture cannot leave or enter the package. The moisture amongst the **seed**s, even if released, will have no place to circulate except for in the bag itself. As long as the container is airtight and not of a porous material, the problem of humidity does not exist. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Storage solutions that do not offer any kind of airflow. Airflow is a priority when you have already opened your bag once in the past and are now saving up leftovers. It helps to capture and churn out existing moisture that may have built-up on the **seed**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the other hand, if additional moisture gets to your **seed**s, they are good as dead in a year. The fact that this only happens when the storage atmosphere is humid should tell you a lot. If the **seed**s are protected from humidity, they are also protected from losing or absorbing excess moisture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Seed banks store rare, exotic and heirloom **seed**s in refrigeration units or cryogenic chambers to ensure the survival and future of specific plant varieties. As a home gardener, you probably don’t have a cryogenic chamber in your garden shed, and you also probably don’t need to store thousands of **seed**s for decades. That said, the kitchen refrigerator or freezer are sufficient for storing leftover **seed**s, as long as they are stored properly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A moderately cool temperature condition will do a great deal in preserving the potency of **grass** **seed**s. Anything between 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit is the ideal temperature for stored **seed**s. In case your **seed**s are exposed to temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, they would ultimately die out within a month or two. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mowing or shredding can be done in late fall to eliminate dead material if desired; however, standing **grass**es will provide great beauty, as well as valuable wildlife habitat if left over the winter. Mowing or shredding in the spring should be done before **grass**es break dormancy. As your prairie **grass** planting matures, weed problems decrease, but you must be vigilant of perennial weeds that may persist. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have ever read the labels on **seed** packets, you’ve probably noticed their recommendations to store unused **seed**s in a cool, dry place. These instructions are a little vague.

Continue reading to learn more about storing **seed**s in the freezer and properly using **seed**s that are frozen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pour the lawn repair mix into a bucket and mix it thoroughly then, for small patches, broadcast the **seed** by hand using a cross hatch pattern to ensure an even coverage.

Hand-held and pusher fertiliser spreaders can also be used for large areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ventilate **seed**lings. One mistake that is easy to make is to leave the plastic dome over **seed**ling trays on a hot, sunny day.

On a sunny day, **seed**ling tray domes can actually steam your **seed**lings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The expiration date on the packet of the **seed**s is really the expiration test date. This means that the **seed**s in the pack that you got was tested for the germination rate. The rate is typically 90 to 100 percent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Seed must have good contact with the moist soil around it otherwise it just won’t germinate so a 1cm layer of sandy loam needs to be broadcast over the top. Use the back of the rake to spread this evenly. This will settle around each **seed** and not only ensure good contact for better germination but will also reduce the chances of it being stolen by birds and ants. If necessary, put up a temporary fence or rope the area off to keep cars, kids and pets from stomping all over it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, harden **seed**lings off before transplanting them outdoors. Sudden plunges into cold, damp conditions can cause enough stress on young plants to cause severe stunting or death. Make the transition gradual. Using a cold frame or cloche works well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some old **seed**s may germinate, some may die upon germination, and the rest won’t germinate at all. There are a bunch of factors that affect the potency of **grass** **seed**s. The temperature and humidity in the room, type of storage container, **seed** type, etc. will impact their shelf life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Based on the species of **seed**s, the **seed**’s moisture content can vary. 15 to 20 percent is considered an optimal moisture level for most **seed**s. It is your job to ensure that they don’t lose this moisture. A couple of weeks of exposure to humidity can extract the moisture and kill the **seed**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Avoid buying bags closer to their expiry date. Look for the freshest stock. This usually helps as not everyone lands up using all their **grass** **seed**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The key to success when freezing **seed**s is storing dry **seed**s in an airtight container and keeping consistent cool temperatures. Seeds should be thoroughly dried before being frozen, as the freezing process can cause moist **seed**s to crack or split. The dry **seed**s should then be placed in an airtight container to prevent them from absorbing any humidity and taking on any damaging moisture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’ve no idea how long the **grass** **seed**s that you have were stored, then the best you can do is to test how well the **grass** **seed**s can germinate yourself. What you can do is to get a few **seed**s and place them, inside moist paper towels. However, researchers at the University of California have a good guide on the timing of how long **grass** **seed**s should take to germinate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Large amounts of leftover **grass** **seed**s should be kept in a cloth bag. As cloth bags provide breathability, there is continuous airflow, and mold cannot form. Also, place a container of baking soda inside this bag for absorbing the moisture coming in through the pores. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Being a gardener, you would prefer to store **grass** **seed**s in the shed. Make sure to keep a constant check of the temperature in your shed. Whenever it’s too hot or too cold, you must make the required storage adjustments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the factors that most influences the germination rate of **seed**s is how they are stored. Like the plants that produce them, **seed**s come in all sorts of forms and sizes. They are also variable in their longevity. Since **seed** packets often contain more **seed**s than might be needed in one season, it’s important for gardeners to learn how to store **seed**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Over-sowing with a good quality lawn **seed** is the easiest and quickest way to cover a dead patch and prevent weeds. If the lawn is thick and strong, the weeds just don’t have any space to get a foothold. Although over-sowing can be done all year round, in WA it is far more effective to do it in the cooler months when heat and water is not as much of an issue so from autumn through to early spring is perfect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Any bump or clumps. Even the slightest of them can indicate expired **seed**s. Look thoroughly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In short, the longer your **seed**s are stored, the lower the chances they will germinate. It would also be wise to check your **seed**s from time to time. You can then change the location if needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Don’t settle for cheap **grass** **seed**s and of low-quality. Look for information such as – less than 0.5% weeds , no more than 2% other crops, less than 2% filler material, no noxious weeds, etc. These **grass** **seed**s are purer and can last in storage for longer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Don’t just keep them in your garage or garden shed. Consider keeping them in an indoor closet or your basement. As long as the location is dry and free of moisture, **grass** **seed**s can be stored for longer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As with most products, there are good lawn repair **seed**s and better lawn repair **seed**s. The best to buy is one that contains three things – lawn **seed**, lawn fertiliser with trace elements and a wetting agent. These have everything that is needed without having to buy other products to ensure a great result. In general, a 2kg pack will cover an area of up to 40m² but any that is unused can be stored for future bare patches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
