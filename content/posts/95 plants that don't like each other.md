## 95 Tips for Plants That Don'T Like Each Other | Tomato Companion Plants
-   An**other** good rule of thumb to follow, if a plant’s description references “wildflower,” or has “weed” in the name, just beware. Also watch for the words: “vigorous spreader” or “aggressive.” Do your research and ask lots of questions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thanks to onions, beets are protected from aphids, flea beetles, and munching rabbits and **other** small animals. And beets can help protect onions from thrips. Broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kohlrabi, kale, and **other** brassicas. Onions repel cabbage loopers, cabbage worms, flea beetles, and cabbage maggots, all of which like to munch on cabbage family members such as broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not only do onions repel pests that may want to munch on your lettuce, but they are also an effective use of space—lettuce has relatively shallow roots, leaving plenty of room for onions to bulb up underground. Peppers. Alliums such as onions and garlic can deter the aphids that like to feed on pepper **plants**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A member of the Asparagus family, Yucca has bright green stiff leaves that add a sense of structure and drama to any space. The geometric layout can be very eye-catching, especially when set against softer-looking **plants**. Native to the arid deserts of North America, the Yucca will prove itself a survivor regardless of how little water it gets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Years ago I just couldn’t resist when someone in our garden club was giving it away. It spread into the grass and it encroached on neighboring **plants**. What a mess and an**other** pain to get rid of. Honestly though, I look at the picture below and think what a pretty plant and it looks so good with the Shasta daisies, I want some. Fight that urge, you crazy woman! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Buckwheat – Fixes calcium in the soil, and makes an exceptionally good green manure plant. Buckwheat absorbs nutrients that are not available to **other** **plants**, and can then be composted or tilled under, releasing those nutrients in accessible forms. Buckwheat flowers are attractive to pollinators as well as beneficial predatory insects: hover flies, pirate bugs, tachinid flies, and ladybird beetles. It provides shelter for ground beetles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The foliage on Lamb’s Ear is pretty and it adds a cool texture element to a flower bed. That being said, once it starts flowering, it gets sort of ratty looking, and the flowers are not all that attractive. It just takes up too much real estate in the flower garden and has even spread to our lawn. Lambs Ear is a known bee magnet which is good, but there are tons of **other** prettier flowers that are bee magnets too. I say skip on the lamb’s ear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ostrich Fern is an**other** plant that spreads by underground runners and definitely one of those **plants** not to grow in your garden. If you have a damp wooded area where nothing else will grow and you’re never going to want to plant anything else there, perhaps Ostrich Ferns would be okay. But, proceed with caution! For **other** shady areas where you would like ferns, try Maidenhair Fern or Japanese Painted Fern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Aloe genus contains over 560 species of **plants**, many of which are easy to care for and hard to kill. Aloes are succulents, and like most succulents, they love sun and store their water in their leaves. Keeping that in mind, avoiding overwatering and giving them bright light will ensure these **plants** are very difficult to kill. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dumbcanes have thick central stems that hold enough water to keep the leaves glossy and lush for days to weeks on end. In fact, the biggest mistake you can make with these **plants** is giving them too much water. They survive low light well and don’t need repotting or pruning often, limiting the need for maintenance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Companion planting onions and asparagus creates competition for the same nutrients—meaning you’ll stunt the growth of one or both of your crops. Sage. Sage tends to enjoy different growing conditions from onions, which can mean it’s tricky to get the growing conditions right for both **plants** if planted together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All in all, with the growing rise in home gardening technology and new techniques, the polytunnel is arguably one of the best places to grow your crops. Here, you can grow two companion **plants** and harvest them within the shortest time possible. We have come a long way from traditional planting methods! As a garden farmer, you’ll definitely feel proud when you start harvesting healthy vegetables and fruits at a low cost, all from using the right resources. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nasturtium – These **plants** make a good trap crop for aphids, and they deter whiteflies, cucumber beetles, squash beetles, Colorado potato beetles, and Mexican bean beetles. It is a good companion for Brassicas, cucumbers, melons, radishes, and tomatoes. Because they grow close to the ground, nasturtiums provide good cover for ground beetles and spiders. The flowers attract a variety of pollinators, and is good for the bees. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Beans (both pole beans and bush beans), peas, and **other** legumes. Onions can kill the helpful bacteria that grows on bean, pea, and **other** legume roots, stunting the growth. Since these legume **plants** fix nitrogen to the soil and onions are heavy nitrogen feeders, onions are a great option to plant after pulling your legume **plants**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I do have to say my sister grows the red Lucifer variety of Crocosmia in her Colorado Zone 5 garden and it is gorgeous. And, it’s a hummingbird magnet. That still doesn’t sway me. I’ve have lots of **other** **plants** that the hummers love. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is also important to look at the nutrients individual **plants** need. A companion plant may need less of one specific nutrient while its neighbor desperately needs it to thrive. In this case, companion planting would eliminate the competition between the two **plants**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just so you don’t think I’m being unfair, I actually have more royal standard hosta **plants**, than I care to count, in my current shade garden. And, they will be at the curb this spring with a ‘free’ sign on them. Lol! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In general, onions are an excellent companion plant for almost every spot in the garden. Their strong scent works as an excellent pest repellant. Interplanted onions can help keep many pests at bay because the strong odor hides the scent of **other** **plants** that insects might want to devour. We’ve had good results using onions to deter aphids, Japanese beetles, flea beetles, rabbits, and **other** pests. Here are the BEST onion companion **plants**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Nasturtiums help prevent insects, particularly aphids, from attacking **other** **plants**. Aphids love Nasturtiums and will surround them instead of their neighboring **plants**.

There are also several benefits that come with companion planting in the UK, some of which we’ll carefully take you through. But first, what is companion planting? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Apparently, it’s easier to water and care for the **plants** in such a system, but you’d have to use many chemicals to control the pests. Let’s use the example of tomatoes. Here, every tomato hornworm in the area will be attracted to your farm. However, if you plant them with lettuce, you’ll experience some exciting findings. The tomato offers the right amount of shade for the salad, while the latter repels all tomato pests. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Companion planting has a long history, but the methods of planting **plants** for beneficial interaction are not always well documented in texts. In many situations, they are created from oral tradition, front porch musings and family recommendations. Despite these historical traditions and the science of horticultural farming, we often practice companion planting simply because it’s a practical planting method! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Alliums such as onions and garlic can deter the aphids that like to feed on pepper **plants**. Tomatoes. The strong scent of onions can make the scent of tomatoes undetectable to insects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Friends: Corn loves veggies that fix nitrogen in the soil—like green beans. Cornstalks also make a great trellis for vining or trailing **plants** including beans, cucumbers, peas, pumpkins, and melons. Zucchini is a good companion plant when planted among corn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are several perennials that **other**s would call invasive or aggressive, but I did not include them on my list because I don’t have a problem with weeding them out and I like them enough that they are worth the trouble. These **plants** include: bee balm, lamium, ajuga, cherry bell campanula (and a few **other** varieties) and agastache. Also, read through the comments below and you’ll hear about reader’s experiences. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An**other** South African succulent, Haworthia is a very hardy plant. Plants in this genus come in many forms, usually covered with white bumps that are often arranged as stripes, giving them the common name Zebra Plant. Some are also commonly confused with Aloes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sunflower – Sunflowers planted near rows of corn are said to increase yields. Use sunflowers as beacons to attract pollinators to **other** crops, particularly squash and pumpkins, and any **other** crop that requires insect pollination. Sunflowers are attractive to a host of wild and domestic bees, and also ladybird beetles, which prey on aphids. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Plus, ditch lilies take up so much space and there are so many **other** beautiful, cultivar and hybrid daylilies that you could use in place of ditch lilies. In my first garden makeover at our current home, I dug dozens of ditch lilies out of most all the flower beds that I made over. They are fine along roadsides in ditches, just not in a residential setting. Just my opinion, but I’m curious if you share it? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dill – Dill improves the health of cabbages and **other** Brassicas, and is a very good companion for corn, cucumbers, lettuce, and onions. Avoid planting near carrots and tomatoes. Dill attracts ladybird beetles, parasitoid wasps, hoverflies, bees, and garden spiders, making it one of the most useful companion planting candidates. See also Companion Planting with Umbelifers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Are you looking for a new method of gardening? If so, then companion planting is one direction that you should look into. As the home gardening sector continues to grow, different green-thumbed individuals are coming up with all kinds of new methods, including this innovative technique. With companion planting here in the UK, you can plant different kinds of **plants** and harvest them together and at the right time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Through the centuries, we’ve cultivated our gardens and noticed that certain **plants** grow well together. Some vegetables, flowers, and herbs are good for the soil and each **other**! We’ve also seen that **other**s repel pests. All in all, companion planting offers a good blueprint for a much-improved garden yield. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Trap Cropping: Companion planting is the ultimate organic pest management system. Some **plants** helps repel unwanted pests, while **other**s can be used to lure pests away from the garden. This is referred to as trap cropping. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Mint repels both ants and cabbage moths. Nasturtiums – Nasturtiums help prevent insects, particularly aphids, from attacking **other** **plants**. Aphids love Nasturtiums and will surround them instead of their neighboring **plants**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Friends: Corn and beans grow well together because beans will grow up the cornstalks, which means you won’t have to build them a trellis. Beans also fix nitrogen in the soil, which is good for the corn. Marigolds, nasturtiums, rosemary, and summer savory repel bean beetles, and summer savory improves growth rate and flavor. Other companions include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and **other** members of the cabbage family along with cucumbers, peas, potatoes, and radishes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I inherited some Creeping Bellflower with our current home and I cannot get rid of it. I even went so far as to dig up the entire small area where it was growing and by the end of summer it was back. They have this evil long tap root that breaks off with a sneeze. I’m stubborn though, so I’ll keep at it. There are **other** varieties of campanula that are quite aggressive too, so just be careful and do your research before you purchase campanula. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The only concern you may face with these **plants** is stretching. While they can survive lower light areas, the denser leaves may begin to grow further apart as the plant looks for a light source. Beyond that, you will find very few problems with these reliable **plants** that last for years on end. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The needs of these **plants** are slightly different from **other** house**plants**. They need more direct light to replicate the conditions in their native habitats and don’t respond well to overwatering. However, with these conditions in mind, they will live for many years with little fuss. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here, the bean seeds feed the corn with nitrogen and provide shade for the roots. The corn, on the **other** hand, provides them with something easy for climbing. It repels pests and encourages growth! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like many **plants** in the Philodendron genus, this species is one of the easiest to care for. They continue to look their best when lacking watering or light and don’t encounter many problems with pests or diseases. They can also handle low humidity areas well and are easy to propagate – simply pop a piece of the vine in water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cosmos - This annual provides food and habitat to parasitic wasps, tachinid flies, lacewings, hoverflies, minute pirate bugs, spiders, ladybird beetles, big-eyed bugs, damsel bugs, and **other** predatory insects. Cosmos can be direct sown from early March to the end of June in our region so that it blooms continuously throughout the summer. Deadhead spent flowers to extend each plant's bloom time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, there are those **plants** that cannot ‘stand’ each **other**. Planting such crops together makes them grow poorly with stunted growth and poor nutrients. Others won’t even get the privilege of enjoying the sun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Celeriac, unlike **other** vegetables, is not an easy plant to grow. It requires rich water-retentive, fertile soils. Grow it together with **other** herbs such as brassicas, cucumbers and bush beans to get high yields. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This type of vegetable requires high levels of nitrogen in the soil. Therefore, you should plant it together with **plants** such as beans and peas. To repel pests, you could also use onions or garlic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Top of the list of unkillable house**plants** has to go to the ever-popular Snake Plant, also known as M**other**-In-Law’s Tongue. This plant is one of the most resilient around, tolerating almost any light conditions from low light to direct sun. They can also go for weeks without watering and will only really struggle when they receive too much water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll also find that a polytunnel is not fixed to the ground like a greenhouse. Hence, you can move it from one point to an**other**, depending on what suits you best. Interestingly, it’s much easier to move your polytunnel than to replace the soil in a greenhouse! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many of you will be familiar with the Mimosa plant, that recoils and curls up if you touch it. Yeah, all **plants** wish they could do that. They don’t want to be touched. They don’t know what your intentions are. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A colorful foliage plant with fascinating textured leaves, Begonias are great options for indoor growth. They also have the ability to flower indoors, but will only do so under near-perfect conditions. However, if you’re happy to keep them just for their colorful leaves, you’ll have no trouble growing these stunning **plants** indoors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Beets. Thanks to onions, beets are protected from aphids, flea beetles, and munching rabbits and **other** small animals. And beets can help protect onions from thrips. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s interesting to see what’s considered invasive or aggressive in different areas of the country or different gardening zones. I recommend doing your homework up front and planning what **plants** you want to purchase for your gardens. Google invasive **plants** in your state and see what comes up and make sure you don’t include those. Also, be sure to read the comments section to see what **other** **plants** readers have listed as **plants** not to grow in your garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Strawberry – These little **plants** respond strongly to nearby **plants**. Couple them with beans, borage, garlic, lettuce, onions, peas, spinach, and thyme. Avoid Brassicas, fennel, and kohlrabi. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let’s talk about a few definitions before we begin. Definitions for the terms invasive and aggressive are somewhat intertwined. For purposes of this post, invasive means: “tending to spread prolifically and undesirably or harmfully” taken straight from the Oxford Dictionary. Aggressive means: a plant that spreads faster than preferred, or into an area of your garden where it’s not wanted (paraphrased from Chicago Botanic Garden website). DNR websites for states have their own definition of what invasive **plants** and aggressive **plants** mean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Onions can kill the helpful bacteria that grows on bean, pea, and **other** legume roots, stunting the growth. Since these legume **plants** fix nitrogen to the soil and onions are heavy nitrogen feeders, onions are a great option to plant after pulling your legume **plants**. Asparagus. Companion planting onions and asparagus creates competition for the same nutrients—meaning you’ll stunt the growth of one or both of your crops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An**other** traditional 70s houseplant making a comeback in a big way is the Anthurium. Part of the same plant family is the Peace Lily, it has similarly shaped spadix flowers surrounded by modified leaves. However, what sets these **plants** apart is the colors of these modified leaves, from bright and captivating red to soft blush pink and almost everything in between. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Friends: Basil and tomatoes were made to go together, not only in sauces but in the garden, too. This herb helps tomatoes produce greater yields and it repels both flies and mosquitoes. Marigolds are an**other** good companion, repelling nematodes and **other** garden pests. Other friends to tomatoes include asparagus, carrots, celery, the onion family, lettuce, parsley, and spinach. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Asparagus, beans, beets, bell peppers, cabbage, chili peppers, eggplant, marigolds, oregano, potatoes, tomatoes Rue When basil is grown about 1 foot from tomato **plants**, it will increase the tomatoes yield. It also improves the flavor of lettuce. Beans - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Friends: Plant mint among your lettuce to keep away the slugs that feed on lettuce leaves, or plant chives and garlic to repel aphids. Beans, beets, broccoli, carrots, corn, peas, radishes, and marigolds also work as good companion **plants**. Marigolds attract aphid-eating ladybugs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These two **plants** are a great addition to any garden. They both produce large green leaves that can be added to salads and a variety of tasty recipes. You can grow your spinach and Swiss chard together with passion fruit, cauliflower, and brassicas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Native purists will get upset when I refer to some natives as being invasive or aggressive. Again, **plants** grow differently in different soils and climates. I’m simply referring to my experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Perennial **plants** are a good investment. Plant once and have flowers that bloom for years. However, some **plants** that seem innocent take over the garden and quickly spiral out of control. Others bloom for such a short time that they don’t seem worth the trouble. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Natural Supports – Plants and flowers that grow tall and strong will lend themselves as natural, organic supports to crops that grow low or sprawl. An example of this would be planting tall sunflowers next to cucumbers or snap peas. The sprawling crops can use the taller **plants** as a trellis. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dragon Tree is the common name for some members of the Dracaena genus. Like Yucca, Dracaena is from the Asparagus family and you really can see the resemblance. These **plants** are characterized by straight and usually narrow central stems and long, striped leaves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A good example is found when you need to water your **plants**. With companion planting, you can do it all at the same time. An**other** essential point is that **plants** are healthier when varieties are grown together. When nitrogenous **plants** like beans are planted together with corn, this ensures that your corn grows to higher heights, and it will be a lot tastier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of the **plants** that made my list are also readily available at local gardening centers too. So how on earth is a novice gardener, or even a seasoned gardener like me, supposed to avoid ending up with perennials that will take over your garden. My best advice is just to read up and ask questions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sage tends to enjoy different growing conditions from onions, which can mean it’s tricky to get the growing conditions right for both **plants** if planted together. Other onion family **plants** (garlic, leeks, shallots, chives, scallions). Many of the pests that will attack one onion-family crop will easily jump or fly to a close-by onion family crop, so give them some space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Isn’t companion planting exciting and potentially very rewarding? From this article, we can draw some important conclusions. First, planting two ‘friendly’ **plants** together saves you on-farm space, as well as on the additional costs of gardening. For instance, the cost of buying items like fertilizers and tools will be greatly reduced. Also, it makes gardening a lot easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Onions repel cabbage loopers, cabbage worms, flea beetles, and cabbage maggots, all of which like to munch on cabbage family members such as broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts. Cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, and **other** melons. Onion **plants** can repel pests that attack cantaloupe **plants** and **other** melons. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An**other** ‘plant it and forget it’ favorite is the ZZ Plant. Featuring glossy green leaves on upright ‘stems’, these interesting **plants** have a unique look that adds a modern touch to any interior design. They are also incredibly easy to take care of, preferring to be left alone than fussed over. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many years ago when I first started dabbling in gardening for myself, I was always on the lookout for free **plants** and people were always willing to give away their extras once they knew I would take them. Talk about gullible!!! There’s a reason why people give **plants** away. Please learn from my mistakes (yes that’s plural, I wasn’t a fast learner) and don’t make space in your garden for these 14 Plants Not to Grow In Your Garden, even if they are free and even if you have lots of space to fill like I did. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just a little disclaimer here. We have lots and lots of readers from gardening zones 3 through 10 here at Gingham Gardens. Pretty cool, right? What is considered invasive, aggressive or a vigorous spreader here in my zone 4b garden is not necessarily so in your gardening zone. See my advice at the end of the post for determining the **plants** you don’t want in your gardens. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The popular Pothos is one of the most widely purchased and beloved house**plants** around the world. The cascading vines grow quickly and feature an interesting range of patterns and colors across the many cultivars. With so many varieties, they have become a hot collector’s item, popular among newbies and experienced plant parents alike. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bush & Pole beans – All beans fix nitrogen in the soil. Plant with Brassicas, carrots, celery, chard, corn, cucumber, eggplant, peas, potatoes, radish, and strawberries. Avoid planting near chives, garlic, leeks, and onions. Pole beans and beets stunt each **other**’s growth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We have been asked to clarify what we mean by “near” in terms of what makes a good or bad neighbour. This differs according to the context. Plants that are said to repel pest insects need to be planted quite close to the crops they are meant to protect. But **plants** like dill, that are generally attractive to predatory insects, can be planted anywhere in the garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – A plant’s root system can easily affect the soil it is in. Plants with long taproots like parsnips and carrots will lift nutrients from the depths of the soil. The nutrients can then benefit those **plants** with shallow root systems. Nitrogen is also important to many **plants**, and some, such as peas and beans, actually help to draw nitrogen in, making it more available in the soil for the **plants** that need it. Prevent Weeds – Alternating upright **plants** and sprawling ones can create a thicker cover across the majority of the open land in your garden area, which will ultimately prevent weeds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – One of the best companion **plants** out there, marigolds help virtually any vegetable. They are particularly helpful for tomatoes, repelling the nematodes that like to attack the roots of vegetables. Mint – Mint repels both ants and cabbage moths. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Garlic – Planting garlic near roses will help to repel aphids. Because of its sulfur compounds, it may also help repel whiteflies, Japanese beetles, root maggots, carrot rust fly, and **other** pests. Garlic, made into a tea, or spray, will act as a systemic pesticide, drawing up into the cells of the **plants**. It’s a good companion for beets, Brassicas, celery, lettuce, potatoes, strawberries, and tomatoes. Avoid planting it near peas or beans of any kind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Today, many **plants** can be planted together. A good example is tomatoes and carrots. If you have a small garden, planting these two crops is an intelligent and nutritious gardening method. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Snow-on-the-Mountain (aegopodium podagraria) – a/k/a Bishop’s Weed or Gout Weed – Hands Down this plant wins first prize of the Worst Plants to Grow In Your Yard! Ugh, I came to hate this stuff. I know hate is a pretty strong emotion when we’re talking about **plants**, but if you’ve ever tried to eradicate this “weed” from your garden, you know exactly what I mean. When someone offered me some, I thought, what a pretty ground cover with it’s variegated leaves. Ground cover indeed and it also covered everything in its path. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Climbing beans, cucumber, marjoram, peas, pumpkins, squash, sunflowers, zucchini Tomatoes Tomato worms and corn earworms like both **plants**. Beans and peas supply nitrogen. Onions - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fennel – Not a companion for any garden food plant, fennel will actually inhibit growth in bush beans, kohlrabi, tomatoes, and **other**s. Plant it, but keep it out of the veggie garden. Fennel attracts hoverflies, ladybird beetles, parasitic wasps, and tachinid flies, so it's a kind of beneficial insect magnet. It's also an important food plant for swallowtail butterfly caterpillars. See also Companion Planting with Umbelifers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Crocosmia (montbretia) – Ugh, definitely not a favorite of mine. When we moved into our current home, there were Crocosmia **plants** everywhere! I dug so much of this stuff out and I’m still dealing with it popping up four years later. I think this is an**other** plant that just takes up so much space and doesn’t bloom long enough to be worth the effort of trying to clean up after it. The blooms are interesting, but mostly just meh. Again, there are so many **other** perennials that are prettier and bloom longer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even if you’re okay with having vigorous spreaders in your gardens, just know they can easily take over an entire flower bed and sm**other** out **other** less vigorous flowers. Please though, if you are not planning on staying in your current home forever, don’t plant any of these **plants**. I happen to be one of the unlucky ones that lots of these naughty **plants** came with the house we purchased. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Companion planting is a great way to ensure you have a garden that will grow healthy **plants** and produce large bounties. A lot of work goes into maintaining a productive garden, so it is worth the time, effort and research it takes to grow like-minded **plants** that will help each **other** out. And with Gilmour’s guide to companion planting, we take some of the guesswork out of the process for you! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Companion planting assists in pollination and controlling pests and helps you make the best use of your gardening space. All of these factors eventually go a long way in increasing your crop productivity. Nowadays, most large-scale farms grow **plants** in a mono-crop type of system. This means that you’ll probably find large tracts of fields containing only a single crop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Alternating upright **plants** and sprawling ones can create a thicker cover across the majority of the open land in your garden area, which will ultimately prevent weeds. Regulate Shade & Wind – Too much sun can damage tender and fragile **plants**. Companion planting can help prevent this by offering shelter as taller **plants** protect smaller ones. The same is true for wind. The taller and larger **plants** will offer protection from harsh winds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   New gardeners are so excited to get free **plants** that they don’t stop to think about how these freebies are going to look in their gardens in 2 or 3 years. In my opinion, royal standard hostas (the very common plain green hostas) just aren’t all that pretty. And, they are definitely the most prolific hosta out there. After all, that’s why they are free. Plus, slugs are so happy when you add royal standard hostas to your garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Companion **plants** are **plants** that complement one an**other** in terms of growth and production. For example, one plant may attract an insect that might protect a companion plant.

-   These are some of the oldest **plants** on earth. They can grow almost anywhere, but you need to choose their best companion plant to get the best out of your mushrooms. They go well with vegetables such as turnips, Brussels sprouts, turnips and fruit trees, and cabbage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Dill and basil are natural protectants for tomato **plants**, keeping away the dreaded hornworm. Marigolds – One of the best companion **plants** out there, marigolds help virtually any vegetable. They are particularly helpful for tomatoes, repelling the nematodes that like to attack the roots of vegetables. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Despite the common name, this popular gifting plant is not bamboo at all. It is actually a member of the Dracaena genus, related to the Dragon Tree and **other** hardy house**plants**. The stems are manipulated into interesting shapes to create a modern and unique décor feature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – An**other** helpful herb in the garden, sage can protect from cabbage moths. Zinnias – Zinnias are excellent companion **plants** and attract ladybugs into the garden. Ladybugs are known to control unwanted pests like cabbage flies. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tomatoes – An**other** sensitive plant when it comes to companions, tomatoes benefit from asparagus, basil, beans, borage, carrots, celery, chives, collards, cucumber, garlic, lettuce, marigold, mint, nasturtium, onion, parsley, and peppers. Avoid planting alongside Brassicas and dill. Corn will attract tomato pests, and kohlrabi will stunt tomatoes’ growth. Potatoes may spread blight to tomatoes, so keep them apart. Do no plant tomatoes near walnut trees. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many benefits to companion planting in the UK. For instance, tomatoes taste better when planted together with basil. Similarly, harvesting them to make a lovely salad is easy because they are located next to each **other**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Disclaimer #2: Just because your favourite plant is on this list doesn’t mean it’s “bad” or shouldn’t be planted. This list is intended for beginner gardeners who aren’t able to keep up with these presumably low-maintence **plants** when they get out of hand. I want to spare beginner gardeners some heartache until they gain the knowledge and experience to keep up with more aggressive **plants**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wow, I feel so bad for unnecessarily repotting so many **plants**. Sorry, guys. I had no idea I scared you so much. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
