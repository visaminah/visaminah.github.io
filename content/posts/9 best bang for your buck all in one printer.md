## 9 Fun Facts Best Bang For Your Buck All In One Printer | Canon Pixma Ts302
-   The **best** resin 3D **printer**s are capable of making high resolution models by curing a liquid resin using a UV light source. This MSLA process uses a masking LCD to selectively block the UV light on a pixel-by-pixel basis, allowing these **printer**s to create models that have a resolution of down to .035mm on the XY axes. This high resolution comes at a price, as parts made on a resin 3D **printer** require post-processing after printing, and UV resin requires caution when handling. Because resin requires gloves and a mask to handle, we recommend beginners or anyone with young kids consider one of the FDM (fusion deposit modeling) **printer**s on our overall **best** 3D **printer**s page . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1. Anycubic Photon M3 Best Resin 3D Printer Overall Specifications Technology: Resin Build Volume: 163 x 102 x 180mm LCD Resolution: 4098 x 2560 LCD Size: 7.6-inch XY Axis Resolution: .04mm Connectivity: USB Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at GeekBuying (opens in new tab) View at Walmart (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Detailed 4K+ prints + Fast 2 second per layer exposure time + Effortless print removal + Roomy build volume for a small **printer** Reasons to avoid - 4-bolt leveling platform - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike the Phrozen Sonic Mini 4K, which is very competitive in this area, the Mars 3 Pro doesn’t suffer from any build quality issues.It’s easy to level and even has a built-in air purifier that, in our tests, mitigated but did not completely remove the resin odor that all MSLA **printer**s emit. With a price in the $300 - $350 range, this isn’t the cheapest resin **printer** on the market, but it offers great quality output and strong usability for the money. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mono or RGB LCD? The type of masking LCD on your resin 3D **printer** can have the single largest impact on your overall print speed. Because they are commonly used in other electronics, RGB masking LCDs are cheaper, but slower because they don’t allow UV light to pass through efficiently and need more exposure time per layer. For example, the RGB LCD on the Creality LD-002R requires 9 seconds per layer, while the Mono LCD on the Elegoo Mars 2 Pro requires only 2.2 seconds per layer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We enjoyed navigating through the Mighty 8K’s menus, thanks to its large and easy-to-use touch screen display. There’s little need to consult the manual – the **printer** walks you through an onboard tutorial to handle leveling and your first test print. Want to rerun a test file at a different exposure? No problem – the Sonic Mighty 8k will let you change exposure settings and more right inside the **printer**. I found this extremely helpful while dialing in a new resin. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With a retail price of $399.99, the Creality Halot-One Plus easily outperforms less expensive **printer**s like the last-generation Creality LD-002R resin **printer** as well as comparably priced **printer**s like the Elegoo Mars 3 . Hobbyists who are looking for the most performance for their dollar should consider the feature-rich Halot-One Plus. Professionals interested in a more streamlined software interface and less concerned about price should consider a higher-end machine like the Prusa SL1S . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As 3D printing continues to become cheaper and more accessible, resin 3D **printer**s have become a popular choice for anyone interested in making highly-detailed models that wouldn’t be feasible using a filament-fed, FDM 3D **printer**. These MSLA (Masked Stereolithography) resin 3D **printer**s typically only have a single axis of motion, and this simple mechanical system means these machines can regularly be found for less than $300. With so many models on the market, we’ve made this list to help you find the **best** resin 3D **printer** for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re ready to throw some serious cash down for a decent-sized resin 3D **printer** with quality that will knock your socks off, the Phrozen Sonic Mighty 8K is here for you. Its roomy 218 x 123 mm build plate can accommodate an army of gaming miniatures or a gift-worthy superhero statue. Priced at $899, this **printer** is more of an investment than similarly-sized machines. But in return, you get crispy details, prints that practically slide off the build plate, a built-in webcam and a machine that’s WiFi ready. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Phrozen Sonic Mighty 8K size is closer to what we see in FDM **printer**s, without being so large that it dominates your workshop. The quality and extra wiggle room would be a worthwhile investment for someone running an Esty shop or an artist wanting to showcase their work. We were able to print 12 very-detailed gaming figures at once and the process only took 4 hours and 2 minutes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
