-   Landscaping fabric will allow moisture to pass through, while preventing the growth of weeds. You’ll want to lay this fabric over the entire surface you plan to landscape. Cut holes in the fabric if you will be planting between landscaping **rocks**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first step in transforming your **yard** is to remove the grass, but don’t get out the shovels just yet. The easiest way to kill your grass is to wrap your lawn in black plastic, so use garbage bags weighed down with **rocks** for a cheap solution. You’ll want to keep the lawn sealed off for at least two weeks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now you’re ready to fill your area with **rocks**. You can dump small **rocks** by the bucketful or use a wheelbarrow to distribute them over a large area. It pays to be meticulous laying these **rocks** because they will essentially stay in place until you remove them. Use a garden rake to smooth out an even layer of **rocks**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
