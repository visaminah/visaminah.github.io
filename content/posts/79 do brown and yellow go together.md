Darker woods like walnut pair well with pastel purples, and lighter **brown** woods pair well with deep shades of purple like plum or bright shades like amethyst.

-   Spring colors are clear and bright, just like the colors of a spring day. The sun is low on the horizon, so everything is imbued with the golden hues of the sun.

This article would never end if I attempted to add in all the color combinations for what colors make **brown**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Triadic color combinations are spaced evenly throughout the color wheel and tend to be more rich or vibrant in color. This color combination is typically dynamic, creating a harmonious visual contrast that pops when combined. Create a triangle on the color wheel and you'll find your 3 triadic colors.

-   Yellow is the color of sunshine and the classic smiley face, so it’s probably no surprise to learn that it represents optimism and hope. But this stimulating color also signifies logic, confidence, progressiveness and creativity. In darker, more golden shades, the color is said to embody luxury, abundance and prosperity. Though **yellow** can be a good match for any brand — companies as diverse as McDonald’s, Sprint and National Geographic have incorporated it into their logo designs — it can be overpowering, and is often paired with a less intense, contrasting color. Too much **yellow**, particularly bright **yellow**, can cause anxiety. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Personally here at Acorn, we’re pleased to be living in an age where people are taking ever bolder risks with their personal style. Arguably though, **brown** and blue is still a colour combination that’s widely under-utilised, especially in the world of men’s style. And that’s a shame, because the right shades paired together can give almost any outfit an air of understated elegance. We’ve got plenty of **brown** and blue cotton shirting fabrics to choose from here at Acorn, and over all our decades in the business, we’ve picked up a few ideas on how you can use them! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Though neither Cadmium Green Light or Cadmium Yellow will make **brown** as light as white does – they do lighten your **brown** while also making it colorful. However, when using titanium white to lighten colors it can often have the adverse effect of making a color look ‘chalky’ and suck out the color. To counteract this, you could mix titanium white with **brown** and then add some **yellow** or green (or another color) to give the **brown** some color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   A highly successful combination is a suit made of quality fabric in charcoal grey, **brown** or navy, combined with a white shirt and patterned tie. A pair of braces could set the look of just right. Black or dark **brown** shoes and socks can complete the look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Yellow and **brown** probably aren’t the first two colors that pop into most of our minds when thinking about logo color schemes. In fact, a recent color preference study showed that only 3 percent of people listed **yellow** or **brown** as their favorite colors. While that data may seem like cause for concern, it shouldn’t be — remember that a color’s popularity has very little to do with whether or not it’s appropriate for your brand. To see just how powerful and effective this color combination can be, take a look at these famous **yellow** and **brown** logos that represent their brands perfectly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to personal style, there’s an argument for considering your skin colour. If you’ve got dark skin, for example, high contrast elements like a navy suit and white shirt can be matched very well with tan **brown** shoes.

Since **brown** isn’t too far from orange, the same applies to this pairing, too. They naturally work well together, creating a subtly pleasing effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is a neutral and natural color that, when used in the right environment, can create a warm, stable feeling in any room. An excess of **brown** or wooden furniture can create a dark, heavy feel in your space.

When looking for a neutral shade to paint your home with **brown** is often passed over for whites or grays, but you shouldn’t rule it out!
