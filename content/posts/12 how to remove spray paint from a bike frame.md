## 12 Interesting Facts How To Remove Spray Paint From A Bike Frame | Heat Gun To Remove Paint From Bike Frame
-   Can I use Spray.Bike to **paint** my mountain bike? Absolutely. Although Spray.Bike is an amazing consumer **spray** **paint**, it is still **spray** **paint** and, especially on a mountain bike, expect it to get scratched up. Chain slap on a mountain bike can be particularly difficult on **paint** jobs, use of a chain stay protector can help protect the frame from rapid wear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How long should I wait between coats of Top Coat? Drying times vary on product, how thick the **paint** was applied, temperature and humidity. Generally, Spray.Bike suggests 7 days before building the bike in order to let the top coat cure. They suggest 2 to 24 hours dry time between Top Coats. Cooler temperatures, thicker **paint** and humid conditions will increase drying times. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What sort of masking do you recommend? Spray.Bike recommends using the yellow 3M Automotive Refinishing Masking Tape. If you have digital designs you want to have made, they suggest calling your local sign shop and seeing if they can print your design on High Bake Paint vinyl or a low-tack vinyl. You can use stickers but sometimes the adhesive can be very strong and leave adhesive residue or pull the **paint** if not fully cured. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Is one can of **paint** enough to cover a whole bike? One 400ml can of **paint** will cover a typical frame and fork without problems if you apply it with proper technique needed for Spray.Bike. Be sure to consult the **spray** distance recommendations and base coat recommendations for each color as **spray** distances vary greatly. Spray.Bike recommends a base coat (either white metal primer, Marylebone, or Whitechapel) if you are **paint**ing with any of the Fluro colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How long should I wait before building the bike? Spray.Bike suggests 7 days before building the bike in order to let the top coat cure. Again, this varies. Thicker **paint**, especially top coats and Keirins, increase curing time as does temperature and humidity. Generally, the longer you can give it to cure, the better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How do I hang the bike while **paint**ing? Spray.Bike recommends finding some way of suspending the frame so that you can **paint** it without having to set it down. Various methods will work: a bike stand, a rope through the head tube hanging from a tree or garage rafters. Make sure you access all areas of the frame. Get creative if necessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Can I use Spray.Bike Top Coat to protect my raw frame? Spray.Bike’s understanding of using clear coat over raw steel is that it is nearly impossible to permanently prevent rust, and their clear coat certainly won't entirely do that. It will definitely slow down the development of rust however, and if you are willing to intermittently brush out some rust and re-**spray** clear it will probably remain a cool looking finish. They recommend sandblasting or sanding with a somewhat coarse grit and cleaning with rubbing alcohol (never acetone) before **spray**ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have an old metal bike I want to re-**paint**, do I need to strip my bike down to the bare metal before **paint**ing? Compared to chemical stripping off all the old factory, **paint**ing over an existing **paint** job is preferable both in terms of both prep work and durability of the new **paint** job. A sanded factory **paint** job will act as a primer. Chemical strippers can leave a residue that prevents Spray.Bike from properly adhering. Sand blasting is an acceptable way to remove old **paint**, however you will want to use a primer (Metal Primer or Cold-Zinc Primer) as your first coat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How do I know if I need primer? You only need Metal Primer (aluminum or steel) / Cold Zinc (steel) if you are down to the exposed metal. You only need Carbon Primer if you are **paint**ing over raw carbon fiber or a resin composite frameset. If your bike is prepped for **paint** and still has the factory **paint**, you do not need primer. If you bike has some exposed metal after sanding and some original factory **paint**, Spray.Bike recommends priming the entire frame. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I want a design on my bike. How long should I wait before adding **paint** masking? Spray.Bike recommends making sure the **paint** is fully cured (~2 hours) before adding any sort of adhesive. That said, if you can wait longer, that's better. 24 hours is amazing, so letting it sit overnight is great. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Can I **paint** over a powder coated frame? Probably. However, it can be difficult to get a powder coated frame well prepped for **paint**ing, especially if it has a hard clear powder on top. If you can get the frame sandblasted, that’s best. If not Spray.Bike recommends sanding through the top coat, making sure the frame is roughed up and well cleaned for the best chance of adhesion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Can I use your **paint** on plastic or fiberglass? Yes, but the durability depends to some degree on how flexible the plastic is. Spray.Bike recommends sanding and cleaning the surface first and applying a coat of Carbon Primer to act as an adhesive helper and to help in allowing the **paint** to flex without it cracking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
