## 11 Interesting Facts Best Paper Shredder For Home Use Nz | Paper Shredders For Home Use
-   Security level. Paper **shredder**s are also classified by security levels. The size of the **paper**’s particles after being shredded is what determines security level rating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Similarly, **shredder**s have a maximum run-time. The run-time tells you how many minutes it can continuously shred **paper** before needing a timeout. Some units can run for about 20 minutes, while others can run for up to an hour or more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For about $100, this **shredder** features a great sheet capacity — a maximum of 15 pages in one pass — and a continuous run time of 20 minutes. It comes with a 6-gallon pull-out waste bin, which for a **paper** **shredder** of its size is more than sufficient. Additionally, this model features an auto-reverse mode that allows it to reduce **paper** jams by returning the **paper** back to you when it detects an overload or possible jam. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This cross-cut **shredder** is small — about the size of toaster — and can be conveniently placed on top of a desk or a countertop. It features a 4.5-inch wide **paper** feed entry, ideal for shredding up to four folded **paper**s in one pass. Its 1.32-gallon wastebasket is not the largest option out there but can hold the remnants of about 40 sheets of shredded **paper**, including junk mail, bank statements, and credit cards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The C149-C’s blade handles up to 18 sheets in a single pass. It can destroy small **paper** clips, staples, CDs/DVDs, and credit cards. It has P3 level security, meaning it can be used to shred documents with confidential information into particles of approximately 5mm x 40mm. Its auto start/reverse functions, on the other hand, allows it to automatically shred documents and reverse when misfed, reducing **paper** jams. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another great thing about **paper** **shredder**s is that they’re relatively cheap. Prices start at $30 or less, and it's often possible to buy a good quality **paper** **shredder** for home use for under $100. Meanwhile, heavy-duty models that are designed to handle more **paper** sheets and offer continuous run-time and higher security typically cost somewhere between a few hundred dollars to $500. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Powershred 99Ms can shred 14 pages in one pass and has an impressively large 9-gallon pull-out basket. Like other Fellowes models, it features SafeSense technology, a safety measure that enables it to stop when someone’s hand gets near the **paper** opening. To save energy, its sleep mode will shut the unit down after two minutes of inactivity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Strip-cut is the basic shred type. Shredders of this kind only cut **paper** lengthwise, producing confetti-like strips. They’re typically recommended only for shredding **paper**work with non-sensitive information. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are seven security levels, ranging from P1 (lowest level) to P7 (highest level). Generally, each **paper** cut type is associated with particular security levels: strip-cuts are P1 or P2; cross-cuts, P3 or P4, and micro-cuts, P5 to P7. Those with higher security levels produce smaller **paper** particles but are also more expensive. For instance, a **paper** **shredder** with security level P7 could cost somewhere between $1,000 and $2,000. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Waste basket. A small waste bin can be an annoyance if you have to empty it frequently while shredding documents. Our recommendations feature larger bin capacities, ranging from 6 to 9 gallons. (Take into account that a waste bin can hold more particles when the **shredder** cuts **paper** into smaller pieces.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Powershred 79Ci is specially designed to be 100% jam-proof. It can prevent the shutter from being overfed and pause the motor when you misfeed **paper**. A light bar also lets you know when you’re shredding within the recommended capacity or exceeding it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
