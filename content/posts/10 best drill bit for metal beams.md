## 10 Tips for Best Drill Bit For Metal Beams | Best Drill Bits
-   When it comes to making small holes, a lot of the same products you can use in sheet metal are similarly effective in steel plates: twist **drill** bits, step **drill** bits or a hole punch. With all of these, however, the thicker the steel plate, the less efficient. Silver and deming bits are a popular option for **drill**ing somewhat larger holes into steel, but this is more the ‘old school’ approach–pushing through the metal rather than carving out a hole. These are not necessarily the most efficient, especially when working on thick plates. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For large holes (3″+ in diameter) in thick metal, there are very few options. This is a tough task that only a few tools can handle, and we recommend the CS Unitec MAB1300–the monster of all mag **drill**s. With a 5” diameter and 4” depth of cut capacity, this tool stands nearly 3’ tall and weighs 112 lbs., but it is a beast that gets the job done well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drilling holes into metal isn’t the most straightforward task for those who don’t do it for a living. Even if you do, choosing the right tool for the job isn’t always easy. There are a lot of factors to take into consideration–how many holes are you **drill**ing? What material are you **drill**ing through? What size hole is needed? These factors play a big role in how quickly, efficiently and affordably you can get the job done, so here are some tips on how to determine what type of tool is right for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You also should be lubricating your **drill** bit before use. This helps preserve the lifespan of the bit, reduces friction, and keeps the **drill** steady on its point of contact. Wax, sprays, and oil can be used for this depending on the angle and size of the hole you are **drill**ing. Cutting fluid and multipurpose oils work great for **drill**ing holes 1/8” or larger. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   RotaCut bits are an excellent choice for holes ranging from ¾” to 1-1/2”. They can be used in handheld **drill**ing applications and are specifically designed to cut through sheet metal. In our testing, we found that RotaCut bits easily cut even through I-Beam using a cordless **drill**, so they are definitely something to consider when cutting through different materials. These typically far outlast traditional twist **drill** bits and run around $9, making them a great long lasting and inexpensive option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you start **drill**ing holes around ¾” or larger, it’s best to switch to bi-metal hole saws for a longer lasting option, or carbide hole saws that are faster and more durable for those larger holes. Bi-metal hole saws usually cost around $9, with carbide hole saws slightly higher, around $15. These options are also durable, versatile, inexpensive, and readily available almost anywhere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hopefully this post has been helpful for showing the various ways to make holes in metal, which heavily depend on the diameter of the hole needed and thickness of the metal you’re **drill**ing. There are also other important variables that come into play–how many holes need **drill**ed, how precise they need to be, how much your labor time is worth and if this is a one-time thing or everyday task. Investing in a $3,000 hole punch seems ludicrous when a $5 **drill** bit will do the same thing, which is of course true if you’re only **drill**ing 10 holes one time. Change those 10 holes to 100,000, though, and things start to look a little different. If you save 30 seconds per hole in labor and say 830 man hours at $30/hour, that’s a $25,000 difference–definitely worth the investment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   There are a few options we really would not recommend for **drill**ing into materials this thick. Hole saws are still used by some, but this is certainly not the intended use and has very little life expectancy. You’ll likely see breakage and wear after just 1 use on this type of material. We also don’t recommend any twist **drill** bits or silver and deming bits (that’s not in a press of some sort), however, reamer bits are extremely common for hole enlarging and hole alignment in structural steel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Similarly, if you are **drill**ing large holes (2”-4” in diameter), Knockout sets become a great option. These are a common solution for making holes in electrical panels where a punch & die make a nice clean hole. Hydraulic or Manual Knockout Set prices start around $900, with cordless M18 Knockout Sets even getting to $1,000+. These higher price tags are why we don’t see the Knockout tools being that popular outside of the electrical trades, but they are a terrific option. A good, affordable option for larger holes in sheet metal are HolCutters, which top out at 3” but only cost around $30. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
