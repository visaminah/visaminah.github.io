## 10 Interesting Facts Is Gray Bedroom Furniture Out Of Style | The Biggest Home Decor Trends of 2023 (Plus, 4 that are on their way out)
-   ’80s decor is back (but we’re doing it more tastefully this time around, praise be). The biggest way we’ll be working in ’80s glam is through silhouette. Think of the chunky, rounded, geometric **furniture** designs that are emerging right now as a reaction to all of the midcentury modernism we’ve been hit with over the last decade. (Which is exactly what happened in the ’80s: after the OG midcentury modernism craze in the 1950s-1970s, the bold Memphis design style took over in the ’80s and early ’90s). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Design experts generally agree that the best bet is to keep your larger pieces classic. So, your sofa, your bed, your dining room **furniture**. Go for something simple and high-quality, then get a little trendier with everything else. Ditto for major renovations. If you want to love your space for more than a few years, keep your choices simple and timeless, then layer on personality elsewhere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In your opinion is **gray** **furniture** automatically dated? I found the perfect shape and style sofa but it's **gray**. Price is right. I'm sick of the **gray** trend but I don't mind a little **gray** now and then. Am I buying a couch from 2017? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cool **gray** tones are starting to feel dated in the way that “tan” walls feel like the year 2000. But warm **gray** walls? Now those are chic. Tones that border on warm taupe, **gray**-brown, or super pale warm **gray**s are the newest neutral for walls. Also: Beige is back, baby. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally, in both home decor and fashion, major trends last about 10 years. Major trends are things like the neutral of the moment: In the 2010s, it was all **gray** everything. Now, it’s all about brown and beige. Smaller trends, like specific patterns, or throw pillow styles, or uber-trendy wall art, have a shorter lifespan, about 3-5 years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Midcentury is a classic look in its own right, but for the last ten years or so, it was THE way to do modern. Meaning, entire rooms were decorated like a midcentury museum exhibit. The look is tired, and a bit boring, which midcentury should never be. Going forward, midcentury **furniture** will be a piece of the puzzle in a room – a chair or a piece of art mixed with traditional or contemporary styles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   About a decade ago, we decided brass was back. It was banned for years after the 80s, and made it’s way back in a big way, in lighting, hardware, **furniture** legs, kitchen faucets, you name it, it was brass. The brass was typically a brushed gold color that looked very manufactured. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Color has been creeping back into kitchens little by little over the last few years. It started with contrasting islands in all white-kitchens, or **gray** cabinets in lieu of white, and now cabinets are being drenched in saturated colors. While moody blues have been a big hit and will remain popular in 2022, the most of the moment shade is a dark green, a la this kitchen from House & Home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Farmhouse is still a fairly popular design style, but it’s evolving into something more sophisticated and less cliché. If you want to update your farmhouse style for 2023, ditch any sign you have hanging in your home that points to where the market is or advertises fresh milk, and any **furniture** that’s faux-distressed finished. Instead, think about ways to mix in more on-trend pieces into your style. Think landscape oil paintings, authentic antiques or vintage finds, and primitive-style pottery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are SO many reasons that secondhand, vintage and antique furnishings will be big this year. For one, there’s a big issue with supply chains around the world, meaning that everything (but especially **furniture**, it seems) is hard to get and taking forever to ship. If you’ve tried to order a sofa, you know that lead times are literally 4-6 months, or more. Purchasing secondhand can solve a lot of these issues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
