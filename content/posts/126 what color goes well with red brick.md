Red **brick** of course doesn’t come in just one shade of **red**. You’ll have anything from a fire truck **red** to an orangey-**red** to a muted clay **red**, depending on what kind of **brick** you have and how old it is.

-   Other exterior features of your home will also play a role in your color scheme.

A **red** **brick** home with a black roof, for example, establishes two of the main colors already in the home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether it is your interior **brick** wall or the exterior, light grey is the color that goes with everything and everywhere.

-   Exposed **brick** adds a warm and cozy touch to any space, using natural materials to soften the synthetic trappings of a modern-day home.

-   Like many types of masonry, **red** **brick** is a timeless addition to the home that never goes out of style. That said, not all exposed **red** **brick** aesthetics are the same.

This darker, more neutral style replaced the previously trending bright and vibrant **red** **brick**s that were challenging to decorate with.

However, consider the shade of orange or purple you desire. For example, a rich eggplant-inspi**red** hue will suit a **brick** exterior better than a garish bright purple.

-   If finding the right color is impossible, select a neutral. Although white pai**red** with **brick** can look dated and p**red**ictable, a rich neutral like beige, taupe or gray can complement **brick** and create a harmonious yet subtle palette. Pair the intensity of the neutral with that of your **brick**, or opt for a rich neutral like charcoal gray with a paler **brick** and a light taupe with deeper **brick**. A glossy black works with **red** **brick** to create a modern look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A complementary color palette draws on color from opposite sides of the wheel, with some variation in the shades. Given this, a **red** **brick** house would suit certain accents.

A more orange-**red** **brick** will work with a rich more blue-green hue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some **brick** homes have a facade that includes another material, such as stucco, which means the **brick** might hold less color dominance.

-   Brick is a traditional material that’s reminiscent of old schoolhouses and stately fireplaces. To bring this feature into the 21st century, pair it with white, off-white, beige, or light gray. These simple neutrals can brighten the space, and the minimalist approach transforms the exposed **brick** into an envy-inspiring statement piece. Additionally, modern design is all about lightweight materials so, since exposed **brick** can appear dark and heavy, be sure to include daintier accents like breezy curtains, glass side tables, and simple picture frames. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both kinds function admirably when painted on properly prepa**red** **brick**. Because the front-facing **brick**s seem off-white and the cracks between the **brick**s appear gray, Seapearl looks particularly attractive on **brick**.

-   I tried a navy blue shade, which turned out perfect. It is one of the interior paint colors that go with **red** **brick**. In natural light, dark colors appear more vibrant and saturated. This bodes well for a darker shade of blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After exploring the neutrals, we can start getting into some colorful options. An excellent companion for those cream colors we discussed, that is also lovely with **red** **brick**, is sage green. Soft, muted greens are a good choice for **brick**, but brighter greens might look a bit garish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   BM Stone Hearth is another inc**red**ible taupe / greige exterior paint color that will go with **brick**. This guy is more beige than gray and is conside**red** more of a muted mid-toned paint color. However, when it’s used on the exterior of the home it will appear to look lighter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Please Note – Any color **brick** is quite likely to be muted, subdued, and subtle. They definitely have a mix of gray in them – which makes them even more of a pastel shade. Well, when I say ‘**red** **brick**’, it’s not actually **red**! But rather, a form of ‘rust’ or ‘maroon’ that tones down the bold and bright **red**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you have a Victorian style or Mid-Century Modern, this **red** **brick** paint color combination is definitely something to have an eye on.

Else, you must choose **brick** as an ACCENT to complement the black exterior walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We said we’d be keeping it simple and that’s why we have only two trim colors for you today. We most often see clients go with a white trim with their **red** **brick** because a white trim will help the **brick** pop. Remember, your **brick** is an architectural feature that we’re focused on enhancing and highlighting so that contrast is like candy for your eyes. The key to choosing a white trim to go with **red** **brick** is that you want to choose something that has a warm, slightly yellow undertone. This allows you to have both a dynamic contrast and complementary tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When the **brick** is painted beige or off-white, it looks fresh and modern with orange clay tile roofs.

-   LRV 41 SW Gateway Gray is conside**red** a greige but it leans a tad more on the gray side. Gateway has some slight green undertones to it which is why I love it next to **brick**. It’s a greige that has a little something extra in it. It’s also very muted, again another reason it pairs so nicely with **red** **brick**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hands down, the best shades to complement a **red** **brick** house are in the cool-toned family. This is because of the design concept known as the color wheel.

And one of my absolute favorites here is Sherwin Williams Svelte Sage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I just spent 20 minutes trying to create the best title for this post 🤔 -one that would captivate the amazing difference our new bold paint color has made to the exterior of our home. I’m not quite sure the title “Best House Paint Colors with Red Brick” is adequate.

If you have similar **red** **brick** on the exterior of your home, and you’re wanting to update your home, this just might be the paint color(s) that take your house to a fresh new level. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When we moved in the house it was painted a sage color with creamy ivory trim that really washed out the entire Cape Cod style of our new home. It was okay I guess, and matched the **brick** fine, but it just didn’t pop, and seemed to age the house. It almost made me feel dusty 🤧. Quite frankly, it was boring and way too p**red**ictable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brick offers a great advantage for home facades: Unlike other siding types, such as vinyl or wood, **brick** siding typically needs no repainting or restaining.

-   If your **red** **brick** home needs the royal treatment, emerald will be an inc**red**ible statement of indulgence and celebration. The impact of shades and paint finish really matter here. Softer shades with texture will downplay the brilliance of this color, while a thick, shiny coat against rich **red** **brick** will dazzle guests. Brass and gold knobs will really pop against an emerald front door. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For starters, we know that **red** **brick** is more subdued and subdued. As a result, we’ll need to keep that in mind while choosing paint colors to complement it. If you’re going to use white, for example, go for a creamy white rather than a brilliant white. When pai**red** with **brick**, the dazzling white might look a touch too harsh. An off-white will seem white against the **brick**, but it will be softer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

For exterior schemes with three colors, try the 60/30/10 rule: Designate 60% of the facade for the dominant color, use a secondary hue for 30%, and paint the remaining 10% in an accent color.
