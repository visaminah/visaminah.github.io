## 23 Interesting Facts Small Modern Basement Bar Ideas | small modern basement bar ideas
-   Even if you aren’t a wine enthusiast, you’ll want to plan a sitting area in your finished **basement** **bar**. Create a space that embodies the type of vibe you want to create. A lounge will look best with several large couches and side tables to sit back and relax in. A club atmosphere will have several high-top tables and plenty of open space for dancing. A sports **bar** might have high-top tables with **bar** stools and TVs on the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have exposed brick for your **basement** walls, you have the ideal backdrop for an industrial or rustic-inspired **basement** **bar**. Work with the bricks or natural stone and create a space that’s comfortable and unpretentious. It should feel like your favorite neighborhood **bar** that welcomes you in with a warm hug and a cold drink. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you decide to expand on it later, you can. Perhaps you start with a single shelf and then add on later or upgrade from the floating shelf to a built-in unit. You could start with a simple **bar** and build on it to have a decorative front, **bar** rail, and fancier **bar**stools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use a variety of black materials when building your **bar**. You could have dark-stained wood, marble, or granite for the **bar**. Then black leather for the seating. Use black glass for the lighting shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To keep your **basement** **bar** from feeling too sparse and cold, you’ll want to add touches of natural materials. You could have a wood floor or wood **bar** front. Then place metal or wood **bar**stools upholstered with leather or suede. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re in the process of planning a **basement** remodel, this is your chance to create your dream finished **basement**. Why not turn yours into a wine cellar? You could build a wine rack on one wall for plenty of wine storage. You can buy kits, or you could build custom shelving for the number of bottles you own. Then you’ll need cabinetry for your wine glasses. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With running water, you can have a sink, ice maker, and a complete **bar** set. This eliminates the need to run upstairs and makes it easier for you to **bar**tend. If you plan on hosting larger groups, consider adding a dishwasher to make washing lots of glassware easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s only so much you can do in a dry **bar**. It lacks running water, so you’ll need to bring ice down with you and carry used glassware back upstairs to clean. Skip all of this hassle and make your setup a wet **bar**. You can work with a plumber to ensure you tap into the correct plumbing lines. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You don’t have to go all out with your **bar** design. Sometimes, all you need is a **bar** cabinet, counter, and stools. These are the basic elements of a **bar** and they’re all you need to create one in your **basement**. This is a smart approach if your space or budget has limitations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **basement** remodel is the perfect opportunity to create a livable space. Why not create a room that’s perfect for hanging out and entertaining friends? You could build a **bar** and host events. Not all **bar**s are the same, though. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Add a built-in cabinet or shelving around the counter space. This will give you plenty of storage for your alcohol, glassware, and **bar**tending tools. You could install a wine and drink fridge under the countertop. This idea looks great and gives you a place to store drinks that need to be cold, like mixers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can’t go wrong with using wood to build your custom **bar**. It’s a classic building material and found in **bar**s across America. Whether you use light or dark wood, you need to have an idea of what you’re building before you start. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use reclaimed wood for the construction of the **bar** and any shelving. Or you could have fresh wood that still has its **bar**k on the edge. Then leave this raw detail facing out when you mount your shelves or build your **bar** top. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you love the modern look of an all-white living room or kitchen, then why not continue this design style to your **basement**? You could have crisp white walls that line elegant marble countertops and decorative pendant lights illuminating the space. The bright white design theme will keep the space feeling bright, welcoming, and fresh. Since there typically aren’t many windows in a **basement**, this is key to preventing the space from feeling too dark or cave-like. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Perhaps your **bar** could look ultra-modern like a cool club from the city. Or maybe you’d feel right at home in a rustic **bar** that’s reminiscent of a country cottage. If you’re serious about entertaining, perhaps you’ll build more than just a **bar**, and instead, a full kitchen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Build your **bar** to fit the space you have available in your **basement**. Perhaps your **basement** **bar** design is only big enough for two **bar**stools. That’s okay, but don’t go any smaller; just one **bar** stool will be awkward when using it with your guests. Instead, skip having the **bar**stool setup entirely and create a walk-up **bar** and place seating elsewhere in your **basement**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choose simple lighting fixtures that have a single cable with a bulb. Or you could have a metal cage around the bulbs for an industrial touch. Then finish your **bar** with vintage metal **bar** stools. They’re affordable and will give your **bar** an authentic feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “I don’t like going into the **basement**. I’m always afraid that something’s going to blow up.” – Roz Chast - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not all **bar**s need to have a countertop area that you can walk behind. If you’re short on square footage, this **bar** style will take up too much room to be functional. Instead, consider some **bar** wall ideas. These walk-up **bar**s have an open concept. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To keep your **basement** from feeling like a black hole, highlight with contrasting materials, like metal. You could have a metal **bar** rail, furniture frames, and lighting fixtures. These will reflect the light to define the space and give it dimension without taking away from the black theme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a dead corner in your **basement**, use it for a corner **bar**. It doesn’t have to take up a lot of space. You could put a **bar** hutch in the corner and call it a day. Or you could build out around the corner. This will give you an effective space without taking up a lot of room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you love to do more than make drinks, consider adding a **basement** kitchenette. Then you could serve both drinks and snacks to your friends and family. Instead of having a **bar** to stand behind, you could replace it with a small kitchen island. Or you can combine the two so that the island still has a raised **bar** top on the opposite side of the kitchen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It can help to use a pre-made **bar** plan. Measure to ensure it fits, and then follow the steps to build your **bar**. If you aren’t ready to build your **bar** from scratch, you can look for a kit. Just follow the instructions to put the pieces together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
