## 44 Tips to Best Stud Finder With Laser Level | Stanley Intellisensor Pro
-   It’s worth noting that with all the finders that claim to find the center of a **stud**, “center” is a bit of a loose term. It’s best to think of that indication as “on the **stud**” more than the exact center. There’s a bit of wiggle room if you will, so if precision is required, best to make a few passes, average the results, then drill a small test hole. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wider than many **stud** finders, the Franklin ProSensor 710 or T13 constantly checks 13 points and has the ability to detect up to 1.6 inches deep. It’s a full-width **stud** finder, meaning you see the entire width of the **stud**. This gives you a clear picture of the **stud** and marks the full width or more accurately marks the center. If you need to be super-accurate, they also provide a ruler along the edge for reference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most important, the adage of “measure twice, cut once,” is vital here too. Just because your **stud** finder swears it has found the center of a **stud**, drilling a small test hole to make sure it’s there is a good idea before you start drilling. Especially if the location is in a place where a miss would be obvious, catastrophic, or, in the presence of live electrical wiring, shockingly bad. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your best **stud** finder app options use your phone’s EMF sensor (electromagnetic field) to hone in on the source. The most reliable we’ve found is Stud Finder by Tue Nguyen Minh on iPhone’s app store. The interface is simple to understand and easy to read. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finding a **stud** can be difficult without the proper tools. Before writing this guide, the **stud** finder in my house was a magnet on a string that my dad made for me. I love the DIY aspect, the simplicity, and the price: almost free. You can use this magnet-on-a-string method to find the braces and nails in or around the **stud** and then extrapolate where the **stud** must be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lastly, one interior wall in my home has 1970s-era wood paneling that was there when I bought it. This puts an additional layer between the **stud** finder and the wall’s **stud**s, but one that’s more “transparent” to their sensors compared to stucco. The better finders passed this test, but as you’d probably guess, weren’t quite as definite in their **stud** location predictions as they were with simple drywall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Without the ability to electronically sense the sides and center, it’s important to get the **stud** finder level so you can more easily follow the **stud**. Of course, that assumes the **stud** itself is straight. We’ve seen some that are questionable in that department. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Stanley FMHT0-77407 FatMax S300 With its iconic rugged, yellow and black asthetic The Stanley FMHT77407 was the most professional-looking of the **stud** finders tested I tested for this guide. That it comes bearing Stanely's FatMax branding provides the FMHT77407 with the street cred that professional and ametuer putterers drool over. Unfortunately, looks and branding can sometimes be decieving: While the FMHT77407 might look tough, It's constructed using inexpensive plastic—felt it had the same chance of surviving a tumble to a contrete floor as the other **stud** finders I tested. Additionally, while its performance was acceptable, it wasn't quite as accurate as some of the other models I tested. Pros Rubber grips Bright display Cons Inconsistent **stud** finding results Buy now at Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Stud detectors have been around for a long time but sometimes one appears which becomes a definite buy for any serious handyman. This model is one of those! Featuring a **stud** detector which just doesn't "beep" when you're over the **stud**, it shows the proximity when you are NEAR a **stud** via the large LCD and shows a target graphic when you're spot on. Also featuring live wire (voltage) detection, you can be sure than nail you're about to hammer into the wall won't end up in your mains wiring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We know you like Yellow and Black and we’ve got you covered. ;-) As we considered the best electronic wall **stud** finder options, we wanted to focus on the ability to accurately detect AC and **stud**s. There are plenty of good options, and our team really likes the DeWalt 1 1/2-inch **stud** finder. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Credit: Reviewed / Geoffrey Morrison The C.H. Hanson Magnetic Stud Finder is an inexpensive tool for DIY enthusiasts who only require a **stud** finder, occasionally. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Electronic **stud** finders emit a weak electrical field and sense variations in the field. The cheapest models can only detect the edges of a **stud**, the better models can locate the center. Since the difference in price is not that significant, I recommend spending the few dollars more on a center-detecting model. This method was, during testing, fairly precise. But again, **stud** finders aren’t magic— multiple sweeps of a wall to find a **stud** is always a good idea. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first test was the simplest. When used on 10-year-old drywall of an interior wall in a wall in my home, could the **stud** finder actually find a **stud**? I knew where the **stud**s in the wall were before I started, so I could see what were false positives created by less accurate finders. I swept each device across the wall quickly, at first, then again more slowly, figuring this would be how most people would use them: A fast sweep to get a general idea and then, a slower one to narrow down precisely where the **stud** was. The better finders had no issues, but surprisingly several couldn’t even manage this basic test. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Magnetic **stud** finders work by using a magnet to locate the screws that hold your drywall in place. They cost less than **stud** finders that use active sensors, but they’re more limited. They can’t detect the actual **stud**, so there’s some guesswork as you look for the exact center. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Best affordable **stud** finder: C.H. Hanson Stud 4 Sure Magnetic Stud Finder, available at Home Depot, $10.65 - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best feature of all is the built in **laser** level. Rotating across 180 degrees with stops on 45 and 90 degrees,you can instantly and easily do layouts and basic tasks suchas picture levelling in a snap. The inbuilt spirit level ensures you're at the right angle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the **stud** sensing side, it detects both wood and metal **stud**s. Two things we’d like to see in a future upgrade is a vertical angle and the ability to lock in an angle. A vertical beam is helpful to mark the entire length of the **stud**. Locking in an angle would be useful when you’re hanging a series of pictures and want to add a creative angle to the display. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tavool TH250 The Tavool TH250 one of Amazon’s top sellers at the time that this guide was written—a bit suspect from a company that’s not exactly well-known. However, after using it, my suspicions were put to bed: its performance was excellent, finding the **stud**s quickly, accurately, and repeatedly. Our Best Overall pick, the Zircon A150, is available for around the same price as the TH250, and proved more reliable. That said, the TH250 did a great job overall. Pros Easy-to-understand display - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Electrical outlets and light switches are almost always found adjacent to **stud**s, so measure 16-inches on either side and that’s generally where you’ll find the next **stud**. Trim pieces, like crown molding and baseboards, are often secured to **stud**s. If you’re starting from the edge of a wall, the first **stud** away from the edge might be only 15.25-inches, then 16 from the center of that one for the rest of the wall (or until a window, another wall, etc). Sometimes **stud**s might be 24-inches, center to center. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Zircon MetalliScanner m40 is able to detect metal in a variety of materials, including plaster. Like a magnetic finder, you’re searching for nails or screws. Lathe can have more nails than the ones just on the **stud**, so once you find a good **stud**, measure out from there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Trying to accurately find **stud**s inside a plaster wall is hard. Magnetic **stud** finders often won’t penetrate far enough and electronic models are iffy at best. Our selection as the best **stud** finder for plaster walls isn’t technically a **stud** finder—it’s a metal detector. In our experience, metal detecting gives us the best results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ryobi ESF5001 LED Whole Stud Detector I liked the angular design of the Ryobi: it felt good in my hand, no matter how I held it, which isn’t the case with some of the other **stud** finders I tested. However, it wasn’t able to find the **stud** in my bathroom test, which all of the other **stud** finders in this guide could. Pros Sleek design - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **laser** level works very well. Easy to see the line in daylight. Would be nice to have a vertical line as well, but the model that has that from B&D does not have a **stud** sensor function. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Trying to detect **stud**s in plaster walls sucks. Most **stud** finders are iffy at best on plaster and lathe. Use a dedicated metal detector instead (recommendation below). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The question of whether a **stud** finder can find a **stud** is difficult to answer. Some better questions would be: How well does it find **stud**s andHow quickly. Not every wall is the same: Can a **stud** finder work on thicker walls, as some of them promise? In order to write this guide, these were a few of the questions that I needed to answer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best **stud** finder with **laser** level goes to the Craftsman 20-ft Self-Leveling Line Generator Line Laser Level. By combining a horizontal auto-leveling **laser** level with a **stud** finder, you can take care of hanging multiple pictures or longer items with more confidence. This definitely falls under homeowner or DIY usefulness, but we’ve heard of Pros finding these handy for quick layout tasks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Great product! I was shopping for a replacement **stud** sensor after my old one bit the dust after 10+ years. Came across this model which offers both a **stud** sensor, wire detector and **laser** level, so thought I've give it a shot. Very glad I did - it works very well for all tasks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It has stronger magnets than many of its competitors, guiding you to the fasteners easily. It also has a rotating bubble level. Unlike whole-**stud** options, that’s a feature our team does want on magnetic models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What's a Walabot, you ask? Well, it's a flat plastic wall-scanning device that connects to an Android smartphone—iPhone users need not apply. As it's not a traditional **stud** finder and costs well above the price gap I put in place for this guide, I didn't call it in for testing. However, it's worth mentioning here as, thanks to an enormous marketing budget, it’s seemingly everywhere. Fakespot, a website that rates the quality of user reviews on Amazon, gives the Walabot an “F,” meaning it determines that the vast majority of the product’s nearly 1,000 reviews are fake. For simple **stud** finding, which is what we were looking for in this guide, the Walabot is more than most people need to spend. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We can’t think of any easier electronic wall **stud** finder than the Ryobi whole **stud** detector. While it lacks AC voltage detection, that tends to lead to so many false positives, we’re not sure you’ll even miss it. One-handed operation, accurate **stud** detection, and an affordable price make the Ryobi ESF5002 our best electronic **stud** finder pick. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many operate with the push of a single button and use easily interpreted lights to indicate the location of hidden **stud**s. Some have an even more basic operation, simply adhering to the wall near **stud**s thanks to magnetism. And many can also detect electrical wires, helping keep you safe and preventing accidental damage to the wiring in your home, office, or wherever you're working. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The downside is that there’s some guesswork based on where your EMF sensor is. Considering you only have a 1 1/2 inches of **stud** to hit, being off a little can move you off of your target completely. In our testing, it’s not as accurate as other **stud** finders. However, if you come at it from several directions, you can dial in the nail’s position reasonably well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re hanging pictures in your home or apartment that are heavy enough to require a wall **stud**, the easiest way to find one is with a **stud** finder. It will help you find wood and metal **stud**s faster, and more accurately than tapping on the wall or hunting and guessing with a drill. Along with a tape measure and a level, it’s a core part of any new homeowner’s toolkit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is another one of our ‘go to’ tools at Shakespeare Solutions. It helps with installing picture hanging system track (when not being installed against a cornice, ceiling or similar) by providing a level line which is used to align the fixing screws. It can be pinned to a plasterboard or similar surface with the included spike which means you don’t have to continuous manoeuvre a traditional, tripod mounted, **laser** level around the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   DeWalt DW0150 The DeWalt DW0150 looks similar to the Craftsman 7623, boasting the same flat-but-wide design. Instead liked that instead of a pushbutton to mark the wall when you find a **stud**, it comes with a hole in its center that allows you mark the **stud** with a a pencil or hammer a nail into. Unfortunately, the DW0150 has far fewer LEDs than the aforementioned Craftsman, making it more difficult to get an accurate reading of exactly where the **stud** you're looking for is located. Pros Hole in center to tap nails through or mark walls Cons Flat, hard-to-handle design - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With the evolution of technology, you can find **stud** finding apps for both iPhone and Android smartphones. They use the phone’s magnetometer (the sensor that drives the compass) to detect metal nails or screws behind the drywall. Presumably, those nails or screws will be in the middle of that **stud** you’re attempting to locate. Note that these apps do not detect actual wood **stud**s or measure wall density. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Older houses (built in the 1940s and earlier) may have plaster and lath walls instead of drywall. Plaster and lath will be more difficult to sense **stud**s through than drywall, not least because the plaster alone could be upwards of one-inch thick. In my tests, the deeper the wall the worse all the **stud** finders I tested performed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should know that, despite being called two-by-fours, modern **stud**s are slightly smaller: 1.5 by 3.5 inches in size. If your house was built before the 1960s, it might have **stud**s closer in size to their two-by-four name. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I also took subjective considerations into account. This ranged from how smoothly each device moved over test surfaces, to how obvious they were when finding **stud**s, either the pull from the magnets or any lights and sounds they produced. Related, I rated them on how easy they were to use and read, etc. For the most part, they were all pretty easy to use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most important thing to know about **stud** finders is that they are not magic. They can not “see” through walls. As such, even the best **stud** finder on earth won’t be accurate 100% of the time on every type of wall. Other than borrowing a portable X-ray scanner, that’s just not possible. That said, some are better than others. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are also other types of tools to detect objects beneath the surface of a wall. Advancing beyond the types of **stud** finders we recommend, you encounter wall scanners. These radar-like tools typically only get used by professionals to “see” what’s behind the wall beyond just **stud**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a lot of “best” **stud** finder options out there. But let’s face it, there’s no single model that’s exactly what everyone needs. To help you out, our team has broken out a list of our favorite **stud** finders in a variety of situations along with what we like and don’t like about each. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tavool TH510 The Tavool 510's performance was pretty much the same as that of its sibling, the Tavool TH250. Both were able to find **stud**s quickly, with minimal false positives. Despite being more expensive than the TH250, the TH510 preformed worse on the wood panel test. Neither were of the Tavool **stud** finders were great in this area, but the TH250 was more on the side of usable than the TH510. Pros Elaborate LCD screen makes mode selection easy Cons Performs basically the same as the cheaper TH250 Buy now at Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hart Professional Stud Finder While it glides nicely across surfaces and comes with enough led lights, that pinpointing a **stud** should have been a cinch, the Hart 9Pro provided me with oddly inconsistent results: lots of false positives and false negatives. Sometimes it would miss a **stud** entirely, ands then insist one was present inside of a wall where I knew there wasn't. I tried the Hart on a different walls in my home and found that its performance was still inconsistent. What’s more its build quality felt super cheap. Pros Slides across a wall the best of any finder we tested Cons Too many false positives and negatives - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
