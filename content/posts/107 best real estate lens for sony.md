## 107 Tips to Best Real Estate Lens For Sony | Explore the  Universe
-   This, of course, refers to their **lens**es. Naturally, photographers carry with them different **lens**es for different situations, and real estate photography is no exception. However, the **lens** you need for a particular job will vary based on a variety of factors. This includes the specific type of camera you own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** wears an innovative optical design that reduces internal reflection to deliver 100% satisfactory solutions. The **lens** comes with a circular aperture that ensures the perfect bokeh effect. Traditional aperture **lens**es cannot match the advantages of a circular aperture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While the 16-35mm mentioned above obviously offers 35mm, this prime **lens** provides a faster aperture and is nearly two inches shorter when the zoom **lens** is set to 35mm. Sigma also offers a 35mm prime with an even faster aperture (f/1.2), but it is twice as heavy and closer to the dimensions of a zoom **lens**. Sony’s 35mm is nicely compact and lightweight, making it easy to throw in your kit for a trip. It will also balance nicely on your Sony camera and work well on gimbals. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rokinon’s 12mm ultra-wide **lens** can be the best pick for Sony mirrorless cameras in your budget. It is a prime super **lens** designed for wide-angle photoshoots. The **lens** is compatible with most of the Sony E mount cameras. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 20mm ultra-wide-angle **lens** from Sony is an excellent choice for photographers who love outdoor photoshoot. It helps to deliver photos with outstanding bokeh. The **lens** comes with advanced optical design and aspherical elements and three extra-low dispersion elements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Its compact and lightweight design will help you to carry it anywhere. It can be a great travel companion for you. The 20mm **lens** comes with advanced aspheric elements required for natural and lifelike photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next up we have the Sony 10-18mm F4 that is an expensive professional level **lens** that is an excellent bit of kit. If you are an established professional level photographer working in multiple niches where this **lens** can provide value then it is a no brainer to add it to your camera accessories. That said though if you are a real estate agent who will only be taking photographs of properties you are trying to sell then the price tag is too high for what you are actually getting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s also worth noting that not all **lens**es are created equal. High-end **lens**es will handle distortion better, and it may be barely noticeable, even with an ultra-wide focal length. Cheap **lens**es can have terrible distortion, sometimes resulting in a type called mustache distortion, which involves both pincushion and barrel distortion and can be next to impossible to fix in post. If you need a **lens** with minimal distortion, it is well worth investing in a higher-end **lens** instead of trying to go cheap. I’ve seen the results of cheap **lens**es in real estate photography far too often, and it is not pretty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ShiftCam 18mm Wide Angle ProLens for Smartphones This **lens** gives you a wider field of view, making it perfect for capturing landscapes, group photos, and more. The ShiftCam **lens** is made of high-quality glass and aluminum, and it's easy to attach and remove. Plus, it's backed by a 100% satisfaction guarantee. Check Price - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On top of this, Rokinon has also ensured that the focus system on the **lens** works without having to lengthen or rotating the forward **lens** element on the **lens** too ensuring that the whole system is as easy as use as possible. If you are a real estate agent rather than a photographer, this really does play right into your hands, especially if you have never used a detachable **lens** before as you can learn to get high-quality images within minutes. This all just keeps mounting up and scoring the Rokinon 12mm even more points over the competition. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The wide aperture also means that you can get a shallow depth of field despite wide-angles generally being less capable in that regard. The bokeh from this **lens** is nice and smooth, resulting in very pleasant backgrounds. It can focus as close as 9.8 inches, which you won’t necessarily want to utilize for portraits due to the unflattering results of perspective distortion, but for detail shots of flowers or a wedding tablescape, it may come in handy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thanks to its extremely versatile focal length range and fast aperture, the Sony FE 16-35mm f/2.8 GM is the most well-rounded wide-angle **lens** that you can buy for your Sony camera. It will cover just about any situation that requires a wide-angle **lens** meaning you can keep from switching **lens**es as frequently. And the image quality is exceptional, allowing you to create detailed, crisp images. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Why it made the cut: Sony pumped this **lens** full of lots of video-focused features, most notably the lack of any focus breathing and the Power Zoom. And at just 12.5 ounces with internal zoom, it would be perfect for use on a gimbal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A wide-angle **lens** is considered anything significantly wider than a normal **lens**. The category typically starts around 35mm. However, within this category of focal length, there are additional subcategories to consider. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you get below 24mm, you get into the realm of ultra-wide-angle **lens**es. Ultra-wide-angle **lens**es are generally necessary for real estate photography. They are also ideal for photographing vast expanses of landscapes or night skies. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The internal focusing operation is extremely fast and totally silent. Even when it has to search for focus a little, which rarely happens, you can’t hear it. Perhaps this **lens**’s biggest plus is the lack of focus breathing. Because that isn’t present, videos are much smoother and more consistent no matter how much you change your focus. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Focal Length is the field of view for a particular camera **lens**, represented in millimeters (mm). The shorter it is, the wider the angle of view is. Some amateur photographers rush to buy ultra-wide **lens**es to raise their real estate photography rates, but shooting too wide can actually distort your photos and stretch the edges of your shot. For the bulk of property photos, **lens**es in the range of 20-25mm are what most of the professionals tend to use. Choosing the wrong focal length may drastically affect your background. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you own a Sony Mirrorless system, you must carry a 50mm prime **lens** for ultimate photography experience. Sony’s 55mm full-frame **lens** is the professionals’ choice due to its performance, size, and price. The **lens** weighs only 281 grams, and it will set well with your Sony A7 III. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Perhaps my only complaint with this **lens** is the lack of focal length markings. Instead of being able to quickly glance at the **lens** to see what focal length you are using, you have to look at the back of the screen or the viewfinder while zooming. It’s a minor annoyance but did cause some frustration. But, the low price of this **lens**, considering the image quality and features it has, definitely makes it worth dealing with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony A7 III is a mirrorless interchangeable-**lens** digital camera that is the most useful full-frame cameras available in the market. It features a combination of value and efficiency. The camera can capture amazing shots even in low light conditions. One can also use this camera to capture wide-angle photos with specialized **lens**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although real estate photography is one of the smaller photography niches, we have noticed more and more people reaching out for advice on what the best real estate **lens** for Sony a6000 cameras is. Due to this, we have decided to make this the subject of today’s article to try and help any of our other readers who find themselves in this same situation. We know that we have a number of readers who use the a6000 as well as other units from the Sony Alpha range so some we hope that you find this article helpful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Images from this **lens** are nice and sharp, especially as you stop down to the more narrow apertures. Unfortunately, there is a decent amount of chromatic aberration and vignetting, which does impact image quality. Vignetting is easy to remove, but removing chromatic aberrations can sometimes be more challenging. Still, it isn’t overpowering and doesn’t severely impact image quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The format is also an important aspect you need to be careful about when investing in a **lens**. When buying the **lens**, make sure it can capture images big enough to cover up the sensor. The sensor’s size varies from one camera to another, which is why you need to ensure that the **lens** you have chosen can cover up the sensor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Compared to other **lens**es in this particular class, this model offers reduced size and weight – making it perfect to carry around with you on the go. Despite this, it doesn’t sacrifice image quality. Indeed, it brings with it a wider angle of view that is perfect for real estate photography in virtually all environments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** features a constant F2.8 max aperture and ensures excellent exposure and depth of field. Its petal shape hood, bayonet type aperture blades make it one of the most stylish wide-angle camera **lens**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’m using it with a new Sony a7iii and after that purchase I needed to really look at **lens**es and my budget. This **lens** seemed like a great fit for Astro photography and was in my budget. So I gave this **lens** a chance and I’m very happy with it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** makes low-light photography and videography unique. Its super-fast aperture will enable you to shoot indoor without using the flash. If you love traveling, this compact camera **lens** can be a perfect companion for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Conclusions 7 If you want to achieve the optimum for your property pictures as a real estate expert, you decide for a digital SLR camera from Nikon. But anyone who frequently also shoots events or people with his equipment, is right at the Canon counter. The **lens** selection depends on the wallet. You may select from the following options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony provided three stops of optical stabilization (OSS). Since most of its crop sensor line-up doesn’t have in-body image stabilization, it will be a welcome addition. It’s useful for still photography as it will allow you to use slower shutter speeds without needing a tripod, but it is also essential for video work. You can get away with some handheld video with that stabilization, whereas it may be too jittery without it. And if you pair it with the a6600, you’ll get image stabilization from both the **lens** and camera for even smoother results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Second, wide-angle **lens**es provide more depth of field when compared to telephoto or even normal **lens**es at the same aperture and framing. If you have a wide-angle **lens** with a maximum aperture of only f/4, you may not be able to get as much background blur as you would like. Other factors contribute to depth of field, of course, but the aperture is an important one. So, if you like to shoot images with pronounced background separation and blur, you’ll want to be sure to get a wide aperture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Conclusions 3 Medium-class cameras with interchangeable **lens**es offer the best compromise between mobility, quality and price for real estate photographs. Whether you opt for a smaller system camera or a digital SLR depends on your quality requirements. You can get top results with the latter models. Read more about this further down when choosing the right brand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although it is a manual focus **lens**, the system is as easy to use as possible and the actual manual focus ring is very responsive and easy to rotate as required. It has a slight resistance to it that allows you to easily and accurately adjust your focus levels as required within seconds. Some compeating camera **lens**es, even at this price point still use the freewheel system with zero resistance on their manual focus ring and it can be a little annoying to use, thankfully though, this is not an issue with the Rokinon 12mm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony Artisan and YouTube content creator Miguel Quiles has also used the new Sony 24-70mm f/2.8 G Master II and notes how it, combined with your Sony camera, makes an unstoppable combination. “What stands out to me about this **lens** is the overall package and how they play off of one another,” he says. “For a **lens** to be small and fast is fine, but if it’s not sharp and the AF performance doesn’t keep up then it doesn’t matter. In this case, this **lens** really gives you the best blend of ergonomics, IQ, AF performance, bokeh and everything else!” Watch the video below as Quiles goes through more of the improved features for the new **lens**: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’ve been working in the US real estate photo business for a long time and wasted more than $30,000 buying different **lens**es. Finally, I’ve found the only and best **lens** for real estate photography, which any property photographer should have. Typically, **lens**es suitable for real estate photos cost somewhere between $300 and $600 for cheaper models and between $1400 and $3000 for premium models. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another exceptional aspect of this **lens** is its sharpness. There is excellent sharpness even when shooting wide open. You will see some slight softness on the edges at f/2.8, though that should be expected. Stopped down, this **lens** is incredible across the frame. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you plan to shoot photos indoors or outdoors, a full-frame ultra-wide-angle **lens** can help you capture outstanding images. Sony has brought another wide-angle **lens** for high-quality photoshoots. The maximum focal length of the **lens** is 20mm. It is a solid ultra-wide prime G **lens** that delivers images with wide-open resolution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Each brand mentions the maximum aperture of the **lens** in the product description section. If you are buying such **lens**es for the first time, can find the aperture details stated like f/2.8. The smaller the number is the greater light the sensor will receive through the **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The focal lengths available in this **lens** are incredibly wide, and photographing with these angles of view is very fun. Especially the 12mm end provides the opportunity to set one's work apart from the crowd. I shared a 16mm example earlier, but 12mm is in another class of wide. The FE 12-24 is a quality **lens**, but note that it does not accept front filters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Autofocus is quick, accurate, and quiet. However, videographers need to be aware that there is noticeable focus breathing. On the other hand, a plus for videographers is that the focus ring can be de-clicked for silent operation. Although the older version of this **lens**–the Sony Zeiss 35mm F1.4 ZA–is still very capable and much cheaper, you simply get a lot more quality from this newer version. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With the new Sony 10-20mm f/4 G PZ **lens**, you can expect a clean and clear image from corner to corner at all zoom settings. The **lens** is the smallest and lightest in its class, making it nice and mobile for those long video shoots. While filming you’ll be amazed by how well the autofocus smoothly tracks your subjects in the frame. The electronic power zoom is also a game changer – it gives excellent responsive control and an adjustable zoom speed so you can set it for the specific shot you’re taking. See what creatives are saying about the **lens** in Hands On With The New Sony 10-20mm f/4 G PZ Power Zoom For APS-C Cameras. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is your first big decision. Do you want a **lens** with variable focal lengths in one package? Each type of **lens** has its own strengths and weaknesses. The right choice for you comes down to your shooting style, personal preference, and the type of situations you will use the **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Image quality was the primary consideration when compiling the **lens** for this list. Aperture was also a significant factor, as many wide-angle situations also require a fast aperture due to limited light. Finally, I considered **lens** size, weight, weatherproofing, focusing abilities, features like focus hold buttons and **lens** markings, and price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Besides, its aspherical **lens** elements will reduce spherical aberration. It features **lens**-based optical stabilization technology. It helps the users to deal with even the slightest movement efficiently. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you plan to buy a wide-angle **lens** for your Sony A7 III or any other camera, you need to take care of some factors before selecting one. Before picking a **lens** for your camera, you need to figure out what kind of **lens** will suit your need best. For example, if you plan to shoot landscape, then a wide angle **lens** will do just fine. However, if you want to take macro shots or portraits, then you need a portrait **lens** for your Sony A7iii. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Real estate photographers take the crop factor number of the camera and multiply it by the focal length of the **lens**. At that point, they can get the equivalent focal length of a 35mm film-based camera. This allows them to take images that are of the same high quality with digital-driven equipment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These cameras are the classic tool for the ambitious photographer through to the professional one. They are available as a digital SLR camera or as a mirrorless system camera. Depending on the genre, preferred by the photographer, the **lens** can be changed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thanks to the wide f/1.4 aperture and the 11-blade diaphragm, it’s easy to get background blur with beautiful bokeh. You’ll be able to get a nice separation between your subject and the background, perfect for portraits or detail shots. The **lens** is also extremely sharp, even when wide open or stopped all the way down. You can use essentially any aperture with this one and not worry about losing out on quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Getting a wide maximum aperture on a wide-angle **lens** is important for two reasons. First, a wider maximum aperture will make the **lens** better for low-light situations. For example, astrophotographers frequently utilize wide-angle **lens**es with wide apertures to gather as much light as possible. A wider aperture is also ideal for occasions like wedding receptions, which typically have limited light. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wide-angle **lens**es, as the name suggests, are the ones that offer a significantly broader view than that of other **lens**es. If you are interested in outdoor and landscape photography with your Sony A7 III, you must pick the right wide-angle **lens**. We have come with a list of 5 best wide-angle **lens**es for Sony A7 III and hope it will help you invest in the right product. If you are looking for the same, here is the list to explore. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Though wide-angle **lens**es aren’t typically used for closeups, this **lens** can focus as close as 9.8 inches, which results in 1:3.8 life-size reproduction. It’s by no means a replacement for a proper macro **lens**. Still, it will be useful for getting those essential detail shots at weddings while allowing you to quickly return to taking portraits without switching **lens**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Entering the world of real estate can be extremely difficult when it comes to navigating through a variety of **lens**es available on the market. In this article, I will help you select the best option for your camera for real estate photography. Whether you prefer a full-frame or a crop sensor camera, read on to learn how to select a great **lens** from a reputable brand. Even if you use the best camera **lens**, you might still need to post-process your photos afterward. Poorly edited photos can dissuade clients from making a purchase. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony - E 10-18mm F4 OSS Wide-Angle Zoom Lens This Sony wide-angle **lens** is perfect for capturing amazing landscapes and cityscapes. The 10-18mm focal length gives you a great range of shooting options, while the F4 aperture ensures that your images are clear and sharp. Plus, the OSS (Optical SteadyShot) system keeps your photos steady even when you're shooting handheld. Check Price - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are interested in outdoor and landscape photography, you must buy the best wide-angle **lens**es. You need to pick the right **lens**es to capture 100% satisfactory images. With the list of the five best wide-angle **lens**es for the Sony A7 III camera, you can choose the right one. Compare the features, read user reviews, and make an informed decision. Happy Clicking! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The old rule, that a **lens** should better be of the same manufacturer as is the camera, is not wrong. Nevertheless, second manufacturers are at least on the same level. The wide-angle **lens**es from Tokina are known for their sharpness, Sigma builds the wide-angle zoom used by most real estate photographers and Tamron successfully digs ground in the full-format sector from Nikon’s professional standard **lens**. The comparison is worthwhile here, because the right decision can save money without sacrificing quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony Artisan Bob Krist has used all three of the above new **lens**es and says,“These three **lens**es have breathed new life into the APS-C format. They are precisely what serious APS-C shooters have needed. And the usefulness of these **lens**es to video shooters with full frame cameras cannot be underestimated because the APS-C crop on full frame video looks so great. This will make the zoom, especially useful for outdoor work where you usually have plenty of light and don’t need the super low light capabilities of Sony full-frame.” Learn more about the **lens**es in the video below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While doing my routine tests with the Sony A7iii, i decided to test 13 different wide angle **lens**es, and i was able to shortlist 5 of them. Out of those 5, the Rokinon RK12M-E was the best bang for your buck, meaning it provided amazing value for your money. If you are looking for something that is more professional, then the Sony E 10-18mm, F4 OSS is a great option. I will talk about each of these **lens**es in detail in the following sections, and we will discuss their pros and cons. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While not inexpensive, this **lens** delivers incredible image quality, despite the extremely-wide angles of view it avails. With f/2.8 available, this Sony **lens** is a great choice for photographing the night sky, along with low light events. Take this **lens** to the most beautiful locations and it is sure to enable you to bring home exceptional results. Note that this does not accept front filters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Therefore, it is important that you use an extreme wide-angle **lens**, which shows a larger image angle, compared with the standard **lens**. But do not exaggerate. If the wide angle is too wide, the image is strongly distorted – a 120-square-feet chamber easily pretends to be a 750-square-feet parlour or details of a house facade shot at a tilted angle suddenly becomes tiny at deep corners. The viewer notices the fake at the least when visiting the property. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Any video shooter’s wishlist of requirements for their kit of **lens**es can really be boiled down to three things: they create high-quality footage, they cover the focal range you need, and they don’t weigh you down. It can seem difficult to put together a kit filled with **lens**es that don’t sacrifice at least one of these requirements, but you can have it all in each of these Sony **lens**es built with video creation in mind. Sony isn’t messing around with these compact masterpieces – they’re built well, they perform well and they won’t overwhelm your kit – especially paired with cameras like the Sony ZV-E10 and Sony Alpha 7C. Video shooters and vloggers check out the list of **lens**es below for a closer look at why they each check the boxes for evolved video quality, complete versatility and unmatched mobility. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In terms of construction, as you would expect from a G Master **lens**, it has a sturdy build with weather sealing. And it has a fluorine coating on the front element to help keep that clean and free of fingerprints and dust. Sony designed this **lens** with 16 elements in 13 groups, including two extreme aspherical and three standard aspherical, to reduce undesired things like distortion and aberration. As with any **lens** this wide, you will get some distortion, but Sony cameras automatically adjust for this, so you won’t even have to think about it. Even if you turn that automatic adjustment off, it is easy to correct in editing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Tamron 17-28 Di III **lens** provides professional-grade image quality in a compact, lightweight package with a very low price. There is little this **lens** lacks aside from switches. The focal length range does not reach the widest or the longest in the class, but it matches perfectly with another exceptional bargain **lens**, the Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8 Di III RXD Lens. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many Samyang **lens**es, especially on other camera systems, don’t offer autofocus capabilities, but this **lens** does. And, its autofocusing is fast and extremely quiet. You can use it for your videos without dealing with obnoxious focus noises. It’s also accurate, even when using Eye AF tracking for humans or animals. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The focal length is another important factor you need to take care of when buying the best wide-angle **lens**. You will find some figures expressed in mm like 18mm, 20mm, 50mm, and more. The higher the focal number the powerful its zoom will be. The lower focal length indicates its ability for excellent wide shoots. If the number is below 50-30mm, it will be good for wide-angle photo shoots. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nevertheless, you can save a few Bucks or Quid by simply checking which second manufacturers are building good **lens**es. The times when Sigma, Tamron, Tokina & Co. have built average **lens**es for hobby photographers for cheap money are over. Many new releases (from around 2014) of these brands can keep pace with high-quality original **lens**es of camera manufacturers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony definitely had video shooters in mind when they designed this **lens**. While it is a great tool for stills and produces beautifully sharp images, it really shines with video. For starters, both zoom and focusing operations are internal. Internal zoom is perfect for those who use gimbals because it won’t throw off the balance of the gimbal if you need to zoom in or out. The variable speed zoom lever also makes zooming easier while recording because you don’t have to twist your wrist around and hope you don’t bump something else in the process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wider still, you get into the fisheye category. Fisheye **lens**es usually range from 8-10mm on a full-frame camera. They aren’t as versatile as other wide-angle **lens**es due to the extreme barrel distortion. Instead, they are more specialized, creative tools. If you want really dramatic images, a fisheye can help create that. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The maximum aperture of the **lens** is F1.8, which will help you capture images with extraordinary field and exposure depth. The **lens** can be an excellent choice for APS-C2 and full-frame cameras. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are looking for a zoomable **lens**, the aperture of such **lens**es will be between f/2.8-f/5.6. The smaller aperture signifies light for the widest angle, while the large figure suggests the light your sensor will get when at the maximum zoom mode. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since most of us have at least one general-purpose/standard zoom **lens** that has wide-angle focal lengths built in (a 24-70mm **lens** for example), an additional wide-angle **lens** is needed to gain even wider angles of view. If your standard zoom has an f/2.8 max aperture, you may also desire a fixed focal length/prime wide-angle **lens** to gain a wider aperture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next up we have our primary **lens** recommendation, the Rokinon 12mm that we feel is the best option for our readers. It has a low price tag considering the image quality that it produces and its 12mm focal range offers an excellent field of view for your photographs. The wide-angle **lens** is able to make some rooms look bigger than they actually are and potentially help you get that initial lead for a potential buyer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But why does it have to be an interchangeable **lens**? For the images in most private scenarios, the supplied or built-in focal lengths are completely sufficient. In real estate photographs, however, you almost always have to switch to a **lens** with an extra wide-angle. This is due to often tight spaces on-location. At the moment I don’t know any high-quality and at the same time affordable camera with a built-in extreme wide-angle **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** features f/1.8 aperture, but it is lighter and smaller than other 55mm **lens**es. The **lens** works well in low light photography and you can make it your travel companion any time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The aperture is relatively fast, and it will help the shooter to capture beautiful images in low-light conditions. The **lens** helps to deliver extremely sharp images. Rokinon is one of the leading DSLR **lens** manufacturers globally, and their **lens**es are known for their unparalleled quality and performance. The **lens** features a compact design and is excellent as a travel accessory. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now it is getting difficult for the author, because he’ll inevitably step on the toes of fanboys of a certain brand or of their haters. My opinion is, of course, subjective, but also based on years of comparisons between the results from different cameras, which I have learned in the context of my picture processing service for realtors. Thus my judgement is based on a solid base of hands-on experience. In the following statements I am referring exclusively to photos from cameras with interchangeable **lens**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the flip side of this though, some people may want to use a **lens** filter for various task while photographing the homes they are trying to sell and the Rokinon 12mm comes with a 67mm **lens** filter thread as standard. Due to the 67mm thread size being popular, you are easily able to source **lens** filters for your specific situation with ease. We always recommend the Gobe 67mm UV filter as a minimum as it helps to protect your front **lens** element during use and while in transit without having any effect on the image quality that you are able to capture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony 24mm f/2.8 G compact prime **lens** is so small and lightweight it gives creatives the chance to work in a nimble, quick and quiet way while producing incredible footage. The 24mm focal length is a favorite among many video shooters because you can include more of the environment in your shots, allowing you to tell a broader story in scenes while keeping all of that sweet sharpness. The sheer size and weight of the **lens** makes it a versatile option and when paired with a small camera like the Sony ZV-E10 or Sony Alpha 7C, you have a travel-friendly content creation machine ready to crank out impressively clear video results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even if real estate professionals do not like it: powerful **lens**es have a higher weight. They consist of significantly fewer plastic and work more precisely with their metallic inner and outer parts. In addition, the built-in glass is of special quality and (partially) provided with high-performance coatings. This helps to minimize the optical losses when refracting light. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Still images are very sharp, with the level of detail on par with much more expensive **lens**es. And while there is some barrel distortion and vignetting, it’s very easy to fix. The f/4 aperture isn’t exceptionally fast, but it still allows for a pleasantly shallow depth of field with excellent bokeh. It can focus as close as 9.5 inches at 35mm, so you can get some fun detail shots with this wide-angle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Its features technologies like w/ high surface precision and two XA elements. The maximum magnification ratio of the **lens** is (x) – 0.19, while the minimum focus distance is 0.92 ft or 0.28mtr. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It offers no less than three aspherical **lens** elements that, along with the super UD glass element, create superior images in virtually all conditions. Not only that, but it offers an incredible close focusing distance of just 0.9 feet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony 10-18mm f/4 ultra wide zoom is a unique **lens** that’s been in the Sony lineup for years and still holds firm as a favorite for video shooters today. It’s lightweight, it’s sharp and it adds that ultra-wide perspective video shooters often need to tell the whole story. Videographer and content creator Chris Brockhurst creates videos for his YouTube Channel where he explains how he uses different gear in real-world situations. He likes to shoot wide-angle and finds it especially useful when creating real estate videos, and he relies on the Sony 10-18mm f/4 **lens** to get the framing he needs. In his video below he shows the wider field of view provided by the Sony 10-18mm f/4 as he takes you on a real estate shoot with his video rig. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because of the wide angle **lens** I was still able to capture the milky way, even though the moon was in the sky and I was in a high light pollution area. I found two local parks, in the city, and gave it a shot. (See photos) I can’t wait for the galactic core and new moon to be back in my local sky. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This versatile **lens** is meant for those photographers who work on action shoots. If you cover sporting events or any such situations where quick shots are required, you can prefer this **lens**. Manufactured by Sony, many professional photographers around the world love this **lens**. At 35mm, one can use the **lens** to shoot high-quality photographs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’m still trying to fine tune the sharpness of close up shots. It’s not a true macro but you can get really close. These flower photos were taken from less than a foot away and then cropped. I thought they were pretty good for a wide angle **lens**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While this **lens**'s focal length range is not as dramatic as the Sony equivalent, the cost is not as dramatic either. The Sigma 14-24mm f/2.8 DG DN Art Lens impresses with the image quality it delivers, the build and aesthetic qualities are excellent, and AF is fast and quiet. Note that this does not accept front filters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Conclusions 4 You need a good **lens** with the widest possible wide angle. Smartphones and compact cameras with their fixed mini-optics are therefore excluded. Do not buy the apparently inexpensive bundles (kits) from the electronics wholesale market when it comes to cameras with interchangeable **lens**es. Purchase the camera body separately at the dealer of your trust and use the saved Dollars for a decent **lens**. Even if it sounds painful, the old basic rule is: The price for a good **lens** starts at the price of the camera body. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These elements help the **lens** to reproduce an excellent point light source. The 20mm F1.8 G ultra-wide **lens** comes with a switchable click stop. You can turn it ON for stills and OFF for video shooting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’ve been involved in photography in various capacities for the last 15 years or so, and throughout that time, I’ve worked with many different **lens**es. Wide-angle **lens**es are some of my favorite tools for creating unique images. My bread and butter in the past was real estate photography, both as a photographer and the manager of a busy photography team at a vacation rental company. Those experiences exposed me to a vast variety of wide-angle **lens**es, both good and bad. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** also comes with internal focusing as an additional feature. The short minimum focusing distance and quick autofocusing help the camera to capture stunning images. The **lens** features a filter threat in the front, and it does not rotate with the **lens**. If you use a polarizing filter, the feature will be an added advantage for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Why the new Sony 24-70mm f/2.8 G Master II for video and vlogging? Not only was the newest iteration of the beloved G Master designed for all types of video applications, it’s as mobile as it comes in this class of zooms. When you use this **lens** you will find it to be smaller, lighter and faster, so it won’t bog you down on a long day of shooting. It’s also packed with a number of features for advanced video creation like its Linear Response Manual Focus and extremely quiet AF operation. All-in-all, it’s one of the most versatile **lens**es in the lineup and one any content creator will find useful for video. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The aspherical **lens** elements will help you to reduce aberration. The **lens** features Carl Zeiss T* coating. Its high-quality coating removes **lens** flares, light scattering, and internal reflection. T* coating plays a major role in capturing stunning images. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you take all of this into account it is easy to see why the **lens** is so popular amongst the Sony a6000 and wider Sony Alpha using community. It is extremely versatile and offers outstanding image quality for its price point. It’s not surprising that so many photographers who use the **lens** have opted to post their own glowing independent reviews for the **lens** that are well worth reading. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just got my new Laowa 12 mm Zero-d **lens** and I like a lot about it. I’m a hobbiest and I’m learning a new hobby, a new camera, and a new **lens**, all at the same time. I don’t usually do reviews, but this is the least expensive wide angle **lens** you can buy for Sony full frame cameras and it does work. And I thought I should share the news. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But it does not necessarily have to be the full format sensor of professional battleships. There is a successful intermediate stage in modern SLR and mirrorless system cameras: the so-called APS-C, DX or Four Thirds formats. With these models the construction of the camera and mostly also of the **lens**es is more compact, while the picture quality is still very acceptable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sony FE 14mm f/1.8 GM is one of those **lens**es that make one grateful to be photographing at this time. Those photographing architecture, real estate, large products, or other subjects in a confined space, those photographing the great outdoors, including landscape and night sky photography, and those who simply want to get creative with ultra-wide-angles will want the Sony FE 14mm f/1.8 GM Lens in their kit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L USM Ultra Wide Angle Zoom Lens This Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L USM Ultra Wide Angle Zoom Lens is a great choice for Canon SLR Cameras. With its 17-40mm focal length and f/4 maximum aperture, it's perfect for capturing beautiful, wide shots in all conditions. Plus, its aspherical **lens** elements and super UD glass element create superior optics no matter the situation, while its ultrasonic monitor (USM) produces fast and silent autofocusing. And with a focusing distance of 0.9 feet and a rounded seven-blade diaphragm Check Price - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you can see from our comparison table above, we have three different recommended camera **lens**es for your a6000 that the community tend to use for real estate photography. First up we have the Sony 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 and although it is cheap and we see people using it, in our opinion it really should be avoided for use in the real estate niche. Its 16mm minimum focal length is not ideal and can make the rooms you are photographing look smaller than the other two featured **lens**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sony 16-35mm Vario-Tessar T FE F4 ZA OSS E-Mount Lens The Sony 16-35mm Vario-Tessar T FE F4 ZA OSS E-mount **lens** is a great choice for landscapes and the a7 series of full-frame cameras. With ZEISS T (T star) coating to reduce flare and ghosting, three ED glass elements to suppress chromatic distortion, and built-in Optical Steady Shot image stabilization, this **lens** is perfect for capturing beautiful photos and videos. The dust and moisture-resistant design also make it ideal for outdoor use. Check Price - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Prime **lens**es will be perfect for those who need to take sharp photos, but zoom **lens**es have more uses. They are almost just as sharp as prime **lens**es, but you can use them for taking different kinds of photos, which makes them a great bang for your buck. Even if you are on a tight budget, it might be a good idea to pay more for a zoom **lens** to take photos at different focal lengths. Besides, such **lens**es are pretty lightweight, and you can easily fit them into your camera bag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That said though, some a6000 bundles have the **lens** included meaning some of our readers may not have it. If you are on a tight budget or taking part in real estate photography as a favor to a friend then you can probably get by with the Sony 16-50mm. That said though if you are a professional real estate agent and you will be taking photographs of properties on a regular basis then either of the other two featured **lens**es is superior options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **lens** has also been fully optimized for the best possible optical image quality with a field of view of up to 110 degrees. This ultra-wide frame just keeps on scoring points for the **lens** in the real estate photography niche as it allows you to capture more of the property in the same image with the highest possible image quality. The **lens** also has a minimum focusing distance of just under eight inches too and although this will not work to your advantage for capturing the rooms of the property due to the range, it can help with any potential close up images you need to show things in detail. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I very frequently encounter the need for focal lengths wider than those in my standard zoom **lens** and seldom go on a shoot without having the wide angles covered. Some specific subjects requiring a wide-angle **lens** include landscape, real estate/architecture, and interior photography. Interiors can include those of a building, vehicle, aircraft, etc. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   From the middle class onwards, the functionalities and results for real estate photography are acceptable. Mirrorless system cameras from Sony, Fuji, Panasonic Lumix, Pentax and Olympus are playing in the same league, perhaps with slight advantages for Sony. Digital SLRs of Nikon and Canon are ahead with some distance – not only because of the much larger pool of available **lens**es of all focal lengths and quality classes. I consider Nikon cameras in the field of real estate photography for the better choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nikon camera owners with crop sensors, however, would likely want to invest in the Nikon AF-P DX NIKKOR 10-20mm f/4.5-5.6G VR Lens. It offers an ultra-wide-angle view that goes far beyond anything that you’d be able to get in a traditional **lens** kit, allowing you to get exactly as creative with your compositions as you need to make the best impression that you can. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the main reasons that we would recommend the Rokinin 12mm **lens** so highly for any type of real estate photography with your Sony a6000 is its excellent 12mm focal range that allows you to capture the rooms of your properties in all their glory. This can work to your advantage by making rooms look large and due to being a prime **lens** as well as its f/2.0 **lens** aperture your photography look lighter, brighter, and sharper even in low light conditions making rooms look vibrant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Compact cameras, considered as classic holiday snapshot cameras, are now decreasingly to be found. In the meantime, they have widely been replaced by smartphones and therefore they are also not really suitable for the successful real estate sales business. In particular, their cheap **lens**es make any real estate photographer’s life hard. They often cause image errors that drastically increase towards the edge of the image. Blurs, color fringing and dark corners are the result. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The manufacturer has used a silent linear motor that makes the **lens** exceptionally quiet. Also, you will get a distance encoder and play a crucial role in flash metering. The **lens** component can detect the target object’s position and send signals to the CPU to analyze the distance of the target object. That’s why it’s considered to be a great **lens** for real estate photography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
