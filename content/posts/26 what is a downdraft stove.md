## 26 Fun Facts What Is A Downdraft Stove | How To Vent A Downdraft Cooktop
-   If you had to choose one, check out the JennAir. This JennAir cooktop has 17,000 BTU (British Thermal Unit) and 15,000 BTU burners. This cooktop’s **downdraft** has over 300 CFM (Cubic Feet Per Minute) of power. CFM is the amount of air that is extracted per minute by blower or fan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are only two brands that make **downdraft** cooktops, KitchenAid and JennAir. KitchenAid and JennAir **downdraft** cooktops are available in 36 and 30 inches. Then again, they are the same unit with a slightly different style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Each of these solutions can have different costs to you depending on your needs and your kitchen's design. Consult with a contractor if you're considering installing new ventilation or changing the location of your range. If you're considering the cooktop option, check out our **downdraft** electric cooktop reviews. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Powerful ventilation can be hidden out of sight. A **downdraft** range hood hides inside the cabinetry behind the range, eliminating the need for an overhead vent. These hoods are concealed with the touch of a button keeping your kitchen’s open concept and beautiful sightlines. Explore the uninterrupted design of the BEST **downdraft** range hoods. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All **downdraft** cooktops are dated. Any cooktop can be a **downdraft** by adding the **downdraft** separately. These componentry **downdraft**s are better as well in CFM exhaust. You can buy them at 600 or even 1200 CFM compared to the 350 CFM of the JennAir. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Second, you need to determine the size of the **downdraft** range hood that you need. **downdraft** range hoods come in a variety of sizes, so it is important to measure your kitchen before you shop. Third, you need to decide what type of ventilation system you want. Downdraft range hoods can be vented through the roof or a wall, and they can be either ducted or non-ducted. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Replace your **downdraft** range with a **downdraft** cooktop OR non-vented cooktop + an independent **downdraft** vent - Independent pop-up **downdraft** vents take up space under your counter but may be able to use the existing ductwork for your **downdraft** range (consult with a contractor to make sure). These vents are usually at least $1,000. Downdraft cooktops are more widely available than **downdraft** ranges and are usually $1,400+. This method will work best if you have space to install a wall oven elsewhere. Pictured below: The Broan 273603. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also implementing this technology, Siemens introduce their 80cm FlexInduction Cooktop with Integrated Downdraft Ventilation. In addition to offering flexible cooking zones which allow you to place different sized cookware anywhere in the zone, the centrally placed **downdraft** unit lays almost flat with the rest of the cooktop. Its super streamlined design saves you heaps of kitchen space while still providing superb extraction. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A few manufacturers still recommend this type of installation of a pro cooktop with a **downdraft**, but it is not an appropriate solution. If you are facing this quandary, consider induction, which is more powerful than a professional cooktop but emits much less heat.Downdrafts were first manufactured 30 years ago, and the blower speeds have been improved in the last few years. However, they are not equipped to handle the heat output of a professional range. Remember, there is almost no capture area in a **downdraft**, so the smoke will almost bypass the **downdraft** completely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   - Smoke is captured and then exhausted. You need a tall deep hood if you cook. Unlike a range hood, there is little or no capture area in a **downdraft**. That smoke will billow past your **downdraft** into your kitchen and home if you are stir-frying on the front burners. Duct Run - You are also reversing the flow of the smoke and adding an elbow, reducing the static flow of the exhaust. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rangehoods have long been part of our kitchens – freeing us from smoke, steam, grease, and smells. Typically placed over the cooktop, new technology these days has allowed for rangehoods to be combined into the cooktop. And voila introducing **downdraft** ventilation technology! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dual fuel ranges offer the best of both worlds: gas burners and an electric oven. The KitchenAid KSDG950ESS is a four-burner **downdraft** slide in range with dual fuel technology retailing for around $3,699. Like the previous model, it has Even-Heat True Convection and the same interior oven features and controls. The burner power ranges from 5,000 BTU up to 15,000 BTU. Three continuous grate sections make it easy to move cookware around. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We hope this article has helped you on your new appliance journey. You can do the cost-benefit analysis pretty easily: if you could spend the same amount or less on a new slide-in or freestanding range plus a range hood, you should consider going that route. With the models above, the non-**downdraft** equivalents cost about $600 less. Slide-in range retail pricing starts at around $1,300, so your savings could be even more significant depending on what you're looking for in a new range. And, of course, holiday sales and package deals can save you hundreds of dollars as well, so if you can time your purchase based on these deals you could save even more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In new construction, you should not be using a **downdraft**. Every other venting option is a better choice. We will cover the efficiency of **downdraft**s extensively and show you tons of venting ideas, including **downdraft**s, other options, and Make-Up Air regulations to be aware of. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should consider an island hood because it is only directing rising air. Unlike **downdraft**s, hoods do not have to pull air in another direction. They can capture volumes of smoke and grease as well. You should try to incorporate a hood before thinking about a **downdraft**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The newest addition to **downdraft** ventilators is the Bosch 80cm Induction cooktop with integrated ventilation. The cooktop’s CombiZone offers flexibility for you to combine two cooking zones, which is perfect for larger pots and pans. The 9 fan speeds and intensive setting gives you ultimate control over how much air you want extracted, all very easily controlled via the DirectSelect touch control panels. Maintaining effective extraction is simple thanks to the filter saturation indicator, letting you know when it’s time to clean the cast-iron air inlet grid, which is also dishwasher safe. Cooking up a storm while maintaining an odourless kitchen is now so effortless! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Downdraft ventilators are becoming increasingly popular as they allow for a more streamlined look to your kitchen. We’re also wanting more and more features in our kitchens while trying to keep them as spacious and space-saving as possible, so **downdraft** cooktops are perfect to save space. Read more about the evolution of the kitchen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many people prefer the fact that smoke, steam, and other fumes are extracted much closer from your pots and pans – BEFORE they rise into the air. This is different to overhead rangehoods, where fumes first move through the air and past your face before being removed. This is where **downdraft** ventilators will be a helping hand, extracting all the smoke and steam before it can move upwards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is easy. Jenn-Air is the only manufacturer of **downdraft** ranges as GE, Roper, Amana and Modern Maid have long exited this niche. It is integral in the middle of the unit and available in electric and dual fuel. The blower is roughly the same as an over-the-range microwave at 310 CFM, so keep the cooking on the light side (or open a window). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When shopping for a **downdraft** range hood, it is important to consider the size of your kitchen and the type of ventilation you need. You will also want to make sure that the hood you choose fits your budget. With so many great options on the market, you are sure to find the perfect **downdraft** range hood for your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Downdraft ranges used to be a popular option for kitchen islands and peninsulas, but they have become less popular over the years so there are few options today. Downdraft ranges are different from traditional ranges in that they don't need separate ventilation above the **stove**top. Instead, they have the ventilation mechanism built right into the range itself. This eliminates the need for an over the range microwave or vent hood to provide separate ventilation. Overall, **downdraft** vents are not as effective as overhead ventilation, so if you do a lot of cooking, especially with high heat, we don't recommend them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Buy one of a handful of **downdraft** ranges available from KitchenAid or Jenn-Air - This seriously limits your options if you want to have flexibility in the brand and features you choose. We're also not sure how long these models will be around. However, this can be the most cost-effective option for some kitchen setups. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Downdraft range hoods are available in a variety of sizes, including 30 inch, 36 inch, 45 inch, and 48 inch. So, no matter what your needs may be, there is sure to be a **downdraft** range hood that will fit. In addition, **downdraft** range hoods are available in both standard and slim models, so you can find the perfect fit for your kitchen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Powerful ventilation can be hidden out of sight. A **downdraft** range hood hides inside the cabinetry behind the range, eliminating the need for an overhead vent. These hoods are concealed with the touch of a button keeping your kitchen’s open concept and beautiful sightlines. Explore the uninterrupted design of the Best **downdraft** range hoods. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a number of different brands that make **downdraft** range hoods. Some of the best-known brands include Miele, Thermador, Viking, Whirlpool, and Wolf. All of these brands make high-quality **downdraft** range hoods that are sure to meet your needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a few things to consider when shopping for **downdraft** range hoods. First, you need to decide whether you want a ducted or non-ducted model. Ducted models are more expensive, but they are also more effective at removing smoke and odors from the kitchen. Non-ducted models are less expensive and easier to install, but they are not as effective at removing smoke and odors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
