## 18 Reference List: Best Roller For Eggshell Paint On Wood | Best Roller For Satinwood Paint
-   Paint **roller**s come in several different sizes, so it's important to consider the area you will be working in before deciding on a paint **roller**. If you are painting average-sized walls, then it's best to look for a standard **roller**, which typically measures 9 inches in length. For larger walls and ceilings, you can find oversize paint **roller**s that range in size from 12 inches to 18 inches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many people grab the first paint **roller** they see without considering the size of the **roller**, where the **roller** will be used, or the type of **roller** cover. This mistake can delay the project and the wrong **roller** cover could result in an uneven finish. Take some time to learn about what to consider when buying a paint **roller**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you need to choose a paint **roller** cover or sleeve, it's necessary to figure out what material is best for the job. Paint **roller** covers are typically made of woven or knit synthetic material, lambswool, or foam. Opt for woven or knit synthetic paint **roller** covers if you are painting interior walls and ceilings. This fabric doesn't shed as much as lambswool and it creates a smooth, even finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On average, a paint **roller** costs about $10 to $100. As with most tools, specialized products tend to cost more, like textured paint **roller**s or paint-specific specialty paint **roller**s. Mini paint **roller**s, manual paint **roller**s, and pad paint **roller**s are all relatively similar in price, occupying the low end of this price range. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paint **roller**s are a relatively basic tool. They consist of a handle, a metal frame, and a metal **roller** that holds a paint **roller** cover. Despite the simplicity of the tool, there are still several types of paint **roller**s and a range of paint **roller** cover options based on size, function, **roller** cover fabric, and pile height. Discover how to choose a paint **roller** that's suitable for your next home renovation project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Similar to textured paint **roller**s, a specialty paint **roller** is intended to create specific paint patterns. The main difference between the two types is that specialty paint **roller**s are not just manual paint **roller**s with an innovative **roller** sleeve. These are specialized tools designed by the manufacturer for specific textured paints. You don't need to use these **roller**s with the textured paint, but you may get better results with the specialized tool over a more general-use textured paint **roller** sleeve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When a manual **roller** is too big to use for thin surfaces or to get into tight corners, the mini paint **roller** is the way to go. They come in a range of sizes, including 2-inch, 3-inch, 4-inch, and 6-inch, allowing you to select the right length based on the needs of the project. Some types of mini **roller**s are used with small-diameter mini hot dog **roller** sleeves. The reason they are referred to as mini hot dog **roller**s is because, with the small diameter and short pile height, the **roller** sleeves resembles a mini hot dog. The thin **roller** sleeve is ideal for painting in tight corners and difficult to reach places, like behind the toilet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Start by cutting in with a brush. Next, use a **roller** to fill the wall expanse. Make W shapes to release the most amount of paint from the **roller**, then go over the area with vertical strokes to evenly distribute it. Work in 3-by-3-foot sections to keep a wet edge and avoid lap marks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While they are still considered a type of **roller**, pad **roller**s do not roll. They have a flat pad that absorbs and releases the paint onto the target surface in straight, even strokes. The design of these **roller**s helps to prevent paint splatters that are common with manual paint **roller**s. However, paint pads only apply a thin layer of paint to the wall, ceiling, or any other surface, so they aren't very good for covering darker or more vibrant colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A textured paint **roller** actually refers to the **roller** sleeve, instead of the actual **roller**. You can use a manual **roller** with a textured paint sleeve to create innovative patterns or mimic designs, like wood grain, brick, or stone textures. The sleeves are made with foam and have individual patterns etched in to create the desired look, though these patterns can be difficult to appreciate on small walls on surfaces, so it's best to use textured paint **roller**s on larger walls where the pattern is easy to see. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, if you are working with trim, doors, doorframes, or narrow walls, a mini paint **roller** is the right way to go. They come in a variety of lengths, including 2-inch, 3-inch, 4-inch, and 6-inch. Just keep in mind that a project may need more than one size of **roller**. Don't try to find an all-purpose **roller** for every surface when it's relatively inexpensive to pick up the right size paint **roller** for the task. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting a room is a common DIY project that many people undertake on their own. They pick up paint, a paint tray, a paintbrush, and a paint **roller**, then get started painting the walls. However, if you haven't tackled a paint project before, you may not know that paint, paint trays, paintbrushes, and paint **roller**s come in several different types. Choosing the wrong paint tray can slow down the project, while selecting the wrong brush can leave you with a streaky finish. For these reasons along with several others, it's important to learn more about the paint and tools you need before starting a project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Standard interior paint projects will typically require a paint **roller** sleeve with a 3/8-inch to 1/2-inch nap or pile height. However, for rougher surfaces, like the back deck or fence, a 3/4-inch to 1-inch pile height is suitable. Brick, cinder block, and stone may require a thicker paint **roller** pile ranging from about 1 1/4 inches to 1 1/2 inches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you are working inside or outside matters. Paint **roller** sleeves have a fabric pile or nap that absorbs the paint and releases it when the **roller** is pressed against a surface. Smooth, interior surfaces should be painted with a 3/8-inch to 1/2-inch **roller** sleeve to get a soft, even finish. However, to ensure that you get an even finish on a textured exterior wall, stucco surface, deck, or fence, go with a 3/4-inch to 1-inch pile height. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most common type of paint **roller** is known as a manual paint **roller**. These are the standard paint **roller**s with a simple handle, frame, and rotating metal **roller** that are typically used for painting interior walls and ceilings. They can also be used outdoors for painting exterior surfaces when they are equipped with the right paint **roller** cover. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In order to get the best results, it's important to match the tool to the paint. If you are painting the room with a flat or **eggshell** latex paint, then a knit synthetic **roller** sleeve is the right choice, but if you are using a glossy latex paint for the job, it would be better to rely on a woven **roller** cover. Lambswool **roller** covers can also be used with glossy latex paint, though they are better for applying oil-based paint. If you are working with varnish or polyurethane, a foam **roller** is the best option. These foam **roller**s can also be used for applying soft, even coats of paint to very soft surfaces, like fine furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The woven synthetic covers work best with glossy finishes, while the knit synthetic **roller** sleeves are better for flat or **eggshell** finishes. If you are working with oil-based paints, switch to a lambswool **roller** cover for a more even finish. Lambswool is also a good choice for glossy latex paint. Just keep in mind that the **roller**s tend to shed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The size and type of **roller** can heavily depend on the location you are working in. Average-sized walls and ceilings can be painted with a standard manual paint **roller** or you can use a textured paint **roller** for a more customized appearance. Go with a mini paint **roller** if you are working in tight spaces or need to paint baseboards, door frames, window frames, and any other thin surfaces. A pad paint **roller** can be a great choice for applying a thin second coat of paint over the first coat and it can help to even out the finish, just keep in mind that the pad only applies a thin layer of paint, so it isn't a good option if you need to cover a bold color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
