## 7 Things You Should Know About Black Oxide Or Titanium Coated Drill Bits | Drilling
-   Before **drill**ing make sure your cords won’t get caught on items around your work area and that your cord is long enough to complete your work. Make sure the area your working in is clear of debris and that your direct **drill**ing area is clean and well-marked. This advice is both for the work quality and your personal safety. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Chucks are important to **drill**ing in that these tools help hold and secure the **drill** bit not just for safety reasons but for accuracy and efficiency. One of the leading manufacturers of keyed and keyless chucks is Jacobs. Arthur Irving Jacobs is credited with creating the first **drill** chuck back in the beginning of the 20th century. Since then Jacobs Manufacturing Company maintains a global presence as a recognized leader in the design and manufacturing of precision tools and work holding devices for stationary equipment and portable power tools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The length of the body is important to how the **drill** bit performs, longer **drill** bits are great for **drill**ing into thick materials but the length sacrifices the rigidity of the bit making it more likely to break. Short **drill** bits are an excellent choice for precision work where the workpiece is clamped in a **drill** press or to a table. The downside is that shorter **drill**s do not work well on thicker materials. The jobber length **drill** bit offers the best of both worlds. They are 9 to 14 times the length of the diameter, these **drill** bits are long enough to **drill** into most material thicknesses yet, short enough to provide durability and rigidity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Jobber **drill**s or jobber length **drill** bits are the most commonly used **drill** bits for most jobs. They are shorter than standard **drill** bits and are less likely to break off. This makes them good for hand **drill**s and **drill**ing holes in a thin material. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drill bits have three primary parts, the point, the body and the shank. The **drill** bits shank is inserted into the chuck of the **drill** and secured. The point is where the cutting element is located and the body has channels cut into it called flutes, this helps remove material as you **drill**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many people don’t realize how far or how fast a **drill** can send flying debris, especially into their face. Take a few minutes to put on protective glasses or a face mask to help stop dust and flying debris from getting in your eyes and mouth. Make sure you have nothing on that can get caught up in the rotating **drill**, things like loose clothing or dangling jewelry can easily create a serious situation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also called “blackening” black oxide is a conversion coating used on metal that adds a layer of corrosion resistance and abrasion resistance. The coating helps reduce friction between the workpiece and the **drill** bit improving the effectiveness of **drill**ing and making the bit last longer. Many tradesmen recommend black oxide bits as being the best general-purpose **drill** bits. These bits are also ideal for good performance in soft metal, low alloy steel, plastic, and wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
