## 18 Tips to Basement Half Wall Ledge Ideas | basement half wall ledge ideas
-   There are several unfinished **basement** ideas out there, but you’ll want to look beyond these. Instead, focus on ideas that help you finish the space. This makes it more welcoming and comfortable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Don’t be scared of painting your **basement** walls black. With the right lighting and decor, you can prevent your **basement** from looking like a dark **basement**. Try to pick one of your **basement** walls to be an accent wall. Then you can paint that one wall black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have the budget, you can even find authentic salvaged or reclaimed wood. This would give your **basement** a sense of authenticity. Choose leather or suede furniture to balance the wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your **basement** is the perfect opportunity to add more usable space to your home. That square footage is just sitting under your home. Why not turn it into something more than just storage? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Completely transform the look of your **basement** with wallpaper. People don’t typically consider wallpaper because **basement**s are damp, and wallpaper isn’t compatible with dampness. However, if you’ve finished your **basement**, then using modern wallpaper shouldn’t be an issue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can continue this look throughout the entire **basement**. Create a contrasting look on the **basement** stairs. The front of the stairs can mimic the shiplap look with a white wood front. The top of the stairs can be a warm wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adding wood paneling to your **basement** walls will create a warm and welcoming environment. You could do this by mounting wood planks on the walls. However, this will require more work as you’ll need to finish the wood and mount each one individually. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use can lights in the ceiling to create lighting in the different areas. This helps to define the space and keep the **basement** feeling bright. You can also balance the black with light wood flooring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re handy and have some experience with home construction projects, then you can DIY your **basement** finishing. Start by treating your concrete walls with a vapor barrier. This prevents the moisture from outside coming in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A simpler solution is to buy prefabricated wood panels. You can buy them by the square foot, so you get just what you need. The panels then hook together and glue or nail to your wall. This is an affordable and easy DIY solution for a finished **basement** wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Leaving your **basement** wall bare with the cinderblock exposed can create a modern and industrial feel. This creates an unfinished **basement** look with minimal effort. However, it doesn’t give the warmest or coziest feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike cinder blocks, stone can create a cave-like feel in a good way. It’s the perfect wall treatment for turning your **basement** into a wine cellar. For this look, use a large wood stone design. You can do this with wallpaper, wall panels, or even real stone. The method you choose will depend on the budget. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With a finished **basement**, you could turn part of it into your laundry room. This gives you more space upstairs. Turn your old laundry room into a walk-in closet or other small usable space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Only those who attempt the absurd will achieve the impossible. I think it’s in my **basement**… let me go upstairs and check.” – M. C. Escher - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Try painting the cinder blocks for a simple and affordable finished **basement**. You may need to apply a moisture barrier coating first or risk the paint bubbling and peeling. The foundation walls have earth on the outside. Moisture in the ground can seep through the cinder block and into your **basement**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Stacked stone is a modern look that can add texture to your **basement**. It’s perfect for finishing the wall of your **basement**. Create an accent wall. Cover the front of your **basement** bar. Build a half wall that separates the space into separate usable areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black can make the **basement** ceiling recede and feel taller than it really is. No matter what color you choose, paint everything, from the HVAC system to the ceiling joists. This creates a finished look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you don’t want to embrace the look of your unfinished **basement** walls, then you have options. Turn that concrete wall into something beautiful with a simple coat of paint. Finish the concrete **basement** wall with drywall, paneling, shiplap, or wallpaper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
