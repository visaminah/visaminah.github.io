## 3 Tips to Garage Door Bottom U Channel | Garage Door Seals: Bottom Inserts
-   A2040 U Shaped Aluminum Bottom Seal Retainer is 2 inches by 2 inches in size, fits most 2-inch thick garage **door**s, and is compatible with any 1/4 inch T-style or T-End vinyl seal, rubber seal, bulb seal and Xcluder seal. Designed to be installed at the bottom of the **door** with fasteners on both residential and commercial garage **door**s. The “U” weather seal retainer design has two mounting plates to install on both sides of a garage **door**, and provides a more heavy-duty mount than our L-Shaped garage **door** bottom seal retainers. Works with a compatible bottom weather seal to keep small pests at bay and blocks dust, leaves, rain, snow, and other weather from getting inside a residential garage, workplace, or other facility. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you've noticed water, dirt, or rodent droppings in your garage, there's a good chance the problem can be traced back to your garage **door**. Garage **door**s are very large, and while all come with a bottom seal to keep out water, wind, dirt, and unwanted intruders, the seals themselves can break down over time. In more extreme cases, the concrete floor or driveway apron under the **door** can shift, crack, or settle, creating large gaps under the **door** that standard seals can't cover. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your garage **door** is working well, then weather-sealing can be mostly a DIY job. Sometimes, the garage **door** needs a gasket replacement, adjustment, or other type of repair. Because it's vital that your garage **door** work and seal properly, you may want a professional garage **door** installation company to handle the job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
