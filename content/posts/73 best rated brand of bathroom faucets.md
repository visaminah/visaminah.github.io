-   A quick tip: It’s never a bad idea to pick out accompanying hardware and handle styles after establishing the type of faucet you want, either in your sink, shower, or tub, though it’s important to note that the way handles operate will heavily influence the functionality of your bathroom design. “One-handle **faucets** are optimal—turning them allows you to control the water temperature and volume, while lifting or lowering it will change the water pressure to your desired settings,” says Danielson. Just as popular, two-handle **faucets** offer two separate controls that flank the spout on the left and right sides. “But many are opting for touchless or touch-activated **faucets**, often with no handle at all,” she adds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Widespread **faucets** have separate hot and cold handles that are independent of the spout and can be mounted on the countertop or on the sink itself. They are often mounted on sinks with three holes that fit 8 inches to 16 inches from one side to the other. If you are renovating and have the choice, widespread **faucets** are more popular than centerset because they have a more built-in look, you can space the handles however you want, and they are easier to clean.
