## 14 Fun Facts Best Impact Wrench For Cars Reddit | Impact Wrench Reddit
-   Clicker **wrench**es are different, and wonderfully convenient to use. They have an adjustable ring around the base of the handle that lets you set the exact torque you want to apply to a nut or bolt. When you have tightened the fastener to the set torque, a ratchet mechanism clicks loudly to alert you that the set torque has been reached and you should stop tightening. No scrutinizing hard-to-read dials while you tighten. Screwing the handle in and out moves an indicator up and down the scale, varying the point where the torque-indicating click occurs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   what brand torque **wrench** is a good moderately priced one? So far I am interested in Sonic Torque Wrench . Not sure which one would be the most useful. Any recommendations? Anything against Sonic? I'd be willing to spend up to $200 on a torque **wrench**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All things being equal, higher voltage will give you more power—but there are cases for lower voltage. With smaller batteries, 12-volt **impact** **wrench**es are more compact. This makes them good for smaller jobs, working overhead, or getting into tight spaces. Tools with 18 and 20 volts have less difference between them. Generally, 18-volt tools with advanced features and capabilities make them more versatile and easier to use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My mind is boggling with all the youtube vlogs about the different Impact **wrench**es!!!!!! Seen one abt a Makita clone, not impressed.There are quite a number of Impact **wrench**es that are the same but have different names like the Clark ones which are the same as other brands.Dewalt are the best as far as I can see, the look better than Milwaukee but are pricey for occasional use. The old adage though, you get what you pay for?The two DeWalt 899 and 894 look and get very good reviews. The 899 is a beast of a thing while the 894 is smaller and compact and costs more than the 899?Wouldn't it be great to get a good decent **wrench** for £50!!!If you can, let me Know. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The good news is that cordless, battery-powered **impact** **wrench**es have gotten better as battery technology improves, which has brought prices down and made them viable alternatives to their pneumatic cousins. In fact, cordless **impact** **wrench**es have a tremendous advantage: mobility. Not being tied to a compressor with an air hose, these tools can easily go wherever they’re needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, all that brute strength isn’t very useful if you can’t control the tool. Fortunately, **impact** **wrench**es are extremely comfortable to use because the concussive blows smoothly transfer most of that high-energy torque directly to the fastener, not to your hand, wrist, or arm. As a result, the twisting motion—known as reactionary torque—that you feel when using an electric drill is virtually eliminated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Digital torque **wrench**es are among the most expensive and the most accurate. These use an electronic strain gauge inside the handle to send a signal to an LED window. The downsides are that they must be handled carefully and require a battery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are four basic types of torque **wrench**es, each with slightly different operating principles: beam or deflection, dial indicator, clicker, and digital. The beam- and dial-indicator-types use a simple mechanical system that connects to a pointer that hovers above a torque scale attached to the handle or to the dial indicator. When force is applied to the **wrench**'s bending handle, the scale or dial shows the amount of torque equivalent to the handle's deflection. If you're buying a beam- or dial-indicator-type, you'll want a large pointer or gauge face for working in dark underhood locations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Looking to get my bf the Milwaukee M18 1/2" Impact Wrench as an anniversary gift.... he's talked about having an **impact** **wrench** forever to work on his truck and from what I've seen, this is a good choice. I don't know much about tools, so was wondering if anyone can confirm this? Also, does he just need the **wrench** or are there other specific parts he would need to use it? Again, not really sure how tools like this work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The difference between a basic **wrench** and a torque **wrench** is that the latter indicates—with either an electronic window, a clicking noise, a needle, or a gauge—exactly how much force is being applied to its handle. It's important, but not well-known, that many fasteners require a very specific tightening specification. When it comes to certain nuts and bolts on cars, guessing it's "tight enough" is almost never right. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Looking for purchase an **impact** **wrench** for removing lugs when swapping wheels for the seasons and occasional work on brakes, exhaust, and suspension. I'm looking for quality, versatility, and reliability here. TIA - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike cordless drill/drivers and **impact** drivers, which excel at drilling holes and driving screws, the **impact** **wrench** is specially designed for tightening and loosening various hex-head bolts, nuts, and lag screws. It employs both rotational force (torque) and short-burst concussive blows (**impact**s) to deliver an unparalleled amount of power. For example, most cordless drill/drivers produce about 50 foot-pounds of torque, and the average **impact** driver delivers about 125 foot-pounds. By comparison, cordless **impact** **wrench**es can easily produce torque outputs of over 250 foot-pounds, which is more than enough muscle to power-drive the fattest lags and bust loose rusty, corroded nuts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
