## 7 Facts Light Grey House With Dark Gray Trim | Light Grey And Black House Exterior
-   To go with the white on a red brick house, I always want to see some black. In fact, it can be very sharp to only do black accents with the red brick. However, we have other buildings to consider. So, I think it would be terrific to do a dark cool **gray** with the black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A deep **gray** aligns with one of Pantone’s colors of 2021, Ultimate Gray. A more dramatic color, this represents deep-seated strength and resilience. Dark **gray**s are bold, calming and modern, especially with black or metal trim. White accents can also be used with deep **gray** to create contrast and intrigue. Whether you choose to paint your entire home this color or use it as an accent color, it will certainly set your home apart from the crowd. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Slate blue combines vibrant blue and **gray** hues. This is an excellent choice for coastal homes, capturing that perfect stormy ocean color. However, it also looks beautiful on any home, ranging from a more colonial blue, to modern shades. Slate blue invokes a calming, serene feeling and is a safe way to play with color without being overly bold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A “graige” or **gray**, beige blend has become extremely popular in the last few years as an alternative to its namesake’s classic hues. Similar to off-white, this color has a warm base that allows landscaping and foliage to look more green and vibrant. On the lighter end, this color can be crisp and refreshing in seashell tones. In a darker, smoky almond, a **gray**/beige blend will give your home a welcoming and cozy character. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you like the dramatic look of a dark **gray**, but aren’t quite sold on the color, this may be a great option for you. Bronze paints are a combination or deep **gray** and rich brown. Although a statement color in its own right, bronze is more classically based as opposed to modern dark **gray**s. Serene and elegant, this paint color is great for highlighting wood, iron and brass accents on your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Colors absorb heat because of how they absorb light. Black will absorb more light from the sun, which means absorbing more heat, while white reflects more light, meaning it absorbs less energy and heat from the sun. So what about **gray**? That depends on how light or dark, dull or bright of a **gray** you select for your home’s exterior. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Green may not be your first thought when considering an exterior paint color. However, in soft muted tones, an earthy green can look quite striking. The key to an approachable green is a soft **gray** or brown undertone. For lighter shades, a **gray** sage green provides a delicate look whereas a darker mossy green provides a more dramatic result. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
