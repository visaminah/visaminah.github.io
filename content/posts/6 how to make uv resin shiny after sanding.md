## 6 Tips to How To Make Uv Resin Shiny After Sanding | How To Make Resin Shiny After Demolding
-   A lot of hard work goes into creating works of art out of epoxy **resin**, a material comprised of two components that, when mixed together, solidify into a durable piece of plastic with a glossy surface. However, the process of removing your epoxy creation from its mold can result in a dull, cloudy, and uneven-looking piece. By polishing epoxy **resin** after it has been removed from its mold, you can achieve a beautiful, glossy finish with relative ease. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Almost all kinds of epoxy **resin** pieces can be polished so as to achieve the glossy finish that this material is renowned for. The ease with which you are able to polish your piece will depend on its overall size and shape, although the polishing process tends to be relatively straightforward. You can use epoxy polish for the following: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is best to begin with a coarse piece of water-resistant **sanding** paper of 120-grit that you can increase up to 300-grit whilst **sanding** in a circular motion. This can be done by hand or with an orbital sander. The **sanding** process will be finished once the surface of the **resin** is completely smooth and even, after which you can begin polishing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is necessary to wet sand your **resin** so as to improve the performance of the **sanding** paper. The process of wet **sanding** helps to flush out additional cut materials that may get in the way of the **resin** and the **sanding** paper. The water also prevents the build-up of dirt upon the surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also polish smaller epoxy **resin** pieces by hand instead of using a drill. This method enables you to have total control over the process. You will need a bowl of clean water, a piece of linen or cotton cloth, clear polishing paste, and a hard, rectangular object (such as that made of wood). With these materials at hand, simply follow our instructions on how to polish epoxy **resin** by hand: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may find that in some cases, your **resin** piece is already quite smooth. This tends to be the case when using a polishing silicone mold, and will significantly reduce the amount of **sanding** you need to do. Smoother surfaces will require lighter **sanding** of a finer grit, although some surfaces may not need any **sanding** at all! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
