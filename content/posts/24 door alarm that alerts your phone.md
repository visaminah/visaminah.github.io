## 24 Reference List: Door Alarm That Alerts Your Phone | Door Sensor That Sends Text Message
-   Attach this Sensor to a window or door frame to be notified when there’s a disturbance. When the magnetized link between the Sensor and receiver is disrupted it sends you an alert. Use it to monitor doors requiring authorized entry, on a window beyond your line of sight to detect entry and many more! The Window/Door Sensor can be integrated into a complete security system managed on the Swann Security app to receive **alerts**. It can even be connected to the Indoor Siren for an audible and visible **alarm** that’s a powerful deterrent for intruders. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hive door sensors are very different from what we've talked about so far. Their sensors are extremely customizable and can basically be set up to do whatever action. You can trigger lightbulbs turning on when a door is open or activate **alerts** if you're leaving your front door without having shut all the windows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since they are more sensitive and smaller than conventional **alarm**s, wireless door **alarm**s provide stronger, undetectable, and reliable protection for difficult-to-reach spots. They can be set independently or fit within an existing wired **alarm** system. Backup power supplies prevent system fallouts in event of electricity cuts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Door **alarm**s are effective burglary protectors. At the moment a door is opened by a burglary attempt, the sensors can activate a flashlight, a loud siren, and a phone call, or any combination of the above. The phone call system can be connected to the owner’s phone, to a private security contractor, or to a law enforcement agency. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You don’t necessarily have to be a victim of a robbery or even a witness of one to know how burglars generally break in. If you’ve seen heist movies, you would know that in any robbery the burglar picks the lock or climbs in through an open window. Why make it easy for the burglars when you can have your house or office secured with the latest technologies in Home Automation & Robotics? Imagine when a burglar picks a lock successfully and the moment he steps in through an open window, the window and door sensors sound the **alarm**, emitting a loud siren which not wards off the burglar but also **alerts** you that there is an intruder in the house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A door-held-open **alarm** with a pleasant chime can warn a receptionist that a visitor has just entered the building, leaving enough room for attending other duties. When an intruder tries to forcefully break through an office door that he or she is not authorized to use, the monitoring system will let the controller know. Door-left-open **alarm**s enable setting longer delivery times for goods and reducing them when the delivery is complete. They guard against one of the most common security intrusion events - piggybacking or tailgating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Door and window sensors are contact sensors composed of two main parts that are a magnet and a sensor. This is also called a magnetic switch. The magnet itself is generally placed on the door while the sensor is installed on the door frame. The **alarm** is triggered when the door or window is opened without authorization (door-open **alarm**) or when the door is forced open (door-forced-open **alarm**). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A question that many ask is if they do need a window sensor on every window. Window sensors are meant to trigger **alarm**s when a window is opened or forced. This means that there is no reason of installing window sensors on windows that cannot be opened or forced. Surely a window on the first floor is more likely to be used by an intruder than a window on the 5th floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Other security companies use a door **alarm** that is triggered by a button rather than a magnet. When the door is closed, one half of the "sensor" depresses a button that protrudes from the other half. When the button is pressed, the **alarm** system reads the door as closed. When the door is opened, the button pops up like a turkey timer and sends a signal to the system to register that the door or window assigned to that sensor has been opened. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Medpage Wi-Fi Connected Door and Window Alarm with Smartphone App notifies you when a monitored door or window is opened or closed. Ideal for a variety of care situations, both home and professional, it's easy to set up and creates a log of every time it is activated, storing the time and date in the Smart Life App on your phone. It can also be used as a security **alarm** for homes and businesses. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Door-open **alarm**s are also called door-left-open **alarm**s or door-held-open **alarm**s. Door **alarm**s of this type are made of two components: a magnetic stripe fixed on the door panel and an input sensor fixed at the door frame. When the contact between the magnet and the sensor is interrupted, the door **alarm** generates the warning signal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Home security cameras and smart video doorbells are great for keeping an eye on your property and for evidence if there’s a break-in but if you want more protection, we’d recommend looking at the best smart **alarm**s that are more than an “intelligent” version of a burglar **alarm**. With these, you’ll get sirens, sensors, keypads and cameras to level up your home security system. And, because they connect to your wifi network, you won’t have to worry about an electrician dangling wires all over the place. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Door **alarm**s can be wired or wireless, although wired models are quickly becoming outdated. The hassle involved in installing wired **alarm** systems usually requires many hours of setup time by a trained professional. This can be an expensive nuisance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your home or apartment is already pre-wired for an older security system it may be tempting to pay for a wired **alarm** service but you should still look into modern wireless door sensors. Even the best wired **alarm**s can be easily disarmed if the burglar knows what he/she is doing. Also, even if the wiring is already in place, in many cases, it may actually be cheaper to buy diy wireless door **alarm**s instead of having someone come in to set up, replace, or reactivate the wired **alarm**s that are already present. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But how does a wireless door sensor work? The sensor itself is a two-piece device. One part of the wireless door **alarm** is attached to the edge of the door and the other part is attached to the door frame. Both parts are mounted with an adhesive strip. The two pieces are parallel with one another, almost touching. When the door is opened, it breaks the invisible connection between the two parts of the sensor, tripping the **alarm**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some individuals like to have a recessed sensor so that the door sensor doesn’t ruin the aesthetic of their home but recessed door sensors take longer to install, and become a permanent fixture in your door even if you decide to change security companies. With Cove’s wireless door sensors, you won’t have to worry about this. Cove’s door **alarm**s are designed to be unobtrusive. Plus, their design also makes it so even a thief directly outside the door won’t be able to see them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you think that only posh homes and high-end stores require door & window **alarm**s, then think again. If your family has toddlers or naughty kids, then one of the effective ways to protect them from any farm is by installing door & window **alarm**s. Is your child a hyperactive one who always wanders off to some part of the house and gets into trouble? The simple solution to this is to install door sensors which alert you immediately when a child gets into a dangerous cabinet or a restricted part of the house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wired door **alarm**s are effective only as long as they have power. Since wired door **alarm**s are reliant on the same power as the rest of your home, then your whole **alarm** system will shut down if the power goes out. With wireless door **alarm**s and a wireless security system, even if the power goes out, you can be assured that your **alarm** system will still work since it runs on long-lasting batteries. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Door-open **alarm**s activate when a door is opened by an intruder and held open for a certain period of time. The door-held-open time is programmable and used to monitor if a door is opened by an authorized access requestor. The door **alarm** warns the owner by emitting a chime, a loud siren sound or a flashing light, or both. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Door **alarm**s or door sensors are not just used to catch an intruder, but also to ward off potential thieves by showing that your home is monitored and secured, making a break-in a highly risky endeavour. Thieves look for specific types of homes and buildings which don’t have the sufficient level of security. The absence of door & window **alarm**s is one of the signs that your home is an easy target for burglars. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Door and window sensor **alarm**s are actually the same device. The basic functioning is a contact sensor that triggers an **alarm** when a door or a window is opened without authorization. This type of **alarm**s represents the ultimate perimetral defense for your facility and it is widely used in companies and residential buildings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, with the button door **alarm**, you hear a click every time the door opens or closes, which can be annoying. Since a magnetic door **alarm** needs no physical contact it can be completely silent. If you do want some sort of noise to be created when your doors are opened you can always activate the chime function of the door **alarm**s but this way you at least have a choice whether you want your security system to make a sound or not. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although wireless door **alarm**s are very easy to set up, don't let their simplicity fool you into thinking they're easy to bypass. Because they're so small and don't require direct contact, the two halves are almost always out of view from the outside of the door. This means shady characters won't be able to know where the sensor is located. Even if an intruder did know where your sensor was, it isn't possible to disable them from the outside. The door only needs to move about an inch to trip the **alarm** and tampering with the sensor will set off the **alarm**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is why we recommend magnetic sensors. As we mentioned above, magnetic door **alarm**s can't be seen from the outside of a door and are more reliable.Furthermore, buttons wear down after a while, and if they aren't installed properly, they can even break with a forceful slamming of a door or window. Since magnetic door **alarm**s don’t have any moving parts you can avoid this risk of premature hardware failure unlike their button cohorts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
