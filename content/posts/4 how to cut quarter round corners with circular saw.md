## 4 Things You Should Know About How To Cut Quarter Round Corners With Circular Saw | How To Cut Quarter Round At 45 Degree Angle Without A Miter Saw
-   The trick to installing trim and molding with professional-quality results is having the right tools for the job â€” or maybe it's not. The real trick to making trim work look great is having a repeatable method of cutting angles with the tools you have available. For most situations, making accurate molding cuts requires a miter box saw. However, if you're trying to finish a small project or have just a few cuts to make, purchasing a miter saw isn't always necessary. Here are a few simple tricks you can use to cut molding with a **circular** saw. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cutting molding with a **circular** saw is potentially not as safe as using a miter saw to perform some of the same functions. Never use a **circular** saw without the blade guard attached and operable and don't hold the guard open with your hand or other means when cutting. For safety and the best results, firmly clamp each molding piece to a solid surface, such as a workbench, before making cuts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **circular** saw can perform one trim cut that's out of reach for a miter saw. Typically, you'd make a long-edge bevel cut with a table saw. However, that's not always an option. You may need to make a long bevel cut when you're wrapping an outside corner with corner-guard molding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Set your **circular** saw to the bevel angle for half the total degrees necessary to complete the corner. Firmly clamp your workpiece and make a cut location mark at each of its ends. Draw a line from one spot to the other and follow the line with your saw to make the cut. Center a strip of painter's tape under your cut line to reduce chipping on fragile pieces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
