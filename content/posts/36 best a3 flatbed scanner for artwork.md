## 36 Reference List: Best A3 Flatbed Scanner For Artwork | Plustek A3 Flatbed Scanner
-   Software and usability would be the scanning software included and whether you can make adjustments to how visual attributes. For example, you may want to **scanner** to pick up lighter values and play down stronger ones. Some software have the ability to remove dusts, stitch multiple scans or even repair blemishes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I found it weird that the **scanner** cannot pick up the grain so asked another friend to scan using her V600. She told me there's a mode where you can turn on the "Show Texture" feature using the Epson scanning software. The result's shown above (not using the Saunders paper). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   VIISAN VF series is the best A3 large-format **scanner**s for professional quality imaging, the VF series features in frameless and narrow boundary with detachable lid design, which can meet all your diverse scanning needs. Besides, those **scanner**s comes bundled with a powerful software, which includes advanced features such as scanning to Folder/PDF/Email/Print, creating text OCR or opening scans with a specified application. It can easily customize your scan tasks based on your requirements for different types of documents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **scanner**s come with basic scanning software. Depending on what you plan to scan, some of the features to look for include optical character recognition (OCR), text indexing, photo editing, and the ability to create searchable PDF documents. The days of platform-specific **scanner**s are over; any modern **scanner** will work seamlessly with both macOS and Windows, and many of them can also scan to your phone or a cloud drive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best, swiftest duplexing **scanner**s have two scan elements, so they can scan both sides of a page at the same time. A design like this will be faster than a **scanner** with a simple duplexing ADF, but it will likely also cost more. A more ordinary duplexing ADF will just scan one side, turn the page over mechanically, and only then scan the other. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The V600 is an impressive offering from Epson. The accurate color resolution will give you near lossless quality when scanning **artwork**. The transparency unit is also great for making high resolution scans of various film formats. If you are looking for a **scanner** to showcase your **artwork** in the best possible ligh, then the V600 is a sound choice. We just wish it were a little bit cheaper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   V600. One sketchbook was placed behind the other. The **scanner** was able to pick up the **artwork** even when the paper's not touching the glass. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   READY WHENEVER YOU ARE – The DS-640 mobile **scanner** is powered via an included micro USB 3.0 cable, allowing you to use it even where there is no outlet available. Plug it into your PC or laptop and you are ready to scan - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Then there's the issue of the maximum scan size you can take. Picking a **scanner** that can handle the size of the originals you need to scan seems like an obvious point, but it's easy to overlook. For example, most flatbeds have a letter-size platen, which will be a problem if you occasionally need to scan legal-size pages. Most flatbeds with ADFs will scan legal-size pages via the ADF, but not all do, so be sure to check. You can also find **scanner**s with larger flatbeds, but they will, of course, take up more desk space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I've three of these. Actually, I've two of LiDE 210 and one LiDE 220. I use this at home to scan **artwork**s. I had previously owned the LiDE210 which sort of malfunctioned when scan produced a strange yellow gradient. Still, I went back to Canon despite my misfortune because of the detail it can capture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Delicate originals such as photos and stamps can go through a sheet feeder, but you risk damaging them. If you need to scan this sort of original only once in a while, you may be able to get by with a sheetfed **scanner** that comes with a plastic carrier to protect the originals. Keep in mind, however, that even brand-new, unscratched plastic carriers can degrade scan quality somewhat. Direct-to-glass is always better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There's one major downside relating to the LED scanning technology it uses. The **scanner** will not scan properly if the paper is not in contact with the glass. For example, say you're scanning watercolour on some cheap paper that has warped, parts that are not in contact with the glass will appear blur. This means the **scanner** is not as suitable for scanning sketchbooks, especially those spiral ones, because the book's spine will cause paper around to curve upwards. If you draw across the gutter of the sketchbook, the area near the gutter will be blur. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are several downsides to this **scanner**. The resolution max out at 600 dpi, which is actually more than enough for most artists. The other thing is the colour depth is only 16-bit. And the scan quality is definitely not as good as the other Epson **scanner**s and Canon. To be fair, Epson calls this a document **scanner** rather than one to scan **artwork**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For photos or other easily damaged originals, bound material, and 3D objects, you need a flatbed **scanner**, which has a large glass platen on which you place the documents, photos, books, or items. (When we talk about scanning objects, here we're talking about scanning three-dimensional objects to two-dimensional images. 3D **scanner**s—which digitize objects to special 3D files for display or printing on a 3D printer—are a different beast entirely.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a lightweight compact flatbed **scanner** with a lid that can be adjusted to scan thick books. It has a high scanning resolution of 4800 x 4800 dpi and can pick up even the grain texture of the paper. Colour depth when scanning is up 48-bit for colour and grayscale 16-bit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Specialized **scanner**s have software with specialized functions. Receipt **scanner**s come with accounting software for organizing your financial data. Scanners that handle business cards can usually extract the card data into a contact database (assuming the cards aren't too ornately designed for the OCR software to read). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   DS-50000. This is a close up to the top right corner showing the faint watercolour gradated wash. There's a low contrast edge there and the **scanner** was able to pick it up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In terms of quality, the Epson DS-50000 A3 **scanner** certainly is not as good as the smaller A4 **scanner**s. However, if you scan large pieces of **artwork**s often, it's quite a convenient machine to use. I use this in my office, and I also have a small LiDE 210 in the office for smaller pieces of work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The V370 is a compelling offering in the Epson Perfection line. While not offering nearly as many extras compared to others on the list, the V370 is perfect for beginner or intermediate level artists looking to backup and share their **artwork**. Scans will capture the essence of your pieces extraordinarily well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ???? EXPERT PAPERLESS SUPPORT W/ FREE DOXIECARE: We’ve thought about your paper, so you don’t have to. Exclusive access to the best support in the **scanner** industry to help you scan, organize, or simply provide tips on the best ways to scan your paper. Every new Doxie includes a 1-year DoxieCare manufacturer warranty and a new friend in going paperless (hi!). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Settling on a **scanner** that meets your specific day-to-day scanning needs can be challenging. Most flatbed and sheetfed **scanner**s on the market today are geared toward everyday office tasks or photo image capture, but they come in a wide variety of types and sizes, some fine-tuned for different purposes. Document **scanner**s, photo **scanner**s, receipt **scanner**s, film **scanner**s: That list is just a start. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   DS-50000. Click for the full 300dpi scan. This sketchbook I'm using is off-white so the colour captured by the **scanner** is actually correct. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I remember there used to be many brands of **scanner** but nowadays it seems the choice comes down to two, Epson and Canon. Epson **scanner**s get mentioned more often than Canon. This is probably due to the fact that Epson has a great reputation at producing photo **scanner**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With a footprint of only 9.9″ x 14.4″ x 1.6″, the LiDE220 is almost the smallest and slimmest **scanner** we reviewed (the V39 is just 0.1” thinner). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For most scanning, having a high enough resolution at your disposal for the job at hand isn't an issue. For, say, tax documents, even a 200-pixel-per-inch (ppi) scan will give you good enough quality for most purposes. A 300ppi scanning resolution is almost always sufficient, and it's hard to find a **scanner** today that maxes out at less than 600ppi. For photos, unless you plan to zoom in on a small part of the photo or print the photo at a larger size than the original, 600ppi is more than enough. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you travel often, you might want a portable **scanner** that's small enough to fit in your laptop bag, or a handheld **scanner** that you hold and trace over text. Some portable models can operate without a computer attached, scanning to a memory card or smartphone. You can also find some that function as both portable and desktop document **scanner**s by combining a portable **scanner** with a docking station that includes an ADF. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For those artists on a more restricted budget, we found that the Epson Perfection V39 was a great alternative to the CanoScan 9000F. While not nearly as high in resolution nor packing nearly as many additional software offerings, the Epson V39 was a compact **scanner** that quickly captured **artwork** perfect for social media sharing. In addition, the Epson V39 has a removable lid allowing for scans of virtually any sized **artwork**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you aren’t scanning in your **artwork** daily, the Canon 9000F photo scanning features are second to none. Featuring a transparency unit, you can scan in a wide array of film negatives and slides. You will have a fun time going through old family photos as the 9000F will restore them beautifully. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thinking of sharing your art online, or even sending it off to make some professional quality prints? It’s possible to make money doing what you love – making beautiful works of art – but you need the right tools to accomplish that. You don’t need the best **scanner** for **artwork** to achieve the best results, you just need the right **scanner** for you and your **artwork**. These come in at a variety of affordable price points but you need to know which model is right for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your main scanning need is scanning documents on a regular basis—particularly those longer than one or two pages—you almost certainly want a document-centric **scanner** equipped with a sheet feeder. Having to open a flatbed lid and put a page on the glass is a minor chore, but having to repeat the process 10 times for a 10-page document is tiresome. Some sheetfed **scanner**s can also handle thick originals such as ID cards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Epson V39 is also a budget **scanner**. It scans A4 size up to 4800 x 9600 dpi. One nice feature it has is the ArcSoft Scan-n-Stitch Deluxe which can stitch multiple scans to form a larger scan automatically. This **scanner** uses LED for scanning. Colour depth when scanning is up 48-bit for colour and grayscale 16-bit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now depending on the scale of your **artwork**, the 9000F does feature a standard 8.5” x 11.7” glass plate. Therefore, for **artwork** outside of this scale, it will need to be scanned in sections and then stitched together in a photo editing software. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Epson DS-50000 is a A3 **scanner**. One nice feature is the glass is flushed on two sides with **scanner** body, so you can scan even larger pieces of paper without any part of the paper lifting off the glass surface. It's extremely convenient. This **scanner** scans so fast it's shocking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The only large format **scanner** I tested was the Epson DS-50000 which is more suitable for scanning documents than **artwork**s. It's a budget A3 **scanner**. I use this in the office to scan **artwork**s for newsprint production. Personally, for professional large format scanning, go for the Epson E11000XL-GA Expression Graphic Arts Photo Scanner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, consider whether you need a special-purpose **scanner**. Among the most common special-purpose choices are **scanner**s for business cards (small and highly portable) and receipts (small and equipped with specialized software). Specialized slide **scanner**s are smaller than flatbed **scanner**s, but they're no better at scanning slides than flatbed **scanner**s with equivalent features. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   LiDE220. Close up on the top right corner. There's a very faint edge on the paper visible to the eye, but very difficult to detect. It's very challenging for the **scanner** to pick up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
