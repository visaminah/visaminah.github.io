## 221 Things About Best Polyurethane For Painted Kitchen Cabinets | Polyurethane on Painted Cabinets
-   Most hybrid enamel paints come in satin and semi-gloss. Satin falls right between semi-gloss and eggshell finish. Benjamin Moore makes a broader range of products, including high-gloss for that candy-coated finish on your **cabinets**. And they also make a matte finish for a more durable paint specific for wood **cabinets**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My favorite brushes for **cabinets** are Zibra brushes. They not only give you a flawless finish but the brushes just glide over the surface of whatever you are painting. They are a little more expensive but I’ve never lost a bristle with these and they are fun to use: Zibra Brushes for Cabinets - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you've completed any DIY painting projects, you probably already know that most of the important work happens before you ever open a can of paint. First, empty your **cabinets** and remove all hardware including hinges and pulls. Scrub all surfaces thoroughly, and use a good degreasing agent to ensure all surfaces are squeaky clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting your own **cabinets** is such a budget-friendly way to make a huge upgrade in the room of your house that is most important for resale. I was quoted a cost of over $3,000 to hire painters for my kitchen **cabinets**, but by doing it myself, I paid just $492. See exactly how much it costs to paint your **cabinets** vs hiring a pro here: How Much Does It Cost To Paint Kitchen Cabinets - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you use a paint sprayer, you'll need to dilute the paint with some water and cover everything you don't want the paint to get on (which is everything but the **cabinets**!). Using a sprayer will give you a smooth finish and no visible brush strokes. Plus, it will take less time for the actual paint job — but the prep time is usually longer since you want to make sure you've covered everything but the **cabinets** in plastic to protect them from unwanted painting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is not a huge difference in the requirements for cabinet paint and trim paint. With trim paint, you will be painting fewer flat surfaces which means more painting with a brush than a roller. So you want a durable paint that can handle high-traffic areas without brush strokes and comes in a semi-gloss finish. Based on my testing, Benjamin Moore Advance is the best paint for **cabinets** and trim. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Oil-based **polyurethane**s were always the more durable choice but now they have a lot of competition as water-based formulas have improved. Oil-based products have a strong odor and can take longer to dry. However, the longer drying time can mean fewer brush strokes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Again, pick whatever sheen makes you happiest. Just know that the more matte you go, the more it’ll show dirt and wear. The more high-gloss you go, the more difficulty you’ll have getting a smooth finish on your **cabinets**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Polyurethane is an excellent way to protect your painted kitchen **cabinets**. It’s available in both oil-based and water-based formulas, so you can choose the one that best suits your needs. Be sure to apply several thin coats for the best protection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a major advantage for lacquer on kitchen **cabinets**, as you do not have to wait for it to dry. If you use the lacquer at room temperature, then it should dry within 15 minutes. You can then sand it down and apply the second coat, which can be completed within an hour. Lacquer dries particularly quickly when compared to other clear coatings, which can take from 72 hours to seven days to dry properly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The colour options for **polyurethane** are amazing. It is a painted finish so you can create almost any colour that you can dream of. This is especially beneficial if you need to colour match an existing fixture or fitting within the kitchen or home (which can be very handy with renovated kitchen projects) or are looking to create a truly unique, one-of-a-kind statement in your new kitchen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are different types of paints, each with its own properties that make it better or worse for kitchen **cabinets**. You touch your cabinet doors all the time, you spill food on them and it's easy to accidentally bump up against them, so you want them to have a durable coating that won't flake off easily. Here are the best types of paint for kitchen **cabinets**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is possible to use **polyurethane** over paint, but there are a few things to keep in mind. First, it is important to make sure that the paint is completely dry before applying the **polyurethane**. If the paint is not completely dry, it can cause the **polyurethane** to bubble and peel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting your kitchen **cabinets** requires more than just choosing paint and slapping it on the cabinet doors with a paintbrush. You'll want to prep and make sure you have the proper tools handy so you can do a stellar job. After all, you don't want your **cabinets** to have sloppy, noticeable brush marks and an uneven surface. Here's how you can give your **cabinets** a smooth finish that looks like professional painters did the dirty work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The exposed edges on melamine and laminate finished **cabinets** are probably one of their biggest pitfalls in a kitchen. Over time, the edges can become exposed to heat from the workings of cooking and preparing meals. This can cause the edges to peel or become exposed, which not only looks unsightly but also leaves the base under the coating at risk of damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll want to select a paint that is durable and can withstand some wear and tear. Once you’ve selected the perfect paint, it’s time to think about which sealer will work best for your project. Here are a few things to consider when choosing a sealer for your newly painted **cabinets**: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want a more rugged, vintage look for your **cabinets**, chalk paint is perfect for that too. If you want a piece of furniture -- your kitchen cabinet, coffee tables, even your kitchen table, dining room table, or kitchen island -- to have a chalky, gritty, rustic appearance, you can skip the waxing and let the paint give itself its own chalky appearance. This is also the reason why people tend to treat chalk paint as a decorative paint too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Patience and prep work are vital to getting a professional-quality smooth finish on your kitchen **cabinets**, even when you use the best paint for **cabinets**. All DIY-paint projects involve a lot of prep work, just like the professionals do. The more thorough your prep, the easier the painting will be, and the better the finished product. Check out our ultimate guide to painting kitchen **cabinets** for all the tips and tricks from start to finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let me first start by saying we paint a ton of kitchen **cabinets**. And when I say we, I mean the extremely skilled professional painting crew we have. They have been painting kitchen **cabinets** for years and have perfected the process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting your kitchen **cabinets** can be a fun DIY painting project to do. Before getting to work, you’re going to need to decide on what kind of paint you want to use. There are a variety of paint options for you to choose from; picking the right one can get overwhelming and difficult. One of the types of paint that’s commonly recommended is chalk paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All of the above information about paints for kitchen cupboards also applies to bathroom **cabinets**. Since bathroom **cabinets** experience more moisture and condensation on a regular basis, I would always use a satin or even a semi-gloss sheen to better protect them. However, all of the cabinet paints I tested did really well when it came to holding up to moisture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’m happy with my blue kitchen because I will love it forever whether it is trendy or not. If I had focused on what was trendy instead of what I loved, I would be sitting here in 2019 with a neutral kitchen, jealous of everyone else’s blue kitchens. Of course, you can always repaint your **cabinets**. But why go to that trouble when you can be happy from the start? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using lacquer will not give you the same durability as a **polyurethane** finish, but its impact resistance, flexibility, and sheen far exceed other clear coat finishes for your kitchen cupboards. It will provide you with a clear coat that is waterproof, chip-resistant, and breathable, with a sheen of various levels, from high gloss to matte. With daily wear and tear, its sheen may become dull, but with a little buffing and polishing, its luster can be restored. Before making a decision about the whether lacquer is best for your kitchen **cabinets**, let us guide you through some advantages and disadvantages of this type of coating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once your **cabinets** have their first coat of paint on, let it dry completely, then take a look at the paint job from different angles. When the paint dries, you may find spots where you accidentally painted against the wood grain and it sticks out in bright lighting. Or, if you used high-gloss or semi-gloss paint, you might find a spot that doesn't look as glossy. Once you've taken a look and made note of spots that need a little extra help, then move forward with your second coat and pay special attention to the places to fix. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is one of the best white paints for kitchen **cabinets**, especially north-facing ones. The incoming cool gray and blue light neutralizes the warmth of the off-white on the **cabinets** to create a sense of harmony and balance indoors. In the south-facing rooms, the warm white cabinet color may come out a little yellow! So, don’t forget to try a sample in various directions to know the true hue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You never want to refinish **cabinets** without sanding. Remember, you are not sanding to remove the old paint or stain. You are simply scuff sanding which means that you are sanding the surface of the **cabinets** just enough, so they aren’t slick. This helps the new primer and paint adhere well and it’s a step you never want to skip! TO make it go faster, here is my favorite electric sander: Tack life Electric Sander (click here for the current price). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sherwin Williams Greek Villa is slightly more warm and creamy than SW Alabaster. So, if you prefer a white kitchen cabinet color that feels creamy and slightly lighter beige, Sherwin Williams Greek Villa **cabinets** are something to have an eye on! When paired with a true white color, you’ll see the notable difference in saturation and undertones. Allow ample natural light to enter this kitchen to make it further appear light, soft, airy, and creamy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you can see in the video, this paint also levels out well on open wood grains and has outstanding coverage even on dark **cabinets**. It’s available in almost an unlimited number of colors and is Low VOC. You also don’t have to worry about shipping prices because you can find Advance at a Benjamin Moore paint store near you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   -The type of paint you used: Some paints require a different type of sealer than others. If you’re unsure which kind of sealer to use, ask the store where you purchased your paint or consult with a professional painter. -The level of durability you need: If your **cabinets** see a lot of traffic, you’ll want to choose a durable sealer that can withstand some wear and tear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The options for colour of a melamine finish are certainly not as wide as **polyurethane** finish kitchen **cabinets**. They are generally limited to a supplier range and will vary. However, options provided do usually cover a considerable range so you are able to select from an array of colours and tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here is all the data from the cabinet paint testing. Be sure to check out the video to see exactly how I tested to find the best paint for **cabinets**. If you have trouble seeing it, you can find it here as well: The Best Paint for Cabinets, YouTube Video - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The design and style of a kitchen cabinet plays an important role on deciding the suitability of a melamine or laminate finish. Both melamine and laminate finishes are adhered to a backing, not painted on like **polyurethane**. This application causes exposed edges and can be difficult to obtain an immaculately finished surface on **cabinets** that contain a lot of detail such as Shaker style or French Provincial **cabinets**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes called eggshell, satin is a slightly-shiny finish which is similar to matte. Essentially, satin paint has a silky smooth appearance with a slight pearl-like sheen reminiscent of an eggshell (hence the other name). You can give your kitchen cabinet set a really unique, regal look so your kitchen remodel can make your old **cabinets** look like new **cabinets**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The type of paint you use will make or break your DIY cabinet painting project. After blind tests in 5 categories, doing over 35 hours of research, talking to professionals across the country, and spending a small fortune on 24 different paints, I would choose Benjamin Moore Advance as the overall best paint for **cabinets**. (See The Ultimate Guide on Painting Kitchen Cabinets HERE). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sherwin Williams Creamy **cabinets** are warm, and soft, and may dominantly peek a yellow undertone in certain lighting conditions. This warm white cabinet color is creamier and ‘yellower’ than SW Alabaster and SW Greek Villa. However, note that this color isn’t too yellow – but actually feels CREAMY most of the time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Valspar Oil-Enriched Enamel: resists scuffing and scratches in busy homes. Its unique formula doesn’t require primer or sanding. It’s perfect for prep-resistant people who still want a beautiful finish on their **cabinets**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can put a clear coat over painted **cabinets** to protect the paint and make the surface easier to clean. However, you will need to be careful when selecting your clear coat. Some clear coats can yellow over time, so it’s important to choose one that is specifically designed for use on painted surfaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whatever primer you choose, make sure that it is suited to the paint that you are using. Many primers can be used with both oil-based and latex paints. After priming, be sure to lightly sand your **cabinets** once again with 220-grit sandpaper and wipe them clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Oil-based paint is the go-big-or-go-home of interior paints. In it, the color pigment is suspended in oil and then thinned with an agent like mineral spirits. It was the preferred type of slow-drying paint to use on wood in homes because of the uniform paint surface. Plus, it’s durable–perfect for things like trim and **cabinets** that experience a lot of wear. Historically, it’s considered the best paint for **cabinets**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What’s your interior design style like? Is it rustic and warm like modern farmhouse or sleek and calm like transitional? Well, this aspect needs to be considered when choosing the best white for kitchen **cabinets**. Generally, you must finalize the overall vibe you’re aiming to create in the kitchen! Looking for a cooler-toned palette? Well, pick the cool whites. Else, choose from the warm whites for modern, traditional, modern farmhouse, and Scandinavian design styles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you are painting anything in your home, the final finish is what counts. You may have the best wood, clear coat, and tools, but if the final finish is not right, then all the effort you put in will have been a waste of time. With this thought in mind, we are going to help you choose the best product for sealing painted **cabinets** in your kitchen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I understand that not everyone has access to a paint sprayer. But don’t let that stop you from painting your kitchen **cabinets**. You can still achieve a smooth cabinet finish by using a high-quality roller and paint brush. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For this project, your paintbrush and roller are going to work as a team to provide a smooth, flawless finish. Apply the paint to your **cabinets** in smooth, even strokes. Once you have an even coat, roll over it with a mini foam roller to smooth everything out. This will help to make brushstrokes disappear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re not as confident using a brush but you want to avoid the brush marks, you may need to spend on a paint sprayer. To give your kitchen **cabinets** the appearance of a more professional finish, you may need to spend on sandpaper or a sanding device. Then, if you want to give it a protective finish or wax finish, you’ll need to spend on both the wax and the brushes for it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The hardware finish has a major role to play when picking the perfect white for kitchen **cabinets**. Generally, if gold, brass, or oil-rubbed bronze fixtures are what you prefer, it’s ideal to choose a neutral or warmer-toned white paint color for your kitchen **cabinets**. Moreover, if you also have one of these finishes running across the lighting fixtures and artwork frames – remember to play around with neutral or warm white paint colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Sherwin Williams Snowbound is a great white paint for **cabinets** since it offers the best of both worlds. Yes, I am talking about the subtle taupe undertones that don’t emerge to be too warm and rather make the color work the best with cooler tones. Even with ample natural light pouring in, expect this Sherwin Williams white paint to feel calm, cool, and slightly soft and crisp. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The ultimate WHITE paint in your kitchen varies on various different factors in your home. The incoming natural light, existing artificial light, view from the windows, and existing architectural and structural elements tend to alter the appearance of ‘white’ on the **cabinets**. So, it’s always important that you apply a fresh coat in various directions to know the true hue of the white cabinet paint color in your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The entering natural light in your kitchen is a single MAJOR reason for how the white painted **cabinets** will appear. Picking the wrong color will immediately make that calm and soft off-white peek unexpected blue, yellow, or green undertones. And you don’t want to face that, right? So, it’s always ideal to analyze the compass direction of your kitchen and choose that white paint color wisely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To remove this, you will need to use a strong degreaser and thoroughly clean every inch of your **cabinets**. Do this anywhere that you will be painting. Be sure to wipe off any remaining cleaner when you're done, and dry it all well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   So what are the pros and cons of chalk paint on kitchen **cabinets**? It has a quick dry time, but a long cure time. You can begin painting without having to prep the surface, but you'll need to apply protective topcoats to keep it from chipping over time. It has a durable finish but only after the extra step of adding a wax topcoat. In the end, it depends on what you envision for your kitchen to look like, what your budget is, and how much time you’re willing to put in for it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you do not follow the correct process when applying the lacquer to your kitchen **cabinets**, blushing can result. This will become evident almost immediately, as milky-white marks appear as soon as the lacquer dries. This is due to moisture underneath the surface of the lacquer. If spraying the lacquer, make sure that there is no water or moisture in the airlines of your spray equipment and that your equipment is clean and dry. This type of problem may also occur when there is high humidity in the surrounding area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Start by preparing your kitchen. Clear out your **cabinets** and all loose appliances on the countertops. Mask off the walls around the cabinet and spread plastic over the floors and any other area that needs to be protected. Remove all the doors, shelves, and all the hardware, being sure that you store it all in a safe place. Clean all the remaining surfaces such as the door frames and sides of the **cabinets**, and wipe them with a clean, dry cloth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although several prefer a foam roller, my favorite roller for painting **cabinets** is this 3/8″ microfiber roller from Home Depot. It gives you an incredibly smooth finish without roller marks and is very forgiving when painting over defects in the painted surface. I absolutely love this roller and used it on my own **cabinets** and on every furniture project. You can see the current price here: Home Depot Best Roller - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, one drawback to using a paint sprayer for existing **cabinets** is the huge amount of overspray. Every bit of the surrounding area will need to be covered. Otherwise, you could end up with a thin coating of paint on everything. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But only if you have a paint sprayer! Lacquer paint will give the smoothest, most durable finish to your kitchen **cabinets**. The only downside to using it is the drying time. Lacquer dries incredibly fast - too fast for it to be brushed on. If you don't want to use a paint sprayer or just don't want to mess with lacquer, that's okay. Keep reading for tips on getting a smooth finish with a brush. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'Sanding is key!' exclaims Grace Baena, interiors curator of Kaiyo (opens in new tab), an online marketplace for pre-owned furniture. 'The reason why you see so many DIY-painted **cabinets** chipping or with flaking off paint is usually because they aren’t well sanded. Remember you need to sand **cabinets** between every single coat of paint too – not just at the very beginning. You also want to make sure you sand corners, edges and any crevices really well, as that’s where chipping is most likely to occur if not prepared properly.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Water-based **polyurethane** is a type of clear coat that is typically used on painted surfaces. It can be applied with a brush, roller, or sprayer and dries to a hard, durable finish. Water-based **polyurethane** is less toxic than oil-based **polyurethane** and has little odor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This interior paint not only brushed on well but also rolled beautifully to a satiny smooth finish which is so important when painting wood **cabinets**. Benjamin Moore Advance cures to an extremely hard and durable finish. I found that I could easily scrub off dried waterproof mascara without taking off any of the painted surface. It is rare to find so many positive attributes in one paint product making it your best bet for your kitchen cabinet painting project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I wouldn’t recommend painting kitchen **cabinets** with chalk paint as I discuss in my post: A Better Alternative to Chalk Paint. If you are wondering what clear coat to put on latex-painted **cabinets**, I would consider going without one. If you use a good paint made for **cabinets**, it should be durable and water-resistant enough without the trouble of a topcoat. However, if you have chalk-painted **cabinets**, you will need some sort of protective finish to make them durable enough for high-traffic areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A paint sprayer undoubtedly gives the smoothest, most professional finish with the easiest application. Spraying your **cabinets** eliminates brush marks entirely and provides an even coat of paint. A paint sprayer can be rented from home improvement stores, like Lowe's or Home Depot, if desired. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sherwin Williams Morning Fog is a great medium gray with subtle blue undertones without being a blue-gray. It is very upbeat and pairs nicely with a navy or blue-gray island. It’s a great color for gray kitchen **cabinets** when you want the space to still feel light and airy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sherwin Williams Alabaster kitchen **cabinets** are soft, creamy, and warm – making a popular best white paint for **cabinets**. It has a perfect tinge of yellow and gray – making it one of the most versatile, sophisticated, and elegant white cabinet color choices. With plenty of natural light in the kitchen, this color is bound to further look airy, soft, warm, and subtle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Benjamin Moore Chantilly Lace is one of the brightest white paint colors for the kitchen **cabinets**. It’s refreshing, and cool, and can feel extra bright and crisp in a kitchen with tons and tons of natural light. This best white for **cabinets** feels true to the hue, but in the north-facing rooms, it may slightly outcast a blue undertone. However, that’s not very dominant though! On the other hand, in the south-facing rooms, this true white cabinet color will feel crisp and extra bright. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Then, hybrids came on the market often called “acrylic-alkyd formulas”. These hybrids are special cabinet paints that have easy clean-up, low VOC and fast-drying times of latex paints BUT also have the durability and smooth finish of oil-based paints. The fact that they have the same or better durability is so important for **cabinets** that are subject to daily use and are subject to a lot of wear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many surveys have revealed that the kitchen is the best and most used room in your house. Your kitchen **cabinets** are some of the most important aspects of your kitchen, as they provide you with storage space as well as enhance the appearance of your kitchen as a whole.

-   There are a few different types of **polyurethane** that can be used on painted **cabinets**, but the best one to use is an oil-based **polyurethane**. This type of **polyurethane** will protect the paint from scratches and stains, and it will also give the **cabinets** a nice sheen. You’ll want to apply at least two coats of oil-based **polyurethane**, and be sure to let each coat dry completely before applying the next one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since I was using a cp I thought I should lightly distress my **cabinets**. I will be honest, I really didn’t want them distressed at all. But if you are using a cp that’s really the point for chalk painted kitchen **cabinets** . Why paint them with cp if you’re not looking for a distressed look, right? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, you’ll notice Annie Sloan chalk paint is listed. Most people wouldn’t consider chalk paint to be cabinet paint but because so many are using it on **cabinets**, I decided to include it. Also, all of the specialty paints had tutorials on their homepages with instructions on how to use their products to paint **cabinets**. Also, the chalk paint was waxed for the water and scrub tests. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Each of these points will aid in producing a smooth finish. You will want to keep reading as we delve into each of these methods. We will also be answering other questions that make come up as you are painting your kitchen **cabinets**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In my books, this may not be the best white for kitchen **cabinets** since it’s slightly challenging to pair with complementary stone countertop, backsplash, and hardware. The taupe undertones don’t make the color feel warmer but rather align towards the cooler end of the scale. This white kitchen color cabinet idea is ideal if you have a mix and blend of neutral tones on the flooring and other architectural features. I highly recommend that you pair matte black, nickel, and satin chrome hardware and pull handles to go with this paint color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For painting **cabinets**, you can either brush, roll or spray. You can also do a combination of two. If you opt for spraying, you can paint the cabinet doors in your garage and roll the cabinet bases.

-   It is much faster than demolishing and removing old **cabinets** and installing new ones. Painting your kitchen **cabinets** is ore affordable than installing new **cabinets**. It allows you to avoid a major renovation and keep the same layout as your existing **cabinets** It’s environmentally friendly. You avoid throwing out perfectly useable materials just for a new cabinet color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even the most well-kept kitchen is bound to collect grime in unsuspecting places. Kitchen **cabinets** collect grease, dust, smoke, food particles, you name it. This can leave a thin coating on the outside, and prevent paint and primer from properly adhering to your **cabinets**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When applied correctly, it can help protect your painted **cabinets** from scratches, stains, and general wear and tear. There are two types of **polyurethane**: oil-based and water-based. Oil-based **polyurethane** has a stronger odor and takes longer to dry, but it’s more durable than water-based **polyurethane**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I wish I could tell you that all you needed to do is add new hardware and you are good to go. But while some oak **cabinets** are coming back in style, take note they are stained in cooler wood tones.

After you’ve completed the required prep work, then, you or your local painters should select the proper type of paint for your **cabinets**.

Whichever type of paint you choose, you’ll also have to select the best paint finish for **cabinets**. Glossier finishes are more protective and easiest to clean, so most experts recommend going with semi-gloss or high-gloss paints (at least for the cabinet doors and drawers). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All kitchen cupboards store metallic items that have sharp points like knives, forks, or spoons, all of which can scratch the surface.

-   This paint can be used on **cabinets**, furniture, or even concrete. It is said to be an all-in-one product but I always like to primer **cabinets** first. This has a chalky finish and ironically is really smooth with both a brush and roller which is why I selected it as the Best Chalk Paint for Cabinets. It’s not quite as scrubbable as its competitors but you could add an optional topcoat. It’s also durable and has low VOCs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even though you can use a brush to apply lacquer, you should use spray equipment to apply it properly. This means you must work in a well-ventilated area, as spraying emits noxious odors and is also flammable. We also suggest that to get the desired results with lacquer, you remove the doors before spraying and, if possible, spray the **cabinets** before they are installed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting **cabinets** with chalk paint tends to be a labor-intensive process. You’ll first need to remove all the objects that are inside of your kitchen **cabinets** to prepare. It’s then recommended to regularly clean your kitchen **cabinets** to avoid any dirt from disrupting the smooth finish that you want to have. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Polyurethane paint is a type of paint that contains **polyurethane**, a synthetic polymer. It is usually used as an exterior paint because it is very durable and resists fading, chalking, and peeling. Polyurethane paint also has excellent UV resistance and can withstand extreme temperatures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Benjamin Moore Simply White is a classic and all-time versatile white paint for kitchen **cabinets**. This Benjamin Moore white for **cabinets** is much brighter but at the same time, reflects a tinge of yellow to make the paint color feel further warm and cozy.

-   About three years after painting my **cabinets** they looked like they needed a fresh paint job. I repainted them but stupidly never finished waxing them. Then I decided to paint them once again and finish waxing them…and again I didn’t finish waxing them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It used to be the case that professionals swore by oil-based paint. As you’ll read in the following section, technology’s improved paint formulas. Oil-based paint is no longer the best paint for **cabinets**, just as it’s no longer suitable for residential applications. Many professionals now use latex paint, citing the improvements to the formula and the as-good-as finish they can get on most surfaces. We actually prefer a third type of paint for **cabinets**, the hybrid enamel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The shinier or glossier a paint is the more durable it is. However, glossier finishes show defects and surface imperfections more easily. For that reason, it’s unconventional to use glossy finishes for **cabinets**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

For the hardware, feel free to style it with polished chrome, matte black, nickel, or antique brass. For the countertop, choose classic whites, grays, or blue grays! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Benjamin Moore Decorator’s White is a clean and bright cool white paint color with a slightly gray undertone. It feels fresh, rejuvenating, and extremely smooth when used on the kitchen **cabinets**. In the north-facing rooms, this color can exhibit a deep cool gray undertone that can be slightly difficult to pair with other complementary hues, countertop materials, fabrics, and textures. In the south-facing rooms, this color may feel like a “true white” paint which is rather soft and subtle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The short answer is yes, there are specific paints designed for **cabinets**. There are a lot of different options available, and we will go over those shortly. The one thing you need to know about all cabinet-specific paint is that it is generally harder than exterior and other interior paints. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

That’s why it’s often better to let pros handle painting your kitchen **cabinets** since an experienced crew will give you the closest thing to a factory finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And those are the three top products you should use to paint your kitchen **cabinets**. While doing this on your own is certainly possible, it’s going to look a lot nicer and be a lot easier if you hire a contractor to do it for you.

Personally, I have recommended this neutral white color a couple of times for the ceiling, moldings, built-in shelves, as well as **cabinets**. And trust me, this Sherwin Williams white color has never disappointed me! It has a perfect tinge of gray and warmth to it – hence, being able to easily pair with warmer as well as cooler-toned palettes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Any of the brands listed in this post, including our top choice, can be used if you want to use poly over chalk paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Someone asked me how to refinish a piece of furniture that had been clear coated with an oil-based **polyurethane**. I would not attempt to refinish this surface without at least sanding and adding a primer and I describe it in this post here: How to Paint Furniture the Easy Way. Remember, you are not sanding to remove the surface you are just barely roughing up the surface to accept primer or paint (How to Stand Furniture in 5 Minutes). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Benjamin Moore Advance was not only the best overall cabinet paint but it was also the best paint for coverage. I was really impressed with how well a single coat covered without using much paint. I was stunned that I just used a little over a gallon on all of my **cabinets**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When applied correctly, **polyurethane** will last for many years without yellowing or cracking. It’s important to choose a high-quality product and apply it according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the best results, use a brush or roller designed for smooth surfaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'Make sure you protect any walls or surfaces you don’t want to get paint on, by running masking tape along the edge of the **cabinets**,' says Yvonne Keal, senior product manager at Hillarys (opens in new tab). 'Lay down sheets on countertops, floors and appliances too, to catch any splashes of paint.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you've been wondering to yourself, "Is chalk paint suitable for this type of material?", you're in luck. One of the pros of chalk paint is that it can be used to paint virtually anything. That being said, if your kitchen **cabinets** are made of raw wood, it would still be best to sand before painting. Although the chalk paint on wood furniture may adhere well, smoothening it first will be much easier for you to do than smoothening it later; a light sanding should suffice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark paint colors are especially susceptible to showing smudges and dust so I use a clear coat on those to provide protection. Also, it’s a good idea to use a top coat on any furniture pieces exposed to regular humidity like kitchen or bathroom **cabinets**. Whether you are looking for the best top coat for chalk paint or even for latex paint or stain, this is a good general rule of thumb: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sherwin Williams High Reflective White is the whitest white paint color with almost no undertones.

This color has a very clean look, so ensure that there’s considerable natural light entering the kitchen else, it may feel too crisp! With little or no light, this color may feel quite cool and crisp, which may not align with the existing warner woods or traditional elements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But the main reason high gloss finishes aren’t used on **cabinets** is because of style. The look of matte and eggshell paint finishes are much more sought-after as farmhouse decor has risen in popularity. But while matte and eggshell finishes aren’t very durable a great compromise and the most popular choice for **cabinets** is a satin paint finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The top coat for painted **cabinets** does not only protect the wood from spills, stains, and heat, but also enhances the beauty of your kitchen. The application of a clear coat will help to prevent possible damage to your kitchen cupboards. The following are some more benefits for using a clear coating on your kitchen cupboards: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The paint is on the **cabinets** and they have a flawless finish! But don't get too excited and start using them just yet — you'll want to let them dry for at least 24 hours or longer. Even if the paint looks like it's dry, there can still be spots where the paint isn't all the way set and it can smudge or crease if you're not careful. Once you've waited for at least a day, then you can start using your **cabinets** again! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before beginning, make sure your **cabinets** are clean and free of dust. Once they’re clean, sand any rough areas until they’re smooth. Then, wipe away any dust with a damp cloth and let the **cabinets** dry completely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An easy way to update your **cabinets** is by adding new hardware. I like to drill holes for new hardware before sanding and priming so if I make a mistake, I can easily stop and fill the hole at that point. New hardware can easily update the look of **cabinets** without a lot of extra work or cost. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As mentioned previously, **cabinets** need to have durable paint to keep them looking nice for a long time. The paints you use for crafting, like acrylic paints, chalk paint and even milk paint will be different from the paint that you put on wood **cabinets**. You need something with a furniture-grade finish that doesn't chip easily and won't rub off or bubble and warp if a little bit of water gets on it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the material of your kitchen **cabinets** is wood, you’ll need to expend time and energy sanding the areas that you intend to paint -- interior and exterior. You’ll need to brush on multiple coats of paint, especially if the material of your kitchen **cabinets** are darker and the paint that you intend to use is lighter. If you intend to use custom colors, it’s possible for you to mix chalk paint together, but it could take a few trials and errors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting your kitchen **cabinets** isn’t quite as easy as grabbing a gallon of eggshell and going to town. It takes a little more prep than painting a room. You’ll have to remove the doors from the **cabinets**, for starters. And there’s special paint for kitchen **cabinets**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are looking for a finish for your kitchen **cabinets** that has maximum gloss, then this clear coat is what you need. This type of finish is great for your kitchen cupboards, although we do suggest that you give your **cabinets** a good stain before you apply the clear coat. This is due to its high clarity finish, which could leave your **cabinets** with a rather plain look otherwise. So, applying a light stain first will ensure the best possible finish, which should last for a long time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Experts advise using a random orbital sander to get better and faster results, although tricky parts like cabinet door edges should be hand sanded. If the **cabinets** haven’t been painted or stained before, start with a medium grit sandpaper before using a finer one. If there is excessive paint or a considerable rough surface, consider stripping. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, remember that the texture must be suited for the purpose. For example, a high-gloss finish is not acceptable on the floor, as it will make it very slippery. Your kitchen **cabinets** will look amazing in a semi-gloss finish, as it will fit into the aesthetic of your kitchen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Oil-based paint was historically known as the best paint for kitchen **cabinets** for multiple reasons. It has a durable finish and results in a smooth finish, which is what the goal is in a place like a kitchen. However, it isn't as common anymore because it's not good for the environment and dangerous to use. Use toxic mineral spirits to thin the paint, which you'll be exposed to during the painting process, and disposing of things containing oil is difficult and wreaks havoc on the climate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sherwin Williams is among the most well-known and accessible paint brands around. As such, their premium Emerald paint line is very popular, especially for painting kitchen **cabinets**.

-   This should be your first step. It may seem like a good idea to just paint your **cabinets** as they are. However, painting over or around hardware will result in a drippy, ugly paint job. So, begin your project by removing all of the doors and shelves from your **cabinets**. You should then proceed to unfasten all of the hinges and handles from both the doors and the **cabinets**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Sometimes you'll see paint products called “clear coat” or “clear coat paint”. Essentially, this is transparent paint that protects the wood **cabinets** from UV rays and damage, helping to make the original finish last much longer. It's similar to the stuff they use on cars to help them keep their color in the UV rays of the sun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

The next step is the final coat of paint, so it’s crucial you make sure they are perfect for that glass-like smooth finish on your **cabinets**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the differences between regular paint versus chalk paint is that there’s no need to apply a primer before painting. This means that you can grab your brush, your paint, and start redesigning your kitchen **cabinets**. Latex, another common type of paint for instance, will still need a well cleaned surface, then primer before you can finally get started doing the paint job that you want. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A cool white paint color would be a blunder in a kitchen with ample warm wood on the shelves, lighting fixtures, and exposed beams. So, if you have a warm color palette running around the house, it’s ideal to pick a neutral or warmer color for the kitchen **cabinets** as well. On the other hand, a cooler-toned palette like coastal would embrace the use of cooler whites on the **cabinets**. Cohesiveness is the ultimate key to a well-balanced home! So, now that we’ve discussed some important aspects of choosing white paint colors for **cabinets**, let’s have a look at the best specific examples from the manufacturers, Sherwin Williams and Benjamin Moore. To make it simpler for you, I am going to subcategorize it into three major types! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, if your **cabinets** aren’t subject to much wear and tear, you might be able to get away with using a less durable sealer. -Your personal preferences: There are many different types of cabinet seals available on the market today. Take some time to look at all of your options and decide which one will work best for your needs and preferences. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another step in laying the foundation for a smooth finish is to use a good, high-quality primer. The primer acts as a bonder, gripping both the **cabinets** and the paint. A good primer is key to achieving both a smooth and durable finish. Primer also helps to block existing color, necessitating fewer coats of paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're not careful, matte finishes can look really dull and boring. If you just painted all your kitchen **cabinets** doors with two coats of matte paint in the same color, it could look really drab and lifeless. The key to mattes is playing around with different colors and styles to find the right balance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Make sure that before you do anything in your apartment, you get permission from your landlord. Your lease should specify what modifications you can or can't make to your apartment, so read through that to start off.

But what I didn’t know before starting this process is how far alkyd hybrids have come. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many options available as a finish for your kitchen cupboards. These include stains, **polyurethane**s, oils, or lacquers. However, the General Finishes High-Performance Water-Based Topcoat is regarded, worldwide, as the very best **polyurethane** for kitchen **cabinets** and most wood finishes on the market today. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sanding is a crucial step in the cabinet painting process. It helps the bond of the primer and paint. Now, the is a way to paint kitchen **cabinets** without sanding and that’s by using chalk paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Choosing the right primer is essential in high-traffic areas like kitchens. We recommend a product like Sherwin-Williams Extreme Bond Primer that offers a higher degree of adhesion than a standard primer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing the perfect color is no mean feat with so many different options around. Look at your current countertop, fixture and flooring for color cues that might inspire your cabinet refresh. Darker colors work really well on the lower **cabinets** with light gray, white or neutral on the upper **cabinets** to draw the eye up. Galley kitchens might benefit from a dark shade on one side and a lighter color on the other, to help prevent it from feeling too closed in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Polyurethane is basically impenetrable by many cleaning substances and is very easy to maintain its visual appeal. Generally, all that is required to clean a **polyurethane** finish that has smudges or is showing up prints, is to wipe it over with a damp cloth and dry it off with a lint-free cloth. This is time savvy and very easy to maintain its exceptional appearance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It should be noted that, although chalk paint can be used directly on virtually anything, it would still be recommended that you use it on a slick surface. Simply clean your **cabinets** with a soft cloth to get rid of any dirt that may accidentally get trapped beneath the paint prior to painting. Doing so will give you a smoother finish. If you want a more decorative finish, you may skip this step altogether, if you want to give the finished product a more rugged texture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Polyurethane is a type of clear finish that is typically used to protect painted surfaces. It is available in both water-based and oil-based formulas, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Water-based **polyurethane** dries quickly and has low odor, but it can raise the grain of the wood and may not be as durable as oil-based **polyurethane**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Second, it is important to sand the surface of the paint before applying the **polyurethane**. This will help create a smooth surface for the **polyurethane** to adhere to. Finally, when applying the **polyurethane**, be sure to do so in thin coats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

In the south-facing rooms with yellow artificial light, expect this Sherwin Williams white cabinet paint color to sneak a yellow undertone.

When pairing with hardware, you can consider the metallic tones of oil-rubbed bronze, satin brass, antique copper, and gold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

If you have ever wondered how much it costs to paint kitchen **cabinets**, then the answer is a lot, especially with high-gloss paints which can be pricey. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because of the improvements in latex paint formulas, it’s almost as durable and polished as the finish you’d get from oil-based paint. Almost, but not entirely. Latex paint dries much faster than oil-paint, making it difficult to get as even and lustrous of a finish. Using a paint sprayer will minimize unevenness. But if you’re using a roller or brush–you’ll notice a difference while painting kitchen **cabinets**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A clear coat of **polyurethane** will not hide any defects that are there on the painted surface, and you need to separately attend to these before you start the application fo the clear coats. It is always better to use **polyurethane**s clear coats that have a high gloss for kitchen **cabinets**. Dust and dirt control is very important when you are using clear coats of **polyurethane**. So you need to cover any ducts that convey air and make sure that you have swept the floor clean and mopped it well before you start on the application of clear coats. You will also need to wipe down the painted surfaces of your kitchen **cabinets** completely and also allow them to dry out completely before you start applying the clear coats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I was impressed with not only how smooth this paint settled out but also on how well it covered. Dixie Silk is Dixie Belle’s newest formula of mineral paint that has a topcoat combined. I love the color options and it is NO-VOC so you can feel completely at ease painting around children and pets. It also has a fast dry time and great “scrubbability.” Dixie Belle Silk doesn’t only give your **cabinets** a beautiful finish but is also fun to paint with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Which sheen should you pick for the best paint for **cabinets**? Whatever you like. We recommend saint paint for **cabinets** because satin looks the best hands down. Semi-gloss tends to be too much sheen and can cause too much glare on your **cabinets**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If that is not a design feature that you want in your finished look, you may need to make a change. If your kitchen **cabinets** are made of wood, one change that you could make is to start painting along the direction of the wood grain. That way, it helps your painted kitchen **cabinets** have a more even, smoother finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A good rule of thumb is that nothing will stick to wax except primer. So, don’t put any clear coat over wax including **polyurethane**. You can however wax over **polyurethane** if you like the buffed look of wax but a much easier option is using our pick for the best chalk paint topcoat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting your kitchen **cabinets** is a great way to update your home on a budget. A good coat of paint can bring any set of **cabinets** up a notch or two. With the tips included in this article, you're well on your way to a smooth, professional, paint job! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best roller to use when painting kitchen **cabinets** is a mini foam roller. The foam roller is dense which provides a smoother finish. If you were to use a regular napped roller, you’d get a textured finish. I prefer using this type of roller. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to a smooth finish, I’m such a stickler! Unfortunately, one of the downsides to painting honey oak kitchen **cabinets** is that they have a very open grain. In other words, you can see lots of small indentions on the entire wood surface. To specifically test which paint finishes would settle into the wood grain to make smooth surfaces, I painted a sample of each on the back of one of my own cabinet doors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For DIYers, I personally recommend brushing or rolling your **cabinets**. There is definitely a learning curve with a paint sprayer and while it can be easy to use at first, it can be hard to troubleshoot problems unless you have some experience. Not only does it take time to learn to use a paint sprayer, prepping the space to spray the cabinet boxes can be daunting. If you are going to use a paint sprayer, I recommend just spraying the cabinet doors and drawer fronts and rolling the boxes. Here is an easy-to-use spray for spray painting cabinet doors: HomeRight Max Paint Sprayer - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, you can paint over already painted **cabinets** however it may require some additional work. If your **cabinets** are chipping and the paint is peeling, you will have to scrape the chipping paint off the **cabinets**. Then you have to sand them smooth. You may need to add wood filler of Bondo to make them smooth again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you're going for lasting durability, an appealing aesthetic, or somewhere between the two, your painted kitchen cabinet can dramatically affect the design of a kitchen and how big the space feels. And because it makes such a crucial difference, you want the best paint finish for kitchen **cabinets**. You can also learn how to paint your kitchen cabinet hardware yourself to save money! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gloss paint finish kitchen **cabinets** are ideal for single people or couples who don't have messy pets and children to worry about. If you want your kitchen to look bright, spacious, and impressive, then gloss can be a brilliant choice. However, if you have wood veneer and cleaning and maintenance are an issue for you, trying something with a much flatter finish to be on the safe side. And some homeowners make their decision based on the contrast of the **cabinets** with their kitchen cookware; considering if the gloss finish will pair well with their best nonstick pans since they are out all the time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Water-based **polyurethane** dries quickly and has little odor, but it isn’t as tough as oil-based **polyurethane**. Whichever type you choose, make sure to apply several thin coats rather than one thick coat. This will help prevent bubbles or craters from forming in the finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s easy to apply and can be touch-up if necessary. The downside of **polyurethane** is that it takes longer to cure, so you’ll need to be patient while waiting for it to dry completely. It’s also not as heat resistant as lacquer, so keep that in mind if your kitchen gets a lot of sun exposure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Right in between oil-based and latex paints are hybrid enamels. These hybrid paints combine the best of both worlds — the durable finish of oil-based paint and the environmental-friendliness and easy cleaning properties of water-based paint. Hybrid enamel is a water-based acrylic alkyd, so it looks and behaves like an oil-based paint (which is what alkyd paint does, just without the oil), while not yellowing over time (an acrylic paint property). This is arguably the best type of paint for kitchen **cabinets**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After you have filled in any indentations, you're going to want to sand everything down nice and smooth. Use a 100-150 grit sandpaper for this step. This has a two-fold purpose. You will be working to smooth out the wood filler along with any other raised imperfections on your **cabinets**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So you're giving your kitchen an upgrade, and you want to paint your kitchen **cabinets**. If you've ever painted **cabinets** of any sort, you know that it can be difficult to get a smooth finish. We've done some of the prep work for you, and researched this question thoroughly. Here are some tried and true tips to help you get that smooth finish you're looking for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lacquer is supplied in a matte finish, which gives you a dull finish and is not all that popular. Then there is a medium finish, which brings out the grain and natural hue of the wood and is used by most people resurfacing their kitchen **cabinets**. Lastly, there is a high gloss finish, which gives you a reflective surface, but it also shows dust more easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the easiest ways to get a smooth finish on your kitchen **cabinets** is to use flood coating with your primer. Always sand in between coats of paint. It helps the new layer of paint bond with the previous layer and the primer to make a more even coat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   SW Pure White is classic, versatile, and can work for one and all kinds of palettes. It’s definitely one of my favorites since it’s clean and crisp enough to appear like a cool white but with a touch of warmth – this color can pair with warmer colors as well. You must pair this white kitchen cabinet paint with taupe, beige, tan, blue, gray, and green on the lower **cabinets**. In terms of hardware, feel free to choose from nickel, matte black, satin brass, polished chrome, and oil-rubbed bronze. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But don’t worry! This piece of blog is dedicated to my TOP picks of WHITE paint colors for kitchen **cabinets** from Benjamin Moore and Sherwin Williams. When diving further down the line, whites can be subcategorized into warm whites, neutral whites, and cool whites. Depending upon your interior design style, the existing architectural elements, the finish of hardware, and the compass direction – the best white paint for kitchen **cabinets** can be chosen. So, before I reveal those majestic white paint colors, first let’s have a look at the bigger picture! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Benjamin Moore is a premium paint brand and is a major competitor to Sherwin Williams, so you shouldn’t be surprised to learn they have some of the best products around. Their Advance line is particularly great for painting kitchen **cabinets**. Here are some of the reasons why: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re considering painting your kitchen **cabinets**, you may be wondering if **polyurethane** is the right choice for protecting your paint job. Polyurethane is a clear coating that dries to a hard, durable finish. It’s often used on wood floors and other surfaces that see a lot of wear and tear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting your own **cabinets** is worthwhile but it is still a lot of work. Don’t leave the finished product up to chance by using just any old paint. Cabinet paints are not created equal and as you’ll see from my testing, the most expensive paints are not necessarily the best! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Really, this is the most important part of the entire project. A coat of paint will only be as good as the prep work. In properly preparing the **cabinets**, you are laying the foundation for a good coat of paint. So what does this involve? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Plus, it takes just soap and water to clean up. If you have leftover paint, just let it dry out and throw it right into the garbage–no annoying trips to the hazardous waste disposal sites. And you can pick your method to paint kitchen **cabinets**. A paint sprayer will give you the easiest, even coat. But with hybrid enamel paint, your wood **cabinets** will look great if you opt to brush or roll the paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   EDITED TO UPDATE: Since writing this post, we’ve decided to give our entire home a bit of an overhaul. Which includes finally replacing these 40-year-old **cabinets**. Having them painted and updating them worked well for 14 years though! I still think this is a great way to update **cabinets** and if ours weren’t so old, we probably would not have replaced them. It was just time. :) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your kitchen **cabinets** have been painted with gloss latex or acrylic enamel high-sheen paints, then you have paint that is stain resistant and durable, and it may then be not necessary for you to give any added clear coats over the paint. These paints are expensive and need a careful application, so the chances are that you have used other paints that are less superior. This is where you will benefit when you cover these paints with a clear coat like **polyurethane**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use a brush, applicator or lint-free cloth to apply the **polyurethane**. The **polyurethane** dries very quickly and any defects can be difficult to touch up. Ensure the kitchen is well lit up so that it allows you to spot any defects in your application. Apply a second coat if you feel there is a need for it, but in general, a well-painted kitchen cabinet will do well with just one clear coat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cabinets can honestly make or break your kitchen décor. If they're a nice color and are well-painted, they can make your kitchen look incredible. On the other hand, if they look rough, then your entire kitchen can take on the same vibe. A simple and affordable solution to making any kitchen cupboards look better is by painting them — even the most outdated **cabinets** can give off a whole new ambiance with a fresh coat of paint! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting your kitchen **cabinets** is an amazing alternative to investing in new ones. It’s a fantastic budget-friendly way to update your kitchen without the inconvenience of an expensive full-scale kitchen renovation. Kitchen cabinet painting is the best way to get a new look without the hassle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re planning to paint your **cabinets**, one of the best ways to protect them is by applying a **polyurethane** topcoat. Polyurethane not only provides extra protection from scratches and wear, but it also gives painted **cabinets** a beautiful, glossy finish. Here’s everything you need to know about using **polyurethane** on painted **cabinets**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Today I want to share the steps on how to paint kitchens **cabinets** and get a smooth finish like the pros. Along with a few tips and tricks to make the process as smooth as possible. Also, I’ll answer a few of the most asked questions regarding painting kitchen **cabinets**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sherwin Williams Extra White is a bright, crisp, and cool white paint for kitchen **cabinets**. This is one of the best white colors for **cabinets** if you’re aiming to achieve a cooler color palette in your home. However, you must be slightly careful when pairing this cool white cabinet color since it has the potential to appear slightly blue and gray in the north-facing rooms. On the other hand, in the south-facing rooms, this paint can counteract with the yellow light to appear slightly softer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this article, we're going to take a look at the 3 most common finishes when painting a kitchen cabinet – gloss, matte, and satin. You can also learn more about how to paint laminate **cabinets**. We will also compare satin vs semi gloss **cabinets**, as well as matte finish and which suits your kitchen **cabinets** the best. This Kitchen Infinity blog will compare their pros and cons, giving you a feel for the best finish for your kitchen **cabinets**. We also have a useful guide for those learning how to paint kitchen **cabinets** without sanding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A lacquer finish on your kitchen **cabinets** will outlast any of the other coatings like **polyurethane**, stains, varnish, or shellac. It may not be as durable as the other coatings, but will last longer without flaking or yellowing. It also seals your wooden surface by penetrating deep into the wood fibers, which is better than that of a topcoat. You will need just two layers, which can last for up to 10 years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Second, you need to use a high-quality **polyurethane** specifically designed for use on **cabinets**. Some lower-quality products can yellow over time or leave a cloudy finish. Third, be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully when applying **polyurethane**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting **cabinets** yourself is always cheaper than buying new **cabinets** or cabinet doors. As long as your **cabinets** are solid wood and in good condition, painting them yourself will save you a lot of money. For more ideas to save you a ton of money while increasing your home’s ROI, click here: The Easiest Projects To Add Character and Value To Your Home - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I prefer semi-gloss paint for kitchen **cabinets**. I think it shows slightly less fingerprints and mess compared to glossy paint. However, both are totally fine options and glossy looks great in ultra-modern spaces! If you don’t have kids or pets or cook much (or have a maid) – super glossy is great! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While chalk paint doesn't need a primer, it may still need a protective wax top coat. Adding this layer of wax is essential to keeping it a durable paint for **cabinets**. You may need to purchase special brushes to paint with wax as it does have a different consistency than regular paint. Wax paint brushes tend to have softer bristles, which makes it easier to spread the wax around the surface of what you're painting without leaving nasty brush marks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a few different ways you can go about painting **cabinets**. They all may or may not be an option for you. It all depends on what painting tools you have available to you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can put **polyurethane** on painted **cabinets**, but there are a few things to keep in mind. First, you need to make sure that the paint is fully cured before applying any kind of topcoat. If it’s not, the **polyurethane** can react with the paint and cause it to bubble or peel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Chalk painting is a fun alternative to conventional ways of painting, like spray-painting, brushing or rolling. While some prefer the more traditional route, others are more adventurous and would love to try out using chalk paint for their kitchen **cabinets**. Some think using chalk paint is beneficial because it’s quick drying, it requires minimal prep work, it’s water-based, it’s durable after waxing, and it can be sanded for a smooth finish. Quick Drying - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So as I said shortly after I started this blog I decided to start changing things around in my home. One of the biggest changes was my chalk painted kitchen **cabinets**. At the time Annie Sloan chalk paint was the rage. I was reading other blog tutorials on how to paint kitchen **cabinets** without sanding or priming. I was all about the fastest way to paint my **cabinets** so I went for it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are two basic types of topcoats for furniture: water-based and oil-based. Traditionally, oil-based **polyurethane**s were the main clear coats used on furniture but now more water-based formulas are on the market. Here’s a little about the pros and cons of each: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In some cases, when using paint for your kitchen cupboards, there is a residue left behind. However, with a clear coat for **cabinets**, this will never happen. A paint coating tends not to cover rough edges, but a clear coat will have no problem, as it covers any rough edges perfectly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lastly, this is one of the most important aspects when picking the best white paint for the kitchen cabinet. Especially if you have the **cabinets** reaching up to the bottom of the ceiling, the color of the kitchen cabinet has a major say. Let’s say, if you have a warmer and creamy tone of white paint on the ceiling, the ultra and crisp white paint on the cabinet will contradict it and make that “unappealing” appearance. On the other hand, if you have crisp white paint on the ceiling, the white paint with the ‘yellow’ undertone on the cabinet will butt against it! So, in this case, what do you do? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As it’s prone to chipping, you’ll need to regularly reapply coats of paint over again after a few months. You’ll need to take into account whether or not you’re willing to give your kitchen **cabinets** some touch-ups over the year. If this doesn’t bother you, and you want to go for a rustic, chalky appearance with your furniture, then this may not be a disadvantage to you. Additionally, milk paint could be another alternative if you want to have a more distressed and chippy look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Heritage Custom Painting is a professional painting service with years of experience, and we specialize in kitchen **cabinets**. Fill out the form below or give us a call today to learn more about what we can do for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are wondering how to seal chalk-painted kitchen **cabinets**, your best bet is Varathane Water-Based Polyurethane. Although it’s water-based, it is the most durable top coat that I have come across that won’t yellow. I have applied it on 5 high-use pieces of painted furniture and they all look as good as the first day I applied the clear coat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No, not because we enjoy doing extra work, but this is for when we paint the **cabinets**. You don’t see behind the hinge which makes it the perfect place to put your piece of tape. As for the other piece of tape on top of the numbered ones, that protects the number from paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A picture is worth a thousand words. Looking at before and after pictures of painted kitchen **cabinets** can help you envision your **cabinets** painted. It may help you decide to give this process a try. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When applying Varathane’s Spar Urethane, make sure to keep a wet edge so it doesn’t dry up on you too fast. In other words, work in a smaller section at a time, and don’t go over the previous section with your brush once you are done. It doesn’t give you quite as much time as its interior **polyurethane** version. Be sure to apply it within temperatures of 65 – 85 degrees Fahrenheit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use a the best paint for **cabinets**, hybrid enamel paint, and check out our post on the best kitchen paint colors for this year. Take your time with the prep work, and use care to sand and clean in between coats of paint. DIY painting is an affordable way to transform a room. Taking the time to repaint kitchen **cabinets** is a brilliant way to spruce up a lackluster kitchen and fall in love with your home’s heart. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While you could paint your kitchen **cabinets** without sanding, we don’t really recommend it. Sanding removes the top layer of paint and helps smooth out the surface, giving the fresh coat something to adhere to. You don’t have to paint bare wood, but it certainly doesn’t hurt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'Durability is the most important characteristic of your chosen paint finish in the kitchen,' says Helen Shaw, director at Benjamin Moore (opens in new tab). 'Kitchen **cabinets** and islands work incredibly hard and are subject to the bumps and scrapes of a busy household, so it is important your chosen product is up to the job. Eggshell is one of the most popular finishes, offering low levels of sheen for a smart, contemporary finish. Satin finishes are durable enough to wipe away finger marks or stains; if you prefer a more reflective finish, opt for a semi-gloss or gloss paint.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once your **cabinets** are prepped and ready to go, start by applying a thin layer of **polyurethane** with a brush or roller designed for smooth surfaces. Work in small sections and be sure to evenly cover all areas. Let the first coat dry completely before applying additional coats (usually 2-3 is sufficient). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Polyurethane kitchen **cabinets** are a type of cabinetry that is made from **polyurethane**, which is a synthetic material. Polyurethane kitchen **cabinets** are very durable and resistant to scratches, staining, and moisture. They are also easy to clean and maintain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Chalk paint and matte finishes have their place on wood furniture. But for the daily wear and tear wood **cabinets** withstand, you need to protect them. Unless you enjoy repainting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This step depends on the shape of your **cabinets** and if you are changing out your kitchen cabinet hardware or not. If you are and the new hardware you chose doesn’t line up with the old holes, now is the time to fill them. Patch the holes and any other imperfections with a high-quality filler like Bondo and let that dry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
