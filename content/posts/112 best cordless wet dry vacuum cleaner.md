A mop **vacuum** saves you time and work and leaves your floors cleaner than a regular mop. Traditional mops usually push dirty water around on your floors, leaving them anything but clean.

-   Is It Better to Vacuum Or Mop First? You should always **vacuum** first, otherwise you’re going to mop around dirt which can cause damage as well as making your home more unhygienic. Some **vacuum** and mop combos do both at once, but the **vacuum**ing function is at the front and the mop is at the back. So you’re still technically **vacuum**ing first, as long as you move in forward movements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Can I Use My Household Vacuum in My Car? We’ve certainly done that—hauled our household upright bagged **vacuum** outside, run an extension cord, hooked up accessory hoses and cleaned a car. But it’s cumbersome and inconvenient, and can potentially damage your **vacuum** as you stretch short and easy-to-tear hoses to reach inside. Stick **vacuum**s are lighter than traditional uprights, but often don’t have the optional hoses to reach many spots, or the powerful suction to deal with dirt and gravel from your floors. Canister **vacuum**s are a much better choice, have the best suction of all three types of household **vacuum**s, and are always equipped with longer hoses. You’ll still have to deal with getting it, its cord and hoses and accessories out to your car, and potentially scraping it along the ground as you work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Upright Upright **vacuum**s can be corded or **cordless**. Cordless **vacuum**s are really convenient for getting into tight corners or your car, but the battery life can be quite poor. Upright **vacuum** mop combos also have the option for steam mops which kill bacteria. Pros Corded and **cordless** options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
