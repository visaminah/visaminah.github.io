## 7 Unexpected Facts About Best Potted Plants To Create Privacy | Tall Potted Plants Patio Privacy
-   Now that we all tend to use our gardens as outdoor rooms we like to enjoy the same **privacy** outside that we enjoy in the kitchen or in front of the television. We don’t want to see or hear our neighbours and we don’t want them watching or listening to us. Plants can help. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Depending on the landscape, you'll need to figure out how high and wide you want your **plants** which in turn will determine the type of screening plant you should use for your space. For example, if you're planning on planting behind a front fence you may want a low-growing hedge so you don't completely hide your home's façade . On the other hand you may be looking for a tall-growing tree to create a natural **privacy** screen around a pool. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thuja or arborvitae – This evergreen tree is a popular option when it comes to what to plant for **privacy**. Arborvitae can grow literally several feet (.9 m.) a year and many species grow in a tightly confined space, which means several of them can be planted close to each other without a problem. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes, you have to plant a **privacy** screen fast. Whether you have just built a fence that the neighbors think is unsightly or your neighbor has just built a shrine to aliens, sometimes you just need **plants** that grow fast and can block the view.

Be careful though, some varieties of bamboo can be invasive and must be planted with this in mind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many climbers such as clematis, honeysuckles and Chilean glory vine (Eccremocarpus) tend to generate most of their growth towards their highest point – so fail to do a thorough job of screening unless pruned very thoughtfully. Bamboos in pots have become popular as screens but provide more elegance than **privacy** and, planted in the ground, the shoots of some types may emerge through the cracks in your – or next door’s – paving. They also suffer greatly if allowed to dry out completely - which is always a risk with large potted **plants** if you go away on a sunny summer weekend. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ivy, Clematis or Hops – If you are trying to cover a fence quickly, you have many vine options available to you. Some vining **plants** that grow fast are ivy, clematis or hops. These **plants** will quickly cover a fence and provide **privacy**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
