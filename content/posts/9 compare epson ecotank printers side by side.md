## 9 Interesting Facts Compare Epson Ecotank Printers Side By Side | Compare Epson Ecotank Printers For Sublimation
-   Connection choices include USB, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Wi-Fi Direct. For my performance tests, I connected by Ethernet. For Android or iOS mobile printing, Epson's Smart Panel app lets you print from or scan to your mobile devices as well as set up and monitor the printer. And, like most current Epson **printers**, the ET-4850 supports Epson Email Print and Epson Remote print, which let you send files to the printer via the internet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The ET-4850's performance ratings aren't impressive for the price, at 15.5ppm for monochrome black pages and 8.5ppm for color, but it delivered respectable performance compared with similarly priced inkjet tank **printers** and some less-expensive cartridge **printers**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Epson EcoTank ET-2850 All-in-One Printer is leading the charge for eco-friendly ink options in your family’s home office. Featuring an innovative cartridge-free ink system and impressive performance in a tidy, attractive package, the EcoTank ET-2850 promises to “exceed your vision” (according to the box, anyway) in terms of overall value and print quality. It’s an excellent all-in-one printer that’s accessible enough for the whole family, and way smarter than the inkjet **printers** of yesteryear. It easily slots into our best **printers** page. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How we test Every printer we review goes through a series of uniform checks designed to gauge key things including print quality, speed and cost. We’ll also compare the features with other **printers** at the same price point to see if you’re getting good value for your money. Tested printing with monochrome and coloured ink Measured the time it takes to print with various paper Compared print quality with other **printers** - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Similar to other newish all-in-one **printers**, the Epson EcoTank ET-2850 has a 1.4-inch LCD panel for menu navigation, which is handled by pressing the soft-touch buttons to the right of the screen. The $250 HP OfficeJet Pro 9015e has a much larger 2.7-inch color touchscreen that can be tilted at 45 degrees for better viewing. Granted, you can access most printer controls right from your phone or laptop , so you shouldn’t have to fiddle with Epson’s diminutive screen too often if you don’t feel like it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note: Epson rates the Epson EcoTank ET-2850 at up to 15.5 ISO ppm for black-and-white documents, and up to 8.5 ISO ppm for color, which amounts to the expected hyperbole when it comes to manufacturer testing. And not for nothing, but printing speeds are a somewhat subjective measurement, depending on how you test, what kind of paper you use, and what settings you tweak on the accompanying software. Plus, most **printers** achieve speedier outputs once they’re warmed up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The EcoTank ET-2850 is part of Epson’s new generation of cartridge-free **printers**, which feature refillable ink tanks to minimize waste. Depending on how much printing you and your family do on a regular basis, each of these new **printers** comes with up to two years worth of ink right in the box — and with every replacement ink set. There are six new EcoTank models to choose from, ranging from $250 to $500. The ET-4850 is nestled right in the middle, though it’s still a bit large to make a good stocking stuffer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turn the printer around, and you’ll find a host USB port, an AC adapter port…and that’s it. I appreciate the minimalism here, but a USB memory port or SD Card slot would be nice for speedy file transfers, especially since you can find such connectivity with cheaper **printers** like the OfficeJet Pro 9015e . The 100-sheet dual-sided document feeder is easy to miss, accessible via a hidden panel in the back. If you lift the main lid, you’ll find the glass scanning area underneath; there’s also an extendable output tray on the front. Overall, it’s a tidy, collapsible package that’s easy on the eyes and easy as hell to navigate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Aimed at home and micro offices, the $499.99 Epson EcoTank Wireless ET-4850 All-in-One is the top-of-the line letter- and legal-size printer in Epson's latest batch of EcoTank all-in-one **printers** (not to be confused with the EcoTank Pro line). In its compact size, features, and performance, the ET-4850 is roughly equivalent to the much less expensive Editors' Choice–winning Brother MFC-J4335DW, but the Brother uses cartridges, whereas the ET-4850's key draw is low-cost ink. If you don't print much, the Brother printer will be the better option, but if you do, the ET-4850 will be a bargain in the long run. That makes it our new Editors' Choice for heavy-duty personal and home-office use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
