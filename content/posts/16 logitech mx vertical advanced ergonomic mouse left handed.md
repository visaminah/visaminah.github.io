## 16 Things About Logitech Mx Vertical Advanced Ergonomic Mouse Left Handed | logitech mx vertical advanced ergonomic mouse left handed
-   The MX Master sculpt provides an extraordinary fit for the hand. From the back of the **mouse** begins an incline that peaks just below the base of your index and middle finger, so instead of hovering above the **mouse**, our primary clicking fingers relaxed on a solid structure. This provides a unique feeling of support lacking in the other mice we tested. From there, the **mouse** tapers off into a gentler slope toward the primary buttons and scroll wheel. There’s more than enough room for your clicking fingers, so even the largest hands should do just fine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Overall, we loved this **mouse**. It’s compact and portable, yet it packs ergonomics better than many normal-size mice. However, we had to pass it up as, compared to the Logitech MX Master 3, there isn’t much material for your fingers to rest upon, so they have to stay bent rather than fully relaxed. And as good as the customization software is, the MX Master simply features more buttons to modify. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Despite being so incredibly well sculpted, this Kensington **mouse** controls somewhat awkwardly. With your grip entirely on the **mouse**, it takes a tremendous amount of acclimation if you’re used to traditional mice. Normally, your fingers might take part in the more precise movement of the **mouse**, but to take full advantage of the ergonomic structure, you’ll have to rely on your arm for such movements. And those of us with larger hands also overshot some of the buttons when fully gripping this **mouse**, making it a little awkward in our hands. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Logitech made some really good decisions with the materials used on this **mouse**. The soft rubber on the thumb rest is a prime example, working its way up to the edges of the primary **mouse** buttons beneath your index and middle fingers, adding both comfort and additional grip. Only a handful of other mice we tested employed rubber on any such surfaces, and only two did as generously. The metal scroll wheels (both vertical and horizontal) also feel solid and satisfying. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Despite being so well constructed, the Logitech MX Vertical features little curvature on the actual clicking surface. Since it’s flat, you need to more actively grip the **mouse** to keep your hand on it. Relative to resting our hand on the Logitech MX Master 3, this was not nearly as comfortable. Plus, the MX Vertical features fewer additional controls to take advantage of. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The AmazonBasics **mouse** features an ergonomic design, but it is still far less nuanced than that of the Logitech MX Master 3. And its material construction feels much cheaper, even creating a sharp edge on the right side that can dig into your ring finger at times. On top of not having accompanying software, this **mouse** appeared to utilize **mouse** acceleration. This is a function that attempts to smooth out **mouse** movement, which ends up making this **mouse** feel slightly less accurate and responsive than the MX Master. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Overall design: We checked out the build of the **mouse** in detail, both visually and in-hand. Specifically, we noted the **mouse**’s architecture and button placement. We also noted how many additional buttons there were, and where they were located. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s a hard world out there for southpaws. Typically the best we left-handers can hope for in mice is an ambidextrous design than splits the difference, sacrificing some ergonomics for a design that can be held in either hand. That’s true even of Logitech’s pricey mice, despite the marketing that the company has put into ergonomics research. But Logitech is bucking the trend with its latest vertical **mouse**. The Lift isn’t quite as premium as the MX Vertical, but it comes in both right- and left-handed versions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Comfort: We spent about two hours with the **mouse** (after getting used to its weight and controls), concentrating on both short-term and long-term strain. An example of short-term strain would be if a button is difficult to reach with the nearest finger. An example of long-term strain would be discomfort in specific parts of the hand after using the **mouse** for the full session. We also noted any wrist strain over the long term. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Logitech Lift Best vertical ergonomic **mouse** Logitech The best vertical **mouse** we tested, the Lift is especially ideal if you have wrist, arm or shoulder problems. It's both cheaper and more compact than the popular MX Vertical, and it has the advantage of offering both left- and right-handed variations. $69.99 at Logitech $69.99 at Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The MX Master has a rechargeable battery, charged with the included USB-A to USB-C cable. And the cable is long enough to use the **mouse** at the same time that it’s charging, though it can interfere with tracking. We’d recommend juicing up overnight. If you find the battery’s dead but need it in a pinch, a one-minute quick charge provides a whole three hours of use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After many years of “**mouse**” use, noticed a degree of RSI occurring which seemed to be at its worse when using a “standard” computer **mouse**. Whilst researching for a more comfortable interface device, noticed that Logitech had brought out something that was dubbed a “vertical **mouse**”. These were available from other manufacturers as well but after the use of so many mice over the years, have always preferred the Logitech brand for it’s quality and reliability (although, at a price of course). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **mouse** was certainly ergonomic, given its combination of a vertical design, generous trackball size and finely curved structure. But a primary issue that arose was the accuracy of the trackball. In large motion it was fine, but during more precise movements like highlighting text, tracking was a little choppy. We missed the precision offered by the Logitech MX Ergo. Plus, the MX Ergo features a more comfortable rubber coating and overall higher quality construction. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **mouse** costs $70, and comes in three colors: Logitech’s typical dark grey, white, or “Rose” pink. (Somebody tell Logitech that most roses are red, please.) But if you’re here for that left-handed version, your options are a bit more curtailed. While the Lift Left is the same price as the standard model, it only comes in grey. All versions are shipping now. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As we mentioned, this **mouse**’s greatest downfall is its minimalism. While it looks sleek, and doesn’t even require a dongle, it does not provide much sculpted support for most of your fingers. Over longer sessions, we felt stiffness in our clicking fingers as a result. Plus, its software is PC-centric, cutting out a significant portion of its potential user base. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Lift’s vertical design positions your hand at a comfortable 57-degree angle (think reaching out for a handshake) instead of requiring you to rotate your wrist palm downward as you do with a traditional **mouse**. In our testing we found it easy to grip and get comfortable with right away, even for several of us on staff who don’t use this type of **mouse** often. Just note that its design is built for medium to small hands — those with larger hands may be better off with the heavier, meatier Logitech MX Vertical. The Lift’s white, graphite and pink options all look attractive and understated, and unlike many other vertical mice we tested, it comes in both left- and right-handed variations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
