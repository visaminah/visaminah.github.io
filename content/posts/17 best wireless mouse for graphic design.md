-   The size is the next thing that you need to consider as a graphic designer. You need to decide whether you will be travelling with your **mouse** or not. If yes, then you should probably get a travel-size **mouse**, otherwise you can opt for a regular-size **mouse**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Logitech MX Master **mouse** is a very good option. It might be the cheapest in the market right now, but the tons of features that come with it let it compete with the high-end mice out there.

We would recommend you to keep this **mouse** on your list, as it will meet most of your needs in a cheaper price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The big question that arises is whether you want a **mouse** that has a wire or not. A wired **mouse** has the advantage of not needing batteries in order to be used; this means that one can use a wired **mouse** for much longer than a **wireless** one that needs to be recharged every so often. However, a **wireless** **mouse** can be more comfortable to use, since there will be no wires tangling up and making a mess. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is a **wireless** **mouse** that you can connect to your system with the help of Bluetooth. You can even connect it to your computer via the USB cord. With this dual feature, you can use it with both old and new computer systems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Logitech is famous for manufacturing top-notch products with extremely ergonomic features. This **mouse** is yet another one of their top quality products and works exceptionally well. The only downside with this device is its hefty price, but the features provided make up for it. If you aren’t on a tight budget, then this Logitech Mouse is a great choice for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Anker Vertical Ergonomic Optical Mouse is an amazing **mouse** if you are someone who’s shopping on a budget.

This is an important factor, as these buttons help achieve a certain level of efficiency as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
