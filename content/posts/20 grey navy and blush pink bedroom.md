## 20 Things About Grey Navy And Blush Pink Bedroom | Navy Grey And Pink Bedroom
-   Thinking of adding **pink** to your home? It can be a scary thought to add in a color that most people associate with Barbie’s Dream House but it’s not that intimidating when you have a list of colors that go with **pink**. Adding **pink** to your home decor is as simple as knowing what colors will complement it. Sure we all may remember the **pink** 70s bathrooms or the bubblegum **pink** our mothers slapped up on the walls of our **bedroom**s when we were kids but **pink** has evolved when it comes to the home and it has a place in design trends. Depending on the hue, the color **pink** can be a calming color and is associated with love, kindness, and femininity so why would we not want it in our homes? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yellow is such an uplifting color and when you pair it with a beautiful **pink** the combination is sure to cheer up anyone. Adding in a **pink** couch here that is solid color allowed this designer to have a little more fun with a pattern for the ottoman. Throwing down a bright and vibrant rug that picks up both colors in the couch and ottoman brings them together and creates a unified design. Looking for more yellow inspiration? Check out our article on colors that go with yellow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As far as green and **pink** go, it’s hard to get them wrong. These colors are so complementary and I am sure that you could pair almost any shade of **pink** with olive green. Here this designer, Leah Ward has combined a stunning fuchsia floral wallpaper up against a vivid olive green picked up in the bed canopy, throw pillows and accent chair. It’s lovely that the bed and curtains are in a natural tone as to not overdo the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We are showcasing a lot of muted and blush **pink**s right now and I promise we will get to some fun, bold shades of **pink** but I must give this mixture of beige and **pink** its time in the spotlight. I love how the designer, Karen B. Wolf kept this room light and bright. She uses touches of beige in the furniture and fixtures to add a natural feel with gives this room a total earthy yet light vibe and totally complements the pale **pink** walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Being on opposites sides from each other on the color wheel means that **pink** and green are the most complementary to each other and it also means that you can pretty much find any shade of green to go with **pink**. It’s important to match the correct hues, though. Visit our page on colors that go with green to learn more about decorating with green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink goes with teal, especially when it’s a soft blush **pink**. By keeping the **pink** more muted and toned back the dark teal provides stunning contrast and that’s when we really see these two colors work together nicely. This geometric wall pattern is quite a statement but one can’t help but swoon over the complementary pairing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For those that love grey but maybe prefer a darker hue, this muted color can also pair quite nicely with **pink**. Just one **pink** piece of accent furniture makes a bold yet delicate statement and adds just a hint of color to break up the dark grey. The blush velvet **pink** couch in the image above proves that you don’t need to overdo the **pink**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The contrast here between the blush vanity and the stark black tile makes the vibe of this bathroom totally grown up and mature. Yes, you can have a **pink** vanity and still have a mature and classy bathroom. Black fixtures are also carried throughout in the lighting and mirror but then adding in just a few touches of gold in the faucet and shower fixtures really adds a nice glam to this space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fun and edgy come to mind when looking at this marvelous sapphire velvet sectional. There’s a richness but also a modern edge to the design of this room. Throwing in pops of fuchsia in the pillows, artwork and even adding a bowl to the coffee table give this room a fun feel all while maintaining the richness and elegance. Historically, we know that blue and **pink** are two colors that are opposites but this room proves that opposites most definitely attract. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A blush or very light **pink** always goes well with a matched muted shade. The light touches of gray and soft **pink** in this master **bedroom** leave a light and airy feeling. Using two soft **pink** armchairs to carry the **pink** from the master **bedroom** to the sitting area is a great choice for this room. This is a little amount of **pink** without being overwhelming. It’s a soft and feminine touch but not too much that a man would feel out of place. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With navy, you could go either way — bright and bold or more subdued. I personally, love a nice blush **pink** up against the navy for a stark contrast. Like in this front porch, the blush **pink** door is perfect not only against the navy siding but also given the color of stonework around the pillars and at the side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink and grey have been a trending color combo for many years now. Typical in little girl’s **bedroom**s the grey breaks up the **pink** but still allows for a girly but sophisticated vibe. Add in just a little pop of **pink** with mostly grey to keep the femininity to a minimum but on the opposite hand add in just a touch of grey with **pink** and you can give a space a distinctly sophisticated look. But let’s break down grey into two separate shades because between light grey and dark grey the looks are completely different. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If we like **pink** and white together and we also like **pink** and black together then when we pair all three we know it’s going to be an exquisite trio. If you have to be stuck in an office all day you might as well make it something that is pleasing to look at. Each color here is completely balanced and not one outshines the other. Yes, the black may add a stark contrast but the fact that it’s carried throughout the middle of the room makes this room balanced and well designed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dunelm's **pink** rugs are classic, elegant, trendy and add a splash of colour to your living room, **bedroom** or office space. Available in different sizes and shapes these rugs also look great when stacked together in the same room. No room is complete without a bit of **pink** so make sure you get your hands on one of our gorgeous **pink** rugs today! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When working with **pink** and incorporating it into your home, you don’t always have to go over the top with other colors. Sometimes just a little bit of color in a curtain or throw pillow is all you need. In this kitchen from Jasmin Resse Interiors, the bluish-**pink** kitchen cabinets are the main act and we just see a pop of turquoise in the patterned curtain. In this case, adding in any more color, I think, would have taken away from the simplistic beauty of these cabinets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Completely traditional, this entryway and staircase have a certain allure and I believe that comes from the textured **pink** wallpaper. Breaking up the white wainscoting and adding in **pink** gives this traditional space charm and elegance but also a bit of fun. Throwing down a **pink** rug also calms the space and makes it less cold and more inviting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this **bedroom**, the **pink** and blue share the weight. The nice, healthy mixture of the two completes the cheery and bright feel of this **bedroom**. One does not outshine the other and when pairing **pink** into the accent pieces like the modern end table you are left with a space that invokes sophistication but still allows for some feminine touches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blush **pink** and sage green are one of the most common colors for a nursery. These two colors when used together have a total calming effect. Very modern and trendy, pairing the sage green with the **pink** also allows for a child to grow into their room. As in the picture above, you can see based on the trendy wallpaper and wall art, it would be very easy to transition from a baby to a little girl and maybe even a teenager in this room. Also, it’s very striking to see that the sage green was carried through onto the ceiling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink and orange are two colors that you may not think go together but when using the right shades they do have a great appeal. When working with orange and **pink** try to keep with fuchsia. These two colors are both very joyful and are quite close to each other on the color wheel but you can still have fun with them. A bolding clash when done correctly can create quite a statement and can provide a room with a little flair and creativity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Much like green, there are several shades of blue that will complement **pink** quite nicely. When pairing with blue, this is when we see a lot of fuchsia, darker or hot **pink**s used. Pink and blue do match nicely together and culturally, these colors are seen as opposites so putting them side by side stimulates a sort of color harmony. Pink is not just for girls and blue is not just for boys anymore. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
