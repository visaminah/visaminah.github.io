-   By letting you direct water where you want it, adding a hand **shower** is an easy way to add style and functionality to your bathroom. Installing a new **shower** head and hand **shower** will be an easy project for even unexperienced do-it-yourselfers. For further help, a video is available.

-   *Note, in the video at around the 13:55 mark, the installer starts talking about the 3-port diverter valve and how you can add on another **shower**head or a ceiling mount **shower**head if you want. It's true the Delta diverter valve would enable this, but if you want an additional spray outlet, you will need to switch to a Delta 6-setting diverter trim. Learn more in our Shower System Buying Guide. In this particular article, we only focus on 3-setting, 2 spray outlet **shower** systems where the 3rd diverter port is capped. Keep reading to learn more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Depending on the condition of your old **shower** head you may need a wrench to help unmount your old **shower** head. Overtime, **shower** head connectors can corrode which calls for a little extra elbow grease. However, Clear Shower XL’s ball joints are made from stainless steel so you’ll never have a problem taking your new Clear Shower XL **shower** head on and off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To install a wall-mounted hand **shower**, select a spot to install the hand **shower**, taking the height of who will be using it into consideration. Remove the bracket cover from the wall mount and mark the location for the screw holes.

Attach the wall bracket with screws, and slide the bracket cover over it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Installing a delta **shower** **faucet** with hand held is probably a task best left for a professional, but you can learn a lot about the job requirements if you keep reading. Choosing the perfect **shower** system can help make your dream bathroom a reality! Our helpful infographics (below) illustrate how everything in your **shower** system will connect inside the wall.

This article even has a video that will help you explain the basic set-up required for a handheld **shower** with **shower**head complete **shower** system. Make sure to scroll down and check it out! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Water Temperature: If the temperature of the water isn’t getting hot enough, the problem may exist within the **shower** **faucet**’s mixer valve. This valve mixes the hot and cold water to deliver your chosen water temperature. To determine whether the problem is your mixer valve or not, try testing the temperature of the water in your bathroom or kitchen sink. If the water temperature is what you had in mind when it comes out of other **faucet**s, it is more than likely an issue with your **shower** system’s mixer valve. Our tip: take the temperature of the water from all the **faucet**s in your home when they are turned to the hottest setting, and keep a record to track for consistency – you may have a problem with your water heater if the temperatures fluctuate often. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Leaks: A **shower** **faucet** system can develop a leak in a number of places. First, you’ll need to determine where the leak is coming from. The most common places for leaks to spring up are where the **shower**head connects to the **shower** arm (the pipe that comes out of the wall that you connect the **shower**head to), the fixture itself (the components can develop cracks or become loose with wear), and where the **shower** **faucet** is connected to the pipes behind the wall. Check those first. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, it is time to drill holes for the **shower** handle and **shower**head. Check the measurements carefully because you need to be highly precise. After that, mark the exact points and drill holes with a drill saw. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, install the sleeve or cover over the handle valve following the manufacturer’s instructions. Put any trim pieces, like the escutcheon piece, and secure in place. Now attach the handle and secure it in place by tightening the set screw. If there are **faucet** covers, install those over the opening. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most plumbers can fix a wide range of problems that come up with bathtubs and **shower**s, including slow or clogged drains, leaky fixtures, insufficient water pressure and more. A non-working **shower** can be a major nuisance, so you’re most likely looking to get it fixed ASAP. Let’s explore what types of things can affect the cost of your repair, how to hire a **shower** repairman (and save money while doing it), and the benefits of hiring a professional to complete the repair. Ready? Let’s dive in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I will be entirely honest with you. To finish this kind of job, you will need some basic knowledge of plumbing and woodwork and a lot of patience. Take your time, read the **faucet** manual thoroughly, and take care not to lose any part of the head **shower** set. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Showers typically have one valve for both hot and cold water with a valve handle. The valve controls water pressure and the temperature of your **shower**. A leaking **shower** valve needs replacing to avoid any hidden water damage and leaks within the wall itself. Unlike a **shower** hose leak, **shower** valve leaks can be harder to spot. Turning the water on and following any signs of water damage should pinpoint the problem and determine the need to replace your **shower** valve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unpleasant Odor: If you notice an unpleasant smell emanating from the **shower** area, it could be a result of mold or mildew originating from a leak somewhere in the **shower** **faucet** system. Our tip: check whether the smell is actually coming from the drain or not before calling in mold removal services or knocking down any walls. This is a problem that may be easily addressed with a few treatments of a chemical drain cleaning solvent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In case you decide to install a rain **shower** head, you should read the instructions and suggestions for the installation of this kind of **faucet**. You will probably need to place it higher than the standard **shower**head. The goal is to get that special feeling of rain falling on you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3-Setting Shower Diverters Shower systems with a hand **shower** and **shower**head utilize a 3-setting diverter trim kit. The diagram below illustrates the 3 diverter trim kit handle positions and shows how the water flows through the diverter valve based on each setting. In a **shower** system with a separate **shower**head and hand **shower**, Outlet 1 is assigned to the **shower**head and Outlet 2 is assigned the hand **shower**. The 3 diverter settings allow you to turn on the **shower**head only (1st position), the hand **shower** only (3rd position), or run both together at the same time (2nd position). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remove Excess Dirt Once you remove the old **shower**head, you may find gunk around the threaded end of the extension pipe coming through the wall. Use a wire brush, old toothbrush, or damp paper towel to wipe the threads clean. Dry the threads before applying the thread tape. The Spruce / Kevin Norris - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   More Options to Consider Delta Shower Head with Separate Hand Held Sprayer Systems are our most popular configuration, however they are definitely not one size fits all. There are the obvious decisions you'll need to make before ordering, such as what finish do you like best, and do you want a modern or traditional style Delta **shower** **faucet** with separate hand held **shower**? There are also some less obvious things to be aware of when selecting the perfect Delta **shower** **faucet** with handheld spray. While the overall function will be the same, incorporating some of these options lets you customize your **shower** system exactly how you want! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Other Considerations: Water Heater and Water Pressure The hot water supply and water pressure are critical in determining whether the system you've designed will be a success. Your water pressure should be at least 45 psi, plus you'll need to determine if you have 1/2" or 3/4" supply lines at your **shower**. Delta Custom Showers do not require 3/4" supply lines. For help in determining the demand on your system, we recommend consulting a licensed plumbing contractor and/or the water heater manufacturer to determine if the size and model of your water heater is appropriate. If your water pressure is too low, a pressure booster may be required. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Examples of Shower Systems with Separate Hand Sprayer and Showerhead All the planning and hard work will definitely be worth it once you get to the end result: Your very own BEAUTIFUL new Shower System with Hand Spray and Showerhead. Your daily **shower** routine will never be the same again! Get energized and take control of your day by spending each morning is your dream bathroom. Your **shower** will sure to be the best in the neighborhood! Take a look and get inspired by the wonderful bathroom **shower** designs below! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Be careful not to mix them. Usually, hot water comes from the left and cold water from the right. According to the position of your hot and cold water supplies, you should connect adapters to pipes from the left and right. That will allow hot and cold water mix in the **shower** valve and then go up to the **shower**head. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Elements of a Delta Handheld Shower Head System To create a Delta **shower** **faucet** with hand **shower** system you will need several component fixtures. You can also browse our pre-built Shower Systems with Showerhead and Hand Shower Sprayer to get inspired. You might even find we have the perfect configuration already for sale! The components necessary to create a complete Delta **shower** system with handheld sprayer are the mixing valve and control, the diverter valve and control, the **shower**head, arm, and flange, plus the hand **shower** and drop elbow. Read on to learn more! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Install the Shower Arm, Flange, and Showerhead Wrap plumber's tape around the treads and screw the **shower** arm into the 1/2" female elbow you stubbed out earlier. Slide the flange over the arm and thread on the **shower** head. Slide the flange forward and turn on the water. Look behind the flange into the hole in your wall to make sure there are no leaks - a flashlight may help. If everything looks good, use some silicone caulk to seal the flange to the **shower** wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adjust the Temperature Limit Stop Delta Shower Mixing Valve Trim Kits all contain a rotational limit stop. The rotational limit stop is basically just a plastic piece inside the **shower** control. This small fixture physically limits you from rotating the handle beyond a certain point to protect you from being scalded by water that is too hot. A pre-set maximum temperature determines how far you can rotate the your **shower** control handle before being blocked by the temperature limit stop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Please note the install video below demonstrates mounting the female end of the ball joint to the **shower** head first. Again, it’s also fine to first mount the male end of the ball joint to the **shower** **faucet** first if this makes for an easier install for you and your bathroom. Either way, it’s recommended you install each piece of the ball joint individually to ensure a tight fit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’ve been thinking about replacing your old **shower** head with a new model, or maybe even adding a hand **shower**, you’ll be happy to know it’s a relatively simple process. You don’t need special plumbing skills, and will likely have it accomplished faster than it took you to get through the checkout line! Best of all, this easy and quick process will give your **shower** a fresh look in addition to the enjoyment you’ll experience from your new **shower**. Let’s get started. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Connecting the Hand Shower Hose Attach the **shower** hose to the threaded supply outlet on the drop elbow. Proceed with the installation of the hand**shower**, following the manufacturer's instructions. Typically all you need to do is thread the other end of the **shower** hose on to the base of the hand **shower** sprayer and tighten. CAUTION: To avoid damage to the supply elbow, hand sprayer, or hose finish during installation, wrap with a cloth or tape and use only a smooth-jawed wrench. DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN CONNECTIONS. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Start by wrapping some Teflon tape clockwise around the threads on the plumbing pipe where the head attaches. Next, screw on the **shower** head and hand tighten. Use pliers and a rag to continue tightening. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adding a Tub Spout to your Shower System People often ask us if they can add a tub spout to their **shower** system. The answer is yes! However it is important that you understand the way the tub spout should be plumbed if you want the optimal results. There is a right and a wrong way to do this and a professional plumber will definitely be an asset here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These types of repairs do not come with a one size fits all solution. You could have a Delta, Moen, Kohler or some old obsolete **shower** valve. Unfortunately, fixing a **shower** valve **faucet** is not as easy as fixing a leaking **shower** head. Every manufacturer has a different way of repairing their valves and come with different parts. So, you'll need to do your homework on what type of product you have before you move forward with any repairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remove the screw to the existing **faucet** using your screwdriver. If it is the water flow that is causing a problem, the issue is with your **faucet** cartridge. Remove the **faucet** cartridge using your needle-nose pliers. Once the cartridge has been removed, allow any blocked water to drain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Review the specific installation instructions that came with your new **shower** **faucet**. Some **faucet**s will use the existing **faucet** cartridge, while others will come with a new cartridge. If yours has a new cartridge, remove and replace the old one. Then, push it firmly into the valve until it is snug, and tighten the nut using a rag and channel locks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To identify the exact location of the leak, turn your **shower** on. Leaking from the **shower** hose is usually visible and easy to spot. Once you have identified where the leak is and are ready to fix this, turn off your water supply. Typically, a leaking **shower** hose is caused by faulty inner seals that have simply worn over time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After turning the water back on, allow the **faucet** you left open to run for a short time before shutting it off. Next, check for leaks around the **shower** head and **faucet** handles. If there are any leaks, tighten the appropriate part. Lastly, turn the **faucet**s on to ensure water flows correctly from the **shower** head and tub **faucet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Therefore, you should leave some water supplies previously, just in case someone needs it. Unless you live in a one-floor home, you should let the water from lower levels of the house run out and release the pressure in the pipes. After securing your lovely home, you can get on installing a **shower** head **faucet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Shower Bench If you plan to install a **shower** bench, make sure the controls, and especially the hand **shower**, are installed near enough so they can be operated while seated. This is an important feature to consider adding to your **shower**. As we age, having a comfortable place to sit in the **shower** can be the type of thing that allows you to stay in your home long term. Even if you're young, take a load off! Your **shower** is for relaxing! So grab a seat, turn on your **shower** system hand **shower**, and enjoy a luxurious experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Shower **faucet**s are removed differently depending on the make, model, and style you currently have installed. Some have removable covers over the **faucet** handles you can pop off with a small screwdriver. Others can have a set screw underneath the handle you can remove with the correct size Allen wrench. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adding an optional hand **shower** is another easy installation that will add versatility to your bathroom. A hand **shower** is especially, well, handy for bathing kids and pets. Hand **shower**s come in several types of mounts: they can be mounted on a sliding wall bar, directly to the **shower** arm or to the wall itself. Some hand **shower**s are stand-alone, and others are used in addition to a traditional **shower** head. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Running the hot and cold water lines to the mixing valve This step is identical to any **shower** **faucet** installation and is not specific to a multi-setting **shower** system with **shower**head and hand **shower**. You need to run your hot and cold water lines either inside the wall or up through the floor to the **shower** mixing valve. As shown in the video, it's probably a good idea to install shut off valves on both the hot and cold water lines while the walls are open as this can be useful later if repairs are ever necessary. This may seem somewhat redundant if you have a mixing valve with stops, however extra ways to shut off the water are cheap to add at this stage and can really come in handy if work ever needs to be done in the future. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turn off the Faucet Do not remove the existing **shower**head with the **faucet** turned on; water will shoot everywhere. Make sure the water **faucet** is off, but it's not necessary to turn off the water to the house. The Spruce / Kevin Norris - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   9. Re-Apply Thread Seal Tape To The Shower Arm Threads - Wrap the **shower** arm or threads of the hand held **shower** head holder 4-5 times going clockwise. Use your fingers to apply pressure to the thread seal tape, ensuring that it adheres well to the threads. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Water Pressure: Getting weak or inconsistent water pressure in the **shower** is a very common complaint. While it may not be immediately apparent what is causing the issue, it could simply be a problem with the **shower**head. If the **shower**head is old, or just hasn’t been cleaned in a while, it may be clogged or blocked by hard mineral build-up. Other potential issues could involve your water pressure regulator or your **shower** valve cartridge. Our tip: see if unclogging your **shower**head resolves the issue before assuming the worst of your pipes, valve cartridge, or water pressure regulator – it could save you from a lot of unnecessary worry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first step in the process is to accurately diagnose the issue with your **shower** **faucet** system. Once you find the source of the problem, you can then assess whether you’ll need to repair or replace it. Here’s some of the most common issues people encounter: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take care to place and fixate the valve to prevent any possible moving. This vertical stud will be the carrier for the valve, and it should be stable. Don’t forget to measure the place for the valve and placed it in the height of the **faucet** precisely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the handle and drain cover of the valve body has been removed, the valve should be open enough to show its interior gasket. The **shower** valve gasket is what controls and connects the water flow. The valve gasket is the most important element of the valve and is essential to prevent leaks and seal your **shower** valve body. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Again, the new rubber washers can be manually screwed on using your hands. Once fully screwed on, reconnect your **shower** hose to the base and head. To ensure everything is fully sealed and as watertight as can be, you can use your pliers or spanner to tighten up both ends of the **shower** hose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finalizing Plans In the planning stage you to decide what kind of mixing valve you want, what type of diverter, which hand **shower**, what type of **shower**head, and figure out all the connector fixtures like the **shower** arm and drop elbow. You can also let us help make things easy by simply choosing one of our pre-built Delta **shower** systems with hand **shower**. We make sure to include everything your plumber will need for installation! After deciding on all the component fixtures, features, collection, style, and finish of your **shower** head with separate hand held sprayer system, there are just a few more things you should consider to ensure your system performance will be optimal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Video Explaining the General Installation Set-up After looking at the infographic above, it might help to watch a short section (between 13:15 and 16.01) of the video below. The video gives a great look at a real rough-in job for a Delta Shower System with Showerhead and Hand Sprayer. The video does a great job explaining where to put the valves and where to stub out the pipes for the **shower** arm and hand **shower** wall elbow. Seeing a bathroom with all the walls open will give you a great idea as to how a **shower** system like is installed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The new **shower** head hits slightly below the top of the window. Previously, the **shower** head hit about 2/3 up the window. That’s a significant difference, both in function and in form. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   7. Clean Inside Of The Shower Head Or Accessory - Whether it's your **shower** head, hose or holder that's been leaking, you'll want to remove any of the **shower** head washers from inside the head or accessory. You can pop the **shower** head washers out using a small flat head screwdriver or a paper clip. Make sure you clean out any debris or loose thread seal tape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. Remove The Old Shower Head - While you can generally loosen the **shower** head with your hands, if it is really stuck on the **shower** arm, use a pair of pliers or a wrench. Just wrap the threads with a cloth to protect the threads from getting chewed up when using your tools. Remember: lefty loosey, righty tighty! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That’s why we reached out to our resident experts to give us the best insight into how to fix a leaking **shower** head.Before we jump into how to fix your dripping **shower** head, we need to first cover some of the basics of why a **shower** head may be dripping.You may not know this, but a leaky **shower** head is not always due to your **shower** head being old or defective. To know what you need to do to fix it, you need to look at the two types of symptoms: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you have removed the cover or handle, you can access the parts and components below. These parts will either pull out or unscrew. Continue to remove parts until you reach the **shower** valve – the plumbing pipe that sticks slightly out of the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you can see, when it comes to learning how to install a **shower** head, the main things you need is patience and time. It’s not the easiest process to complete, but it is one that is worth the results in the end. We hope this guide serves you well, and you have beautiful **shower** results! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the current adapter is not compatible with the new one, you will need to remove the current adapter and replace it. Screw the tub **faucet** onto the adapter until it is tightened and lines up correctly. Install the set screw if the new **faucet** has one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To replace the **shower** head, you don’t even have to shut off the water supply. Just remove the old **shower** head by turning it counterclockwise. If you can’t do it by hand, use an adjustable wrench. Make sure the **shower** arm doesn’t turn inside the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Showerhead, Arm, and Flange Most people are fairly familiar with **shower**heads but you're planning your dream **shower** system so take this opportunity to get the exact **shower**head you want! You can choose an overhead rain **shower**head, an invigorating full body spray **shower**head, a soothing Delta H2O kinetic **shower**head, a multi-setting **shower**head, or another great option! Spend some time thinking about what kind of **shower** arm you would like. Do you want the standard type where the **shower** arm sticks out of the wall so the water from the **shower**head hits you at an angle? Or would you prefer a **shower** arm with a 90-degree bend so you can experience a falling rain effect. The **shower** flange is a small decorative piece with an important job, it covers the hole in your wall where the pipe sticks out! In the example **shower** system, we are showing Delta's large overhead rain **shower**head mounted to a **shower** arm with a bend. This bend helps accommodate for the thickness of **shower**head and gives you more clearance. The decorative wall flange really completes the look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At this point your ball joint is attached to either your **shower** head or **shower** **faucet** (step 4). Now it’s time to carefully tighten the other end of the ball joint into place – do not over exert force or use tools to tighten. Hand force is sufficient and highly suggested. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may need to replace additional rubber washers in the **shower** stem connecting to the valve body. The **shower** stem is the part of the **shower** that the bottom of your **shower** hose connects to. These rubber washers are prone to wearing down and can easily be replaced whilst the valve body is disassembled. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   6. Clean The Face Of The Shower Head - While you have the **shower** head uninstalled, it's not a bad idea to get some of the scale and soap that may have built up on the surface and in the nozzles. We recommend submerging the **shower** head in a mixture of white vinegar and water for 30 minutes to an hour and then rinse with water. You can soak it longer if it's got heavier build-up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   PEX column is now connected to the drop-ear elbow by using Teflon tape and adapters. Now screw down it to the horizontal stud. It should be screwed down where the **shower**head from the other side will be. Also, be sure it is parallel with the valve below. For this job, use the electric screwdriver and fixate it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At this point, you’ll have the hand **shower** hose connection installed on the right side of the **shower** arm diverter, and the **shower** head installed on the bottom. This is also the correct positioning if you’re installing a hand **shower** that will be on a slide bar. Place the hand **shower** into the bracket cover like a holster until you’re ready to use it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To start installing a **shower** head **faucet**, you need to get to plumbing behind the wall. In case you have a particular door for this purpose, you can enter and do it from the other side. Since that option is not hard at all, you may consider yourself lucky because the people built your house were experts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In most cases, you will find a cut-off **shower** valve in your bathroom. If you do not have it installed, the second option is to look for the main water valve.
