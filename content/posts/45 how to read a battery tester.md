## 45 Reference List: How To Read A Battery Tester | Battery Hydrometer Working Principle
-   If your load **tester** is electronic, it will automatically remove the surface charge before conducting the load test. However, if your test equipment is manual, you will need to remove the surface charge yourself by applying a 300-amp load for 15 seconds. After doing this, let the **battery** sit for a few minutes before conducting the load test. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   NAPAOnline is your go-to shop for car batteries, **battery** parts and **battery** testing tools. Don’t forget to stock up on test leads for performing a **battery** test or stay even more prepared with this 10-piece Multi-Meter Test Lead Kit by NAPA, which provides large crocodile clips, flexible silicon pins and 64-inch-long interconnect test leads. For professional assistance checking your car **battery** health or getting it replaced, schedule an appointment with a local NAPA AutoCare Center near you today. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Knowing how to test a **battery** using a multimeter is important to ensure the **battery** is working at optimal levels and is not showing symptoms of wearing out. A **battery** failure can lead to seemingly increasing problems in the hardware of an electronic system or starting troubles in a car. A multimeter can be used to check the voltage and current produced by a cell which helps to recognize a faulty **battery** that may be replaced. The symptoms of a poor **battery** and how to test a **battery** with a multimeter are discussed below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Car Battery Testing & Voltage: It’s important to test your **battery** and electrical system regularly, not just when it’s starting to show signs of weakness. Proactively testing it (or making sure your mechanic does) twice a year will help reduce your chances of failure. Most retailers offer a simple free five-minute **battery** test. Use our Find a Retailer for a location near you to get a free **battery** test. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In most cases, the voltage across a **battery** can be measured to check if a **battery** is working or dead. But if the goal is to ensure whether the **battery** can supply sufficient current to a load, make sure to measure the amperage of the **battery** in milliampere-hour (mAh). Batteries are rated in amp-hours and voltage. Check the **battery**’s label to determine the voltage and amp-hours of the **battery**. For example, 12V 95Ah means the **battery** provides 12V at 95 Amperes for an hour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the car is off, a reading of 12.2 V-12.6 V shows that the **battery** is in good condition and fully charged, and if the measured voltage is less than 12.2 V, the **battery** is weak and may have to be replaced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When contact is made with both positive and negative contacts on the **battery**, the current is released. This conductive medium measures the **battery** charge (amperage). Each **tester** comes with a gauge that reflects the level of the charge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Luckily, properly maintaining and testing a **battery** isn’t so much difficult as it is easily brushed aside by those who aren’t aware of its importance. In their recent webinar, Larry Rambeaux and Jimmy Fielding discussed **battery** testing in detail. You can watch the recorded version of the webinar at any time for their full training. However, a summary is provided here: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These numbers are for measurements with **battery** temperature 70�F (21�C). When the temperature is lower, specific gravity will be slightly higher. For example, at 30�F (-1�C) 50% charge is at 1.210. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Prepare the Battery The first step is to locate the vehicle **battery** (consult the owner’s manual) and determine if there is any dirt or corrosion at the positive and negative terminals. The positive terminal usually wears a red cover and a “plus” sign, while the negative terminal has a black cover and a “minus” sign. Since corrosive buildup can keep the multimeter from taking accurate voltage readings, it should be scrubbed off using fine-grit sandpaper. Gloves should be worn to prevent skin exposure to harmful chemicals and **battery** acid. Once the terminals are clean, they will serve as the connection points for the multimeter’s probes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTE: Keep any open flames away from the automotive **battery** as it produces hydrogen gas that is extremely flammable. Automobile batteries are full of sulfuric acid that can burn your hands. Short-circuiting car **battery** terminals produces electric arc hot enough to melt steel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The instantaneous hand-held **battery** **tester** is a great basic option with which to equip your toolbox and use on any vehicle **battery** (hot or cold), including a small boat, ATV, RV or riding lawn mower. For more powerful heavy-duty, industrial fleet or commercial farm equipment batteries, purchase a hand-held heavy-duty **battery** load **tester**. You could also go with a digital voltmeter for continuous monitoring on a wide range of applications from 8 to 16 volts. This backlit voltmeter gauge provides at-a-glance monitoring of a **battery** while remaining vibration, temperature and moisture resistant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A macro enabled Excel software comes standard (32 bit office). If purchased with an IBEX-Pro or Ultra an adapter is available for use with Exmons Ultra Plus. Exmons software allows you to incorporate the specific gravity & temperature measurements with internal resistance & voltage data from the IBEX-Series **tester**s - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Car **battery** voltages above are for measurements with **battery** temperature 70�F (21�C). When the temperature is lower, voltages will also be slightly lower. For example, at 30�F (-1�C) for a maintenance free car **battery** 50% charge is at 12.24V. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When your car doesn’t start, often a low or dead **battery** is the culprit. Unfortunately, most vehicle owners do not check their **battery** until it fails. As preventative maintenance, the suggested best practice is to conduct a car **battery** voltage test regularly – at least twice per year – using a multimeter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **battery** test for an AGM or EFB **battery** is more extensive, as the demands on these special **battery** technologies are more complex. These batteries are subject to frequent starting processes and continual partial discharges. This effect is increased by the electrical consumers which have to be supplied by the **battery**, even when the engine is stopped. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some batteries have a built-in hydrometer that can be used to check the electrolyte in the **battery**. If your **battery** does have a hydrometer, there is an eye on top of the **battery** with a little tube and a green ball that sits down into one of the **battery** cells. The specific gravity of the electrolyte determines where the green ball sits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The All-In-One Battery Tester can test the **battery** strength of more than 12 types of batteries. Suitable for standard AA/AAA/C/D/9V batteries, button cells, and lithium batteries, e.g. in digital cameras. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Technological advances in **battery** testing equipment have reduced the size of these devices, while expanding the information available in the palm of your hand. Sophisticated **battery** **tester**s can measure voltage, resistance, temperature and charge. Check out the portable SOLAR 40-1200 CCA 12 Volt Digital Battery & System Tester with a 4.5 to 16V operating range. This one device can test conventional flooded acid, AGM flat plate, AGM spiral wound gel cell, start-stop AGM and start-stop enhanced flooded batteries. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Battery **tester**s for automotive applications are important. It is crucial as high currents are drawn during start-up. Ensure that your **tester** is compatible with lead-acid batteries before use for safe testing conditions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are using an electronic load **tester**, the **tester** will ask you to enter the CCA of the **battery**, **battery** type, and **battery** temperature. Make sure you read the exact CCA from the **battery** rather than assuming you know what it is, because many **battery** manufacturers make batteries with different CCA ratings that look the same on the outside. The **tester** asks for the estimated temperature of the **battery** because the colder a **battery** is, the less efficient it is. Giving the **tester** accurate information will allow it to make accurate calculations. The **tester** will then load test the **battery** and come back with a result of either good or bad **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In addition to gauging the **battery**’s strength while your vehicle is running, you’ll want to test your **battery**’s performance when carrying a large load (such as starting your car). Called the cranking method, this test requires starting the vehicle and pushing the gas (while in park) to reach 2,500 RPMs for five seconds. It often helps to have one person start the car, while another person reads the data from the voltmeter or multimeter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When the vehicle is turned on, the **battery** drives the starter motor, so more power is drawn from the **battery**. The voltage rating drops for a moment as soon as the car is turned on, but it shouldn't get below 10 V. If the measured voltage is below 10 V, the **battery** may not have sufficient turnover strength and may be prone to failure soon, hence may be either recharged or replaced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The SOLAR 100 Amp Analog Fixed Load Battery Tester, which features an easy-to-read, color-coded meter with a graduated scale for assessing **battery** condition, is great for keeping it simple. NAPAOnline also sells a large selection of **battery** **tester**s for automotive service shops from popular brands like SOLAR, Carlyle and DHC. For instance, shop owners can link this DHC **battery** **tester** to a computer system and text results to a customer or print off a report directly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While DMM’s do not provide a light-speed reaction to voltage variations based on sample rate, they do provide a stable enough reading to project static voltage, continuous declines in voltage, and charging system voltage output. One major issue to consider is where to make connection with the **battery** during such readings. In knowing that **battery** voltage is limited to connectivity between post and terminal, I recommend comparing post-to-post readings of **battery** voltage to post-to-terminal readings. Note that this process may be impacted by **battery** design, such as side post batteries. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take the rated CCA of the **battery** and divide it in half, then apply that load for 15 seconds. (For example, if your **battery**’s CCA is 700, you’ll apply a 350-amp load on the **battery** for 15 seconds.) At the 15 second mark, you need to read what the voltage of the **battery** is before you let the load off. If you take off the load before reading the voltage, you’ll end up with a bounce-back voltage, which will not give you an accurate result of your test. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No car **battery** lasts forever. In fact, a typical **battery** found under the hood of a combustion engine vehicle is designed to carry an ever-decreasing amount of electric charge for three to five years before its power is ‘discharged.’ Automotive batteries are being tasked to power more components than ever thanks to modern technology like GPS navigation, LCD screens, DVD players and connections to Bluetooth devices. So, before you hit the road for holiday travels to grandma’s house, it is a good idea to perform a car **battery** test. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A multimeter is an electronic measuring instrument that is used to gauge volts, amps, and resistance from an electrical source. The most common automotive application for a multimeter is to test the strength of a car **battery**. When used properly, it will provide voltage information to a high degree of accuracy on a digital readout. Understanding the data provided is vital in determining whether the **battery** is strong and healthy or should be replaced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To measure an electric system’s condition, most **tester**s need a connection to the circuit through wires. Simply connect the positive end of the multimeter to the **battery**’s positive terminal. Then connect the negative end to the negative terminal. Your comprehensive multimeter should quickly display a conclusive assessment of your **battery**’s capacity, as well as a reading on the alternator output and starting system capacity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When a **battery** **tester** expands the available readings to include not just the electrical current, but the entire system’s running voltage and internal resistance (ability to deliver a current), it is often called a multimeter. Essentially, a **battery** **tester** tells you what a used **battery** can do, while a multimeter gives you the real-time effectiveness of a **battery**’s operation in your vehicle. Our NAPA experts recommend the TrueBlue 31 Auto-Ranging Digital Multimeter, which has a 1,000-volt auto-range plus features a no-contact voltage detector and integrated led flashlight or the comprehensive Bosch MMD 540H Hybrid Vehicle Multimeter kit for hybrid vehicles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A car **battery** is usually located in the engine compartment towards one side of the engine, but can also be placed under the wheel well, the back end of the car, or even in the trunk. Refer to the owner’s manual in case of any confusion regarding the **battery** location. Also, access the **battery** terminals by looking for metal connections on the top or front of the **battery**. Perform the following steps sequentially to check the voltage across the car **battery** when the car is off: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Car **battery** maintenance is a year round requirement, because it is very frustrating to find in a morning that your car suddenly can't start because of the dead car **battery**. It happens usually in the coldest days. Testing a **battery** is fairly simple with a selected car **battery** **tester**. Read on how to test a car **battery**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you’re driving a big rig with multiple batteries in a bank or driving a compact car with just one **battery**, it’s important that your batteries be properly maintained. Batteries are the power house of your vehicle, and if they aren’t functioning properly, you’re sure to run into problems. In heavy-duty trucking, that problem often ultimately turns into a road call unless properly taken care of in the shop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Check the exterior of the **battery** case for cracks, broken pieces, leaks, or other damage to the case. The picture below gives an example of a damaged **battery** that you would not want to charge or load test. If your **battery** has damage like this, you’ll want to figure out why the **battery** is damaged so that the replacement **battery** is not also damaged. For example, check your **battery** tie-downs to make sure they are there and that they properly secure the **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Variations commonly found amongst 12V batteries on the market are absorbed glass-mat (AGM) and flooded lead-acid batteries (serviceable and non-serviceable). While diagnostics are similar, service and maintenance vary based on accessibility and chemical/structural variances amongst each type. Common testing procedures include the use of the following tools: digital multimeter; conductance **tester** (low amperage tool); refractometer (if **battery** is serviceable); load **tester** (high amperage tool); and/or PicoScope 4425A Digital Storage Oscilloscope (**battery** test option in PicoDiagnostics software). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take note, though, that these **tester**s only measure current. On batteries like lithium, the reading results tend to be inaccurate. This is because the current does not wear down evenly. It takes a significant drop at certain charge levels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **battery** voltage test is used on maintenance-free (sealed) batteries because these batteries do not have caps that can be removed for testing with a hydrometer. Section 2.8 will provide more detailed information about the sealed maintenance- free batteries. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Current vs charge. The current is the rate of flow of charge, whereas the charge is the physical property of matter. In batteries, the current is what actually charges the **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A car **battery** **tester** is an automotive diagnostic tool engineered to test the remaining capacity of a **battery**’s overall charge (an automotive **battery** **tester** does not test for voltage; that is a different electronic piece of equipment discussed below). Keep in mind when car **battery** testing that you are basically measuring the specific **battery**’s direct current. This diagnostic reading is a short comprehensive test of your **battery** health: capacity (available energy storage) and self-discharge (cell integrity). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, insert the **battery** into the **tester**. Make sure the positive and negative contacts on both the **battery** and device match up. Next, secure the **battery** firmly in place, then take the reading. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While slight variances do exist amongst manufacturers to indicate a **battery**’s 100 percent state-of-charge, I typically project 12.6V is the norm (lead-acid). While cranking, a measurement of at or below 9.6V indicates severe **battery** degradation or poor maintenance, and further assessment must be conducted, such as charge and re-test following **battery** manufacturer’s recommendations, cell inspection (if serviceable), etc. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note: The red one is positive (+), the black one is negative (-). Never connect the red cable to the negative **battery** terminal or a vehicle with a dead **battery**. Otherwise, this will cause a full or dead short circuit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the **battery** is fully charged and the specific gravity is high, the green ball will be in the center of the tube, so you can see a green dot in the middle of the eye. If the specific gravity is low, the ball will be shifted to the side so that you see black. If you have somehow lost the electrolyte from the **battery**, you will see white. At that point you will need to determine why the electrolyte is low. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Multimeter Setting The multimeter may look complicated due to its various measurement settings, but the general operation is fairly simple. For testing the electrical output from a vehicle **battery**, the multimeter dial should be turned to the “20 volts” setting. But before the multimeter can be used, all surface charge from the **battery** must be removed to allow for an accurate reading. To do this, the headlights should be turned on for about two minutes, then turned off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Determine the **battery** state of charge of each **battery**. If the voltage reads higher than 12.75 volts for a flooded cell **battery** or about 13 volts for an AGM **battery**, there may be a surface charge on the **battery** that will interfere with getting accurate results from the load test. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
