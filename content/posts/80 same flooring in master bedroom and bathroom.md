-   About Ari Ziskin Ari Ziskin is our resident expert in all things fitness, dance and **flooring** trends. After five years of blogging at Ari’s Menu, where she was featured on sites like The Huffington Post and Buzzfeed, Ari decided to pursue writing full-time. Nothing makes her happier than sharing her knowledge to help people create their gyms and begin their fitness journey. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When stepping onto cork **flooring** with heels, your shoe will make an indentation into the cork, but the cork particles bounce back after you lift your feet. Over time, heavy furniture can leave permanent indentations. Cork **flooring** is eco-friendly, available in many colors, and exceptionally durable. It's expensive, though. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bamboo **flooring** is often lumped in with hardwood **flooring** since the products are similar in quality and use the same installation methods. However, the bamboo plant is a form of grass, not wood. Bamboo grows very quickly, making it a completely renewable material, and **flooring** made from bamboo fibers is harder than most hardwoods, making it a very durable **flooring**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Having the same type of **flooring** in all your rooms will make your house feel more comfortable and cohesive. It is important to note, however, that the angle or direction of the lines or seams of the **flooring** is key to achieving these effects. Additionally, color choice and tone play an important role in the feel of it all too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Triangle : Triangle shapes are versatile when it comes to **flooring**. They are easy to decorate around and add a subtle statement and flair to your bathroom. Diamond : For a more luxurious bathroom floor, diamond-shaped **flooring** will bring some personality without overpowering the rest of the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many people who live in homes with two or more levels may worry about how difficult it will be to clean their floors. Different **flooring** accumulates different amounts of dust and dirt. This means that there will always be one specific type of **flooring** that requires less maintenance than others throughout the house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bedrooms and bathrooms are used for very different purposes, obviously, and you might not want to treat them the same way. For instance, you might want a calming, peaceful **bedroom** environment. This means softer, more pastel-like tones, and maybe some darker secondary and accent colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The dominant color in a room should cover about 60% of the available space. For a **bedroom**, think in terms of walls, the bedspread, large furniture, or an area rug. For a bathroom, think about walls, shower curtains, countertops, or cabinets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ask any real estate agent and they will tell you that the best way to increase the value of your home is to update either the bathroom or the kitchen. They’re the rooms in the home that see the most traffic, especially the bathroom. But how do you keep your bathroom current? By keeping up with 2022 bathroom **flooring** trends. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using distinct kinds of hardwood floors in an open floor layout often distinguishes certain zones. The entryway, for example, may have parquet-style wooden **flooring** while the rest of the room is laid out with straight planks. This can help you identify your entrance and complement your home’s style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s important to be aware of the trends when you’re doing any kind of expensive renovation, like a bathroom. Rustic wide plank wood floors in a bathroom is technically a more rustic farmhouse look. And that’s fine if the same floor connects the bathroom to the rest of the house directly, but if you are **flooring** a bathroom that is not continuous with your wood floors, or a in more traditional home where more formal wood floors exist in the hall, it’s worth considering a tile that will look like it has been there forever and is completely timeless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, the design and overall tone of any room start with your floor. It’s one of the biggest purchases you will make in any home update. To find the best **flooring** for bathrooms, you’ll want to consider your style and which looks will stand the test of time should you decide to sell. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Having the same types of **flooring** throughout a home can get boring. So, why not boldly choose to mix up the types of **flooring** from room to room? Once you get an understanding of the pros and cons of different types of floor options, you can better create a vision for your home's decor. There can be too much of a good thing, as you don't want to overwhelm the senses by installing every type of floor imaginable. Create a sense of unity between rooms while tastefully designating various spaces with a maximum of three choices of floors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When in doubt, engineered hardwood **flooring** is one of the best options for most rooms. Whichever type of **flooring** you choose should provide insulation, withstand foot traffic, and provide aesthetic appeal. Budget-friendly ways to make your existing floors fit your style is to use area rugs and complementing color treatments for the walls and furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Carpet comes in two major categories: cut pile and loop pile. The fiber loops are cut for cut pile, and the fiber loops are left uncut in loop pile carpets. Saxony, textured, and frieze are variations of cut pile carpets, while Berber and level loop are the main types of loop pile carpet. Textured cut-pile carpeting is the most popular type for **bedroom** use. It’s soft, has a casual look, and resists dirt reasonably well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If aesthetics are your number one priority, then consider selecting a floor that will look good in every room. If cleanliness is what concerns you most, then the same **flooring** throughout the house might not be for you. Unless they are kept spotless at all times, certain types of **flooring** tend to gather dirt faster than others. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not at all! Bathroom floor tile is still as trendy as it ever was. However, the trending bathroom floor tile looks have truly evolved over the last 5-10 years. You see, something technology has given us is the ability to achieve virtually any look with any type of **flooring**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Instead of utilizing the same **flooring** throughout your home, choose to coordinate via mixing slightly different hues and textures. Create sophisticated and unifying spaces by having a living room in a dark-colored wood, but use a slightly lighter shade for nearby **bedroom**s and in hallways. You can also install carpet in a **bedroom** that is a shade that complements the existing **flooring**'s color and texture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Try not to go beyond installing three different types of floors for the rooms in your home. Too many types of floor styles from one **bedroom** to another can create an erratic, visually disruptive energy. If all of the **flooring** within your common areas is the same, excluding the kitchen and bathrooms, keep your **bedroom** floor similar in color or material. When a living room has carpet and the hallways and other rooms are tiled, you can choose carpet or another **flooring** type for a **bedroom**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Carpet is a prevalent choice for a **bedroom** **flooring** surface in North America and many other western nations, mainly because it is soft and warm on the feet—an obvious advantage in a room where you are often bare-footed. That tactile comfort helps to create a sense of lush luxury in many colors and patterns in the room while also dampening sounds and protecting you from cold toes on chilly winter mornings. But there are other reasons that carpet is popular in **bedroom**s, as well as some reasons you might not want to use it, such as environmental considerations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s a reason why porcelain and ceramic are classic bathroom **flooring** choices. Not only are they waterproof, but they’re also relatively inexpensive and can mimic the look of pricier materials such as natural stone or wood. (And while the two materials are similar in composition, porcelain is different from ceramic in that it’s made from more refined clay and fired at a higher temperature, making it more durable and less porous.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The wood-look tile bathroom **flooring** trend is super hot right now. Tile manufacturers are keeping up with the times and following the trends of contemporary wood and stone. This means you can have the sleek, current bathroom of your dreams with good ol’ dependable tile **flooring**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What I’m saying is that the world of LVP wood look **flooring** is ALL the relatively rustic, wide plank look that is ubiquitous in the Farmhouse trend. And that look is not right for every house. We are so deep in the farmhouse trend that we can’t even see the edges of it. More traditional homes that have no business with rustic floors have them anyway because that is the only choice available, (as opposed to more traditional looking wood floors, with slimmer planks, stained and varnished, smoother and more formal). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Picking out your home's master **bedroom** and bathroom decor is exciting, but it can also be overwhelming. There are so many options. If you like a color, is it okay to use it for both rooms? We've consulted with the experts to bring you the answer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Geometric **flooring**” is a fairly open-ended term. It just means using different shapes to create eye-catching patterns. Luckily, 2022 is full of fun-shaped **flooring** to create a statement-making bathroom floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In terms of the dining room, some people prefer a type of **flooring** which will suit the purpose of the room better. For instance, some homeowners may prefer tile or linoleum over wood, laminate, or carpet to make an attractive space for dining. Similarly, some might want linoleum **flooring** throughout their home since it is waterproof and much easier to clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For wood-look **flooring** planks, herringbone is much more accessible than chevron. As for bathroom tile, both patterns come as pre-assembled mosaics. So you can save time and money on bathroom **flooring** materials and installation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another popular feature identified when discussing **flooring** is what material stands up best against moisture without causing damage. For instance, bathrooms, kitchens, mudrooms, basements, and laundry rooms experience high traffic and moisture. So, the **flooring** needs to withstand conditions other areas of the home may not experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While there's no need to break your budget on an area rug, it's also true that a good quality rug will generally last longer, look and feel better, and shed less than a cheap bargain brand. In terms of size, if the bed is placed on top of it, the rug should be large enough to extend at least two feet from both sides and the bed's foot. Smaller rugs used at the base of the bed or along its side should be large enough to fill most of the space. They can help keep a **bedroom** free from noise. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Install carpet in a room that you want to feel plush, comforting, and warm. If you are invested in your home and property value, opt for hardwood **flooring** which lasts for decades. Carpet is a fine choice if you are on a budget and do not have concerns about allergens or stains. Hardwood floors are a bit louder and colder when walking around but they look sophisticated and have high appeal. Ultimately, choosing between carpet or hardwood should center around your aesthetic tastes, budget, and acceptable level of maintenance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What you choose for your kitchen **flooring** really depends on the type of space it is and how much traffic it gets. A common mistake people make is to use laminate **flooring** in a high traffic area such as a kitchen, but it has a tendency to scratch easily. In contrast, hardwood floors are normally better suited for kitchens because they are more durable and less likely to be damaged by spills or scratched by cooking utensils. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cork **flooring** is most often used in kitchens due to its durability and comfortable support when standing for long periods. Although it is still a relatively unusual **flooring** material, natural cork **flooring** is used in **bedroom**s. One of cork **flooring**'s most important features is its ability to insulate between floors, providing soundproofing and helping keep heat and air conditioning where it belongs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If sustainability is important to you, consider cork as a **flooring** material. Waterproof and comfortable underfoot, it’s an excellent choice for the bathroom. It’s also naturally textured, which makes it the perfect non-skid surface. Plus, cork can feature some beautiful and unique grain patterns. To protect your cork **flooring** from moisture, reseal it every couple of years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to choosing **flooring** for a bathroom, most homeowners focus on finding an attractive, durable material that suits their style. But there’s one major difference between bathroom **flooring** and the **flooring** of other rooms—bathroom surfaces need to be waterproof. And picking a floor that meets that need should be priority number one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Flooring selection is a personal choice and often hinges on function, aesthetics, and budget. Using common **flooring** throughout a home has many benefits. However, there are solid reasons why some rooms may need a different **flooring**. While carpet is soft and warm in a **bedroom**, it’s not as functional in a bathroom or kitchen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The secondary color should occur about half as much as the dominant color. It gives the room depth and makes it interesting. In **bedroom**s, this would be nightstands, curtains, bedsheets, an accent wall, or the trim. In a bathroom, this would be towels, an accent wall, small rugs, or maybe the shower curtain (if you need more of the secondary color). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wood-look planks come in different types of **flooring**, such as laminate, WPC vinyl, and SPC vinyl. There are also wood-look ceramic and porcelain tiles. All of these **flooring** gems are perfect for the high demands of any bathroom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You really can't go wrong with sticking to a neutral color palette for **flooring** and accompanying wall color. Light-colored floor coverings go with walls that are dark, vibrantly colorful, or pastel. You can pair carpet, tile, or hardwood **flooring** that is white, cream, beige, sand, grey, or taupe with industrial, modern, traditional, or farmhouse decor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The big difference is construction. SPC rigid core **flooring** is traditionally thinner and even more durable. Additionally, rigid core planks are also better at hiding imperfect subfloors. If you are installing over tile or another unlevel surface, SPC is a great option that can save you some money in prep and installation without sacrificing style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, about 10% of the room should be an accent color. This can be a bright, popping color that spices up the space. Think about throw pillows, lamps, frames, or potted plants for a **bedroom**; and decorative bowls, soap dispensers, and toothbrush holders in a bathroom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vinyl **flooring** replaced linoleum in the 1970s, but homeowners concerned about the environmental impact of vinyl **flooring** are starting to return to linoleum. Linoleum, made from linseed oil and other natural ingredients, is the original resilient **flooring**. It has most of the same virtues as vinyl but is a more environmentally sound choice. Linoleum is slightly more expensive than most types of vinyl **flooring**, and design choices may be more limited. Still, it is worth looking into if you are considering a resilient **flooring** material that is 100% biodegradable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I am so excited to be partnering with Floor & Decor for our Master Bathroom Floor remodel. We originally had large gray square tiles in our bathroom, then we had dark hardwood floors in our **bedroom** and carpet in our closet. I hated having 3 different floors in such a tiny space. It was an eye sore! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's hard to match the natural appeal of real wood **flooring**, adding beauty to any decor style. While there are dozens of types of hardwood used for **flooring**, some of the most popular are ash, walnut, oak, and maple. The two basic types of wood **flooring** are solid and engineered wood. Solid wood floors are full-length pieces of wood from top to bottom, while engineered wood floors are manufactured using three to nine layers of wood veneers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Especially don’t consider wood look LVP for your bathroom (or **bedroom**, or laundry room, what have you) if it will connect directly to your existing hardwood or wood look floors. It’s highly unlikely you will ever find a close enough match for this to work well. It will just look bad. Sorry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This easy-to-care-for **flooring** usually costs less than $5 per square foot for materials, with installation adding about $5 per square foot. At this price, it is comparable to mid-range hardwood **flooring**. The look is unique. It's worth checking into bamboo **flooring** if you are already considering hardwood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Additionally, the bathroom is supposed to be calm and relaxing, like your own personal sanctuary. It’s where you go to get away from it all. That’s why cool tones continue to reign this year’s bathroom **flooring** trends. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Flooring often differs between floors due to function and the amount of use. Wet areas like bathrooms and low traffic areas or **bedroom**s may have different **flooring** than high traffic areas or important rooms. Hallways are high traffic and commonly are used to link upstairs and downstairs, so often have the same **flooring**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is perfectly acceptable to use multiple styles of **flooring** throughout your home from room to room. Typically, living rooms and **bedroom**s are carpeted from wall to wall. But, you can successfully enjoy **bedroom**s with floors that are different from common areas and other rooms. Use light, texture, and your room's layout and purpose to guide your design choices. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you think of romantic, you probably think of red or pink. These are great colors to use for a romantic master **bedroom** but could be overbearing when used as the dominant color. Look for ways to feature red or pink as a secondary or accent color with a more neutral dominant color such as grey, beige, or white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Make a room seem grand and open by sticking to the same color or texture throughout. If you opt to install imported tiles or have vintage hardwood **flooring**, make sure your paint color and furniture complement the space. Having specific rooms with the same type of **flooring**, colors, and texture visually unifies them. For example, have plush carpet **flooring** in **bedroom**s, but all other rooms should have the same color tile or laminate throughout. Use this technique for open-style homes or loft spaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For many homeowners, the **flooring** of an upstairs and downstairs is usually different. It’s a matter of preference as to whether or not this should be the case. For example, what’s more important to you? Having matching floors in all your rooms or having a different type of **flooring** used upstairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Strip, plank, and parquet are the three most common wood **flooring** styles. For **bedroom** use, strip and plank are by far the most popular. Both are traditional, linear pieces of wood, but the plank is wider than the strip, giving it a more casual vibe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next to carpeting, hardwood **flooring** is the most popular choice for **bedroom** **flooring**. Among real estate professionals, genuine hardwood is usually regarded as one of the best **flooring** materials. Not only is it beautiful and hard-wearing, but it's relatively durable. Even better, it biodegrades and is considered an environmentally friendlier surface. For home resale, hardwood **flooring** is the best option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Smooth-textured bathroom floor tiles in white limestone always look in beautiful contemporary bathrooms. In 2022, you’ll read a lot about texture. Knots, scrapes, brushes – everyone is talking about textured **flooring**. So where does that leave smooth bathroom floors? Still quite popular! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Installing different **flooring** in your **bedroom**, living room, and other areas keep your home lively and interesting. Stick to a maximum of three different types of **flooring** in your home to prevent visual chaos. Different floor styles can help establish the use of a room and elevate existing decor accents. Keep the following points in mind no matter if you select wood, tile, or carpet: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There may be situations when certain rooms require furniture or equipment that might not work well with either hardwood or carpet floors. The function or purpose of a room may necessitate a different type of **flooring** than that used throughout the rest of the house. A room that primarily functions as an office may require different **flooring** that will make it more conducive for work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Make your room look larger by matching your wall treatment and floors, or rely on a light-colored carpet, tile, or hard floor. Darker colored **flooring** and tiles with busy patterns will make a room appear smaller. A child's **bedroom** is better suited with engineered **flooring**, cork, or vinyl tile that can handle spills, wear-and-tear, and adventurous play. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In addition to looking chic and trendy, gray floors set the tone of a cool, contemporary bathroom. They, like white, give you a neutral backdrop for decorating in basically any color. Aquas, greens, bright bold colors, or even black and white classic tones – they will all go with your sleek gray **flooring**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A kid's **bedroom** needs to be outfitted with durable **flooring** that can bounce back after a spill, tumble, or playtime with toys. Combat scuffs, dings, and floor damage by installing a carpet or engineered **flooring** that is stain-resistant. You can opt for imaginative **flooring** types that differ from other rooms in the home because it is a kid's room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this guide, we’ll discuss the pros and cons of having the same **flooring** throughout a home, whether **flooring** should differ between floor levels, and if it’s OK to use different **flooring** in different rooms. Additionally, we’ll look at using multiple species or colors of hardwoods instead of switching materials, and **flooring** options for the kitchen and dining room. Our goal is to provide you with information to help make your **flooring** decision easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tile is known for being durable, waterproof, and easy to clean – perfect for any room. Especially the bathroom. But with the surge in wood-look **flooring** options, is tile on its way out? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although you can layer area rugs over carpet, they are typically used to soften hard **flooring**s, such as wood or laminate. When choosing an area rug for your **bedroom**, there are endless options of size, color, pattern, weave, and material. It's easy to change a room's style, color, or tone by swapping out a different area rug. Also, you can easily roll it up and take it with you when you move. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I was recently in a new build. The builder had installed a nice classic LVP downstairs and carpet upstairs. All the upstairs bathrooms had the same LVP as the rest of the house. But they were now installed right beside the carpeted hallways and **bedroom**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To get your luxurious bathroom off to the right start, you’ll want to see what’s trending with bathroom floors. Luckily, there’s a lot is happening in **flooring** in 2022. Let’s take a look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first question you need to answer is if your house needs new **flooring** at all. If the only problem with the floors is that they’re old or dirty, then replacing them might be a waste of money and resources. Assuming you do want new **flooring** in some rooms, how should it match? The same type throughout? Or different types for each room? Pros and cons exist to this. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When installing hardwood **flooring** in small rooms or hallways, be sure to lay it parallel to the long side of the room or hall or install it on a diagonal to the long wall. Otherwise, it will make the space appear choppy or small. If the end of the hall is home to a doorway that separates spaces, install wood running in a different direction or with a new grain to bring interest to the space. If there isn’t a door between your hallway and the adjacent room, consider installing carpeting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Without a doubt, you’re going to see matte finishes on bathroom **flooring** for many years to come. The trend of natural textures practically requires a matte finish, not to mention how practical a flat finish can be. If you’re looking for more gloss in your life, I recommend you stick to wall tiles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, sheet vinyl is resistant to water and slipping. Plus it comes in beautiful patterns to give your bathroom a unique look. So you can live your fresh **flooring** dreams in 2022. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether it takes the form of sheet vinyl, vinyl tiles, or newer luxury vinyl **flooring** (LVF) tongue-and-groove planks, vinyl is a surprisingly versatile **flooring** choice for **bedroom**s—no longer just used in bathrooms and kitchens. Many looks are available, with luxury vinyl products almost indistinguishable from wood, ceramic, or stone. Vinyl planks are a good choice for **bedroom**s. Although not as soft as carpeting, it's not as hard as hardwood or tile, and breaks falls better. The biggest downside is vinyl is a plastic material; it off-gases chemicals and cannot be recycled. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is far more visually pleasing for wood floors to match from room to room. Only a master **bedroom** or a kid's **bedroom** can reasonably get away with having slightly different **flooring**. Keeping the floors the same material and color helps unify the spaces in your home. You can easily change the wall treatment, furniture placement, accessories, and lighting to make it feel different despite having similar floors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gray has quickly become the most popular trend, not just for **flooring**, but for home decor in general. Gray cabinets, gray doors, you name it. And every shade of gray is still hot and trendy in the bathroom. For your floors and decor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the biggest questions you may ask is which type of **flooring** is better. The answer depends on your use. Is it for you, a child, or an older adult? Are you concerned about environmental issues, for instance, does the **flooring** off-gas chemicals, is it created in a green manner, and will it be recyclable someday when it is time to replace it? Do you plan on selling your home sooner rather than later? Some of these elements may be more important to you than others, but all should be considered when making a **flooring** choice for your **bedroom**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **flooring** in your **bedroom** is a particularly intimate surface. It is the first thing your bare feet step onto in the morning and the last thing they touch before climbing into bed each night. The effect that **bedroom** **flooring** has on a person is physical and psychological, making your choice of materials a significant design decision. You want it to be comfortable for bare feet, attractive, durable, easy to maintain, and complementary to the **bedroom**’s decorating style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A major issue of using the same **flooring** throughout the house is that it lacks the diversity and uniqueness that different **flooring** gives. Different **flooring** may be seen as an advantage by people who would like to have something that other homes don’t have. This diversity will not only be felt aesthetically but would also help determine what kind of furniture would fit each room’s specific type of floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So instead of forcing a darker color into your bathroom scheme, try focusing on the style. This **bedroom** contains quite a bit of dark gray and black, which might not be ideal in your bathroom. Instead, focus on the blush color, geometric patterns, and soft lighting as inspiration for your bathroom: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rubber **flooring** is made of virgin or recycled rubber. This type of **flooring** is durable, sometimes lasting for more than 30 years, and can be an excellent alternative for a child’s **bedroom** or playroom. It can stand up to dropped weights and is less likely to scuff, dent, wear, or tear. Besides its durability, it’s also easy to clean and maintain. It comes in a wide range of colors, and styles, including tile and sheet versions and flat or patterned looks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The benefits of having the same **flooring** throughout your home are many. Prominently, it confers an appearance of wide space and airiness. It further gives an aesthetic unity–this continuous space is visually pleasing and seemingly seamless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For the past decade, vinyl has surged in popularity as a bathroom **flooring** material due to its water-resistance, reasonable pricing, and ease of installation. This has resulted in a plethora of styles and designs flooding the market. The material comes as sheets, planks, or tiles, with sheets being the best option for bathrooms because the installation is virtually seamless, making it waterproof. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When buying a home or redecorating, **flooring** is an important consideration. If the floors complement the function and aesthetics of the space, they create harmony throughout. However, if the floors are a mosaic of colors, textures, and materials they can grate like nails on a chalkboard. The big question is, should **flooring** be the same throughout the house? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
