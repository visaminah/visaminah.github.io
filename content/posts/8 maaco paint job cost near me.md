## 8 Facts Maaco Paint Job Cost Near Me | Maaco Paint Job Cost Reddit
-   Every shop is a little bit different on pricing because of variations in quality, skill level, and the type of **paint** job being done. It’s probably obvious that **paint**ing a Ford Econoline van is going to cost more than **paint**ing a Volkswagen Golf, but there are plenty of other factors that play into the costs of **paint**ing a car. As does doing it yourself, though we caution anyone who thinks it’ll be a simple job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you get started, you’ll need two things above all else: time and space. Give yourself enough time to sand, repair, **paint**, and dry your vehicle. This is a crucial step that can save you big headaches with smeared or damaged **paint**. Space is vital, because unless you’re a machine (you’re probably not), **paint**ing a car will take time. You’ll need a safe space to store the car where the **paint** job can be done without damaging the **paint** or annoying your neighbors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The costs to **paint** a car vary depending on where the work is done, the size and complexity of the vehicle to be **paint**ed, and the quality of the **paint** job itself. In general, expect to pay anywhere from $300 to upwards of $10,000 for a professional **paint** job. The upper end of that price is where we find metal flake, multi-colored, and custom **paint** jobs, so unless you’re prepping your car for a show there’s really no need to spend that much. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of us have considered changing our vehicle’s color, but very few actually go through with it. That’s for a few reasons, mainly related to cost and time because changing a car’s color is a lot more involved than just **paint**ing in the same shade. Before changing your car’s color, here are some things to keep in mind: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like many things in life, you’ll absolutely get what you pay for when it comes to professional **paint** jobs. You can swing into a budget shop and be out the door for $500, but don’t expect it to be a top-notch job. A solid, high-quality **paint** job averages around $5,000. In general, you can count on **paint** job prices to vary based on: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After a while, that shiny new car you were so proud of starts to look dingy and faded. The **paint** has taken a beating over the years and all you’re left with is a car in a different color (or colors) than the one you started with. You could throw in the towel and just buy a new car, but those are the words of a quitter. Your other, much braver choice is to have the car **paint**ed by a pro, or yourself, to restore its former glory. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you feel that you’re skilled enough to do the job at home, and keep in mind that this is a big if, you can get a similar result for much less money. Supplies can run anywhere from $100 to $1,500, depending on what you already have at home. Also, keep in mind that if you don’t have a well-ventilated area where dust and debris can’t get to your new **paint** job, it’s probably best to let a pro do the work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing a mainstream color like black, white, or gray is the cheapest way to go. If you want a specialty color, especially one used by a premium automaker, you’ll pay more. Also, keep in mind that changing your vehicle’s color will cost more because of the work it will take to **paint** the engine bay, door jambs, and more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
