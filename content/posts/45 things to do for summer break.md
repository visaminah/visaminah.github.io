## 45 Fun Facts Things To Do For Summer Break | The top five things to do on your summer break
-   25. Make friendship bracelets and hand them out to all your girls. Sweet and thoughtful, your girls will love this perfect **summer** accessory! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Shannon Des Roches Rosa, mother to 10-year-old Leo and co-editor of The Thinking Person’s Guide to Autism, says that her son, who has autism, “is used to 1:1 supervision and engagement all day long, and I can’t possibly provide the kind of routine and stimulation he craves, no matter how many camps and grandparent visits his sisters get shuffled off to. I try to keep Leo occupied, and I have a lot of support, and having an iPad helps, but I still worry that—as has happened in **summer**s past—it won’t be enough, and Leo’s behavior and abilities will keep disintegrating until school resumes at the end of August.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   8. Go hiking. Find a nearby stream and take a dip. The cool water will feel amazing in the **summer** sun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is another activity you can engage in. You can learn a new skill or get better at the one you’ve been learning before. There are different skills you can learn during the **break**. There’s writing, baking, product design, fashion design, and the likes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you have been wanting to start your own home bakery or settling up a side business of online financial consultation, do not procrastinate any longer. This **summer** holiday, make use of the time and set up your dream project. Give it a start and you will have a wonderful opportunity to take it forward. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Biking — what could be better than riding through the wind on a **summer**’s evening? While many of us learnt this in our formative years, not everyone did. E-bikes are incredibly easy and safe to ride, and **summer** offers the perfect weather to learn to ride. Simply download the Bolt app and try out our e-bikes! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Kids who thrive on predictability and are prone to panic over transitions—including those on the autism spectrum—benefit from posted schedules that outline what will happen throughout the day (i.e., 7am: Wake up, go to the bathroom, wash face…8am: **break**fast…) Depending on your child’s developmental level, simple pictures can also help. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With natural attractions like Old Faithful Geyser, the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone River, Yellowstone Lake, Grand Prismatic Spring, and abundant wildlife viewing, Yellowstone National Park has been one of the top **summer** vacation spots in the U.S. for more than a century, and this year is no different. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Get involved in a local **summer** reading program, specifically at your local public library. Most public libraries have a **summer** reading program you can take advantage of. This is something you can get all of your kids involved with, or just go to the library and read to the little one(s) while the older ones participate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Relaxation is a relative term. Many of us have children of our own, who are also on **summer** **break**, and that adds a level of responsibility to our day. But for the most part, we try to take advantage of the readily available opportunities to relax during the **summer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even with the best-laid plans, you may see some regression and worsening behavior over vacation. Give yourself a **break** for not being able to magically avoid it. And be ready to hold your ground in as calm, firm, and consistent a manner as possible. Yelling or becoming physical only escalates things, while giving in teaches your child that if he screams loud enough, he’ll get what he wants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can’t visit the Waterpark Capital of the World and not stay at a water park resort. There’s really no wrong choice for family accommodations in Wisconsin Dells, but if you want to go all-in for your **summer** vacation, book your stay at the Wilderness Resort, one of the largest water park resorts in the country. In addition to its four indoor and outdoor water parks, you’ll enjoy a black light mini-golf course, zip lining, laser tag, and go-karts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Summer vacation means the kids are out of school, the calendar is wide open for family fun, and the best **summer** vacation spots in the U.S. are welcoming kids and parents with open arms. For most families, that means **summer** vacation ideas are back on the radar after a year or two of COVID-conscious family road trips, backyard movie nights, and other staycation vacations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not that our students would understand that. To most of them, we teachers are mysterious beings with mysterious lives; what we do during our **summer** vacations is downright unfathomable. But for those glorious few months when we're traveling with our families or taking a tennis lesson, we're just like everyone else. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sure, it’s not really part of the U.S., but the Bahamas is one of the most popular and convenient **summer** vacation ideas for families pining for a piece of paradise without the hassle that usually goes hand-in-hand with getting to the more far-flung Caribbean beaches (or flying with kids on flights that require multiple connections). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's true: Many teachers use their **summer** **break**s to revamp curriculum, update classroom activities, or attend classes for their certification. Some even have **summer** jobs; online teaching, tutoring, and counseling are some of the best **summer** side hustles, The Balance Careers says. But the beautiful thing about working over the **summer** is that we do it on our own terms—sometimes even poolside. That's at least sort of a vacation, right? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have some free time on your hands, why not explore your hobbies? Many a time you wish to pursue crafts or other activities but can’t do so due to a lack of time. Make use of your **summer** holiday and take up an activity. It can be something as simple as making a craft out of an old box or something as grand as painting your own home. Get a good property insurance plan beforehand to cover your house and then get going. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ok, there we have it. I hope those give you some good ideas on how to spend your time this **summer**. I’ll still be living here in Taiwan this **summer** where it is Hot Hot HOT until the fall. Hope we make it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yet while she remains “scared of **summer**,” she also sees a lot of potential—especially for Leo, a self-taught swimmer who enjoys basking in the family pool. No backyard pool? You may find your child is just as happy playing in a sprinkler and earning music downloads for good behavior.

-   And last but not least put the gloom of the winter away and get outdoors. You can simply spend time at the pool, go golfing, enjoy picnics or spend long days at the beach nearest to your house. Go for long drives, take your kids to the park and make the most of the **break** you have. Winters restrict your movement, but **summer**s make it possible to bask in the sunshine. Take full advantage of this and spend time with your loved ones while creating some priceless memories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Many of us fit vacations with out-of-town friends and visits to relatives into our **summer** plans.

We also make notes and take pictures of the things we see and experience so that we can share them with our students in the fall. Oh, and we text our colleagues the great ideas that our trips inspire, too. But yeah, we travel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   It might surprise some students to learn that their teachers look forward to **summer** **break**s as much as—maybe even more than—they do.

Summer **break**s mean we don't have to plan every minute of an eight-hour school day—and can day-drink if we want to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
