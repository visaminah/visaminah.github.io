## 16 Things You Should Know About What Color Walls Go With Dark Grey Bedding | What Wall Color Goes With A Gray Sofa
-   Recreate the look of a private member’s club with a grown-up scheme that oozes luxury and elegance. A must-have in any gentleman’s club, bedroom wall panelling makes an elegant backdrop for a statement upholstered bed and classic polished wood furniture. Paint panelling in a calming shade of **grey** that feels restful and relaxed and will act as a neutral backdrop for furniture and soft furnishings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Timeless and versatile, **grey** has become the go-to neutral in recent years and is the perfect colour to choose if you want to create a stylish bedroom that feels relaxed, calm and easy on the eye. Grey varies between pale and muted tones to darker, steely **grey**s and dramatic near-black shades, so there’s a host of different styles that you can create with men’s bedroom ideas. And **grey** is one of those adaptable colours that works with pretty much any accent colour, so opens up plenty of options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘The simplicity of a dark **grey** bed enables you to switch up interior styles as you wish, providing a timeless and versatile design. As for complementary colours, there are endless choices which you can bring in through your bed dressings.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Traditionally, more masculine rooms tended to be decorated in earthy browns, dark blues, greens, **grey**s and sometimes black, with bedrooms largely free from frills, flounces and overly-ornate decorations. Patterns were often simple and lowkey too, with geometric prints, plaids, stripes and herringbones offering a neat, smart and tailored look. That being said, things have moved on, and there are no hard and fast rules about what makes a masculine or a femimine bedroom…anything goes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘A really common mistake when working with **grey** is simply using too much,’ says Amy Wilson, interior designer for 247 Blinds (opens in new tab). ‘When lots of different shades of **grey** are used in a single room, it is likely to feel very cold and one-dimensional, which doesn’t make for a dramatic space.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘Grey is the perfect colour for creating a sophisticated, stylish and balanced bedroom,’ says Lucy Ackroyd, Head of Design at Christy (opens in new tab). ‘Sitting in the middle of bright white and bold black, **grey** offers a range of tones that can be incorporated into your **bedding** and overall bedroom aesthetic without negotiating with the lighting of the room.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘Warm tones enhance a comforting and enveloping feel which takes the chill out of colder **grey** rooms, and muted, mellow shades are ideal for a gender-neutral bedroom. Powder and pastel hues transform spaces into cosy and relaxing havens, while **grey** and white bedroom ideas are perfect for restful retreats.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘The versatility of **grey** means colour combinations are endless,’ say the paint experts at Dulux (opens in new tab). ‘Add a touch of luxury with a rose gold and **grey** bedroom theme, or balance brighter shades with cooler **grey** hues.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **grey** headboard and neutral **grey** **bedding** will work well with pretty much any accent colours. Consider adding a bold denim blue or indigo on the wall behind the bed to give a plain room a more manly vibe. While pale blues can feel cold and chilly in a bedroom, opting for a stronger shade can add warmth, especially when teamed with warm wood furniture, tan leather accessories and spicy accents of burnt orange on cushions and throws. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘If you love a solid wood flooring style but would prefer a more modern option, **grey** engineered wood flooring is ideal as it looks equally as impressive, but is more stable due to the layers of wood underneath. Accessorise your wooden floor with a textured, neutral-coloured rug to soften its masculine finish.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘Use texture and pattern to balance out **grey**’s cooler tones,’ says Amy Wilson at 247Blinds. ‘As a general rule, **grey** is much more successful where texture is applied rather than as a flat finish, like with a paint. Therefore, it may suit the space better to bring in **grey** through cushions, curtains, blinds or **bedding** for a livelier look.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Utilise wasted space above and around a bed, by considering a built-in bridge of storage directly above the bed and continuing down each side. Storage cubbies can be left open for display or doors added so that everything is hidden neatly away. Opt for a calm **grey** colourway so that units blend in seamlessly with wall colour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘Using a lighter **grey** duvet as your base, elevate the look by pairing it with dark charcoal accessories like a cosy throw. Complete the design by adding artisan-style woven-cushions in monochrome stripes and zig-zags. Adding texture, shapes and patterns through soft furnishings creates a sense of energy, youthfulness and creativity.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Combine the steeliness of dark **grey** with a touch of calming white in a half-and-half bedroom scheme. Using a darker colour on the lower portion of walls creates a grounding effect and gives a contrast backdrop for furniture and **bedding**. Painting the upper section of wall in a paler shade, helps to stretch the height of a room visually, which is a neat idea if bedroom space is tight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘Grey is an obvious but great colour choice when looking to achieve a masculine space, however, straight lines are just as key for this style,’ says Jonathan Warren, Director and bed specialist at Time4Sleep (opens in new tab). ‘Opting for an ottoman bed is a great way to bring in a darker charcoal **grey** shade as well as sleek straight lines, resulting in a sophisticated finish.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘Having **grey** flooring in your bedroom can create an instant warm and welcoming feel,’ says Carolina Hanson, Head of Design at Luxury Flooring & Furnishings (opens in new tab). ‘Single plank style flooring makes a great choice as it is very minimalist - keeping things calm and simple whilst adding timeless character to the room.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
