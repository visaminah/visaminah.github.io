## 86 Reference List: What Are The Best Poultry Shears | The 5 Best Kitchen Shears of 2022
-   Bennett Fisher is our head tester. He is a product developer specializing in sun protective clothing and backpacking equipment but has also focused on human-centered design with composites and household items. He has spent the past three years using fabric **shears** while sewing up prototype apparel and bags, helping him understand the importance of a comfortable pair of sharp **shears**. It is no different in the kitchen or around the house when you need something cut or opened. Kitchen **shears** are convenient and make quick work without getting out a big knife or cutting board, and should cut right through anything, not hurting your hands in the process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ✔ HEAVY-DUTY CONSTRUCTION: With 9.6 Inch long, 3.5mm blade thickness, engineered for perfection and built to last a lifetime, our high-quality stainless steel kitchen **shears** are strong, durable, rust-resistant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The edges of the blades comprise of fine serrations that grip and cut the flesh right apart, without causing a nasty mess. These ultra-sharp blades measure 4.5” in length with a double-beveling and an ergonomic design. This is what accounts for precision-cutting and accurate measures of the **shears** when it comes to portions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But again, if the OXO kitchen scissors are sold out or if you can’t find them anywhere, the Kai Kitchen Scissors are our runner-up choice. In our kitchen **shears** tests, the more-expensive pair performed as well as the OXO kitchen scissors, with a similar single serrated blade but a more squared off look. However, they’re not as readily available and don’t come with OXO’s guarantee. They’re a good choice if you can’t find the OXO scissors, but you likely won’t have that problem. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Poultry **shears** are essentially scissors. When breaking down a chicken, duck, or goose you’ll want to target joints where two bones intersect. Shears can also cut cleanly through the breast bone both for spatchcocking or for disassembling a chicken into bucket pieces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We don't like our hands cramping after cutting for long periods, and we are guessing you don't either, so we made handle comfort equally weighted with ease of cleaning. On top of all the cutting for the sharpness test, we also cut three feet of cardboard to test heavy use on a resistant material. After all that cutting, the OXO Good Grips Multi-Purpose Scissors had the softest and most comfortable handles. The handle has silicone stretched over it, giving the **shears** a nice squish when closed. The KitchenAid All Purpose Shears come in next with a much firmer but more ergonomic handle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for a solid pair of multipurpose kitchen **shears** (with comfortable handles) that do more than just snip, these Zwilling Henckels take-apart kitchen **shears** are among the most sturdy heavy-duty kitchen scissors we’ve used. The 3" stainless-steel blades are high-quality, corrosion-resistant, and micro-serrated for easier, more efficient cutting. These **shears** can also replace several of your kitchen gadgets in a pinch; that jagged-toothed section of the handle can be used as a bottle opener or nutcracker. Can your knife do that? But mostly, we like that the blades come apart, which makes for easy cleaning after dispatching raw **poultry**. Hand-washing is recommended. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That’s where **poultry** **shears** come in. A cut above your standard kitchen scissors, these clippers are designed to slice through bird carcasses both big and small, from the smallest of spatchcocks to the fattest of turkeys. Unfortunately, some of the **shears** on the market are about as useful as those plastic scissors your toddler has. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Besides, the kitchen assistance from TANSUNG is produced by a high standard of CNC technology to represent premium quality and delicate design. Specifically, the stainless steel blades are ultra-sharp and strong for heavy-duty **poultry** cutting effortlessly. Further, there is no rust or corrosion during use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **poultry** **shears** are designed to handle different kinds of food. For example, the front part of the scissors where the blades ‘meet’ continuously is meant to cut meat. It is important to note that in order to cut meat perfectly, you use only the front part of the scissors and not the rear part with the groove, which is designed specially to cut bones. It is important to note that these **poultry** **shears** do not cut through skin. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Straightforward and practical, these **poultry** **shears** feature a tough-as-nails 3.5-inch serrated steel blade and a specially designed handle that will see you break down any bird with ease. The **shears** are spring-loaded so you get maximum slicing force with minimal effort. The locking mechanism is easy to engage and disengage (and doesn’t get in the way), so you can go to town on that chicken safely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just like a Swiss Army Knife, this pair of **poultry** **shears** packs several tools into one seamless design. You can cut through bones in a cinch, chop up veggies, peel fruits, scrape fish scales and even open a beer. Crafted from the same stainless steel as most high-quality chef knives, the blade is not only supremely sharp but also resistant to rusting and corrosion. The heavy-duty scissors have a large textured handgrip to keep your hand secure while cutting. Plus, you can detach the blade to clean thoroughly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should make sure that whatever you choose is comfortable and easy to use. The handles and handle loops of the **shears** should comfortably accommodate your fingers. Soft-grip coatings will prevent strains and undue pressure on your finger. Also, go for a pair that will allow ambidextrous use easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No other scissors cut through as many different materials as well as the Kai **shears**, with no tears, hanging threads, or divots. They’re the best scissors on the market for cutting through any random object you decide you want to trim—the perfect all-around scissor. Your biggest problem is going to be preventing family members, roommates, and dates you’re trying to impress from absconding with your perfect scissors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These all-steel **poultry** **shears** are stylish, versatile and super sharp. The ergonomic handle is suitable for left- and right-handed people and is slip-proof thanks to a “grasp and hold” design. But what really sets this pair of scissors apart is the ingenious two-in-one blade design that allows you to complete two of the most essential tasks relating to **poultry**: snip and trim through skin and cleave through bone. They’re also extremely hygienic, as there is no chance of bacteria sticking to the stainless steel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A set of **poultry** **shears** typically looks a lot like a pair of scissors, although the **shears** generally look and feel heavier. The ideal material for these **shears** is carbon steel, which holds an edge well and remains extremely durable, although it is also possible to find **shears** made from stainless metal. Depending on the design, the **shears** may be solid molded, or handles in materials like plastic may be attached. It is also not uncommon to find serrations or notches on one blade to grip the meat while it is cut. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We love how easy it is to clean the **shears**. In fact, the blades separate easily to aid thorough cleaning. You can adjust the interlocking screw of the **shears** for the desired preferences. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Serrated blades will provide you with a better grip any day over a straight-edged knife. And if the **shears** are sufficiently durable, these could cut through bones and tendons effortlessly. The serrations also provide a non-slip, safe grip during use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How about you? Which is your ideal **poultry** shear? Hopefully, my review will help you choose the best one that meets your demand. If you like this post, please give it a thumbs up or share it with others. Thank you! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   10/18/12 Update...Still going strong after several years. Blades have remained sharp and all the parts (handle, spring, the latch that keeps **shears** closed when not in use)are in really good shape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In our tests, they sliced easily through materials as varied as marshmallows, parchment paper, and clamshell packaging. One micro-serrated edge keeps a hold on slippery meats and seafood, and the blades come apart for easy cleaning. The handles are large enough to accommodate most hands, and they have a bit of cushioning for comfort, although that didn’t make much of a difference in our tests. Finally, OXO’s satisfaction guarantee gave these a leg up on **shears** that performed similarly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This delivers a super-clean cut of accurate proportions. We absolutely loved the kind of precision cutting that these **shears** offered for separating flesh from joints or cutting them altogether. These could even cut through tendons, and the bone notch on the tool can be used for small **poultry** bones as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to buying the best **poultry** **shears**, you should know some fundamental factors that highlight kitchen utensils. Otherwise, you might find it hard to choose the best one or waste your money on an invaluable product. Hence, below are four essential things you should consider when opting for the best **poultry** **shears**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To maintain the sharpness of the blades, it is recommended to store the **poultry** **shears** in a knife block, cover it with a sheath, or put it in a drawer separate from other utensils. These **poultry** **shears** measure 9.35 inches long by 3.94 inches wide. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But “regular” all-around scissors aren’t always best for everything. If you’re looking for a pair of snips to keep in the kitchen, OXO Good Grips Kitchen and Herb Scissors is the best pair because it combines sharp, take-apart blades, a micro-serrated blade for gripping slippery raw meats, roomy handles, and a great warranty. These snip raw **poultry** and fresh herbs swiftly and cleanly—unlike some other models that let things slide. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just like a Swiss Army Knife, this pair of **poultry** **shears** packs several tools into one seamless design. You can cut through bones in a cinch, chop up veggies, peel fruits, scrape fish scales and even open a beer. Crafted from the same stainless steel as most high-quality chef knives, the blade is not only supremely sharp but also resistant to rusting and corrosion. The heavy-duty **shears** have a large textured handgrip to keep your hand secure while cutting. Plus, you can detach the blade to clean thoroughly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Poultry **shears** are good for much more than breaking down a chicken into pieces. You can also use the **shears** to debone chicken thighs, section wings, and trim fat off for deep frying. Poultry **shears** are an all-around useful kitchen tool – one of the few essentials that Sous Vide Guy recommends every chef has on hand. They can also serve a bit of double duty for processing herbs and some vegetables as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For thorough and safe cleaning, the detaching mode allows you to safely separate the blades with ease. The large-sized, non-slip grips offer more room for your fingers to rest when holding, making them easy to use. These **poultry** **shears** are also ideal for cutting fish and have a bottle opener built into the handle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Additionally, its professional and stylish design will surely meet your needs. Indeed, the entire structure is sturdy and durable because of the top-grade stainless steel material. As a result, you no longer deal with rust or corrosion problems like other regular **poultry** **shears**. Plus, the handles also provide you with pleasant and non-slippery control. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The upper blade of these **shears**, we noticed, is uniquely designed with micro-serration that tends to almost minutely curve inwards. What these finely-honed edges do is latch firmly onto whatever it is that you are trying to cut: meat, vegetables, etc., pulling the flesh apart along with cutting the substance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The spring-loaded full-tang handle gives you better control and a firm grip, and the ergonomic design is ideal for left or right-handed users. The thick heavy-duty 4mm high-grade stainless steel runs all the way through the **shears** from top to bottom, meaning the blades and handle are designed to last longer even for heavy duty cutting. And they are made to never come apart when cutting, no matter how wide you open the blade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A good pair of kitchen **shears** is essential. We’d argue that it’s just as important as a trusty chef’s knife. Yes, really. Kitchen **shears** are more than just a pair of scissors that lives in the kitchen; they're super sharp, powerful, and most certainly not for slicing open cardboard boxes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The OXO Good Grips Spring-Loaded Shears are a great kitchen tool for those who want an easier time in the kitchen, or those who struggle with grip strength. The key feature of these **poultry** **shears** is the addition of a spring-loaded mechanism in the handle. This is great for those who have arthritis or joint inflammation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One warning, however. The blades themselves are quite short, meaning that if you’re looking for a dedicated set of **poultry** **shears** you may have better luck elsewhere. You’ll also want to make sure that the blades don’t become misaligned when doing any sort of heavy cutting such as through bone or the like. Keep in mind that missing the joint can lead to a blade offset that must be corrected before trying to cut through skin, work on raw meat, or remove silver skin. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How can I use **poultry** **shears** for other purposes aside from cutting **poultry**? You can make the most of it by cutting other cooking materials such as lobster, cracking nuts, and other seafood. However, the performance will depend on the quality of the blades. How do you cut a chicken with **poultry** **shears**? You can watch this youtube video for reference. Can I use regular kitchen scissors to cut chicken? Yes, you can, and yet you only cut the soft meat. It’s better for your **poultry** **shears** with the most rigid meat or hard bones for better results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The micro-serrated blade edge of the **shears** cuts clean through meat and tough tissues. Even trimming or chopping herbs is not an issue with it at all. This also makes for safe, anti-slippage performance and use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use: You many only use your **poultry** **shears** to cut through chicken, animal bones, fish and other fibrous food, and that’s okay. If that will be the sole use, then look for a pair that is strong with a good spring action and a lock. Also, some **poultry** **shears** cut through raw food, while others are better for cooked chicken, turkey or meat. Plus, there are some models that do not cut through raw skin, so be on the lookout for this if you intend to use your **shears** to cut up a raw chicken with the skin still on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A great benefit to these **shears** is that the blades can be taken apart for cleaning. Hand-washing the tool with warm water and soap is recommended. However, do dry them promptly after that. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **poultry** **shears** from William Sonoma may look simple, but they can cut through meat and bone with no fuss. This is because they’re designed with a spring that’ll allow you to press down on any surface with ease. And they’re also compact, taking up little space in your cabinet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These all-steel **poultry** **shears** are stylish, versatile and super sharp. The ergonomic handle is suitable for left- and right-handed people and is slip-proof thanks to a “grasp and hold” design. But what really sets this pair of **shears** apart is the ingenious two-in-one blade design that allows you to complete two of the most essential tasks relating to **poultry**: snip and trim through skin and cleave through bone. They're also extremely hygienic as there is no chance of bacteria sticking to the stainless steel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Want one tool in your kitchen that can do it all? Here we looked at the extra features the **shears** had on them besides cutting. Points we awarded for each unique feature per pair, and the Gerior Heavy Duty Come-Apart easily has the most. This pair comes with a bottle opener, peeler on the blade, fish descaler, flathead screwdriver, and nutcracker/jar opener, by far the most attachments out of our test fleet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The high-quality blade is the first vital element contributing to the peak performance of the **poultry** **shears**. A robust and razor-sharp blade will cut the **poultry** smoother and effortlessly. Indeed, you should choose the gadget with premium stainless steel for peak quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cleaning and sharpening: Poultry **shears** come in contact with the juices of raw meat, fish and **poultry** and need to be thoroughly cleaned to avoid cross contamination. Look for **shears** where the blades are easy to separate so they can be properly cleaned, or open wide enough for you to be able to clean in between all the nooks and crannies. Being able to open the blades wide also makes them easier to sharpen. Some **poultry** **shears** can only be washed by hand, while others are safe to put in the dishwasher. Consider what is more convenient for you before choosing a model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Poultry **shears** are scissors which are designed specifically to be able to cut through bone, chicken skin, and other tough materials. In addition to being used on **poultry**, of course, **poultry** **shears** can be utilized as general kitchen **shears**, and they are suited to a wide variety of heavy duty kitchen tasks. While not an essential kitchen tool, they are extremely useful to have around, especially if you plan on hacking apart any whole chickens in your kitchen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Mairico Ultra Sharp Premium **shears** come equipped with a bottle opener and fish scaler. The bottle opener works better than others with this attachment. They are dishwasher safe making them easy to clean after each use. They also have one of the lower prices on the list, making them a good option if the cost is a deciding factor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s not that kitchen scissors can necessarily do things your chef’s knife and paring knife cannot. But the best kitchen **shears** will make certain tasks like snipping herbs, breaking down a whole chicken, or cracking lobster shells a lot easier. Although **shears** are often referred to as an “optional” kitchen tool, the home cooks who get it, get it. And lucky for you, a quality pair of kitchen **shears** is generally much cheaper than a fancy knife. See below for our favorite pairs and ways to use them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you can’t find the Kai **shears**, we recommend the super-sized Wiss 10” Titanium-Coated Shop Shears as our runner-up pick, which has heftier handles for big hands. They don’t cut wrapping paper as fluidly as the Kai **shears**, and they don’t come in a true left-handed mode. However, the long blades slice through clamshell packs as easily as Excalibur, and the full-tang construction will last for years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are looking for the entire stainless steel **shears**, don’t forget the kitchen utensil from Silver Armadillo. Seeing that the entire construction is made from premium stainless steel, you no longer face a broken situation. Hence, these **shears** can adapt well to long-term usage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The KitchenAid **shears** cut smoothly enough to not leave a mess behind. It is made of high-grade stainless steel that is resistant to rusting. The micro-serrations on this blade offers savage, heavy-duty cuts, that make it an ideal pair for cutting up meat, vegetables and other food. The serrations also contribute immensely to the overall durability and built-quality of the product. It also enhances the performance of the **shears**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Furthermore, the handles are made from entire stainless steel for heavy-duty and ultra-strong grip. In addition to that, the spring-loaded handles will facilitate your slicing power with minimal effort. As a result, all kinds of meat or **poultry** bones can be cut precisely and easily thanks to the ergonom-ic handles’ unwavering strength. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So the first thing that we noticed are the “cushion pads” that are there on the insides of the handles of these **shears**. This is definitely something which you don’t come across more often. These cushions make it extremely comfortable for you to use these **shears**. These absorb excess pressure, especially when you have to cut harder stuff by exerting greater force and hence, keeps discomfort at bay. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Straightforward and practical, these **poultry** **shears** feature a tough-as-nails 3.5-inch serrated steel blade and a specially designed handle that will see you break down any bird with ease. The **shears** are spring-loaded so you get maximum slicing force with minimal effort. The locking mechanism is easy to engage and disengage (and doesn't get in the way), so you can go to town on that chicken safely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moreover, the blades are designed in separate parts, which will simplify your cleaning and care. In addition, you can snip through the large **poultry** easier thanks to that feature. Plus, the ergonomic rubberized handle with loop and bolster also optimizes your holding with a pleasant experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Due to this feature, it comes with heavy-duty and reliable construction. In detail, the blade is creat-ed in 4mm thick, sharp, and top-notch stainless steel for cutting the thorough **poultry** bones with ease. Moreover, the **shears** are preferred due to rust-resistant and stable features. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The three-mode lock design gives these heavy-duty **shears** the ability to perform under different situations. For example, on locking mode, your safety is maximized because the **shears** are prevented from opening accidentally. While doing heavy-duty cutting jobs, the spring-loaded mode relieves the pressure from your hand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What we have first up on our list of best kitchen **shears** right now is indeed hailed as one of the most brilliant in the field: the Shun Kitchen Shears. These professional-grade **shears** come with 4” blades and are 9” long, overall. These are made with VG-10 super steel which makes them ultra-sharp for cutting through bone and cartilage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The cuts made by these **shears** are clean enough. These can cut most things, including **poultry**, fish, tough tissues, and vegetables. However, it’s best not to use it for cutting up bones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **shears** are easy to clean and maintain. We are relieved that they are dishwasher safe. However, the brand recommends the **shears** to be hand-washed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Poultry **shears** have classically been used for tasks like cutting a chicken in half down the breastbone, although a cleaver can also be used for this purpose. They can also be used on an assortment of tough foods to cut rapidly and with a great deal of control. You may note that specific recipes call for **poultry** **shears** in particular for things like trimming and cutting meat. Ideally, the **shears** should not be used for non-kitchen tasks like cutting carpeting, although most **shears** are perfectly capable of being used in this capacity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In terms of balance, Sous Vide Guy found that Henckel’s **poultry** **shears** work great for both left and right-handed butchers. They have a good amount of leverage and excel at cutting through joints. One note on that point: if you’re having trouble opening the **shears** after cutting then you’ll need to loosen a small screw that serves as a latch for the blades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After conducting 30 hours of research on 75 models of scissors and kitchen **shears**, consulting with experts (including a maker expert at San Francisco’s Exploratorium), and cutting paper, cardboard, marshmallows, string, duct tape, wire, cable ties, and chicken bones, we think the best scissors for all-around household use are the Kai 5210 8-inch Dressmaking Shears (also available for lefties ). They just work. Light and sharp, with the smoothest-feeling action of any scissors we tested, these stainless steel and vanadium blades will swiftly and precisely cut paper, plastic clamshell packaging, cardboard, blue jeans, and even picture-hanging wire in a pinch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The KitchenAid **shears** are well-known for their smooth performance. These are some of the fastest-selling kitchen **shears**, owing to their comparatively affordable price tag than the rest of its high-end contemporaries. It is indeed highly efficient in what it does, and it is highly recommended by many kitchen enthusiasts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   They are easy to operate and the spring-loaded handle prevents hand strain. After being used on food, you must clean the blades of the **shears** well to avoid cross-contamination. However, they must be washed well by hand and dried completely to maintain the sharpness of the blades. Do not put the **poultry** **shears** into the dishwasher. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   LIVINGO’s kitchen **shears** are an exceptional, multi-purpose addition to any kitchen. One of the best things about these LIVINGO **shears** is that they are made of press-forged, surgical quality stainless steel. This means that you’ll be working with a solid piece of metal from handle to blade tip. This is great for those who like extra weight to their kitchen implements, or for those who want a workhorse. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   OXO is one brand that has made a name for itself over the last few years with its innovative kitchen gadgets range. It has been recognized as a manufacturer and supplier of quality culinary appliances that are incredibly easy and fun to use. The Good Grips kitchen **shears** from the brand stand as an example of the brilliantly devised kitchen tools that you’d reach out for time and again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Concerning the handles, it features non-slippery and soft grips for smooth and easy control while preparing food. The handles are especially spring-loaded, which contributes to preventing hand strain. Therefore, you do not need to put more effort into cutting **poultry** or other tough foods. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   It’s evident that the best **poultry** **shears** are essential kitchen assistance to cut cooking ingredients, especially **poultry**, with ease. Therefore, there are various sorts of **poultry** **shears** for you to choose from. However, one drawback is that picking the best one among various models might not be easy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We found it to be a pretty functional pair of **shears** overall, with nothing strikingly different from all those that we had reviewed before it. It is made of high quality, anti-corrosive stainless steel. The micro-serrated edge of the blades makes for clean cuts on meat, **poultry**, fish and leafy vegetables. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Similar to knives, the best way to sharpen kitchen **shears** is with a whetstone, or sharpening stone. Here’s how it’s done: First, take the blades apart, if possible. This will ensure you’re able to sharpen the entire length of each blade. If your **shears** don’t come apart, this same technique applies, but it’ll be a little more difficult to get a sharp edge on the part of the blades nearest to the handle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Kitchen **shears** can cut through meat and bone, which is useful when you’re spatchcocking a turkey or cutting a chicken breast into cubes. (Pro tip: When snipping up raw chicken, no need to dirty a cutting board—simply open the package of chicken and snip pieces directly into a bowl.) Kitchen **shears** are also fantastic for clipping herbs right onto a plate of food, cutting perfect parchment circles for cake and pie pans, and so much more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Budget: Poultry **shears** come in a wide range of prices, so there is something for everyone. That being said, lower-priced items are not generally the same quality as pricier models. The kind of material used to make the **shears** will affect the price, as does the durability of the product.

If you will use them often, it would be wise to invest in ones that will last a long time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   When seeking out **poultry** **shears**, it pays to spend a little more. Cheap ones will ultimately fail, possibly at a very awkward moment, and you may find them frustrating and irritating to use.

-   Care for **poultry** **shears** like you would care for any other blade. When not in use, keep them wrapped or in a knife rack to protect the blades and to prevent injuries. After use, hand wash the **shears** with very hot water and soap; a few drops of bleach may be used periodically to keep bacteria off the **shears**.

This is also possible with a cleaver, but requires much more blade skill to accomplish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Want a pair of high-end professional-grade **shears** that’ll last forever? The Yoshihiro All Stainless Steel Shears are your answer.

To keep them in tip-top shape, detach the blades for thorough cleaning shortly after using them (especially when working with acidic ingredients). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
