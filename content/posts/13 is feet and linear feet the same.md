## 13 Reference List: Is Feet And Linear Feet The Same | is feet and linear feet the same
-   By basic definition, **linear** **feet** are measured in units of **feet**. However, the individual pieces may be measured in inches or a combination of **feet** and inches. It is helpful to first convert all the measurements to inches and then add them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Understanding the concept behind measuring and using **linear** **feet** is significant when people plan to move to someplace or execute a home improvement project. Linear footage is not a measurement that is to be dealt with regularly, but the insight on how to calculate it is essential. A **linear** foot is one foot or 12-inch size of length where width and height are not considered. Linear **feet** are also known as **linear** footage or length in **feet**. Linear measurements give an approximate idea of the project’s scope and, together with other parameters, provide an overall price estimate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Square **feet** and **linear** **feet** are two terms of measurement you'll hear when shopping for floor coverings and other construction materials. It's important to understand the difference between them when comparing prices since lumber is typically sold by the **linear** foot while carpet and plywood are sold by the square foot. It's also helpful to know how to convert between the two using paper and pencil or an online calculator. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To calculate **linear** **feet** in excel, let’s take an example of a bookshelf project. The owner wants to calculate the different sizes of boards that are to be used into separate categories. Then, the amount of material in each category will be calculated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Calculate the total length of each board separately. Add the lengths of the boards of each size. Keep them exclusively apart and find a separate total for each category. To calculate the total **linear** **feet** for each board, put the following formula in cell G5: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you know the area of a room in square **feet** and one of the room's dimensions in **feet**, you can find the other dimension by dividing the area by the known dimension. Say that you know a room has 80 square **feet** with a length of 8 square **feet**. You divide 80 by 8 for the result of 10, which is the measurement of the room's width in **linear** **feet**. To calculate the perimeter, you add two length measurements and two widths. For an 8 by 10 foot room, the perimeter is (8 x 2) + (10 x 2) or 36 **linear** **feet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since floorboard widths measured in inches, a conversion of the room's square **feet** to inches is also needed. This is done by multiplying the total square footage by 12. So for a room of 100 square **feet** where a 5-inch wide floorboard is being used, the number of **linear** **feet** needed would be (100 x 12) / 5 or 240 **linear** **feet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Calculating **linear** footage can help the general public determine how to price their move from one place to another. The public will only have to pay for the space they use in moving trailers measured in **linear** **feet**. It also helps them to determine the rates for upholstery or flooring as companies provide certain quotes for **linear** **feet** of the spaces in their homes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many lumber and flooring online retailers include calculators that do the math to determine the number of **linear** **feet** of flooring needed for a room. To use a **linear** foot calculator for wood flooring, you typically type in the final width in inches of floorboard and the square footage of the room. The calculator will provide the number of **linear** **feet** needed. When measuring the width of floorboards, use the width of the exposed surface of the board, also known as face width. Do not include edges that are hidden when the floorboards are installed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Out of numerous steps while planning a renovation or construction, an important step is to determine the quantities of different materials needed. For many projects, the **linear** **feet** of the materials are calculated. Many common construction materials like steel, for instance, are measured in **feet** and sold by the foot. For some projects, you will need to be able to convert square footage into **linear** **feet** of building material. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you know the square footage of a room, you may want to find out the number of **linear** **feet** along the outside edges, or perimeter. To do this you will need to know either the length or the width of the room since different combinations of length and width can result in the same area. A room that is 12 by 10 **feet** has 120 square **feet**, as does a room that is 8 by 15 **feet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **linear** foot is a measure of distance, such as the length or width of a room. It consists of 12 inches, just like a regular foot of measurement. The addition of the term **linear** simply indicates that the measurement in one direction along a line. A **linear** foot is a one-dimensional measurement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Linear footage is calculated by measuring the lengths of a space or objects in **feet** using a tape measure and adding them together. Width, height, and thickness measurements are not included. Convert the units using suitable converters if needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
