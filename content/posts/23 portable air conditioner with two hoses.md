## 23 Reference List: Portable Air Conditioner With Two Hoses | Are there any advantages to a one-hose (portable) air-conditioner?
-   Dual hose **portable** air conditioners follow the same principle, but incorporate the outside unit into a single inside unit; instead using ducting **hoses** to draw outside air over the condenser coils and back to the outside again. They are more convenient as no permanent installation is required. They a tiny bit less efficient due to heat loss through the **hoses** and the additional heat generated from the compressor, which is now inside the room that needs to be cooled. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In both single and dual hose systems, the duct removing the warmed air from the **portable** AC unit also generates heat. It is transferring hot air, after all. This heat is radiated back into the room. This further contributes to the inefficiency of the **portable** ac unit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hi, i wanted to buy a **portable** air conditioner (wall mounted isn't an option for me) but I've read that the ones with dual **hoses** are way more efficient. The problem is that they are also more rare to find for a strict budget. I was wondering if it was possible to build a hose myself around the intake, assuming it was clearly visible on the back. Am i missing something or is as simple as that? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It all depends on the space you’re cooling and many other factors. In certain scenarios single hose is just perfect and chills the room just nicely, in other cases dual hose is unbeaten. The slightly higher unit price of dual hose systems is quite justified given the benefits described. Whatever questions you may have, consult our professionals at Chills Air Conditioning to find the best single or best dual hose **portable** air conditioner for you! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Portable air conditioners aren’t as mobile as their name suggests, and they’re also one of the loudest and least efficient ways to cool a room. But if you don’t have central air, and a window AC isn’t an option, a **portable** AC is the next best way to beat the heat—and if that’s the case for you, we recommend the Midea Duo MAP12S1TBL . It’s quieter, more powerful, and generally more pleasant to live with than nearly any of the other two dozen **portable** ACs we’ve tested (and the hundreds more we’ve researched) since 2016. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Keep the intake and exhaust **hoses** away from each other when outside of the window. Having them close to each other increases the change that the intake hose is drawing in freshly exhausted hot air. If stacking vertically, I like to keep the intake hose below the exhaust hose for this reason too, as hot air rises slightly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Frigidaire Gallery Cool Connect GHPC132AB1 impressed us not only with its ability to maintain a steady chill throughout the room within one-half of a degree but also with its surprisingly low-volume performance. Although it doesn’t have the same power or efficiency as an inverter model like the Midea or the LG, the single-hose Frigidaire somehow inexplicably managed to run at an even lower volume in our tests, beating both of those **portable** ACs by about 2 decibels. However, its window-installation kit wasn’t quite as robust, and while it offered all the same smart-home capabilities, we encountered some frustrations with the way they worked. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our eco-friendly **portable** air conditioner is sure to delight and provide you with the perfect amount of comfort. Reach out to us with any questions or check out our FAQ page for more information. Feel confident that you are getting the best air conditioner out there while also making a difference for the planet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The popular, affordable Black+Decker BPACT14WT delivers where it counts—in cooling performance—better than anything else in its price range. But it’s a little rough around the edges compared with our other picks: Its operation is louder, its controls are clunkier, and it lacks the nice details we like about some other models. But even so, it gets the job done, and it’s a fine choice if you need a **portable** AC at something closer to a window-AC price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Known as condensate, the water that was condensed out of the air may be disposed of in any number of ways. You can remove the pan and dump it. Or the air conditioner itself may sling the moisture against the hot part of the coil where it will be converted back to vapor and expelled in the exhaust. In the rare instances where the **portable** air conditioner is located near a floor drain, the condensate can be simply run through a tube to the drain. In other cases, the tube leading from the air conditioner’s drain pan can lead to a that will pump the liquid water to the outside or to a drain elsewhere in the building. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whynter is going GREEN! With this new eco-friendly 14,000 BTU **portable** air conditioner, you can stay cool while keeping with better environmental standards and reducing energy consumption. This Whynter ARC-14S **portable** air conditioner features eco-friendly, CFC-free R-32 refrigerant and lead-free RoHS compliant components. Our CFC-free, lead-free **portable** AC unit with 14,000 BTU has high energy efficiency. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Single hose models are the only type that violate this principle, which is why they are so inefficient. Instead of using two **hoses** to keep the air masses separate and drawing outside air to pass over the condenser coils, they ditch the intake hose and just draw the inside air instead — destroying the working principles of air conditioning. Why? Probably because it’s easier to market and sell the convenience of one hose rather than two… They chose to leave out the fine print that mentions going from two to one house makes a perfectly good machine next to useless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ZoneAire **portable**s units have a control panel on the top of the unit. The set-point temperature will be displayed both on top of the unit by the controls and on the unit’s front display panel. If there is an interruption in power, the unit will auto restart when power is restored. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To solve the pressure drop problem, manufacturers invented the dual-hose design, which uses warm outdoor air to reduce the temperature of the condenser. The appliance does not eject indoor air, thus the air pressure inside the dwelling remains more consistent. That's not a perfect solution, however, since now you have two lare, warm **hoses** in the living space that you are trying to cool. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both single and dual hose **portable** cooling units have to draw air in from one source (**portable** AC hose) and inject it into the room from another (the main cooling unit). If you decide on installing one unit in any given space, the exhaust has to be led outside. This is mainly because air-conditioning devices generate more heat than the cooling air when operating. Another hose is typically used to insert the air into the unit, enabling AC to run. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Infiltration air heat transfer is a major inefficiency of a **portable** AC system. Its effect is much more pronounced when outdoor air temperature is higher . Under old standards and guidelines single hose **portable** AC units could be tested at any outdoor temperature. It stands to reason that manufacturers would choose to conduct this testing at lower outdoor temperatures to boost the measured cooling capacity of tested units. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We place each **portable** air conditioner inside of the same room made up of tall windows that take in a strong amount of sun. We then set the temperature on each air conditioner to 68 degrees and the fan speed to maximum, aiming the appliance at a target 8 feet away. Then we measure the temperature at four locations on the target using an infrared thermometer and thermocouples. We also check the appliance’s outlet temperature (it should be consistent and a lot hotter than what the air conditioner is putting into the room). We run the appliances on a hard surface that amplifies rattles and squeaks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the Midea Duo isn’t available, the single-hose LG LP1419IVSM is another great option for a **portable** AC with an efficient inverter-powered compressor. It has a similar setup overall, with a built-in hose and a top-mounted fan that makes the AC sound as if it’s breathing in and out with steady wafts of white noise and cool air, plus all the same smart-home features. It’s slightly more expensive than the Midea, and some readers have complained about the timbre of its sound (though we never had any problems with that ourselves), but overall it’s still one of the best **portable** air conditioners you can find. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This type of **portable** AC is very common. They tend to be cheaper than dual hose options and are easier to install because they have fewer ducts. But, how they work leads to one major drawback. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Single hose **portable** air conditioner is the more basic of the two designs. A compressor is used to charge the cooling system, removing hot temperature from the space in which it operates. With single-hose units, the air is drawn in from the room. Warm air and humidity are expelled outside, which is why you need to think of the window or wall that can serve this purpose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The problem for UK residents is that single hose ACs are the only type of **portable** model available to buy. Dual hose models, window units or **portable** split units are not available, despite their vastly superior performance and efficiency. But what makes single hose ACs so bad? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This powerful unit is rated for rooms up to 400 sq ft and has a SACC rating of 10,000 BTUs. It is a touch more expensive than our single hose model top choice, but it has many advantages over other dual hose models. Most notably, both **hoses** are contained in a single tube, making installation a breeze. This design also reduces air gaps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This unit features the patented advance in auto drain technology, which uses and recycles moisture collected during the cooling process to produce cool air. The dual hose operation provides fast cooling. Our dual hose **portable** air conditioner can cool up to a 500 sq. ft. space, though ambient temperature and humidity may influence optimum performance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
