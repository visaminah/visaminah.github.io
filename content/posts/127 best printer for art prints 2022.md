-   Office **printer**s are an essential piece of equipment for any professional or business. From all-in-one units to single-function, color and monochrome, there's a **printer** to suit just about any kind of job. Laser **printer**s are great for mid to high volume offices since they have high-capacity input trays, long-lasting toner cartridges, and fast printing times. Inkjet models are more suited to low-volume or home offices since they are slower and have smaller capacities. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To ensure that what you see on your monitor is accurate, you'll need to calibrate it. This will ensure that the colours you see on screen are the same as the colours that will be printed. Most art **printer**s come with a calibration tool, or you can use a third-party calibration tool. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   9.

-   If you need to go large, but do so on a budget, the Expression Photo HD XP-15000 is an entry-level 13-inch or A3+ **printer** from the reliable Epson brand. This large format **printer** is worth a look if you are a photo enthusiast looking for something that’s more a back bedroom than a pro studio. It’s compact for its class, with the manufacturer claiming the XP-15000 is 30 percent smaller than its predecessor. OK, so for the price we have to make do with six inks rather than 10 or 11, but there’s a large LCD screen to adjust settings on and a suite of mobile printing apps that enable you to take advantage of the **printer**'s wireless capabilities. While the front-loading tray actually handles A4 or US Letter paper, it’s the rear paper feed that has us excited, being suitable for A3+ **prints**, including those on thicker media. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   8. Canon Pixma G4510 photo **printer** Compact **printer** with a cost-effective refillable ink system Specifications Category: 4-in-1 **printer** Print speed: 13ppm Paper capacity: 100 sheets Paper size: up to A3 Weight: 10.5kg Today's Best Deals Check Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Neat design + Low ink cost Reasons to avoid - No duplex mode - No front USB port - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Of course, buying a **printer** isn’t a one-off investment, as you'll need to regularly buy good quality inks and paper too. Consider the type of ink a **printer** uses when making your purchase decision, as this will directly influence the running costs going forward. It'd be disappointing to find a bargain on the **printer** only to find out that it costs you a fortune to actually make any **prints**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Epson EcoTank Pro is an all-in-one ink tank **printer**. This means it uses refillable compartments rather than cartridges to hold ink; these are designed to reduce waste and ink shortages in the middle of big print projects. The unit can print up to 25 pages per minute, and automatic duplex printing means you'll reduce paper waste as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Three paper paths, including a front-loading one for fine art paper, make it easy to switch between different formats – there's even a roll paper option for panoramic **prints**. The core of this inkjet model includes a nine-ink set, there’s onboard Wi-Fi for printing from smartphones or cameras directly, a 4.3-inch touch panel screen for making selections, and an 80ml cartridge size described as generous by its maker. A relatively compact footprint, coupled with the flexibility this machine provides, ensures it should be near the top of your wish list, especially for anyone wanting delivery of deep, contrasty blacks and rich tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We've divided this guide into two sections. First, we run through regular letter-size (A4) **printer**s, and then we look at larger wide-format (13-inch) **printer**s. As you might expect, the smaller **printer**s tend to be more affordable, while large-format **printer**s will produce **prints** of higher quality - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   7. Canon PIXMA iP8720 / iP8750 The best budget wide format **printer** for photo enthusiasts… and beyond! Specifications Type: Inkjet Maximum paper width: 13 inches Print size: A3+ Ink type: Canon ChromaLife 100+ Number of inks: 6 Max resolution: 9600 x 2400 dpi Droplet size: Not given Print speed: Not given Unit size: 590 x 331 x 159mm Weight: 8.5kg Today's Best Deals View at Best Buy (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Newegg (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Low price for 13-inch (A3+) **prints** + Decent print resolution Reasons to avoid - ‘Just’ 6 inks - Build quality a little plastic-y - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Brother MFC-L2750DW XL multifunction laser **printer** is packed with features such as a fast automatic document feeder, fax capability, and a second paper tray. It’s also fast at both duplex printing and copying, but doesn’t sacrifice speed for quality; documents look sharp and clear every time. It's easily one of the best home **printer**s overall, and our favorite laser **printer** – so long as you don't need to print in color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are serious about printing your photographs or your fine art **prints** yourself, or if you just want to print professional-looking images of your work for your portfolio, it’s a good idea to invest in an inkjet **printer** that uses pigment inks. Formulated with solid pigment powder rather than with dye, these inks are more vibrant, more stable, and more archival (albeit also more expensive). Pigment inks must be used with pigment **printer**s, which tend to be much larger and, aptly, pricier than the run-of-the-mill dye-ink machines usually found in home offices. Still, they can be smart investments for artists who often display or sell their works. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like Canon’s L-series camera lenses, the PRO-1000 **printer** has a ‘red line’ denoting top-grade quality, this time based on no less than 12 pigment-based Lucia Pro ink cartridges. By comparison, the smaller PRO-300 runs on 10 inks, both models include a chroma optimizer in the line-up, which helps to apply a smooth top coating when printing on glossy photo paper, to minimize bronzing and gloss differential. Even so, the **printer** achieves its highest quality with matte and fine art media, on which color and mono output are magnificent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   During testing we also make sure to try out the various available quality modes, including optional image enhancement features. We create **prints** from our own specially created test chart to test the **printer**'s accuracy in terms of color reproduction, tonal range, retention of detail in bright highlights and dark shadows, and the ability to deliver smooth gradations in subtle color variations. The **printer** manufacturer’s own-brand inks and papers are used throughout the entire testing procedure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This series replaced Epson’s popular Stylus Pro family – the flagship SureColor P20000 specifically replacing the Stylus Pro 11880. This wide format **printer** is designed for mini labs and photo studios needing something that can handle plenty of output. At 64 inches wide there’s versatility built in too: as well as printing photographs up to exhibition quality utilizing its 10 pigment inks (nine of their color), its size means this **printer** can also produce signage and banners. A PrecisionCore MicroTFP print head offers **prints** to a maximum 2400 x 1200dpi resolution, whilst its print head structure claims to result in fewer vibrations along with more accurate ink drops and ink placement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Canon imagePROGRAF PRO-1000 A heavy duty **printer** pitched at both the photography and graphics markets Specifications Type: Inkjet Maximum paper width: 17 inches Print size: A2 Ink type: Canon Lucia Pro inks Number of inks: 12 Max resolution: 2400 x 1200 dpi Droplet size: 4 pl Print speed: A2 **prints** in 6 minutes Unit size: 723 x 435 x 285mm Weight: 32.3kg Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Walmart (opens in new tab) View at Dell (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + 12 inks for superior color accuracy + Sumptuous print quality for both color and mono photos + Inks can be replaced individually Reasons to avoid - Larger than average unit size - No optional roll-feeder attachment - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Canon imagePROGRAF PRO-1000 is a fast **printer**. It can print a 17 x 22 inch print in about 2 minutes. This is much faster than most other **printer**s on the market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The last thing that any fine artist wants is to compromise quality for budget. Luckily, with the PIXMA Pro-100 you do not have to compromise any more. It’s affordable and gives exceptional color **prints**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s a lot to love about this new Epson **printer**, although it’s incredibly similar to the previous XP-960 model. It works very well as a standalone **printer** and photocopier, with intuitive touchscreen controls. Going large to wide format printing makes your photos look much more imposing, and the print quality itself is very good, though this **printer** doesn't print quite as large as its 13-inch rivals. For glossy color and black & white photo output, the XP-970 also loses out to the more specialist Canon PIXMA Pro-100S **printer**. The Epson is smaller, lighter, and less expensive to buy, but has dearer ink costs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   5. Canon ImageClass MF743Cdw Best small business laser **printer** Specifications Printer Type: Laser Features: Print, copy, scan, fax Display: 5-inch color touch-screen Ink/Toner: Four cartridges (black, cyan, magenta, yellow) Connectivity: 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi, Ethernet, USB 2.0 Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Dell (opens in new tab) View at Newegg (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Large, 5-inch color touch screen + Fast performance for **prints**, copies and scans + High-capacity toner cartridges deliver low cost per page Reasons to avoid - Large size - Duplex printing is somewhat slow - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A photo **printer** is a huge investment especially for artists. As such, you need to balance between quality and price. Although most pro-level **printer**s are on the higher end when it comes to price, it all narrows down to you and the quality level you want to achieve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Canon imagePROGRAF PRO-300 is another solid 13-inch **printer**, but where it really shines is in printing black-and-white photos. The PRO-300’s 10-color Lucia Pro pigment ink set includes both photo and matte black inks, producing deeper and more intense blacks that look fantastic on fine art photo paper. And because the Canon PRO-300 has separate nozzles for the two types of black ink, it doesn’t need to switch tanks while printing (a common annoyance), reducing ink waste and saving time. The PRO-300 also has a dedicated Chroma Optimizer channel that layers on a clear coating for a smoother finish, enhancing glossiness and reducing bronzing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Epson Expression Photo XP-8700 is a versatile, all-in-one **printer** that can handle your printing, scanning, and copying needs. It features a built-in scanner and copier, and a 4.3" color touchscreen for easy operation. This **printer** also supports wireless printing from your mobile device, so you can print from anywhere in your home or office. Plus, with its high-capacity ink cartridges, you'll be able to print more pages before having to replace them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are using double-sided tape, place a strip of tape on the back of the artwork and then press it firmly onto the other piece of paper. You can also use Elmer's Glue-All or another type of adhesive to glue art on **printer** paper to the back of another piece of paper. Just be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully so that you do not damage the artwork. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Epson EcoTank Pro ET-5850 combines impressively low ink costs with an abundance of business-friendly features to take its place as the best small business inkjet **printer** we've reviewed. The EcoTank design uses refillable ink tanks and comes with enough spare ink bottles to print thousands of pages. A small business **printer** rated to print more than 3,000 pages per month, it's more than capable of handling whatever your team might throw at it. The **printer** boasts scan, copy and fax capability, dual 250-page paper cassettes, a 50-sheet automatic document feeder and a large, easy-to-use 4.3-inch touchscreen for convenient operations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Epson Expression Photo XP-8700 is a great all-in-one **printer** for users who need high quality **prints** and want the convenience of wireless printing. It's also a good option for those who have limited space, as it doesn't take up much room on a desk or countertop. However, the **printer** is quite expensive and it doesn't have some features that are found on other all-in-one **printer**s, such as an automatic document feeder or duplex printing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Brother HL-L2390DW is a monochrome all-in-one **printer** that offers one thing rarely seen in a laser **printer**: a low price of entry. And while the cost may catch the eye of home and small-office users, its performance and feature set are nothing to scoff at, either. Prints are sharp and faster than average; this **printer** handles scans and copies quickly, as well. And while the **printer** is monochrome, the full-color scanner delivers true-to-life color capture and fast scanning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Can’t decide whether you need a sheet or roll **printer**? The new Epson SureColor SC-P900 (opens in new tab) provides a choice of both – although you do have to pay extra to get the roller unit. Epson’s flexible flagship A2 **printer** is capable of printing up to 17 inches in width. This is an update of the older Epson SureColor P800, offering a significant improvement in image quality, with deeper blacks, thanks to the addition of an additional, tenth, ink. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our **printer** reviews cover more than just the standard print/scan/copy combination units that are so popular on store shelves. We test every **printer** on the basics, like print quality and speed, but we also take the long view, weighing factors like the cost of printing or the volume the **printer** is built to handle from month to month. In addition to all-in-one inkjets, we’ve also reviewed laser **printer**s, photo **printer**s and even portable models, all with the aim of finding the best **printer** for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Canon PIXMA Pro-100S is a sizable and solid desktop design that uses metal components in its print engine to guarantee accurate high-resolution results on large sheets of paper. It **prints** quite quickly on anything from individual 6x4” photo paper to borderless A3+ posters. The only difference between this model and the outgoing Canon PIXMA Pro-100 is its compatibility with Canon’s PIXMA Cloud Link service. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   8. Epson EcoTank ET-8550 A large-format **printer** that does a bit of everything Specifications Max Print Size: 13x19 inch Print resolution: 5700 x 1440 dpi Print speed (13x19 inch; std quality): 2m Interfaces: Hi-speed USB, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, SD/HC/XC Scanner: Yes Dimensions: 523 ‎x 379 x 169 mm Weight: 11.1kg Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Dell (opens in new tab) View at Newegg (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Versatile large-format printing + Bottle-based ink Reasons to avoid - Significant price tag - Can be slow - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are an artist or art enthusiast, then you know that the quality of your **prints** is important. Not all **printer**s are created equal when it comes to printing artwork. In this blog post, we will discuss the best **printer**s for art **prints** and provide reviews and a buying guide. We will also answer some common questions about printing art **prints**. Let's get started! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's also a great home **printer**, with faster-than-average print speeds and high print quality overall. Text and color graphics all look great, but we noted that glossy photos printed impressively fast, and the use of a 5-ink cartridge system with two types of black ink resulted in photos with high-quality accuracy: Natural-looking colors, sharp details and smooth transitions. Really, our only big complaint with the Pixma TR8620 is the above average cost of ink, due partially to the expense of the extra ink cartridge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   6. Epson EcoTank ET-8550 A large format **printer** with low running costs Specifications Type: Inkjet Maximum paper width: 13 inches Print size: A3+ Ink type: Epson Claria ET Premium Ink Number of inks: 6 Max resolution: 5700x1440dpi Droplet size: Not given Print speedUp to 209 sq ft per hour for photos: 25 Seconds per 10x15cm photo Unit size: 523‎ x 379 x 169mm Weight: 11.1kg Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Dell (opens in new tab) View at Walmart (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Cartridge-free tanks (70ml bottles) + Cheap volume printing + 10.9-inch color touchscreen Reasons to avoid - Relatively limited color space - Bit slow in high quality photo mode - Big up-front purchase cost - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Pixma TR150 made high-quality photos faster than other competing portable **printer**s, and delivered excellent color and detail. It can also handle larger photo **prints**, but unlike some of our photo printing favorites, there is no copy or scan capability. You do get a solidly built portable **printer** with optional battery and even support for Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice controls, but we love it for the great photos and low ink costs it offers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are even models available with on-board memory so you can queue several jobs at once or delay printing until a specific date. Creative professionals also have a slew of choices for creating excellent quality **prints**; ink tank models allow for bigger print jobs, and some can be set up with rolls of media for printing posters and other large format **prints**. We've rounded up our top picks from brands like HP and Epson to help you decide which is the best **printer** for your office. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It uses dual band Wi-Fi as well as Bluetooth 5.0 to connect to all of your wireless devices. You can use the HP Smart App to print from your mobile devices, order ink and paper, and even monitor ink levels and paper capacity so you're never caught by surprise with empty cartridges or input trays. The compact design is perfect for smaller spaces, and the output tray doubles as a stylish cover to make your **printer** blend into the decor when not in use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While shopping online or in-store, you may have noticed how popular all-in-one **printer**s are. These are models that not only handle printing, but copying, scanning, and even faxing as well. These are best suited to small businesses and home offices that may not have enough space for dedicated equipment, or just want to streamline their workflow. The drawback is that these tend to be much more expensive than their single-function counterparts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A previous TIPA Award winner, the Epson SureColor SC-P5000 is a beast of a desktop **printer**, perfect for placing in a corner of your studio. It’s a 17-inch model with an enviably broad ink set that can handle anything a photo business can throw at it. That includes panoramic **prints**, A2+ posters, and fine art sheet media, including poster board. Inevitably then, it’s bigger and heavier than most consumer desktop **printer**s, but this inkjet model is designed for exhibition quality output, not just hard copies of holiday snaps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your budget is tight but still nothing smaller than an A3+ **printer** will do, check out the PIXMA iP8750 (aka iP8720), a very fairly priced and featured inkjet **printer** option from Canon. Yes, there are ‘only’ six inks to play with – essentially dye-based inks plus one pigment ink – but, with the ability to print from 10 x 15cm at ‘photo lab quality up to A3+ in size, this looks like a decent option for the photo enthusiasts’ home office/studio. Attendant features include the convenience of wireless connectivity, while optional XL-sized ink tanks purport to cost users 30 percent less per page than the standard size. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This humble three-in-one can print, scan and copy, but it is most at home when turning out surprisingly vibrant photos. As is often the case with budget inkjet **printer**s, the supplied starter cartridges are somewhat light on ink. However, if you replace them with high-capacity carts, the running cost is also quite competitive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The quality of your paper will have a big impact on the final print quality. If you're using sub-standard paper, then no matter how good your **printer** is, the results will be poor. Make sure to use high quality photo or fine art paper for the best results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Canon Pixma TR8620 offers plenty of office features, from scanning and faxing to a 20-page automatic document feeder (ADF), a duplexer for two-sided printing, and two paper trays for keeping two types of paper at the ready. A big 4.3-inch color touchscreen makes it easy to control, and the **printer** supports smart home integration with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Solid ink **printer**s use a solid wax material to print images onto paper. These **printer**s are typically used for photo printing and can produce high-quality **prints**. However, they are not well suited for large format printing projects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1. Brother INKvestment MFC-J995DW Best **printer** overall Specifications Printer Type: Inkjet Features: Print, copy, scan, fax Display: 2.7-inch color touch screen Ink/Toner: Four cartridges (black, cyan, magenta, yellow) Connectivity: 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi, Ethernet, USB 2.0 Today's Best Deals View at Newegg (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Very low cost per page + Fast at printing text and graphics + Quick scanning and copying speeds Reasons to avoid - Mediocre color-photo scans - Does not make two-sided copies/scans via ADF - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That depends on what kind of volume your business does. If you regularly need to fax, scan, copy, and print documents and images, all-in-one models are most certainly a worthy investment. However, if you only occasionally need these services (like only a few times a year), it may be better to just get a single-function **printer** and use a business like FedEx or Staples for copies and scanning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Epson EcoTank Pro (view at Office Depot) is one of the best **printer**s available for home and traditional offices. It can print up to 25 pages per minute, and auto duplex printing saves time and paper. You can print from mobile devices, and the touchscreen interface makes it easy to navigate menus and settings. If you're looking for a reliable, entry-level **printer**, the HP Envy Pro is a good option (view at Amazon). This budget-friendly **printer** is great for low-volume offices, and Bluetooth compatibility lets you print from mobile devices with or without an internet connection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The HP ENVY Photo 7855 All in One Photo Printer with Wireless Printing is an excellent choice for those who want to print high-quality photos at home. This **printer** uses HP Instant Ink, which is a subscription service that delivers ink to your door when you need it. The **printer** also works with Alexa, so you can print hands-free. Plus, the 7855 has a sleek design that will look great in any home office or studio. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Canon’s A3+/13-inch imagePROGRAF PRO-300 and A2/17-inch PRO-1000 deliver gallery-quality photo and fine art **prints** from conveniently compact desktop machines. Taking everything up to a grander scale, the imagePROGRAF PRO-2100 is a much larger, freestanding **printer** that accepts rolls of paper up to 24 inches in width. There’s direct support for a huge range of fine art media from the world’s best paper companies like Canson and Hahnemühle. The PRO-2100 delivers spectacular print quality for both color and mono photographic images, based on a range of 12 Lucia Pro pigment-based inks that includes a chroma optimizer, to minimize bronzing and gloss differential on glossy photo paper. The auto paper cutter and Canon’s supporting Professional Print & Layout software keep the whole process quick and easy when creating bordered or borderless **prints** in custom sizes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Inkjet **printer**s are the most popular type of **printer** used for art **prints**. They are relatively inexpensive and produce high-quality **prints**. If you are looking for an all-purpose **printer** that can handle a variety of projects, an inkjet **printer** is a good option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, the thing about **printer**s is that it isn't just the initial cost. Ink refills are infamous for being eye-wateringly expensive. However, if you are planning on doing a lot of printing, it is still more cost-efficient than using even the best photo printing services (opens in new tab). All of the **printer**s on our list use individually replaceable inks, so you only need to replace cartridges that have run dry. Also, both Canon and Epson have introduced **printer**s that run on bottles rather than cartridges, which is both more efficient and less wasteful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Xerox VersaLink C400 color laser **printer** is one of the best available for home and traditional offices. You can print up to 36 pages per minute with the first page out in as little as 7.4 seconds. The input tray has a 550-sheet capacity that can be expanded to a maximum of 1250 sheets with additional trays; a 150-sheet bypass tray is also included for specialized print jobs like envelopes, labels, or legal-size documents. You can connect to the **printer** via a USB cable or Bluetooth and dual band Wi-Fi for mobile printing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The title of best photo **printer** is essentially a dogfight between two names: Canon and Epson. While there are other manufacturers in the portable **printer** space, these two are really the only game in town when it comes to desktop **printer**s for photos of top quality. If you're looking to frame, mount or display your photos, this is where you want to be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a few ways that you can go about gluing art on **printer** paper to the back of another piece of paper. You can use a glue stick, white glue, or even double-sided tape. Just make sure that whatever method you choose will not damage the artwork. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

The type of **printer** you choose will depend on the quality of the print you want, the budget you have, and the specific needs of your project.

-   The **printer** uses dye sublimation print technology to produce superb quality photo **prints** at a resolution of 300 dots per inch. You can print various photo ranging in size from 2.1 by 3.4 inches (card) to 4 by 6 inches (postcard). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That said, really rich, deep blacks are marginally better than the PRO-300, which uses a newer, reformulated matte black ink. Large-format A2/17x22-inch **prints** are certainly imposing, and you can create panoramic **prints** of up to 1.2m in length, although there’s no optional roll-feeder so you have to cut the paper to length manually, in advance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can connect to the **printer** via Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or USB 3.0 wired connection for printing from your computer, camera, or mobile devices. You can also print directly from your iOS mobile devices when you need to quickly edit and produce images for clients. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best **printer**s make it easy to print all your documents, photos and other hardcopies. Whether you want basic document printing for homework assignments, high-grade photo printing for frameable portraits, or something that handles scanning, copying and even faxing, there's a **printer** out there that fits the bill. Do you want an all-in-one inkjet or a black-and-white laser **printer**? In this article we'll help you decide what you want, and find the **printer** that best fits your needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   HP’s oddly shaped all-in-one comes with comprehensive features, although it is first and foremost a photo **printer**. The print resolution is high enough to ensure your photos look sharp and colorful when printed on glossy photo paper. There’s also a handy SD card slot for printing directly from your camera’s memory card. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thermal **printer**s use heat to transfer images onto paper. They are typically used for short-run **prints**, such as business cards or labels. Thermal **printer**s are not well suited for large format printing projects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   4. Epson Expression Photo HD XP-15000 If you're tight on space this compact large format **printer** is perfect Specifications Type: Inkjet Maximum paper width: 13 inches Print size: A3+ Ink type: Epson Claria Photo HD ink Number of inks: 6 Max resolution: 5760 x 1440 dpi Droplet size: 1.5pl Print speed: Up to 29 pages per min (mono or color) Unit size: 479 x 370 x 159mm Weight: 8.5kg Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Newegg (opens in new tab) View at Walmart (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Affordable initial setup + Smaller footprint for its class Reasons to avoid - Replacement inks expensive - Uses 'just' six inks - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Canon Pixma TR150 is a portable inkjet **printer** that's small enough to carry in a backpack, but big enough to print everything from 4x6 photos to 8.5 x 11 documents. With a two-cartridge system, its ink is affordable and lends itself well to a variety of printing uses. But where the Canon really stands out is photo printing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Aimed at professional and enthusiast photographers, this high-quality photo **printer** achieves superior color fidelity by drawing on eight individual inkjet cartridges to create detailed **prints** on photo paper sizes up to A3+. And instead of pigmented inks, Canon has specified brighter dye-based inks for **prints** that look good enough for gallery display. Pigment ink is more durable, but you can expect to display dye-based photos for around thirty years before fading occurs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These days we are taking more digital photos than ever before, and the best desktop photo **printer**s are perfect for making hard copies of those memories at home. They represent a wide spread of price categories from premium models aimed at professional photographers to highly affordable photo **printer**s for families and students. What they all offer is a more convenient and cost-effective alternative to the services of a commercial photo lab. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Its ink is tank-based rather than cartridges, making the ET-8550 less costly and wasteful to refill than other **printer**s. Photo quality is very good, with bold and punchy colors, which can be fine-tuned using custom color-management settings. You can also load different papers in separate paper cassettes, and switch seamlessly from photos to documents and back. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are also dedicated nozzles for both photo and matte black inks to preserve quality and streamline the printing process. Along with traditional and glossy paper, this **printer** can be equipped with rolls of media up to 1.5mm thick to create banners, posters, and other large **prints**. The color touchscreen can be customized with shortcuts and pre-set configurations for faster, easier operation and mass-printing media. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The performance is also top notch, with sharp text, clear graphics and faster-than-average printing of mixed text and graphics. Fast scan and copy speeds are a plus, and the color laser **printer** has one of the easiest setup options available. That's enough for us to declare the Canon ImageClass MF743Cdw one of the best all-in-one **printer**s and our favorite laser **printer** for small business users. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   They're also much less expensive, making them attractive options to professionals on a budget. Many new **printer**s work with smart networks, allowing for voice controls via Alexa or Google Assistant, wireless mobile printing, and scanning to cloud based storage services. They may also have integrated security features like password protection and employee ID verification to protect against misuse and unauthorized access to sensitive information. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This must be the ultimate A3 photo **printer**. For starters, it’s a sleek, practical design with a large tilting touchscreen interface and the ability to print on any kind of paper up to A3+. Secondly, it uses six individual inks to create superior quality **prints**. Best of all, it’s an EcoTank, which means you’re not tied to cartridges, and you’ll find enough bottled ink in the box to print 2,300 photos. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's wonderfully rewarding to make your own **prints** rather than send them off to a lab and hope for the best. Not to mention, producing artwork with your own **printer** gives you more control and creativity over the final results. With options right up to a 64-inch **printer**, there is plenty of choice for photographers and artists who want to sell fine art **prints**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With more and more office devices becoming "smart" and internet-enabled, security is more important than ever. Thankfully, many new **printer**s come with a suite of security software that allows for employee ID or email authentication, setting up firewalls, password protection, and even encryption for your documents. You'll still have to protect your company's internet connections, but with these extra layers of security, you'll be able to prevent anyone from stealing company info, the personal data of employees, or sending malicious documents to be printed from your office. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to print both photos and documents regularly, it can be a pain to find a solution. Printing documents on a photo **printer** is expensive and inefficient, while photos will look bad coming out of a document **printer**. And buying two is quite an outlay of cash. So what's the answer? Well, Epson reckons it's their EcoTank ET-8550, a do-it-all **printer** with a five-ink setup designed to cover the spread and do everything well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Looking for a **printer** that can handle large format **prints**? Check out the Epson EcoTank Photo ET-8500! This all-in-one unit is capable of printing, scanning, and copying at resolutions up to 4800 x 1200 dpi. Plus, it has wireless connectivity so you can print from your mobile devices.

-   3. Canon Pixma TR8620 A great home office **printer** Specifications Printer Type: Inkjet Features: Print, copy, scan, fax Display: 4.3-inch color touchscreen Ink/Toner: Five cartridges (black, pigment-black, cyan, magenta, yellow) Connectivity: 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi, Ethernet, USB 2.0 Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Dell (opens in new tab) View at Walmart (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Fast photo printing and copying + High image quality + ADF and duplexer Reasons to avoid - Ink costs are above average - Does not make two-sided copies/scans via ADF - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So it's best to think about exactly what you need. The key factors to consider are the size of photos you want to print, and the type of ink you want to use. If this all seems a little overwhelming, you can scroll to the bottom of this page for our top tips on how to choose a photo **printer**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Typical of Canon 5-ink **printer**s over the years, this one runs on a pigment-based black cartridge for rich, solid text in document printing, along with dye-based cyan, magenta, yellow and black inks for photo output. Better still, you can keep plain paper for document printing in the internal cassette, and load sheets of variously sized photo paper into the upright rear feeder, as and when you want to create photo **prints**. The four dye-based inks for photo printing naturally have a smaller gamut (or color space) than in Epson’s competing photo **printer**s that use six dye-based inks but, even so, the Canon’s color rendition looks very lifelike and natural for everything from portrait skin tones to vibrant landscapes. The motorized output tray adds a touch of automation and the onboard controls are simple and intuitive, based around an OLED screen. As usual with document/photo **printer**s, there’s a built-in scanner, ideal for creating photocopies, but this model lacks a memory card slot for direct photo printing, although it does have built-in Bluetooth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Canon PRO-300 is the successor to the highly-regarded PRO-10 and again its distinguishing feature is that it uses ten pigment inks rather than dye-based ink. One of the cartridges is a ‘Chroma Optimizer’, which provides a smooth finish on glossy paper. Of the other nine newly-formulated Lucia Pro inks, you get the standard six colors for photo printing, plus red and grey inks, and both ‘photo’ black and matte black, for printing on glossy and matte media respectively. There are individual channels in the print head for both photo and matte black inks saving time and ink when swapping between media types. Excellent output quality combines superb accuracy for color **prints** and fabulous definition for black & white photo **prints**, without any unwanted color casts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Canon ImageClass MF743Cdw is an all-in-one color laser **printer** that offers great performance and plenty of features, like a large touch screen and duplex printing. But with a monthly page volume of up to 4,000 pages, it's meant for the office rather than the home. Business users will love the built in 50-sheet automatic document feeder, 550-sheet paper cassette, and work-friendly features like two-sided scanning and low printing costs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dye-sublimation **printer**s use a special dye to print images onto paper. These **printer**s are typically used for photo printing and can produce high-quality **prints**. However, they are not well suited for large format printing projects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Any **printer** can print a photo, but some are better at it than others. All of the models on this list are semi-dedicated photo **printer**s, which is to say they can turn out a decent text document, but photo printing is their superpower. They are all inkjet **printer**s because only with liquid ink can you achieve the required resolution and color gamut for fine photo printing, and only inkjets can print on dedicated glossy photo paper. Laser **printer**s have advantages, but in general, lasers are lousy at photos. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The only downside to the Canon imagePROGRAF PRO-1000 is that it is a bit pricey. If you are looking for a cheaper option, then this might not be the **printer** for you. However, if you are willing to spend the extra money, then this **printer** will produce amazing **prints**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s enough ink in the box to print 3,800 photos, which more than justifies the high price tag. It **prints** somewhat slowly and there’s no auto duplex mode, but if you are only printing photos, that’s not going to be a problem. In terms of running cost and convenience, this modest MegaTank is hard to beat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   6. HP Envy 6055 photo **printer** Great home **printer** for printing photos on a budget Specifications Category: Wireless all-in-one **printer** Print speed: 10ppm Paper capacity: 100 sheets Paper size: up to A4 Weight: 11.51lb Today's Best Deals Check Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Low price + Easy to use Reasons to avoid - Ink can be costly - Not the fastest - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Brother MFC-L2750DW XL Best laser **printer** Specifications Printer Type: Laser (Monochrome) Features: Print, copy, scan, fax Display: 2.7-inch color touch-screen Ink/Toner: Black toner Connectivity: 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi, Ethernet, USB 2.0 Today's Best Deals View at Walmart (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Newegg (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Very fast printing and copying + Very fast black-and-white scanning to PDF + Fast document feeder + Low cost per page Reasons to avoid - Average color-scanning speed - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Resolution gives the level of detail in photo **prints** and is given in dpi (dots per inch). And since artists are attentive to details, it goes without saying that the **printer** selected must be of a higher resolution. Some **printer**s have a resolution of as high as 9600dpi. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Over the years, I have also tested and pushed **printer**s for art to their max. Irresponsibly printing for hours and neglecting how I maintained the **printer**s. Often until they had to be put in their colorful **printer** graves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Canon PIXMA iX6850 photo **printer** Excellent compact A3 **printer** with five colors Specifications Category: Color inkjet **printer** Print speed: 14ppm (mono) Paper capacity: 150 sheets Paper size: up to A3+ Weight: 11.5kg Today's Best Deals Check Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Natural colors + Large color **prints** Reasons to avoid - No auto duplex - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're serious about creating high-quality **prints** of your art, then you'll need to invest in a good quality art **printer**. However, even the best art **printer**s can produce disappointing results if they're not used properly. To help you get the most out of your art **printer**, here are some expert tips: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you can see, buying the best **printer** for your art is not that hard. All you need is to understand what to look for as well as your specific needs. We hope that you have found this guide helpful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The HP DesignJet Studio Steel Large Format Wireless Plotter Printer is a great choice for those who need an art **printer** that produces high-quality, professional-looking **prints**. The **printer** is easy to use, comes with everything you need to get started, and is very reasonably priced. However, the **printer** is not the fastest on the market and is not compatible with all types of paper. If you need a large format **printer** that is fast and can handle all types of paper, then you may want to look at a different model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   9. Canon imagePROGRAF PRO-2100 Pro grade 24-inch printing isn't cheap, but this one’s hard to beat Specifications Type: Inkjet Maximum paper width: 24 inches Print size: A1 Ink type: Canon Lucia Pro Number of inks: 12 Max resolution: 2400 x 1200 dpi Droplet size: 4 pl Interfaces: USB 2.0, Wi-Fi, Ethernet Print speed: A1 photo **prints** from 1 minute 38 second Unit size: 1110 x 766 x 1168mm Weight: 124kg Today's Best Deals View at Walmart (opens in new tab) View at Newegg (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Pro grade workhorse + 24-inch **prints** Reasons to avoid - Expensive - Heavy - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The MFC-L2750DW XL turned in great document quality, and the fastest speeds to date for text and mixed text/graphics files. The **printer** even made two-sided **prints** faster than some models can handle one-sided documents. Using its high-capacity toner cartridge, the MFC-L2750DW XL offers a cost per page of just 2.7 cents, the lowest we've seen in this category. That's a tough deal to beat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When printing your artwork, make sure to use the correct **printer** settings. Many **printer**s have different settings for different types of paper, so make sure to select the correct setting for your paper type. You should also experiment with different resolutions to find the best setting for your particular artwork. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are plenty of affordable A4/letter-sized photo **printer**s out there that can carry out all the tasks of an all-in-one family **printer** while doing a great job printing on glossy photo paper. They tend to use the usual four (CMYK) ink cartridges to good effect. They may be either pigmented ink or dye-based ink. The pigment is quicker drying and longer-lasting while the dye is brighter and works well with high gloss media making it more desirable for photos. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When choosing an art **printer**, it is important to consider your needs and budget. If you need a high-quality **printer** for professional use, you should expect to pay more. However, if you are a hobbyist or only need occasional **prints**, you can find less expensive options that will still produce good results. Ultimately, the best art **printer** for you is the one that meets your specific needs and produces the quality of **prints** that you desire. With so many options on the market, there is sure to be a perfect match for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Very broadly, pigment inks last longer without fading, but dye inks tend to give richer, denser colors and sink deeper into the paper surface. They're both 'inks', but they have different pros and cons, and **printer** makers will choose one or the other (or combine them) according to what the **printer**'s designed for. The best photo **printer** doesn't necessarily use one or the other – it's up to you how you want to balance immediate print quality against long-term stability. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ink costs are an ongoing concern for any **printer**, since ink refills are part of the operating expenses for any **printer**. Ink can get very expensive, but some new models are designed to reduce both the expense and the hassle of finding the right ink cartridges. And this isn't purely an issue for inkjet **printer**s, as laser **printer**s use toner cartridges. Look for a lower cost-per-page and check out our reviews for a detailed discussion of how print costs might make one **printer** better than another. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Connectivity allows multiple devices such as computers and smartphones to connect to one **printer** in different ways. These include USB, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and Bluetooth. Luckily, most **printer**s have at least one or more options mentioned above. It is, however, important to keep in mind that, the many the options, the more convenient the **printer** is. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Print quality comes down to how well the **printer** lays ink on the page, and whether it produces sharp details and legible letterforms. Most inkjet **printer**s deliver "good enough" levels of quality, but if you want crisp looking text every time, you'll probably want a laser **printer**. And photo printing varies widely between general use **printer**s, so check out the recommended models on our best photo **printer**s list. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But it's not just affordable at purchase; operating costs are low, too, with a cost per page of 3.7 cents using standard-capacity toner cartridges and just 2.7 cents with high-capacity toner. If you want the benefits of a laser **printer** without the usual expense, the Brother HL-L2390DW is our best budget pick for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   5. Epson Expression Photo XP-970 photo **printer** A compact **printer** with exceptional A3 photo ability Specifications Category: Multifunction inkjet **printer** Print speed: 8.5ppm (mono) Paper capacity: 100 sheets Paper size: A3 Weight: 8.7kg specifications Colour Black Condition New Today's Best Deals View at Dell (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Newegg (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Six-ink colour fidelity + Large touchscreen Reasons to avoid - Slow print speed - Limited paper capacity - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There's much more to the cost of a **printer** than just the purchase price: Ink costs can eat away the savings you expected from your affordable device. If you want one of the best home **printer**s with the most affordable ink, we recommend the Brother INKvestment MFC-J995DW. The all-in-one inkjet **printer** features extra-large ink cartridges, and comes with an estimated years' supply of ink in the box, which adds up to the lowest per-page ink costs we've seen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Laser **printer**s are another option for art **prints**. They are generally more expensive than inkjet **printer**s, but they produce high-quality **prints**. Laser **printer**s are best suited for projects that require high-resolution printing, such as photographs or illustrations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For letter size printing up to 8.5x11 inches, most recent models follow Canon’s lead of combining a pigment-based black ink for crisp document printing, with four or more dye-based inks for premium photo output on glossy paper. Moving up to wider format 13x19 inch printing, there’s a choice of **printer**s based exclusively on dye or pigment inks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Behind that headline feature, this is a fairly basic four-in-one **printer** with just enough key features to make it suitable for home use or a small office. It **prints** very slowly and cannot automatically print on both sides of the page. For anyone planning to run out of lots of color documents, this compact and pleasingly designed AOI will beat most of the competition on per-page running costs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   the Canon imagePROGRAF PRO-1000 is a great **printer** for art **prints**. It produces high-quality **prints** with accurate colors and crisp details. The **printer** is easy to use and comes with everything you need to get started. The only downside is the high price tag, but if you're looking for a professional-grade **printer** for your art **prints**, the Canon imagePROGRAF PRO-1000 is a great option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our test procedure begins with installing the latest software drivers and running nozzle check and print head alignment routines. We then create test **prints** from mono documents, mixed text and graphics color documents, and a wide range of digital photos that include landscapes, portraits, and black & white images. We use the various available quality modes, including optional image enhancement features. We also create **prints** from our own specially created test chart, to test the **printer**'s accuracy in terms of color reproduction, tonal range, retention of detail in bright highlights and dark shadows, and the ability to deliver smooth gradations in subtle color variations. The **printer** manufacturer’s own-brand inks and papers are used throughout the entire testing procedure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finding the right **printer** starts with defining what you need that **printer** to do. There's a drastic difference between a large multifunction **printer** that will copy, scan and fax and a pocket-sized photo **printer** that's perfect for printing snapshots on the go. The best place to start is to narrow down what functions you want, and what aspects of printing are most important to you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It also has five inks and is designed for use only with Epson cartridges. When it comes to paper handling, this **printer** handles up to 120 sheets and 20-sheets of photo paper. It can also print labels on CDS and DVDs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're still not happy with the results you're getting from your art **printer**, then it may be time to seek out professional help. Many graphic designers and printing companies offer art printing services, so contact a few and get quotes. This can be a bit more expensive than doing it yourself, but it's worth it if you want the best possible results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Printers come in many shapes and sizes, from pocket photo **printer**s to large-format professional models. We check the suitability for wide-ranging tasks from printing office documents to high-end photographic output and, consequently, the type and quantity of dye/pigment inks. Additional features can include a built-in scanner, a standalone control panel, a touchscreen interface, Wi-Fi connectivity, direct fax functions, and a card reader slot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, all this wouldn't mean much if the **prints** didn't look any good. Fortunately, the Canon PIXMA G620 MegaTank (G650 in Europe) puts out images of great quality, with good color rendition and tonal range. It makes the most of its six-ink setup, and can put out high volumes of **prints**: a full tank-load can produce up to 3,800 6x4-inch photos, or 3,700 mono documents, or 8,000 color documents. It's not the fastest **printer**, but it is extremely efficient. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The HP Envy 7855 lives up to its jealousy-tinged name as a stylish all-in-one inkjet **printer**. It's one of the best home office **printer**s, offering solid print performance across the board. But in addition to printing documents, scanning and copying on the flatbed scanner, and even faxing, the Envy 7855 is also a very good photo **printer**, handling everything from small, wallet-sized photos to borderless 8 x 10s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you step up to the more expensive A3+ size **printer**s, you’ll often find more inks used to make up the image, and you may well have pigmented black ink for text documents alongside dye-based black for photos. Five, six, eight, or ten ink compartments are common and more colors mean superior print quality is possible. It may also mean higher ink costs, but fortunately, photo **printer**s with refillable ink tanks are booming, so if you plan to print a lot of photos, go for a **printer** that takes bottled ink rather than cartridges. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
