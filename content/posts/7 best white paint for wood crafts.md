## 7 Reference List: Best White Paint For Wood Crafts | Best Paint To Use On Wood Furniture
-   Its almost white to begin with! Easy right? No, it’s never as easy as you think it will be BUT with a little patience we were able to come up with a sweet creation. Using hairpin legs you can find here I was able to raise the dresser to the perfect height for a changing station. Then I added glass knobs you can find here. I decided to **paint** in Benjamin Moore Advance (waterborne alkyd) in the clients preferred shade of white. (out of all the thousands…) Certain areas of the piece were sanded to bare wood and sealed to keep the wood tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   White **paint**ed furniture becomes a staple in home decor and design! It ties new and old, rustic and chic. It just looks beautiful. Here is a Pinterest friendly image if you want to pin it for later! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When **paint**ing white furniture above all other colors we have to remember that NO MATTER what the can or literature says you will always at the very least want to lightly sand and clean to remove any grease, dirt or debris from the surface. I generally use an orbital sander for big areas and for smaller nooks a mouse or sand by hand using maybe 80 grit to break the existing finish. Should we prime before we **paint**? Yes. No matter how great the adhesion of the **paint** we want to use a shellac based primer, oil based primer, or another stain blocking primer (my favorite is the Dixie Belle Paint Companies BOSS which comes in Clear or White!) to seal the surface and lock in any stains, oil, or tannin. By sealing the existing surface you lock in those impurities that can otherwise seep into your **paint** as it dries to contaminate your lovely white finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course this isn’t white but you can see the problem. This is usually caused by some sort of residue on the surface (even cleaner residue can cause this) or oils. You don’t want to run across this at the END of the project! **Sometimes I use TSP or a deglosser, KNOW THIS, these can cause your WHITE to turn yellow!! Wipe down with water and vinegar before **paint**ing if you use this! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Believe it or not rustic white **paint**ed furniture can be just as difficult if not more for reasons I will explain in a bit. If we didn’t realize before we should now know wood wants to look like wood. It doesn’t prefer to be WHITE! And so… it may resist but, with the right practices we just may be able to pull it off to perfection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best Benjamin Moore **paint** for furniture is Benjamin Moore Advance. It was designed for cabinetry! (think high use, kitchens, bathrooms etc) It DOES NOT HAVE TO BE SEALED. (Genuinely, thats not a gimmick and they dont use that as some farse of a selling point, its just true) Do you remember what we said about bleed? “What is even worse is sometimes this doesn’t happen until you add your top coat.” This means one extra step to avoid inviting bleed when **paint**ing white furniture! PLUS it has some of the same properties as **paint**ing furniture with oil based **paint**, which helps to also prevent bleed! Something you may want to note though is regardless of the slight oil content, you never have to worry about your Benjamin Moore Advance Paint Yellowing. Find your local Advance dealer HERE and have it tinted to ANY WHITE YOU WANT! **Full disclosure I do add a top coat on the surface of dressers, tables, etc. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This was a table I finished for the living room of a home on DIY Networks Restoring Charleston. Of COURSE we needed white furniture right? Yes, the show needed lots of it. For instance the other rustic white **paint**ed shadowbox coffee table... - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
