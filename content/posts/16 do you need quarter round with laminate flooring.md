## 16 Things You Should Know About Do You Need Quarter Round With Laminate Flooring | How To Cut Laminate Flooring
-   Buckling: What happens when a floor can’t expand properly.For a **laminate** **flooring** installation and correct size of the expansion gap, we suggest to use installation spacers that can be found in an installation kit, between planks and the wall to allow for the required 1/4 inch expansion space. Be sure to look at the installation instructions included in your **flooring** box as it can give you important information about installing your floor. Remember that some floors require a bigger gap than others. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As mentioned above, it is a matter of preference whether to install the baseboards before or after installing hardwood or **laminate** **flooring**. The argument for installing baseboards first is primarily due to how much easier it is to paint the walls and trim without worrying about the new floor. By installing and finishing the baseboards first, there is no need to tape down plastic sheeting to protect new floors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   During construction, most walls will have either a piece of lumber or metal frame on the floor. These are secured with nails to the sub-floor (the base floor onto which you will install carpet, hardwood, or **laminate**). In most cases, drywall is then fixed to the framing from the top, leaving at least a one-inch (2.5 cm) gap between the bottom of the sheet and the floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Installation of baseboards is often preceded by installation of the **flooring**, but this can vary based on what type of **flooring** is being used. Carpeting needs to have the trim in place so that the edges can be tucked under and hidden from view. Trim installation is much simpler after installation of hardwood or **laminate**, on the other hand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Baseboards are often installed before **flooring**, although it depends on the type of **flooring** being used. It is necessary for carpeting to have the trim in place, allowing the edges to be tucked under and out of sight. However, for hardwood or **laminate**, it is easier to install the trim after. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Run a thin bead of construction adhesive along the back of the molding. Place the molding up against the baseboard molding or wall, allowing the bottom of the molding to sit on the **laminate** floor. Press the molding tightly against the baseboard molding and wall. Have an assistant hold the molding in place. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, install thresholds where your new **laminate** meets a different type of **flooring** or in any doorways, etc. Some thresholds will just cover the gap and will sort of look like a T shape when you look at the end. Some will bridge the gap between a slightly higher or lower adjoining floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In some cases if the base board is installed on a new **laminate** or hardwood floor that isn't flat, there will be gaps under the base board that take away from the overall look of the finished floors. The base board could be described as following the contour of the floor, but there are times when this is not the case. This base board was installed by another installer that must have worked at a lower rate. So installing quarterly round molding can be used to cover this unsightly gap. In this case I don't think they installed 1/4 round to cover this gap. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An expansion gap is essential when it comes to **laminate** **flooring** installation. The recommended expansion gap is a minimum of ¼ inch. Expert installers say that the larger the space, the larger the expansion gap should be, as the floor needs more space to expand and contract with temperature. Since **laminate** **flooring** is a floating floor, it is not attached to the sub-floor and sits on top of the underlayment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Installing quarterly round moldings is a task that can be used to install **laminate** or hardwood **flooring**. It can be confusing trying to cut all the angles you may encounter. I will try to explain it in simple terms so you can install your own quarter round. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your space has existing door jambs, you can create a cleaner look to your new floor install if you trim the bottom of the jambs so that the **laminate** can slide neatly underneath. Using a piece of **laminate** as a guide, butt it up against the jamb. Mark the jamb with a pencil and trim the jamb with a flat handsaw parallel to the sub floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your first row will set the stage for the rest of the room’s **flooring**. The most important piece of advice we can give you here is LEAVE A 1/2″ GAP (use spacers) at the wall (so, on three sides). Laminate floors are floating floors and are subject to expansion and contraction. Leaving the gap will prevent buckling – and it will be covered by the baseboards so no one will be the wiser when you’re all finished. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Answered by LCD: sk him why the 1/4 round is needed - I have seen houses where the drywall was installed sitting on the subfloor and mudded to fill the gap at the top, so there is no gap under the drywall to provide expansion space for the **flooring**. If you basebaord is only 1/4 or 3/8" material, that is cutting it mighty close for expansion/contraction space, so he might be saying do this to protect you from having visible gaps around the edge, or to prevent the floor from shrinking short of the baseboard, then catching on it when it reexpands, which could ruin the floor. If your drywall did not have **flooring** gap space left under it, and your baseboards are less than 3/4" thick, I would agree with him. Remember, depending on floor size and type of material, you need 1/4-1/2" gap all around - but as a floating floor shrinks and expands, it is common for all the shrinkage to be toward one edge that for whatever reason locks in place, so an initial 1/2" edge all around can become 1" on one wall and zero on the opposite one - which would likely leave an open gap along the baseboard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   *Disclosure: Lumber Liquidators generously gave us **flooring** in exchange for posting about their awesomeness.They did not tell us what **flooring** to choose or what to say. We were quite pleased with our LL **flooring** in our last house (that we PURCHASED) and are over-the-moon thrilled about our new Lumber Liquidators **flooring** in this house. We trust you all know by now that we wouldn’t post about or recommend anything we don’t love. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are laying quarter round or shoe molding on hardwood floors, you should lay a quarter round or shoe molding that matches the floor wood grain & stain. Most folks know that hardwood **flooring** companies generate a lot of profit from trim pieces. If you want to avoid paying the high price for matching trim, but still want a clean, finished look, consider buying unfinished trim pieces at your local big box and staining the to match your prefinished floor. This will save you 50-75% off buying matching trim, and you likely won’t be able to tell the difference (especially if your hardwoods are oak or pine, which are readily available in unfinished trim at home improvement stores). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Answered by ContractorDon: He may be trying to speed up the process of laying the floor, yes you do need expansion room for the **flooring** to expand but between the space normally there where the sheetrock meets the wall and the baseboard it should be enough without the 1/4 round. He does not have to be as carefull cutting if he has an extra 1/2 inch provided by the 1/4 round. My house is done with only baseboard and looks great after 14 years of expansion and contraction. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
