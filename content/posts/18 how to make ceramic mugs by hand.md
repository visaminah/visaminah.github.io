-   To create food-safe and waterproof **mugs** you need traditional clay, stoneware, or **ceramic**s. All of them need to be cured in a kiln. Some also need to be glazed (with a food-safe glaze), which also needs to be fired. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If possible, dry you mug upside down to keep the handle from drooping. Also, dry it slowly by covering it loosely in plastic for several days.

-   Your clay will now be about the size and shape of a cup rather than a mug. Cups are a bit shorter than **mugs**. This does depend on how much clay you started out with. But 13 oz of clay that is pinched to 1/4 inches thick will be cup-sized, rather than a mug. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Never have a dull coffee or chai session with these adorable handmade pottery **mugs** from Artoon. Get a few **ceramic** coffee **mugs** so your party look as amazing as they make you feel. A little something to prop up your mornings and high tea. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even though some types of air dry clay harden well after drying, they don’t have the strength of **ceramic**s or stoneware. In lots of cases, air dry clay cracks while drying. Cracks can vary in size, some may be so small you wouldn’t even notice, but water will get into those cracks and break the item from within or develop mold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Vinegar acts as a flocculant in **ceramic**s, which is a fancy way of making clay stickier. You can spray vinegar on your attachments before you make them, or you can mix your slip with vinegar to make it more effective. Paper clay: Mix your slip as you normally would (maybe a little wetter than usual) and take 4 parts slip and one part shredded or torn paper – any kind will work but a lot of potters will swear by egg cartons, tissue paper or newspaper – mix them thoroughly and let sit overnight then use it as slip. Paper clay will make everything about attachments easier. The only downside is that it has a shelf life of barely two weeks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can make **mugs**, plates, or bowls with air dry clay, but only for decorative purposes. Even though air dry clay is not toxic, it’s not food-safe even after glazing or using waterproof sealants. But let’s dig deeper!

-   For some people, coffee is more than just a comforting beverage to sip with breakfast: it’s a magical elixir that grants energy and banishes sleep. But it's unfortunately easy to spill while walking from place to place mug in hand. And according to a new study, this happens because we’ve been holding our coffee **mugs** the wrong way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Instead of going into a place that will let you paint pottery, help your child create a personalized mug at home. Give the mug as a gift to parents, grandparents or even a favorite teacher. Help your child in creating a gift by painting a plain **ceramic** mug. In addition to painting the mug, have your child use her hand print for decoration on the mug.

-   Mugs are a potter's bread and butter. According to The National Coffee Association and the Specialty Coffee Association of America, Americans consume 400 million cups of coffee every day, and there are 300 million people in America, which means that every American needs an average of 1.33 coffee **mugs**. So if every single person needs one (and a third) good mug, then every potter should have at least one solid mug in their repertoire. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The heat-resistance issue isn’t so easy to dismiss. Loctite epoxy stands up to only 120 degrees, Haslage said. Very hot coffee would exceed that, though it’s possible the heat wouldn’t transfer through the **ceramic** enough to cause the epoxy to fail. But cleaning the cups in a dishwasher would definitely be a problem. So would using the cups to warm drinks in a microwave. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sculpting with air dry clay is so easy and fun. It doesn’t require special tools or equipment (like an expensive and big kiln). Air drying clay is so versatile. You can make endless crafts with it. But is it suitable for making **mugs** and plates to hold drinks and food? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Way to go! You're almost finished making your first of many handmade clay coffee **mugs**. To finish, smooth the edges where the handle was attached using a damp sponge or brush. That's it. You're finished! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
