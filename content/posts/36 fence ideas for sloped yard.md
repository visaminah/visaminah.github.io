## 36 Things You Should Know About Fence Ideas For Sloped Yard | Rackable Fence Panels Home Depot
-   If you want the ornamental **fence** simply for decoration or to define the boundary of your **yard**, and privacy isn’t a concern, an open style, like pickets, in wood or vinyl, might be a good choice. Because these **fence**s come in panels, installation will need to accommodate the slope of your **yard**. It’s important to decide, during the planning stage, if you like the look of paneled **fence**s that are stair stepped, especially if you have a steep grade on your property. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One way to add something unique to your **fence** is to mix it with metal. I love the wood horizontal boards with metal posts. Metal works great for stability but the different material really adds architectural interest. Plus mixing metal and wood makes for a very modern design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Aside from looking simple yet classy, more and more homeowners are getting attracted to lattice fencing because of its visually appealing character, versatility, easy installation, and cost-efficient nature. It could be used for a wide range of fencing purposes from privacy fencing to simple outline fencing. If you are thinking of using lattice fencing for your garden or patio for a change, here are some lattice **fence** ideas that you can consider. In this article: What is a lattice **fence**? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A simple lattice **fence** can be a divider, a screen, a trellis **fence**, or a low-outline **fence**. It is expected that you already have your choice of lattice panels to arrange. But if you want to go DIY, here are the materials that you need to prepare in making your own simple lattice **fence**: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a sloped **yard**, one of the best uses for an ornamental **fence** is simply as another piece of decoration in the garden in the form of a freestanding trellis or screen. Since factors such as construction quality and security are not problems in this instance, you can get any style of ornamental **fence** to work. If the slope is small, you can probably get away with installing the **fence** parallel to the ground, but if the slope is significantly sharper you may want to consider installing a **fence** with the vertical lines being differing heights while still being plumb with each other. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are plenty of ornamental designs that can give you privacy, such as shadowbox **fence**s which stagger pickets to block the view from the garden. Lattice **fence**s can be covered with climbing vines to provide privacy but present challenges in a sloped **yard**. The best option to ensure privacy may be to have custom-built panels that conform strictly to the slope. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Don’t look at the unique features of your **yard** as limitations—consider them opportunities to get creative in your design. However, if you do not feel comfortable building a DIY **fence** in your sloped **yard**, having a custom **fence** installed by a **fence** contractor is also a solid option. Whatever you choose, adding a **fence** to any **yard** is an excellent way to give you privacy while increasing the value of your home and making your **yard** look lovely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This one is a full lattice deck privacy screen. It is a good accent to large land areas for people to feel more cozy and confined. Thinly slatted lattice **fence**s would make it all the more effective as a privacy screen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are several species of wood that can be used for a horizontal **fence**. Cedar is often used in outdoor projects because it contains natural oils which are a deterrent to bugs. It’s also rot-resistant making it a longer-lasting product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   They will likely begin by choosing the center point of the length of the curve and place a stake at that spot. They’ll use some string or wire and tie it to one end to the stake, and then move around to create an arc. Then, they’ll drive in additional stakes where the posts will be placed along the curve. The process will be repeated for the entire **fence**-line until the complete curve is drawn out and you’re happy with the placement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another purpose for **fence**s can be to mark your property line. You can put a **fence** around your garden to keep unwanted friends out. Also, you can make an outdoor shower which would certainly need a **fence** around it for privacy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This sloped **yard** has the best of both worlds: prairie plants for pollinators and turf grass for **yard** games. A retaining wall holds back the hillside, leaving a flat grassy space for bare feet. Wildflowers and longer grass give the remaining hillside a natural feel. The retaining wall is an ideal spot for decorative planters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a steeper slope or hill, following the contours of your land is more difficult. In this case, you probably want to opt for a stepped **fence**. This installation style is referred to as such because each panel is a bit higher (or lower) than the next, creating the appearance of stair steps. Stepped **fence**s can be easily created with preassembled panels. However, your posts will need to be individually cut to fit the height of each panel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, your contractor will dig the **fence** post holes and set the posts where they placed the stakes. They will continue to set the posts and then place the **fence** boards between the posts until your **fence** is complete. Don’t forget to have a removable section and to include a couple of gates. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To conclude, lattice fencing is both visually appealing and practical. Regardless if it is a large or secluded area, it can be a good accent **fence**. It has its upsides and a fair share of downsides. But since the pros outweigh the cons, it is understandable why it has become a new go-to **fence** for homeowners. We hope that you got inspired by some of the ideas that we mentioned here today. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll want each panel to be even and level, so there will be gaps underneath the panels, and these gaps may not be consistent throughout your **yard**. Gaps can be a problem if you need to prevent a pet from escaping, in which case you will need to find a way to fill them. You may also want to fill your gaps for aesthetic purposes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our featured testimonial is from Sandy, a foster pet parent from Connecticut Pet Rescue. She shows how our **fence** can be installed with a difficult back **yard**. If you don’t want to watch the whole thing you can jump to these important clips with the links below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While few **yard**s come close to being perfectly flat, significantly sloped **yard**s present specific challenges for homeowners who want to build their own DIY **fence**s. Don’t let that discourage you—a challenge doesn’t make the project impossible by any means. Many a homeowner with an uneven **yard** has prevailed and built their dream **fence** anyway. Besides, the contours of your **yard** create interest and add to its beauty, especially with a new **fence**. Let’s look at some of the techniques you can use when installing a **fence** on a slope or a hill. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Stepped fencing is another option for sloped properties. It uses rails that are perpendicular to the **fence** pickets so that every section accommodates the slope of the property. The **fence** ends up looking like a set of stairs which increases in height as you continue up the slope. Stepped fencing usually has gaps which may enable your beloved pet to get out of your **yard**. The **fence** will also look less consistent, which makes it a less popular choice for many home owner’s, but a stepped **fence** tends to be simpler to construct. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the primary goal of your **fence** is to keep people and wildlife out, any gap in the bottom of the **fence** can be a very big problem. Since the gap of one end of a stair-stepped **fence** panel will be larger than the other end, due to the incline of the slope, you should most likely consider a rackable **fence** panel that follows the slope of the ground. These **fence**s ensure that the gap between the **fence** and the ground is consistent and minimal. Rackable panels that adjust to the slope of the ground, are available in ornamental **fence** styles with an open design, with small spaces between the vertical lines and panels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In appearance, the lattice **fence** is unique because of its distinguishable diagonal slats and crisscross pattern. It is commonly used in oriental style gardens, spa, and as enclosures in patios or used as dividers inside the home. It is also known for being a cheap fencing alternative and a durable, versatile fencing choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After plotting your **fence** line with string, you will be able to clearly see the changes in elevation in your **yard**. For angles over 10 degrees, you will need to trim the rails (horizontal panels of **fence**) accordingly. Otherwise, no trimming is needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This widely slatted wooden **fence** is usually seen in wide countryside estates. It will look beautiful in orchard gates. You would be surprised to know that it is neither vinyl nor woo. It is actually welded iron with the proverbial criss-cross lattice design.Related - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I love a living wall. Adding plants to a horizontal **fence** is great for giving something that can be very hard a soft touch, bring life to it. This is a very modern look. The great thing is that mother nature can keep these plants alive for you! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Building a **fence** along a curve is always best left to a professional. When building a curved **fence** it’s imperative that each post is placed correctly to create the desired curve for the **fence**-line. A professional contractor will work with you to form the optimal curve for your **fence**-line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first thing to consider in regards to a slope is the possibility of grading or leveling the slope. Grading is when you use machinery for digging, cutting, and moving the soil, so the land is more level. It might sound like a hassle, or be expensive, but it could be easier or look more attractive than building a **fence** on a slope. If you decide against grading, your only other option is to build a **fence** designed specifically for a sloped property. To construct a **fence** on a sloped property , you’ll have to decide if you want to use a raked fencing design or stepped fencing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Compared to wrought-iron, vinyl, aluminum, composite **fence**, and wood fencing, a lattice is cheaper. You have to note, however, that there are other cheap **fence** types. This includes chain link, pallet, hog, and barbed wire and electric fencing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'Other things to consider include boundary walls and **fence**s. How will level changes within the garden affect your neighbor's wall or **fence**, for example? If you’re dropping the ground level quite a bit, boundary walls may need underpinning which is an expensive undertaking.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because stepping a **fence** will not hug the ground as a racked **fence** will, pets can escape with greater ease under the gaps. However, depending on the severity, this can be remedied by filling the gaps with soil. As we said before, stepped fencing is the preferred method when your property has larger slopes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   They say that good **fence**s make good neighbors but I think **fence**s can be way more than that. Fences are perfect for adding privacy to your outdoor space. They make an architectural statement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Perhaps you’ve been putting off your fencing project because your property is sloped or curved and you know it’s going to be a challenging venture. If you look at your back**yard** and dream of seeing a beautifully constructed **fence** but aren’t sure how to tackle the tough issues it’s time to get professional help. These are some top metal fencing ideas for a property with hills and curves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another common fencing challenge is dealing with curved property lines. If your property lines are not straight, you may need to build a **fence** that curves. A curved **fence** isn’t really curved ; it just looks that way. The section of a **fence** stretching between each of the posts is always a straight line regardless of the construction materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lattice **fence** cost is based on three quality grades and the typical measurement is per foot. The cheapest lattice **fence** is made of plastic costs from $2-4. Medium-grade or cheap wood lattice **fence**s would cost $2.50-5 while quality wood lattice **fence** costs $8-25. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No, it’s actually more expensive to do a horizontal **fence**. The reason is the wood used needs to be of a higher quality to ensure that the boards don’t sag. No one wants saggy boards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When building a **fence** on uneven terrain, one option is to follow the contours of your **yard**. This means that the horizontal rails of your **fence** will follow your **yard** in a smooth line that is parallel to the ground rather than level. The contoured method works best when the slope is slight rather than dramatic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is but objective to lay down the pros and cons of lattice fencing especially if you are already set to having one. Knowing these would save you tons of time, effort, and money as you would have the chance to look for other fencing types that will be best for you. Here are some of the pros and cons of a lattice **fence** that you should consider first before getting on with your lattice **fence** project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
