## 11 Shocking Facts About What Is The Best Soft Eyeliner Pencil | Best Waterproof Eyeliner
-   For the uninitiated, an **eyeliner** **pencil** is just that: A **pencil** that (ideally) draws a nice neat line of makeup on the outer rim of the eye. They can be made up of a variety of different ingredients, but by volume an **eyeliner** **pencil** contains mostly waxes or gums that help the line stick and a pigment to provide the coloring. The devil is in the details though, and not all **pencil**s are created equal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finding the right shade of **eyeliner** can be tough, but there are a few basic fashion guidelines that will help. Almost everyone has a few reliable **eyeliner** **pencil**s in basic black, and for the most part that’s a go-to color — but it doesn’t have to be. If you have especially pale skin, black may just give you “tired eyes,” so go with a brown or grey **pencil** instead. Browns can also work well on those with a medium skin tone, while those with darker skin can look good in silver, blue or a variety of other colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re going for a night out and want colors outside the spectrum of black and brown, choose something that complements your eyes. Brown **eyeliner** is always a safe bet with brown eyes, but dark blues or greens can make the right eye shape pop. Blue eyes usually love a little gold or bronze around the edges, and hazel eyes play well with a range of other hues. Try purple, green or gold until you find your style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Finding the right color **eyeliner** will usually be a lot easier than finding one with the right feel.
