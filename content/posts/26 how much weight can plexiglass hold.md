## 26 Reference List: How Much Weight Can Plexiglass Hold | Glass vs Plexiglas – Which One Is More Steady and Strong Option?
-   As mentioned above, **plexiglass** usually comes with a thin layer of plastic film intended to prevent scratches as the material travels from manufacturer to retailer to your workshop. Leaving that film on as you measure, mark, and cut will prevent scratches from your tools and work surfaces. Score deep. When using a knife such as a box cutter to cut **plexiglass**, be sure to score a straight, deep line before attempting to break the material at the mark. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now that we've addressed the single biggest drawback to acrylic, we should address its single biggest benefit. Compared to glass acrylic is remarkably light**weight**. With larger pieces, say 24"x36" and larger, glass can be dangerously heavy, causing the frame to bow under the **weight**. Not only that, but glass can be dangerous to handle in those larger sizes, threatening to flex and snap. Acrylic is preferred when framing larger sizes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The tool will help you estimate how much your piece of glass will weigh. This is useful if you are purchasing the glass to put on a pedestal or table, and you would like to know if the table will hold it. The results are approximate and don’t count the packaging used to ship the glass. If you require more exact **weight**s, please contact us directly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For example, the price of a full (48″ * 96″) sheet of 1/4″ thick **plexiglass** from a top vendor like Fab Glass and Mirror comes to a whopping $736.25 with”free shipping”. This is a company that advertises “we will beat any price by 10%”. So, the #1 tip for purchasing large sheets of acrylic is to always buy locally. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the most remarkable features of plastic is just how greatly its features can vary from variety to variety. Acrylic doesn't have as much impact resistance as polycarbonate; polycarbonate's tensile strength is greater than that of PVC; PVC's heat deflection abilities are lesser than Vivak's; and so on, and so on. One of the most basic differences between varieties, however, can be found in how much they weigh. Though that may seem like a simple and not particularly worthwhile distinction, any engineer worth their salt will tell you that **weight** is of the utmost importance when deciding whether a material is appropriate for a particular project. That value must be known in order to determine the overall **weight** of said project and whether its other components will be able to support the heft of the plastic component - which is why we've put together this quick and easy guide on the **weight**s of some of our most popular plastics. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whichever cutting method you choose, you may find that the cut **plexiglass** edge doesn’t look terribly attractive. If the cut edge would be visible in your application, take the extra time to sand and buff out the imperfections. Note: You can use a handheld power sander, but manual wet-sanding typically achieves the best results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Plexiglass is a kind of clear acrylic sheet, and it is specifically used as a generic term to refer to a few different products that are manufactured under different names, including Plexiglas, the original trademarked name. When acrylic was created in the early 1900s, one of the products produced with it was registered under the name Plexiglas. Today, a number of manufacturers create **plexiglass** acrylic products sold under brand names including Acrylite, Crylux, Lucite and Perspex. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Acrylic can be cut, drilled, machined, softened, and bent to make any shape. And, being half the **weight** of glass, handling acrylic is easy. At The Plastic People, we can cut/form acrylic to size or shape you desire, but if you want to work with acrylic yourself, here are the key aspects of working with acrylic: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Versatile and tough though it may be, **plexiglass** isn’t perfect. For one thing, it scratches easily. That’s why sheets of the material come covered in a thin layer of protective film. The other downside? Homeowners who don’t know how to cut **plexiglass** can be intimidated by the material at first—but we’re here to help! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our acrylic rods can be used in any number of ways. The rods are durable, will not bend easily, will not shrink, and will not weaken. In addition, they are light**weight** and enduring, and are naturally UV resistant. Additionally, various types of exposure will not compromise the quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light**weight**: Even though it is more durable than glass, acrylic is half the **weight**, making it an incredibly easy material to work with. It is also lighter than the other most popular clear plastic, polycarbonate. Keep in mind that is polycarbonate is 250 times stronger than glass, though, so it's best to consider which plastic is best for your project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Glass is a unique substance made by melting silica sand with various additives to make a vast range of clear or colored, transparent, or opaque products. PLEXIGLAS® is a type of engineered plastic and is the most famous trade name for **plexiglass**. Other trade names include Perspex (ICI), Lucite (DuPont) & Optix (Home Depot). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Start the process with 120- or 180-grit waterproof sandpaper, in combination with a wood or rubber sanding block. As the **plexiglass** becomes smoother, transition to successively finer grits. Finish by sanding with 600-grit sandpaper. Once you are satisfied with the appearance of the edge, move on to buffing. Outfit your electric drill with a buffing pad and, after applying a polishing compound formulated for plastic, bring the **plexiglass** edge to a perfect polish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to price and ease of cutting, glass beats acrylic. But when it comes to durability, cleanliness and light **weight** acrylic wins every time. There are pros and cons to glass and acrylic. Depending on the situation one may be preferred over the other. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are ordering glass for use as a shelf, use this tool to make sure that it will support the **weight** of the items you want to put on it. The glass type and thickness, the distance between supporting brackets, and other factors will influence whether your glass can meet your **weight** limits. If you have further questions, please contact us directly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After readying your tool, measure and mark the **plexiglass**, then cut as you would any other material, clamping if appropriate. One note of caution: If the blade overheats, the material may chip or crack. Proceed accordingly, water-cooling the blade or pausing your work for a few minutes as needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When using a knife such as a box cutter to cut **plexiglass**, be sure to score a straight, deep line before attempting to break the material at the mark. Use the right blade. Whether using a hand tool or a power saw to cut **plexiglass**, it’s important to use a sharp blade. A dull blade will fight against the material, potentially causing cracks and breaks—not to mention an overly rough cut edge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For thicker sheets of **plexiglass**, cut with a power saw—be it a circular saw, saber saw, or table saw. (To cut anything but a straight line, opt for a jigsaw.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Keep the plastic film on. As mentioned above, **plexiglass** usually comes with a thin layer of plastic film intended to prevent scratches as the material travels from manufacturer to retailer to your workshop. Leaving that film on as you measure, mark, and cut will prevent scratches from your tools and work surfaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ⋆ If you have the Milsbo Wide, Milsbo Tall, Fabrikor Wide, or Rudsta Wide, we recommend upgrading to a thicker acrylic sheet for better **weight** support and more slots choices. Please check out our 3/8" listing here: https://etsy.me/3b821Wi - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When cutting **plexiglass**, leave the film in place as long as possible to avoid marring the surface. Second, bear in mind that even if you’re careful, it can be difficult to cut **plexiglass** without leaving a rough, irregular edge. If your project requires a clean edge, expect to devote energy to smoothing the finish. Simply cutting **plexiglass** to size is easy by comparison. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, hold the yardstick to the marked line, and run the dull side of a utility knife or specialty **plexiglass** cutting tool along the yardstick to score the sheet. Score again and again, as many as 10 or 12 times, until you have made a deep groove in the **plexiglass**. Flip over the **plexiglass**, and score the opposite side in the same manner. To finish, hold the scribed line to the edge of your work surface, and secure the **plexiglass** in place with a clamp. Then, with sharp downward pressure, snap off the portion of the **plexiglass** that extends beyond the work surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When considering the differences between **plexiglass** vs acrylic, the reality is, they’re very similar. But there are a few notable differences. Let’s break down what **plexiglass**, acrylic and a mysterious third contender, Plexiglas, are and the differences between them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The chairs are made of durable polycarbonate which holds considerably well under significant **weight** and pressure. However, the best thing about chairs is they are pretty light**weight** even when they are so sturdily built. This allows you to carry them easily from one space to another. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are numerous variations of acrylic sheet products mainly differing in surface treatment. In the calculators below, we compare standard **plexiglass** with regular clear tempered glass to make simple “apple to apples” comparisons. We specify “tempered” glass because it is stronger than annealed glass – see this post for how glass gets tempered. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have been using my new desk setup since June and just love it. The **plexiglass** serves as a great writing surface. I am very pleased and recommend this. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
