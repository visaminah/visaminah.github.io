## 48 Unexpected Facts About What Color Goes With Red Blue And Yellow | Types of Colors
-   What does this information have to do with the color **blue** and red makes, you ask? The answer rests on additive and subtractive colors. When you mix **blue** and green, you get cyan. When you mix green and red, you get **yellow**, but what color does red and **blue** make when it comes to RGB? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Primary red: True primary red is magenta. Primary colors cannot be made from other colors. Primary colors are the source of all other colors. Primary red goes with **yellow**, orange, **blue**, white, and black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Violet is considered a spectral color. Like **blue** and red, violet is created through a single wavelength of light which falls on the visible spectrum between 380 and 450 nanometers. Purple is not a spectral color. Instead, purple becomes visible to our eyes when the wavelengths of the spectral colors red and **blue** are mixed together and reflected by an object. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   TRY IT! Choose colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. For example, you might choose **blue** and orange. Make a picture that uses both colors. Don't they make an interesting contrast? That's because the colors are opposites. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What color does red and **blue** make when you add black or white? Adding black or white to a mixture of **blue** and red allows you to create many different types of purple. Tints of purple are created by mixing red, **blue**, and white. These tints will be lighter colors, like orchid. Shades of purple are made by mixing red, **blue**, and black. Shades will be darker and deeper colors, like indigo. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A moderate reddish-brown with some shades of **yellow**, sometimes called clay or terracotta red. Colors that work with brick red include cream, sage green, black, white, brown or beige, **blue**-gray, and other shades of red. Raspberry red: This pinkish-red tone resembles the berry color; raspberry red goes well with black, navy, shades of **blue**, gray, white, cream, metallics, and wood tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So **blue** and red are the dominant wavelengths that combine to create purple. This means that the shade of purple you’ll end up with totally depends on the red and **blue** colors you start out with. If you want a warmer shade of purple, use a warmer shade of red as your base. Warm reds have orange or **yellow** undertones. If you want a cooler purple, start with a cooler shade of **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Colors opposite each other on the color wheel are called complementary colors. For example, violet and **yellow** are complementary colors. So are red and green, and **blue** and orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thing is Blue, Red and Yellow is the same thing as Cyan, Magenta and Yellow. It is just less specific in what the exact hue needs to be. It is perfectly normal to call cyan **blue**, or magenta red. In fact in the past they were called that even by printers. Its just that we have become more specific as what the optimal color would be and what its name should be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The meaning of **blue** is widely affected depending on the exact shade and hue. In design, the exact shade of **blue** you select will have a huge impact on how your designs are perceived. Light **blue**s are often relaxed and calming. Bright **blue**s can be energizing and refreshing. Dark **blue**s, like navy, are excellent for corporate sites or designs where strength and reliability are important. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So what colors make purple? Purple is a combination of red light and **blue** light. An object that we perceive as purple has a makeup that causes it to absorb all wavelengths of light except those that fall around 700 nanometers and 475 nanometers in length. The object reflects those exact wavelengths mixed together, which gives the impression that the object is purple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to purple, adding in either white or black to a mixture of red and **blue** will adjust the value. If you’re going for a lighter purple, like periwinkle, add more white. If you want a darker purple, like deep violet, add more black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If we are talking about paint, then red plus **blue** definitely equals purple. However, it is another thing if we talk about the light spectrum, which follows the CMY Color Model. This model uses cyan, magenta and **yellow** as the primary colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In some countries, **yellow** has very different connotations. In Egypt, for example, **yellow** is for mourning. In Japan, it represents courage and in India it’s a color for merchants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red and green are an example of complementary colors. Look at the painting Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose by John Singer Sargent. The reddish-pink color of the flowers really stands out against the green background. Imagine if Sargent had painted all **yellow** or **blue** flowers instead. They would just blend in with the green (ho-hum). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Neutral colors consist of white, black, and tan. When you add white to red, it creates pink. This is a softer shade and it can be mixed with **yellow** to create softer shades of orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So, if cyan, magenta and **yellow** are the real deal primaries when it comes to tactile objects, why does just about everyone on the planet still think the honor belongs to red, **blue** and **yellow**? "Well, partly because they are incorrectly taught this from their first days at school," Westland says. "But also because it seems intuitive. It seems intuitive because people believe the following: 1) That it is possible to make all colours by mixing together three primaries, and 2) That the primaries are pure colours that cannot be made by mixing other colours." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Did you know your surroundings are fully capable of influencing your emotions and state of mind? Well, the main reason behind this is that the colors in those spaces are playing a crucial role. Color psychology is a study of how colors determine human behavior. There are four primary psychological colors – red, **blue**, **yellow** and green. Psychological properties of these basic colors are as follows: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Perhaps now is the best time to explain how additive and subtractive colors work. To explain it plainly, additive colors are those that produce white when combined. See the chart on the left above. These hues are red, green and **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue isn’t necessary for making orange. It is actually directly across from orange on the color wheel. Instead, what you will notice is that between the red and the **yellow** sections in a variety of orange colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A triad uses colors at the points of an equilateral triangle (three colors spaced equally on the color wheel). These are sometimes called balanced colors. An example of a triadic scheme could be red, **blue**, and **yellow**; green, orange, and purple, etc. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "It turns out that if we use three primaries, the best ones to use are cyan, magenta and **yellow**," Westland says. "Note that these are the primaries that have been identified by the large printing companies who will use CMY (and often black as well) in their commercial devices to make a large range of colors. The idea that the subtractive primaries are red, **yellow** and **blue** (RYB) is confusing and should not be taught. It would be wrong to think that cyan and magenta are just fancy names for **blue** and red." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When using paint colors… red and **blue** make purple. But does red and **blue** make another color? Here is a clue… it depends on what color theory we’re discussing. Let us explain… - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In Circus, Georges Seurat uses many different neutral colors. You can see a few glimpses of red, **blue**, and **yellow** in this painting. But the overall effect is of natural brown and gray colors, like those you might see in rocks or in sand, dirt, and clay. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mixing **blue** and red together makes purple. The amount of **blue** and red that you add to your mixture will determine the exact shade of purple you produce. More red will create a redder purple, and more **blue** will create a **blue**r purple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue is essentially soothing and stimulates clear thoughts. It relaxes our mind and calms our nerves. The positive aspects of **blue** are intelligence, trust, efficiency, serenity, and coolness. Its negative aspects are coldness, lack of emotion, unfriendliness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Orange, **yellow**-orange, and **yellow** are an example of analogous colors. They are blended nicely in Sunflowers, a painting by Vincent Van Gogh. How do you know that these colors are closely related? They share a color—each of them contains some **yellow**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To make a color darker (this is called a shade of the original color), add a small amount of black. If you add too much black, your color will be almost black. Another way to darken a color is to mix in some of the complementary color (the opposite color on a color wheel - see below). This produces a rich, dark color (richer than just adding black). Some pairs of complementary colors are: **blue**/orange, green/red, **yellow**/purple, black/white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So what two colors make purple in subtractive mixing? Red and **blue**! Mixing red and **blue** paint or dye actually mixes different wavelengths of light. Red paint reflects one wavelength, and **blue** paint reflects another wavelength. When combined, the compounds in the mixture reflect the red and **blue** wavelengths back in a new way. That combo of reflected light is what we see as purple! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In your designs, bright **yellow** can lend a sense of happiness and cheerfulness. Softer **yellow**s are commonly used as a gender–neutral color for babies (rather than **blue** or pink) and young children. Light **yellow**s also give a more calm feeling of happiness than bright **yellow**s. Dark **yellow**s and gold–hued **yellow**s can sometimes look antique and be used in designs where a sense of permanence is desired. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **yellow** color is associated with joy, optimism, confidence, self-esteem, emotional strength, friendliness, creativity, and energy. When overused, **yellow** can have a disturbing effect. Although, like the other colors it reflects some negative emotions too. Some of them are irrationality, fear, emotional fragility, depression, and anxiety. Did you know that babies tend to cry more in **yellow** rooms? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Burgundy is a deep reddish-brown shade called wine red. Colors that go well with burgundy red include white, black, gray, purple, navy, turquoise, forest green, pink, gold, beige, and **yellow**. Brick red: A moderate reddish-brown with some shades of **yellow**, sometimes called clay or terracotta red. Colors that work with brick red include cream, sage green, black, white, brown or beige, **blue**-gray, and other shades of red. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black is the special case in which all of the colors are absorbed. Black is made by combining **yellow** with **blue**, cyan with red or magenta with green. These combinations make all colors be absorbed and as a result we see black. On the above principle lies the manufacture and use of filters in photography, movies etc. These filters are made in order to absorb or to reflect part or whole light components apart from the desired one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So what two colors make purple through additive mixing? In additive mixing, you can make purple by combining the wavelengths of **blue** light and red light in different proportions. Depending on the combination, you can get a pale purple like lavender...or a bold, dark purple like merlot! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The color orange is made from mixing red and **yellow** together. Orange is a secondary color, which means that it is made by mixing two primary colors together. The three primary colors are red, **blue** and **yellow**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's shocking, but true: The names we've been using for our primary colors when it comes to coloring books and paint chips? Totally wrong. "The subtractive primaries are really cyan, magenta, and **yellow**," Fairchild says. "The names '**blue**' for the 'cyan' and 'red' for the 'magenta' are typically misnomers. Other colors can be used as primaries, but they will not produce as wide a range of color mixtures." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You also teach this to children this way because they don't need to be introduced with exact names for the colors. Because names Red and Blue match the name of the color ranges better. I mean we could decide to start call all **blue** colors cyans but we dont. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   TRY IT! Choose a primary color and a secondary color. For example, you might choose **blue** and green. Don't they look nice together? That's because they are analogous. With just these two colors, you can create even more analogous colors—**blue**-green, green-**blue**, and others in-between. All of these will have a color in common: **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yellow is often considered the brightest and most energizing of the warm colors. It’s associated with happiness and sunshine. Yellow can also be associated with deceit and cowardice, though (calling someone **yellow** is calling them a coward). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Describes the deep red color of cherries; it can also be called blood red or tomato red. Cherry red combines well with azure **blue**, gray, pale orange, tan, and pale **yellow**. Burgundy red: Burgundy is a deep reddish-brown shade called wine red. Colors that go well with burgundy red include white, black, gray, purple, navy, turquoise, forest green, pink, gold, beige, and **yellow**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, look back at the time you buy printer ink. These stores sell cartridges labeled RGB and CYM. You might have even been confused because red, green and **blue** are the not primary colors you were taught in school. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this painting by Georgia O'Keeffe, White Barn, the cool **blue** of the background contributes to the quiet feeling. The simple shapes and stillness of the barn give this painting a restful look, and the **blue** makes it feel even more peaceful. Imagine how different the painting would look with a bright red sky—it might seem more exciting than restful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A color wheel shows how colors are related. On a color wheel, each secondary color is between the primary colors that are used to make it. Orange is between red and **yellow** because orange is made by mixing red with **yellow**. What goes between secondary colors and primary colors? Intermediate, or tertiary, colors are made by mixing a primary color with a secondary color that is next to it. Red-orange, **yellow**-orange and **yellow**-green are some intermediate colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue and red are essential to creating purple, but you can mix in other colors to create different shades of purple. Adding white, **yellow**, or gray to your mixture of **blue** and red will give you a lighter purple. Incorporating black into your **blue** and red mixture will give you a darker shade of purple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Orange is a complementary color to **blue**. This means they shouldn’t be mixed together but they do work well together. When orange and **blue** are used together for decorating purposes, they make help each other pop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In general, purple refers to any color with a hue that is between red and **blue**. But getting the perfect shade of purple is a little more complicated than simply mixing these two colors. This is where the science of color comes in! Understanding the science behind making purple will help you make purple all on your own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first step is to create a color wheel with the hue distribution that we require, with red, **yellow**, and **blue** at 120 degree increments. There are many examples on the web. I've created one here that only has fully saturated colors so that it can be used to generate the full RGB gamut. The colors on the wheel are completely arbitrary; I've set Orange (60°) to (255,160,0) because the midpoint between Red and Yellow was too red, and I've moved pure Blue (0,0,255) to 250° instead of 240° so that the 240° Blue would look better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue is often associated with sadness in the English language. Blue is also used extensively to represent calmness and responsibility. Light **blue**s can be refreshing and friendly. Dark **blue**s are more strong and reliable. Blue is also associated with peace and has spiritual and religious connotations in many cultures and traditions (for example, the Virgin Mary is generally depicted wearing **blue** robes). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
