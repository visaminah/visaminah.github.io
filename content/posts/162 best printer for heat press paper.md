-   Printers that use less power, i.e. the Workforce WF-7210 Wireless Inkjet Printer which uses up to 80% less power than any regular **printer**; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   We recommend pigment inks for best washability but you can use dye-based, sublimation or pigment inks.

Leave the printed image to dry for 10-20 minutes before cutting or pressing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   As with any desktop publishing project, consider the color of the item you are pressing onto when selecting colors for your designs.

It’s a good idea to test your design on “scratch fabric” before applying it to your final t-shirt or another garment. Some fabrics may require more heat and pressure than others and may not show off your design as well as you expected. Therefore, it is best to determine the best specifications for pressing before you press your final product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Inkjet heat transfer **paper**s transfer the whole sheet which can be either transparent (**paper**s for light fabrics) or completely opaque (**paper**s for dark/colored fabrics).

-   How does it work? First your sublimation **printer** imprints your graphic onto a sheet of special high-release ‘transfer’ **paper**. Then you use a heat press to transfer the dye design onto your substrate – your tee-shirt, mug or banner. The dye turns from solid to gas without forming a liquid (sublimation) and penetrates the substrate material leaving a print that won’t crack or wash out. It doesn’t work with natural fibers so well, but with a high polyester mix the results are vivid and permanent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
