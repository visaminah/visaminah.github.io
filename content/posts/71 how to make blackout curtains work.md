## 71 Shocking Facts About How To Make Blackout Curtains Work | Blackout Curtain Rods
-   O’Brien also noted that **curtains** with **blackout** lining are heavier than typical **curtains**, so investing in a good quality drapery rod is important. “Don’t buy the thinnest, least expensive rod — you don’t want it to sag or break,” she said, adding that shoppers should look for a rod that has a larger diameter of about 1 inch that can hold more fabric. And while there’s a price jump, both O’Brien and Brown recommended a traverse rod, which features a baton or string that you pull to open and close the **curtains** for additional ease. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is not the fabric itself that blocks out the light. There is a **blackout** liner that does all the hard work. So if you hide this **blackout** layer within the other layers of your **curtains**, you can choose whatever colour **curtains** you like. On the inside and the outside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want an eye-catching color-blocked look and excellent room darkening, IKEA’s Marjun Curtains are a solid choice. They’re the least expensive of our picks, and though they don’t provide 100 percent darkness, they come pretty close—they even block a bit more light than our favorite darkening **curtains**. The downside is they come in only gray, blue, or lilac and only in one length, making them the least versatile curtain we recommend. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The modern versions available are appealing and bright. For example, white is preferred by those who don’t want to have dark colors completely. But to achieve the **blackout** functionality, you must have a dark lining to get 100 percent light blocking protection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Sebastian Insulated Total Blackout Window Curtains are among the few **curtains** that completely blocked all light during our testing. They’re the best choice for people with extreme light sensitivity and for shift workers (or anyone else) who sleeps during the day and needs a pitch-black bedroom. They aren’t the prettiest of our picks—the fabric is very, very shiny—but they look better than the other total-**blackout** **curtains** we’ve found. We’ve tested them twice, and when installed properly they’ll keep a room cave-dark. Available in six colors and five lengths, these should work with most windows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No home is complete without the right kind of window coverings to complement the décor and to keep the interiors comfortable at all times irrespective of whether it is the summers or the winters.

The versatility gives you more flexibility to get the window dressings which are most apt for your requirements and provide the best value for the investment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Crate and Barrel Silvana Silk Blackout Curtains are the most beautiful **curtains** we recommend, but they block the least light. The fabric is higher quality and drapes better than the other **curtains** we tried, so they’re perfect for adding luxury (and some room darkening) to your home decor. This is our only pick made with natural fibers; the front is a blend of silk and linen, while the liner is 100 percent polyester. They look better and feel lighter than any other **blackout** **curtains** we’ve tried, but don’t expect them to create a totally dark room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lay **blackout** fabric on top of curtain panel with right side down so the right sides of both materials are together. Center the **blackout** fabric on the curtain panel.

-   We also suggest browsing our paint guide so that you can compare paint design ideas with the different fabrics we offer. The mood of your room can be vastly different depending on if your **blackout** **curtains** are open or drawn. Still, with the right set of **curtains** and room design, you’ll have a room that looks elegant in both scenarios. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because **blackout** **curtains** are made from a thicker material, you might assume that they require a different approach than an average curtain for styling.

-   Something to make note of is if you want sheer **curtains** covering your windows. Sheer **curtains** are popular because they still let in some light. That filtered, dappled light gives a special quality to any room. However, if you also want a **blackout** curtain over this window, you will have to install the **blackout** lining as a separate entity on the curtain rod. Perhaps even on it’s own rod or track. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The outer (closest to the window) layer of the curtain is in fact a certain type of **blackout** fabric. This fabric is designed to be heavy and impenetrable by light. It’s a simple liner that is made out of a number of different materials, depending on your preference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, they are installed in the same way. When designing your ordinary **curtains**, the way you take the measurements would be the same with the **blackout** ones. If you are not sure how to do it, you can always request your designer to help (if you have one of those), or simply follow the instructions that came with your **blackout** **curtains**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What do you do if you find the perfect **curtains**, but they're so thin and sheer that the sun shines right through? In the light of day, this could put a glare on the TV, cause the inside temperature to rise, or ruin a midday nap. What you need is **blackout** curtain lining. This heavy-duty liner is hidden behind the pretty curtain but works hard to block sunlight from shining through. Save money by making your own following our step-by-step instructions below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Daylight saving time is almost here — this year falling on Sunday, Nov. 6 — which means we'll gain an hour of sleep and, in the process, get sunlight earlier in the morning and lose some in the evening. If the time change means the sun is up before you are, **blackout**s **curtains** can be a worthwhile investment: Experts told us they look like typical **curtains** but feature a **blackout** lining that stops light from filtering into your room. They can also help regulate how well you sleep overall — studies have found that shifts in exposure to light before you rise can reduce your quality of sleep, disrupt circadian rhythm (the internal process that regulates sleep) and make you feel fatigued much earlier in the day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Make sure the **curtains** are wider and longer than what you want your finished **curtains** to be. There needs to be room for seam allowances on the sides and enough fabric to fold the top down to create a casing and hem the bottom. Your curtain fabric needs to be wider (ideally 4 inches, but you can make do with a little less) than your **blackout** lining. If your **blackout** lining is too wide, just cut it down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rookie Tip: As you hang the rod, make sure you wash both your liners and your **curtains** in the wash. They will all shrink quite a bit. You can then iron them all, which is a huge pain…but is a must if you want to get them looking good. This step took a lot of time but was worth it in the end. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Having **blackout** **curtains** in the bedroom provides a soothing effect that brings out a good atmosphere for falling asleep. With neutral colors painted on the wall, the **curtains** pop out nicely and create a beautiful contrast. During winter seasons, the bedroom becomes warmer, and in summer, they become cooler, making it ideal for giving you a peaceful night’s sleep. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In essence, the lights from our bedrooms come from the outside. Maybe you live in a place where street lights are installed, and the light reflects straight to your bedroom.

-   I absolutely looooove the natural light that streams into this room. It’s fabulous and illuminates the entire space. But when you want a little extra shut-eye on the weekends…it’s not exactly easy to snooze past sunrise with light in your face. So I knew I needed **curtains**, and they’d have to be **blackout** **curtains**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   White or any other light-colored fabric does not absorb the heat falling on its surface and reflects most of it back. This is the reason why white window coverings are preferable for heat control especially during the summers. The higher opacity and the ability to reflect the heat, make the **blackout** **curtains** an ideal choice for preventing heat gain during the summers and heat loss during the winters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Susan Peters, owner and interior designer for 9108 Designs, emphasized PBteen’s combination of quality and design details. “Don't let the ‘teen’ part fool you — this curtain is appropriate for all ages,” she added. “Pottery Barn across the board makes some amazing **blackout** **curtains**.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

This is good news for those of you who are worried about your **blackout** **curtains** clashing with the style of your bedroom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So, if you don’t want to throw away your other **curtains**, you can install **blackout** curtain linings. You can choose to hang them separately by attaching them to your ordinary curtain. Whichever way you choose the latter works perfectly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blackout **curtains**, due to their effective heat insulation capability, also help reduce your energy bills by enhancing the efficiency of your air conditioner and thermostat.

As a result, energy bills get reduced significantly. Lower energy bills mean more savings. Thus, in the long run, **blackout** **curtains** provide an even better value for your investment in window treatments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're looking at a specific curtain that’s not offered as a **blackout** option, or if you simply want to keep the **curtains** you already have in your home, placing a **blackout** curtain liner under your regular curtain can be an effective (and often more economical) way to get the **blackout** effect, according to Peters. “You can buy any **curtains** that fit your style and pair them with a **blackout** curtain or **blackout** curtain liner,” she said.

The curtain is offered individually or in a set of two and you can purchase separate ring clips for ease of use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blackout **curtains** are mostly white in color and seldom black due to the thermal advantage that the white window coverings offer.

-   “Using draperies with rings is much more user-friendly, and if you want **blackout**-lined drapes, you will likely open and close them every day,” said O’Brien. She added that rings tend to glide along a rod easily, while rod pockets and grommets are “clunky, more difficult to open and close and don’t look as pretty and polished.” Ultimately, though, this decision comes down to personal preference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

There are also built-in **blackout** liners made to completely block out light, which is accomplished through “a coating that’s applied to the fabric [that] blocks the little pores in the weave,” said Brown. “This material is thick and offers thermal insulation benefits, blocks out noise and creates ultimate privacy.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

If this is the case, 90 to 95% **blackout** **curtains** will do best. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

The last thing you want is for your **blackout** **curtains** to match your decor but fail at actually blocking out light. Let’s go a little deeper into how **blackout** **curtains** work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

These layers work to stop both natural and artificial light from passing through your windows, creating a **blackout** effect in your home. Controlling light intake and outtake helps you regulate your sleep schedule. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Curtains hold a special place in any consideration regarding window coverings. Curtains are convenient to install, easily replaceable, available in multiple colors, designs, and fabric options. This makes them one of the most versatile and widely used window treatment options. Whether you prefer, sheers, room-darkening, or **blackout** fabrics, **curtains** offer you all such choices in different price points to suit your budget. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No matter what style you choose, you should always read the fine print before making your final purchase to avoid potential disappointment. “Be sure that you see the word ‘**blackout**’ in the description as opposed to ‘room darkening’ or ‘light filtering,’” said Peters. “These other two options may not block as much of the light from your room.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . Because there’s a thick liner attached to **blackout** drapery, O’Brien said they can help keep your room a little warmer by limiting the cold air seeping through the window (it’s even more effective if you choose a ). And by blocking direct sunlight, they can also make the room a little cooler during the warmer months. Protect furniture and decor from fading.

Reducing the light gaps to the smallest they can be, shades are superior when it comes to getting intense darkness.You can also enjoy every convenience of modern innovations–like top down bottom up operation and motorization. Blackout shades really are a dream, and they’re sure to help you drift off to dreamland every night! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Well, the ‘**blackout**’ part of the **blackout** curtain has nothing to do with the colour of the fabric. Blackout **curtains** are, in fact, two or more layers of fabric. The multiple layers of the **curtains** contributes to the efficacy of the **blackout** curtain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Additionally, babies and children tend to sleep in segments that don’t necessarily line up with the solar cycle and are easily disturbed by light and noise. That’s why we recommend **blackout** **curtains** for the areas in your home where your baby sleeps. The obstruction of light — be it sunlight or artificial light — and noise can help our precious little ones fall asleep and stay asleep. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whatever the case, **blackout** **curtains** can be the answer to these problems. But blocking out light is not the only thing that black out **curtains** do. Blackout **curtains** can also insulate your room more effectively. Since your windows are the main source of heat gain or loss in a home, having thick, heavy **curtains** covering this glass can help keep the temperature of your room more stable. And in doing so even help keep your energy bill lower. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many **blackout** **curtains** come in different colors and patterns. Knowing ahead of time what you’re looking for will help you find the right **curtains** for you faster. And it can be helpful to keep in mind that some lighter-colored **curtains** that are advertised as "**blackout**" aren't as effective at filtering out light as darker-colored ones. Figure out what type you want in advance. Do you prefer traditional **curtains**, shades or blinds? That will help narrow down your search. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, this next step may sound legit crazy to you, but I’m just sharing the way I did these **curtains** as a can’t-even-sew-on-a-button kinda gal. Attaching the liner to the curtain, and hemming the bottom is probably a super simple sewing job. But instead, I decided to use hemming tape. It took a bit of time & patience, but I didn’t have to struggle through the potentially painful project of pricking myself with a needle as I tried to sew this all together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are plenty of reasons to start using **blackout** **curtains**. As we mentioned, blocking out light in a room on-demand can dramatically increase your quality of light. For most people, light filtering for a restful sleep is the primary motivation for **blackout** **curtains** in the home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
