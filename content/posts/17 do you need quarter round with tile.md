## 17 Tips to Do You Need Quarter Round With Tile | What Can I Use Instead Of Quarter Round?
-   Either way, there will be a slight expansion gap. Installing quarter **round** molding or shoe molding makes a gracefully smooth flooring transition from the vertical baseboard to the horizontal floor covering any gaps. They add a **round**ed shape and dimension to the transition. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are looking for a premium Quarter Round Easiklip offers 3/4-inch quarter **round** molding made from solid oak. It comes in five colors, complimenting their solid oak flooring. These moldings come in 96-inch lengths and will match almost any existing wood or laminate flooring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   David is has written and made videos about flooring products and installation since 2011 at Floors To Your Home (.com), where he is also the PPC Manager, a Researcher, a Website & Marketing Strategy Team member, Videographer, Social Strategist, Photographer and all a**round** Resource Jito.

David Lichty - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pro Tip #1 - Make sure the blade rests on the outside edge of the pencil mark to prevent short cuts. You want to see the mark after you cut. Pro-Tip #2 - Always cut the end of a piece of quarter-**round** yourself before placing it. Don’t rely on the lumberyard to make a straight cut. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To hand-nail molding, drive each nail almost flush with the quarter **round**, then use the nail set to sink the head beneath the surface. Use putty to cover the nail holes. Be sure to use a paintable putty if you plan to paint later. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Place the trim piece on the miter box or saw base, so the blade just touches the pencil mark. Make your first cut, then reverse the saw to cut 45-degrees for the other end of the trim. For a miter box, turn the molding a**round** to cut an opposite 45-degree angle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Installing quarter **round** on baseboards with caulk is not a good idea because it can be difficult to remove should you need to repair the floor in the future. It is not the right choice because it won’t create a strong enough bond like glue will. Use caulk only for what it was designed for: to fill gaps if necessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another type of molding is shoe molding. It’s typically flatter and taller than a quarter **round**. The main differences between the two are: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you begin measuring and cutting, you must check the correct angle of every corner. Most wall corners are not a perfect 90-degree angle. They can be off by a degree or more, causing an unsightly gap where the quarter **round** ends meet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These include a miter saw to cut the shoe molding, a coping saw to create inside corners, and a finish nailer (or pinner) to attach the molding. Because shoe molding is small and easy to damage, this is one case where a finish nailer or pinner is preferable to a hammer and nails. Start in a corner and work your way a**round** the room in one direction. This makes it simpler to cut the coping joints you’ll need for the inside corners. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 2 - Apply a thin bead of liquid floor adhesive to the sanded side of the quarter-**round** molding. Line up the molding against the baseboard and press it against the wood. You can use another board to apply even pressure if you don’t have an extra set of hands. Press the quarter **round** in place for at least a minute to create a tight bond. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you do not want to rent or own a miter saw, you can buy a useful tool called quarter **round** scissors. It safely and cleanly cuts the quarter **round** and costs from $15 to $50, about the same price as a miter box and handsaw set. Plus, you can store them inside a toolbox if space is an issue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Installing quarter-**round** molding is an inexpensive upgrade that makes any baseboard look better. Molding adds visual character and detail to transitions that are generally dull and unobtrusive. Like a bow tie on a tux, it provides a stylish, finished look to any room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Quarter-**round** molding, as the name implies, is one-quarter of a long section of a **round** wood doweling or rod. The cross-section is a 90-degree arc. Sometimes the baseboard is too thin to cover the expansion gap between the floor and the wall, which can be as wide as 5/8-inches (15mm). Other times, the baseboard may leave gaps. Installing quarter **round** trim on baseboards covers gaps for a smooth, **round**ed finish to the baseboard and floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Easiklip offers 3/4-inch quarter **round** molding made from solid oak. It comes in five colors, complimenting their solid oak flooring. These moldings come in 96-inch lengths and will match almost any existing wood or laminate flooring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes, the quarter **round** ends without making a turn. Use a return or end cap. It’s a small piece of molding that superbly finishes the end. Adding a return piece is not mandatory, but it makes a professional-looking finishing touch that hides the molding’s exposed end grain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’ve been looking at baseboard finishing trim, you’ve probably discovered quarter-**round**, too. As the name implies, this type of molding is one-quarter of a **round** dowel (split a dowel down the middle, then further split the halves, and you’ll have quarter-**round**). While quarter-**round** can be installed along the bottom of baseboard, trim carpenters and homeowners tend to prefer the sleeker look of shoe molding, which is taller and narrower than its curved counterpart. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
