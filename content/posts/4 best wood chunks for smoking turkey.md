## 4 Facts Best Wood Chunks For Smoking Turkey | Best Smoke Flavor For Turkey
-   A good way to tell when your **turkey** has been smoked for the correct amount of time is by using a meat thermometer. If you do not have a meat thermometer, then you can check the **turkey** by inserting a skewer or knife into the thickest part of the bird. If it goes in quite easily and there is no resistance, then the bird is ready to come out of the smoker. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best way to reheat a **turkey** is slowly. The meat needs to be heated gradually, otherwise you risk drying out the meat or even burning it. When reheating a smoked **turkey**, make sure that you use low heat to give the meat time to cook. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best way to store your smoked **turkey** is in an airtight container. It can be kept for up to 7 days, but will soon lose its smoky flavor. If you want to keep the **turkey** for longer, wrap it in foil and then store it in a freezer bag. This will help preserve the smoked flavor much better than in an airtight container. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Smoking a **turkey** with the right wood can be hit or miss since everyone likes the flavor of food differently. You may find that when you smoke a **turkey** with certain woods, it might taste bitter or burnt in some parts of your bird. However, there is a way to make sure that you have the best-smoked **turkey** for your Thanksgiving! When smoking **turkey**, elderberry, apple, and cherry woods is a good start. These fruits produce a milder smoke flavor so make sure you use lighter grilling temperatures when cooking your bird with these types of wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
