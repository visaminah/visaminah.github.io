## 18 Tips for Best Mechanical Pencil For Students Reddit | Looking for great pencils for school
-   There are a lot guides and top lists of **mechanical** **pencil**s on the internet written by people not any more knowledgeable than newcomers - you won't find those here. The following links will give newcomers a rough overview of the hobby. Best way for you to learn more is to combine these guides with all the knowledge that you can read and see on r/**mechanical****pencil**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Kerry Sharp 0.5mm: Where to begin, this is a fan favorite and I understand why, it is perfectly balanced it has a sleek design(I would be a millionaire if I got a dollar for every person thinking it's a pen). The mechanism is very nice and the **pencil** it's relatively cheap compared to others. This is the **pencil** I have carried for 2 years throughout classes and it is probably my favorite. An overall good **pencil** and well worth the money. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When Uni introduced the Kuru Toga , it was a revolution—literally. With a conventional **mechanical** **pencil**, the tip of the lead gets worn down into a broad wedge shape as you write, making your writing look uneven. The Kuru Toga solves this problem with its built-in ratchet mechanism that rotates the lead slightly every time you lift the lead off the page. This causes the lead to be worn down into a sharp, consistent conical point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I've been looking to buy a new **mechanical** **pencil** recently. I have been looking at the rOtring 600 and 800, but many reviews say that they are small and not suitable for people with large hands, which I have. Do you guys have any recommendations for **mechanical** **pencil**s which would be good for people with larger than normal hands? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   KURU TOGA 0.7mm: The **pencil** that started it all, I found one of these on the ground in high school, and then the **mechanical** **pencil** obsession started. This **pencil** is very light the mechanism is very interesting and like it's designed for it does keep the lead at a point. I have had some issues with lead getting stuck in the point but overall a good **pencil**. Overall a good **pencil** and an interesting mechanism, worth the price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I can't believe there is a subreddit for **pencil**s.. But moving straight into it. I am looking for a couple wooden **pencil**s and one good **mechanical** **pencil** for school next fall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I mostly use my **pencil**s and pens for long form writing (essays and academic papers) and annotating books, and it seems like many **mechanical** **pencil**s featured in this sub are meant for drafting. What are the features that make a **mechanical** **pencil** good for writing vs. drafting, and what are the best nice **mechanical** **pencil**s for writing? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Kuru Toga Roulette takes this auto lead rotation mechanism and puts it into a luxuriously sleek, high-quality body. It features a metal grip section that’s comfortable to hold and gives the Roulette a low center of gravity—a characteristic that makes the **pencil** feel more nimble and easy to control in the hand. Three rows of gentle knurling on the grip provide extra purchase for your fingers as well as added visual appeal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rotring 600 0.5mm: This **pencil** is almost perfect, It is heavy and well balanced the machining is top-notch and the internal mechanism works wonderfully it feels premium. While it does have these advantages I now only use this **pencil** for drafting and drawing as the weight gets fatiguing on the hand after about 40 minutes of writing. Overall amazing **pencil** and worth the money. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My dad is an engineer and does a lot of sketches of **mechanical** drawings when he's working something out. His birthday is coming up and I want to get him something he can use. Right now he just has some flimsy plastic thing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I'm a student who's about to join high school who is also into drawing. So please recommend me a **pencil** that is good for both things. Writing and Drawing. And please make sure I can buy it online in stores like amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I've been using gel roll pens for the past couple of months for my note-taking and daily tasks. I use to use the Pental 0.5 HB and it was just ok. I used a bic **mechanical** **pencil** for it, but I'm not sure if the **pencil** makes a difference. I wanted to get a darker and smoother lead to use instead, - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This discussion appears very regularly. If you are wondering if you are the only one to use the eraser in your **pencil**: No you are not the only one. If you are wondering if you are the only one who never uses the eraser in your **pencil**s: No you are not the only one. The basic answer is: you are not alone. The only right way to do this is to do it the way that makes you the happiest. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Title says all. I am looking for a sub $30 **pencil** that will hopefully last me until I finish off University. I know nothing about **pencil**s, I've read the posts here and I just have no idea what to buy - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I wonder what everyone thinks about the best **pencil**. Best can mean many things such as build quality or features or writing experience. For me I like the Rotring 800, Spoke 4, and Staedlter All Black. I am curious to here what your picks are. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Well, when it finally broke, I decided to invest in a little more expensive **pencil** and got a Rotring 0.5mm ( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AZWYUA4/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_DGrvzbD98J6YA ). Sadly the **pencil** hasn't even lasted 3 months and the eraser holder has completely caved in and the barrel is totally bent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are only two things that kept the Roulette from sharing the top spot with the Pentel Sharp Kerry. First, the fixed lead sleeve makes it less portable and pocket-friendly than it would be if it had a retractable lead sleeve. Second, the Kuru Toga mechanism can cause a slightly squishy feeling when you press the lead down on the paper and the tip retracts a fraction of a millimeter. It's a very minor sensation and we stopped noticing it almost immediately. But if you are especially sensitive to **pencil**s with a little give in the tip, the Kuru Toga may not be the best choice for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Zebra M-301 0.5mm: These are my old school **pencil**, while cheaper compared to other **pencil**s the steel design looks very nice and it is light and comfortable in the hand. I have used these **pencil**s almost exclusively through grade school and I carry 3 in my backpack at all times. Overall ok **pencil**, if im being honest I usually give these ones out to classmates if they need a **pencil** knowing I will never get it back. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
