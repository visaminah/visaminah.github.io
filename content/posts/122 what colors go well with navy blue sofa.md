## 122 Things You Should Know About What Colors Go Well With Navy Blue Sofa | Paint Colors For Living Room With Blue Furniture
-   Last on the list is a gentle and unique color for those who like pink but would prefer something a little closer to being neutral. Dusty rose pairs well will “dusty” **blue**s. Ash **blue** walls with gray furniture and a dusty rose rug can add some character to a mostly-neutral room without disrupting the color scheme too much. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A solid **blue** sofa can look dreary and raw when left unadorned. Floor rugs are a great option to transform the aesthetics of the space while choosing to leave the sofa bare of layer it. A Moroccan rug with geometric patterns is one of the most common ways of decorating around a navy **blue** sofa that gives a feel of completeness to the space. There are other elegant patterns you may choose from to give some warmth to the area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While this isn’t wrong; the list is definitely limited. Let me put your mind at ease. Navy pairs well with vibrant **colors**, spices up black and white tones, and plays nicely with other neutrals. In the fall I love pairing navy with modern beige tones, such as tan and taupe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here you can actually see a dark and very rich shade of **blue** framed by white surfaces but the detail that stands out is actually the vanity. It has a gorgeous mahogany color with a reddish hue and that complements the **blue** in the sense that they’re both dark color but have different bases altogether. {image from blackknightgroup}. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We mentioned that soft orange looks great with **blue**. But if you want an unusual and cheerful look for the room you’re designing, tangerine and **blue** make a great pairing. If you want to temper tangerine’s energy, use dark navy **blue**. An orange accent wall plus a navy and white striped rug is a great example. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Well, if you need to match your new rug perfectly with your space, be keen to study the **colors**, light, and patterns in your space. When it comes to selecting rugs for your living room, where many people and your guests first visit and are impressed, the procedure is complicated. If you were looking for an answer to Should a rug be lighter or darker than couch? It may be better if you proceed forward through the article. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While I definitely understand how fear can set in when you’re considering a new sofa for your home, I want to encourage you to make purchases that are unique and true to your style. While yes, navy is a unique color option when it comes to sofas, it is also a fabulous choice and one that you should consider. You can make the room bold and colorful or let the navy sofa set the tone while it accentuates the neutral **colors** you pair with it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re creating a room with high-energy, beachy feel, this combination is a great choice. And if you like patterns, you can often find coral and light **blue** blankets, rugs, or shower curtains. If you find this combination to be a little too high-energy, you can create a room with a mostly navy and white palette and include some coral and light **blue** accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But let’s talk a little about **blue** and its varieties. We know that everyone sees colours differently. For some this colour is strict and boring, while for others it is relaxing and soothing. The good news is that the power with which it will impress you will be memorable. If you are looking for the dream interior for your living room, the first thing you need to do is determine the style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you can’t quite make up your mind between gray and brown, taupe is a great color choice. And as a bonus, many modern homes and apartments use taupe-stained wood for flooring, tabletops, etc. This great neutral base goes well with **blue** and white wallpaper. Or if you have a kitchen with taupe wood floors, navy **blue** cabinets are a great way to add a bit of **blue**. This combination looks great when juxtaposed with white countertops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want a rustic, Southwest-inspired aesthetic, try a palette of warm terra-cotta and cool **blue**. Some designers recommend pairing dusk **blue**, a pale near-neutral **blue**, with terra cotta. But almost any shade of **blue** will do! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lights can magically transform any space to make it look bigger and brighter. The addition of symmetric floor or table lamps on either sides of a navy **blue** couch can elevate the overall look of the area. You can also create interest by opting for a single signature pendant or floor lamp that occupies the awkward corner next to the couch. Select lights that complement the overall design style and theme for pleasing aesthetics. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For another traditional and cozy look try adding a chocolatey brown to your **blue**s. It’s an easy way to dress up or dress down a room that’s needs a sprucing in the family home.{found on georgettewestermaninteriors}. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, a light **blue** isn’t the only wall color you can choose besides white. You can pick green, pink, or yellow, depending on the shade of your couch and the tint of the wall paint. Whatever color you choose, you can build the rest of your living room’s color scheme around it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pastel yellow is a beautifully light, springlike touch in any room. It’s the color of baby chicks and daffodil petals. It makes a great color for a breakfast nook or sunroom, and it’s a nice lightening touch in a room with navy furniture. For a dining room, try pastel yellow walls with a **blue** table runner. Just about any **blue** shade will look nice here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cushions are the perfect (perhaps easiest) way to accessorise a **blue** sofa. From plush velvet to bold prints, a throw cushion can inject an instant boost of colour, comfort and style into your living room. Opt for contrasting colours for a bold statement or try a more subtle look by choosing a cushion of the same shade as your sofa with bright coloured piping. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a lighter look, even a few lavender accents will add some character to a soft **blue** room. Start with a lavender-patterned accent pillow or two and then add more lavender accents if needed. One good example is adding soft, sheer lavender curtains to a room with gray walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Navy **blue** is a wonderful choice for a sofa color and decorating around a navy **blue** sofa can be a challenge to style your own space.. The hue can be treated in a variety of ways to create a somber and intimate or bright and happy environment. Navy **blue** is likewise a dark hue that requires little maintenance. Because the color is so flexible, it will complement almost any interior design style and color scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Throw pillows and cushions are great accessories to a sofa and make it more warm and inviting. Contrasting **colors** such as yellow, orange or neutrals can make it look vibrant and attractive. Bring in Hygge by adding a fur throw or blank for a layered look. Experiment with textures for a rather eclectic look to create a Bohemian decor style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some people might consider turquoise to be a shade of **blue**, but many actual turquoise stones are closer to being green. Either way, this shade is one that can be combined with **blue** for a memorable look. If you like patterned wallpaper, a turquoise and white accent wall can be a great way to add some character to a room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re going for a calming and classic palette, a combination of **blue** and chocolate brown just might be the answer. Try a **blue** and white patterned rug in a room with chocolate brown leather furniture. This look creates a balanced color scheme: the dark brown is a grounding influence, while the lightness of white prevents the overall aesthetic from appearing overly dark. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for a dignified yet non-traditional combination with **blue**, violet is a great color to choose. And one of the best ways to use this combination is to incorporate a variety of shades ranging from **blue** to **blue**-violet. One example is a living room with shades from sky **blue** to navy **blue** to deep purple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gold makes an especially bold statement against a deep **blue** somewhere between royal **blue** and navy. For best results, use this combination sparingly. A gold accent on an otherwise-bare **blue** wall creates a memorable focal point in any room! But if you want to be subtle, simply add gold hardware on a **blue** dresser or end table. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sky **blue** has a bit of a faded look, as if it’s mixed with a bit of gray. It’s also light but not bright and generally very pleasing to the eyes. It’s a perfect color for a space like the bedroom or the bathroom if you want it to feel calming and relaxing but still look interesting at the same time. Play around with a few other shades of **blue** for variation or add some gray and white details for contrast. {found on battalionroofing}. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **blue** you choose is up to you. Since burnt orange is a lot more muted than bright shades of **blue**, brighter **blue**s are an option here. Navy or slate **blue**s are also a way to use this combination while still maintaining a relatively calm atmosphere. Burnt orange walls and dark **blue** appliances can create the perfect balance of creative energy and grounded calm in a kitchen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Well. According to the rug under couch rules, exactly not. However, to tie the room’s look together, you will want to choose a rug that complements the two or three primary **colors** of the room. Make sure a solid-color rug complements the color of your sofa and matches the accent **colors** in the room, like a work of art or pot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a striking contrast, pair midnight-**blue** walls with pieces of terra-cotta pottery placed throughout the room. This look goes well with cool white trim and some greenery. Or for a homey feel, opt for terra-cotta walls with soft **blue** rugs or furniture. Luckily, both of these shades can be found in abundance in the furniture world, so you’ll have plenty of opportunities to experiment with this exciting combo. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light wooden shades, be it on the floor or furnishings, look warm and have a unique appeal. For instance, in this spacious and bright bedroom, a light-hued wood-finish floor with its chevron pattern makes for a stylish statement. And as it is paired with a rich navy-**blue** wall cladding, the room looks interesting and full of personality. Don’t miss how the drapes complement the floor and the pendant lamps jazz up the wall cladding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cardinal red can also be used in small doses to balance out a mostly dark room. If you have a kitchen with a good bit of navy (or really any shade of **blue**), even a red teakettle and a couple of other red appliances can add some brightness. This combination also lends itself to patterns. Try a **blue** and white rug and a few largely-red wall hangings in a largely-white room to add a dynamic burst of color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking for a way to revitalize a living room, a **blue** and soft orange color scheme is a great way to do so. And just like most color combinations on the list, you can create a variety of moods with this one depending on the exact shades you use. For an airy, coastal feel, combine sherbet orange with pastel **blue**. Either one makes a great wall color, and you can even incorporate **blue** and orange patterned rugs or throws for some high-energy contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In a kitchen, try black tile flooring with a deep **blue** backsplash and white cabinets and countertops. Or for an old-school look in a moody room, you can even include black-and-**blue** patterned brocade curtains. You can also go subtle by combining a navy couch with cream-colored walls decorated with black-framed photos or art pieces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For instance, think about taking a black and white photo near your rug and bed. On a grayscale, you need to change the **colors** significantly. At the same time, if you choose a multi-color rug, you should match the secondary or tertiary **colors** to your bed or other large furniture or accessories. This allows for a small change while the items are still flowing together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When navy-**blue** colour meets beige, a lot can happen. You can paint your walls with a soft beige colour and add a comfy navy-**blue** sofa to lend contrast and visual interest. Don’t forget to decorate the sofa with patterned or bright yellow or orange throw pillows. Adding a golden colour lamp next to the sofa will be a classic move. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also mix and match navy **blue** with pastel **colors**. In addition to the pale pink you can use, navy **blue** is also a good match for greeny **blue**s, purples, and beige. This color scheme injects some color into the room, but it still keeps the room’s moody look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a great combination of cool **colors**, combine leafy green with **blue**. You can do this organically with houseplants. Plants look great in a largely-**blue** room of just about any shade! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re a fan of rich, jewel-tone shades, golden yellow is one that looks great with **blue**. The shade of **blue** you choose will make a dramatic difference in any room. Soft **blue**s can work almost like neutrals, so you could make a statement with golden-yellow furniture or a bedspread against a backdrop of soft **blue** walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you like beige but want something a touch more glitzy, champagne is an excellent choice. Champagne upholstered furniture adds an elegant touch to a mostly-**blue** palette. One nice yet subtle example is including champagne-framed mirrors or pictures in a room with **blue** and white patterned wallpaper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mustard is a strong color, so one option is to place a mustard yellow couch or chair in a room with soft **blue** walls. Alternatively, for a cool contrast, place the mustard couch in front of a deep **blue** accent wall. Couches aren’t your only option here, though. Even a simple mustard-yellow lampshade or two can add some subtle warm energy to a room with a lot of **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Emerald green is a beautiful, intense green with plenty of **blue** undertones. So of course, it goes well with a range of **blue** shades. For a bolder look, combine emerald green with jewel-tone **blue**s. Alternatively, navy **blue**’s near-neutral quality makes it a good choice if you want emerald to be the focal point of a room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No matter the theme or color your decide to accent it with, **blue** will always work. But that doesn’t mean you can’t go with the best options. Take a peek at 31 of the best **colors** to pair with **blue** and see if one strikes a fancy with you! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you like to create rooms with interesting or unusual features, rooms with dark **blue** walls can create a striking contrast with a pastel pink chair. Alternatively, pink and **blue** paisley wallpaper can help you create a beautifully unique accent wall. Pastel pink is also great to pair with both **blue** and sage green, as the combined cool influence of sage and **blue** can keep this airy shade of pink grounded. This article offers inspiration for designing with various pastel shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Seafoam green also looks great in a room with darker hues. Sheer seafoam curtains look striking against marine-**blue** walls. This color combination is one that also really lends itself to patterns. A seafoam and **blue** patterned rug looks especially nice in a largely-white room. You can even add hints of sand or beige for a truly seaside-inspired aesthetic! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Navy **blue** and dark **blue** nuances in general look particularly beautiful and elegant when they’re complemented by brass accents. You can see here a very stylish bathroom which takes advantage of this combination. The antique brass details are just what it needs to stand out. {found on hartandlock}. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sage green is quite a trendy color in design. Its grayish, almost silvery undertone means it’s a great option for pairing with cool **colors**. Sage looks great with **blue**, particularly almost-neutral shades like slate **blue** or navy. Sage is a great color for walls, accessories, pillows, and more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown is a great complement to navy **blue**, but it’s crucial to balance the two. Therefore, choosing lighter shades of brown when pairing it with navy **blue** is your best bet. Use lighter brown shades like caramel or tan instead of deeper ones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A glint of warm metal will highlight a rich, navy sofa, especially one with velvet upholstery. Since metals are considered neutral, they can be worked into any colour scheme and are perfect for decorating around a navy **blue** sofa. Gold, brass and copper may also feature in Art Deco side tables, an opulent chandelier, vases and cushions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As an interior designer, I know that convenience and comfort are leading in interior design. And since our focus is navy **blue** sofa, I will give you some valuable tips on how to combine it with the rest of the interior. And when we talk about the living room, the sofa is the main furniture that everyone dreams of. Find the perfect pieces like velvet sofas or leather sofas, for example, can be a difficult task. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As we’ve seen so far, **blue** almost always looks good with various shades of brown. And mahogany is a highly dignified shade of brown. The easiest way to integrate it with **blue** is to incorporate mahogany-stained wood furniture (or even darker-stained wood flooring). Most designers recommend using bolder **blue**s in this context, so navy, marine **blue**, or even slate **blue** are all great options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although orange and **blue** are contrasting colours, they work incredibly well together to bring a warm and vibrant lift to a room. One might consider pairing a navy sofa with a bold, tangerine footstool, or a scattering of orange cushions. However, it’s important to balance orange accents with other shades of **blue**, grey, black and white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When paired with black or other dark **colors**, navy **blue** and similar shades can look quite sophisticated. A décor like this stands out and has depth even though the **colors** are fairly similar in intensity. Add a few bright touches of color for effect if you want to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you prefer largely-neutral palettes, you can sprinkle in a few **blue** accents when you have a room with champagne furniture and walls. A couple of **blue** vases, bowls, and throw pillows are often enough. This is also a combination that works well in bathrooms: try soft **blue** walls (or tile floors) with champagne-colored hardware. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can find this color in many Persian-style rugs. Even something as simple as adding one of these rugs to a room with **blue** couches can do wonders. Or if you want something more subtle, go for an eclectic mix of cranberry red and **blue** vases and/or bowls in a largely neutral space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As mentioned before, **blue** goes really well with white because they balance each other out and create a very fresh and clean décor. Similarly, you can pair **blue** with light gray. The effect would be similar but the contrast would be a bit smoother and less striking from a visual standpoint. {found on langskitchens}. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black and **blue** might sound like a strange, bruise-like, and overly dark combination. But the key to success with these **colors** is to incorporate enough white to balance them out. A living room with navy **blue** walls, crisp white mantle and wall trim, and a black and white patterned couch or rug creates a unique yet balanced look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Navy **blue** is one of those **colors** that works nicely in just about any setting, whether it be a home office, library, bedroom, or bathroom. It is your best option to avoid using the common neutral **colors** in your room. However, to improve the overall appearance of your room, you must combine this rich color with other **colors** because it cannot be used on its own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pink and **blue** might evoke memories of baby showers. But when combined carefully, they can make a lovely palette in any room. Try cornflower-**blue** couches with a few pink vases, bowls, or accent pillows in a living room. A bedroom with soft **blue** walls can also look nice with a soft pink bedspread. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If **blue** is the main theme in your living room, try making your couch the lightest shade. A light **blue** couch will not only stand out, but it’ll also be a more inviting space amongst the darker tones. Blue living rooms are soothing places because **blue** tends to be a very calming color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A solid navy **blue** sofa may seem too bulky for a living space because of its darker shade. You can well balance it out with a clear glass coffee table with a sleek, slender bottom. It will make the area not only look elegant, but also add some glam to the space. Small glass or crystal decor elements complementing the coffee table can add to the overall look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also create this aesthetic using wooden floors and furniture. Wood with a dark, chocolate stain forms a beautiful pairing with any shade of **blue**. But to balance out the darkness, always make sure to include a lighter color like white or off-white to create balance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **blue** couch in your living room doesn’t have to be the object of focus. If you like the color but don’t want to make it into a statement, try a smaller-sized couch. Small **blue** couches can be just as expressive as large ones, without taking up too much attention. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It depends on the room and the atmosphere you’re going for. A **blue** couch can give a room a nautical or seaside feel, which can be great for a summer house or beach house. It can also be a beautiful accent color in a room with neutral walls and floors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Neutral **colors** like beige but also other variations such as ivory or various shades of grey are generally very versatile. They can be used as complementary **colors** for darker nuances like **blue** for instance. The beige here helps to tone down the dark **blue** walls and to make this living room seem brighter.{found on anniesantullidesigns}. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Beige and **blue** is a classic pairing, and this palette evokes the image of the seashore, especially when you mix in some white. And if you’d rather not track down hard-to-find furniture for your project, this combination is a great choice. Warm beige is a common color, especially for living room furniture. Try combining warm beige couches and chairs with sky **blue** and white pillows and rugs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A living room that is laid back with a neutral color palette, feel free to use your navy **blue** sofa as the highlight element that pops out catching attention. Opt for warm whites for decor styling in case you decide to go for such a design approach. Alternatively, you can also use wall trimming to frame large pieces of artwork, or use wallpaper to create a backdrop for your navy **blue** sofa. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also juxtapose these **colors** in small doses to add some color to a mostly-neutral room. Royal **blue** and tangerine pillows add just enough energy to a room with pale gray couches and chairs. Or if you’re a fan of patterns, try simply adding a tangerine and orange throw or blanket. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   White, when combined with navy-**blue**, renders a classic and clean look to any room. This colour combination is a sister of the black and white colour combination. The white colour gleams against its dark counterpart, which gives a room character. As you can see in the bathroom above, shades of white on the walls and sanitary wares have been paired with a navy-**blue** vanity counter for an interesting look. You can use the white and navy-**blue** colour combination on cabinets, closets and sofas too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sand walls make an ideal backdrop for **blue** furniture, and they look especially nice in rooms with marine **blue** and seafoam green. Or you can create a more dramatic look with marine **blue** walls and sand-colored couches. Don’t feel limited to paint and furniture when choosing sand-colored elements for a room, either. Jute rugs, pale wood flooring, wicker furniture, sprays of wheat, etc. are all great options to choose from. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is another great option for those who love jewel tones. And burnt orange is ideal for creating an autumn-inspired palette. Adding a little burnt orange is a great quick fix if you feel like a mostly-**blue** room has become too cold and unwelcoming. Throw pillows or wall hangings that are mostly burnt orange are easy and inexpensive options for evening out a room. If you want to capitalize on this autumnal aesthetic, add in some golden yellow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Marigold is a beautiful, unusual color that is roughly a combination of burnt orange and gold. Its classic look pairs well with colonial **blue**, especially when the **blue** is part of a pattern. Even a marigold lampshade looks beautiful against vintage-inspired, **blue**-and-white patterned curtains. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another color that complements **blue** sofas is pink. This color is known for being neutral and does not overpower the overall room. Pink accent chairs also work well with **blue** couches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You already know that green and **blue** make a good combination. But if you want to go extra-bold, forest green is a great way to make a statement. Forest green makes a surprisingly nice wall color, and you can limit it to an accent wall if you’re cautious about making a room too dark. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is something magical about the navy-**blue** colour. Its dramatic presence and classic look make it a favourite among interior designers. Its dark tones grab attention quickly and help radiant colours to pop. Which is why it is often used in modern interiors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you prefer a look of quiet elegance in a room, cool grays and various shades of **blue** go quite well with one another. For a living room, soft gray walls (or even just an accent wall) pair well with **blue** furniture. Or in a bedroom, try a cool gray bedspread with a few **blue** accent pillows or a **blue** rug. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Matching your armchairs with the sofa in the shades and tones of navy **blue** may seem to be rather dull and repetitive. Instead, use contrasts – juxtapose armchairs in contrasting **colors** for a more vibrant look. Alternatively, you may also choose printed fabrics for the upholstery to add more personality and dynamism to the seating area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even when used sparingly, these **colors** have the potential to really transform a room. But if you really want to commit, try lime-green drapes and furniture in a room with **blue** walls! Or you can create a softer aesthetic with **blue**-gray walls and a few muted lime wall hangings. If you want to be creative and try something off the beaten path, this is an excellent combination to choose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many different shades of olive, so you can choose the right one for the mood you want to create. Cooler, grayish olive greens are good for color schemes closer to neutral. You can combine them with slate **blue** for a cooler aesthetic. If you want more of a warm/cool dynamic, combine warmer olive with deep **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mint looks great with almost any **blue** shade. You can use mint green as a neutral and choose darker **blue**s as a grounding force, or opt for a soothing pastel aesthetic with mint and baby **blue**. To really capitalize on mint’s retro aesthetic, include bronze hardware on cabinets, dressers, etc. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Navy **blue** is an elegant and sophisticated color, making it a perfect alternative to neutral **colors**. Also, since navy **blue** is rich, it must be balanced with other **colors** in any space. Read on to learn in-depth which **colors** go with navy **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Navy-**blue** and gold go beautifully together. Use metallic gold accents or gold-toned wood finishes on the walls, furniture, or trims to highlight the navy-**blue** colour. For instance, observe how a large gold-framed mirror mounted against a navy-**blue** wall makes for a royal statement. It is accompanied by a trio of smaller mirrors with golden frames. The overall look is stunning, especially when paired with a gleaming white floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Patterned blankets can give your couch more depth, especially if the couch itself is a solid **blue** with no discernable features. Having a blanket on your couch already is a proactive move for chilly nights. Why not use the color or pattern to your advantage? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you like the combination of **blue** and red but want a stately palette, try combining burgundy with **blue**. In particular, navy and burgundy look great together. Generally, designers suggest using the 60-30-10 rule. That means to choose a neutral (white, gray, and soft beige are all good choices) and make that neutral take up 60% of the room. Choose either burgundy or navy and make that color take up about 30%, and then take the remaining color and make that one take up about 10%. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
