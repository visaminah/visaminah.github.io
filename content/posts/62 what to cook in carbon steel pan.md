## 62 Unexpected Facts About What To Cook In Carbon Steel Pan | We Tested the Best Carbon Steel Pans—and These Are Our Favorites
-   Made in the USA, this **pan** ships from the factory with a vegetable oil seasoning already applied, just like their preseasoned cast-iron skillets. The pre-applied seasoning is rougher than what you will get from a naturally developed patina on a regular carbon steel **pan**, so you can’t expect to use this immediately for “nonstick” **cook**ing where you want a fried egg to slide around on it. The rougher surface will also shred paper towels when you first attempt to clean it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remove oil and let the **pan** cool. Wipe away excess oil with paper towels – it is now ready for **cook**ing. (If you find that food sticks to the **pan**, repeat the procedure.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Matfer Bourgeat Black Carbon Steel Fry Pan, 11 7/8 Inches Best budget carbon steel **pan** Amazon The Matfer Bourgeat performs as well as our top pick, and while it doesn’t cost more than bargain restaurant **pan**s, it’s built a lot better, with a high quality, nicely welded handle and enough depth to go from searing to deep frying. $66 $53.99 at Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Scrub the **pan** with a moderately abrasive sponge. If necessary, use a little detergent. Scrub until the **cook**ing surface feels smooth. The coloring will be uneven, it’s the glossy surface you want. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cook over medium heat for about 10 minutes, occasionally moving the oil around the bottom and sides of the **pan** with the help of a spatula and/or paper towel. As the **pan** seasons it will turn brown, or even black. Every **pan** has its own, unique look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One big advantage of carbon steel over cast iron is that carbon steel **pan**s heat up much more quickly. And because it's more conductive than cast iron, it heats more evenly, with fewer hot spots. But even with that, it is still capable of reaching temperatures high enough to thoroughly sear a steak, and can likewise be used on the stovetop and in the oven. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   de Buyer Mineral B 12.5-Inch Frying Pan Best carbon steel **pan** overall Amazon Heavy construction, a second handle for easy transport from stovetop to oven and a design that’s deep and wide enough to tackle any **cook**ing task make the de Buyer Mineral B our favorite of the carbon steel **pan**s we tested. $99.95 at Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   They also share a few of the same downsides. They're poor conductors of heat as far as **cook**ware materials go, making them prone to uneven heating patterns: hot in the spots right over the heat source, significantly cooler just a short distance away. They're both also reactive metals that aren't suited for long-**cook**ing acidic or alkaline ingredients. You wouldn't want to reduce a whole bottle of wine or make a tomato sauce in them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   (Important: The waxy layer protects your carbon **pan** when it is delivered to you, but in the unlikely event that you should discover small patches of rust, this is no problem. See “rust” at the bottom of this page.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s a lot to love about carbon steel: It’s lightweight and easy to move around, and it’s flexible too, equally at home in the oven or on electric or gas stovetops, the grill, or an open fire. (A carbon-steel fry**pan** is a must-bring next time you go camping; sorry, cast-iron.) Plus, carbon steel heats up fast, **cook**s evenly, and cools down quickly—and it has excellent nonstick qualities that, like good wine, improve with age. Yes, the benefits of carbon steel **pan**s are aplenty, but to keep their superpowers going strong, they do need a little special attention. Here, the DOs and DON’Ts of how to clean a carbon steel **pan** as well as how to **cook** with, store and care for carbon steel so it stays in tip-top performance shape for days, months, and heck, years to come. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The textured handle is about the same quality as the de Buyer or the Mauviel, though it is arc-welded to the **pan** instead of being attached with rivets, so it doesn’t have the finished, crafted look of the de Buyer. The Matfer Bourgeat **pan** we tested doesn’t have a second handle, so you’ll want to take a little more care moving it in or out of the oven. However, it gave us equivalent results and was still easy to handle, and you can’t complain about it at this price point given its overall quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Matfer Bourgeat isn’t quite as deep as the de Buyer (1.75 inches) or as wide (11 7/8 inches), but it’s thick, heavy (78.50 ounces) and designed to take some serious abuse in a French restaurant kitchen. And, of course, it is significantly less expensive than our top pick without giving up much in performance. It’s deep enough to handle frying (some of the other budget **pan**s were too shallow to cover all the bases) and performed well in all of our testing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the benefits of carbon steel is that it performs like a cast iron **pan** without the added weight, so we wanted to make sure that each **pan** was easy to handle and maneuver. We assessed the weight and feel of each **pan** and how balanced it felt from handle to body. We also considered how hot or slippery each handle felt in our hands. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "Just like with cast iron, you never want to use soap on your carbon steel **pan**s," says Kalick. "It will fully strip the seasoning and may leave an unpleasant residue behind as well." When your **cook**ware has crusted-on food, use boiled water and a metal spatula as needed, but never dish soap. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And when properly seasoned, they do develop a nonstick surface. Still, they'll never be the best choice for **cook**ing eggs, and they're generally too heavy for sautéeing. Plus, if you try to simmer an acidic liquid in cast iron, like a tomato-based sauce, for instance, the acid will both break down the nonstick seasoning and impart a metallic flavor to your food. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some cast iron **pan**s come with an enamel coating, which makes them easier to care for, since the enamel protects the surface from rust and corrosion. The downside is that the enamel coating can crack at temperatures as low as 400 F, which somewhat defeats the purpose of cast iron. It can also chip if banged hard enough, and while it's easier to clean than regular cast iron, it won't ever be nonstick because there's no way for the enamel to build up any seasoning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Superior Heat Tolerance – carbon steel is remarkably heat tolerant which is why it makes great **cook**ware. Most all carbon steel **pan**s are safe up to minimum 600 degrees with some oven safe as high as 1200 degree F. One of the reasons many restaurants will have a wide variety of carbon steel **pan**s is that they can be safely left on range top burners for long periods without concern for damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most carbon steel **pan**s, on the other hand, have sloped sides, making them much better suited to sautéing. As I explained in my how-to on tossing foods in a skillet, if you want to launch something skyward, you need to send it off a sloping ramp, not crash it into a wall. Carbon steel shapes are perfect for that. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like cast iron, carbon steel is also pretty cheap. Prices online can range quite a bit, though I'd steer clear of the cheapest ones unless you can verify in person that they aren't made of extra-thin metal (good carbon steel **pan**s are thinner than cast iron, but not by a lot). Even at the more expensive end, you're unlikely to go over $100 for the larger sizes, and can spend quite a bit less than that. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Carbon steel **pan**s combine the durability of a cast-iron skillet with the functionality of a nonstick **pan**, so it's important to find a **pan** that can conduct heat evenly on both the stovetop and in the oven while maintaining a completely slick surface. Just like cast iron, carbon steel **pan**s require seasoning—the more you season them, the more nonstick they become over time. When shopping for a **pan**, pay attention to whether it comes pre-seasoned or if you'll need to season it yourself, and keep in mind that it won't be as slick on the first use as it may be on the 100th use. Some of the **pan**s we tested arrived pre-seasoned, and some we seasoned ourselves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As it is preseasoned, the entire **pan** is coated with a smooth black coating and is considerably lighter (57.75 ounces) than most of the 12-inch **pan**s we looked at. Some budget-minded shoppers may prefer this to the Lodge as it is not as heavy, and the coating is smoother out of the box, so less additional seasoning is required to get nonstick performance. This would be a good all-around **pan** for someone with budget constraints and looking for a multitasker — since it is deep, it can be used for stir-fries and deep-frying and can be used in the oven for casseroles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lightweight and easy to handle – carbon steel **cook**s like cast iron but weighs significantly less. To demonstrate, a popular 12” cast iron skillet weights 8 lbs. compared to the 12” Matfer carbon steel fry **pan** weighing in at just over 5-1/2 lbs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Initial seasoning involves coating a **pan** with vegetable oil and heating the **pan** to high heat. You’ll likely want to turn off your smoke detector if you’re doing this indoors, and make sure to open windows for plenty of ventilation during the initial seasoning process (and when melting off the shipping wax). Things can get smoky! A **pan** may need to be seasoned as many as ten or more times before it becomes sufficiently nonstick — though the best way to season it is simply to **cook** with it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Kalick also cautions home **cook**s to never put carbon steel in the dishwasher. "The detergent is often too abrasive and there's an increased possibility of your **cook**ware getting scratched or dented by other things," he says. "If you put carbon steel **pan** in the dishwasher, you will absolutely ruin it." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Carbon Steel Pans are very well loved by many home **cook**ing enthusiasts and professional chef’s alike, and with good reason. This **cook**ware boosts the durability and heat tolerance of cast iron, but the benefits of an easy release **cook**ing surface like that of non-stick, and the thermal conductivity of stainless steel. Our most popular pieces of carbon steel **cook**ware are the Matfer Bourgeat Carbon Steel Fry Pans which have continued to be a customer favorite at Cook’s Direct since being recognized in Cook’s Illustrated back in 2015. The Matfer Bourgeat **pan**s come in four sizes: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ready to clean your carbon steel **cook**ware? "Start by wiping away as much food residue as possible with a paper towel or cloth," says Kalick. "If stuck food bits still remain, you can boil some water in your **cook**ware to loosen the food, before scraping it up with a metal spatula. When it gets really dirty, scour it with about a cup of coarse salt and then rinse it out with hot water. Your **cook**ware will then need to be re-seasoned, which involves heating a small amount of oil over the stove, letting it smoke, and then letting it cool until the metal darkens in color." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Despite the name, this **pan** is Chinese-made, and very similar to the Misen, with a dual-riveted textured metal handle but with no silicone handle cover. This black steel **pan** is not the same alloy as carbon steel, however, it has very similar performance characteristics. At 2.13 inches deep, it’s the second-deepest **pan** we looked at, so it would be good for fried chicken or big stir-fries. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **cook**ing surface can get very hot. Make sure to use **cook**ing utensils designed to take the heat, like wood, metal, and silicone. Whatever utensil you use, make sure not to scrape or scrub too hard because you can strip the seasoning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Seasoning bonds oil to the surface, giving the **pan** excellent non-stick properties. It also protects the surface against corrosion (rust). Any vegetable oil with a high burning point will do, but common sunflower oil and flaxseed oil are recommended. This is how it’s done: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On arrival, a new carbon steel **pan** from Professional Secrets is covered with a layer of wax that protects the surface from humidity and corrosion. It must be removed before you even start to season your **pan**. Like this: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   * 30% heavier compared to other 10-12" size **pan**s (3.148 lbs vs an average of 1.907 to 2.1 lbs) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With use, a carbon steel **pan** builds up a layer of polymerized oils known as “seasoning,” giving the **pan** an easy-release, near nonstick finish. A little care and maintenance can help you build up and preserve this finish so your carbon steel **pan**s give you a lifetime of service. Michael Berk/CNN Underscored - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I've added pictures (red-stone looking one) of a much better frying **pan** -- the CSK 12" granite red stone frying **pan**, which was used to **cook** half of the same meal side by side -- you can see that it's 30% less in weight @ 1.907 lbs (vs the 3.148 of the Fit Cook) and it cleans *perfectly* just by wiping it down with a paper towel -- something that you cannot do with the FitCook here because you will get lint all over it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most cast iron **pan**s these days come preseasoned. "Seasoning" is a nongreasy layer of oil that is bonded to the surface of the **pan**, which protects it from rust while also imparting nonstick properties. And while the **pan** itself is extremely durable, this seasoning can be scraped off if scratched with a metal spatula. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Made In's carbon steel skillet passed all of our tests and was particularly useful for scrambling eggs, thanks to the completely nonstick surface. Our testers loved the ergonomic handle, which made this **pan** one of the easiest to hold and maneuver. The lightweight body and balanced handle made transferring it from stovetop to oven seamless. This **pan** produced golden, crispy chicken skin and moist, chewy skillet **cook**ies. It's oven-safe up to 1200 degrees Fahrenheit and is easy to clean with hot water and a scrub brush. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We love that this **pan** has two handles: one main, smooth long handle (which is attached with three short rivets) and a loop-shaped grabbing handle so that you can carry it — with potholders — in and out of a hot oven. It can easily double as a casserole dish because of the second handle, making mac and cheese, roast chicken or cornbread a little easier to deal with. Note that there are many versions of this **pan**, including a single-handle model that performs the same and is also a good choice if you don’t feel you need the handling assist. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A carbon steel **pan** is perfect for working with high heat. However, the **pan** must be heated up and cooled down slowly or the steel can lose its shape. Therefore: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Acidic ingredients – vinegar, lemon, tomatoes, etc – can react with the steel in the **pan**. This is a harmless reaction, but it may give food an unpleasant metallic flavor. Stainless steel or ceramics are a better idea. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But the truth is, even if there's merit to those arguments, they only go so far. As someone who owns multiple cast iron and carbon steel **pan**s in multiple sizes, I can attest that in most cases, they're pretty interchangeable. Kenji concurs. "I use both for both—whichever I grab first," he told me when I asked him about his own habits. Frankly, if you already own plenty of cast iron, I wouldn't try to convince you that you must also invest in carbon steel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "You can **cook** almost anything in carbon steel," he adds, sharing that a few of his favorite dishes are stir-fry in a wok, perfect rice in a paella **pan**, and a lovely crust on a pizza steel. "The only thing you need to be a little careful of is acidic ingredients. You can add some tomatoes to it no problem, but it's not an ideal place to make a vinegar or citrus-based sauce because that will strip the seasoning." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Versatile – you can use carbon steel **cook**ware with nearly any heat source and **cook** top. Place your carbon steel **cook**ware in the oven, on the grill, in the broiler or on top of the range. And it will be compatible with induction, gas or electric ranges. Carbon steel **cook**ware is light weight and easy to transport, plus you can pretty much count on being able to use it where ever you will be **cook**ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Carbon steel **pan**s are becoming more common in the home kitchen as home chefs recognize their advantages. Carbon steel **cook**ware is considerably lighter and easier to manage than cast iron, responds quickly to heat changes since it’s so thin, and is much tougher than aluminum or stainless **cook**ware — carbon steel can go from a high-power gas burner right into a blazing hot pizza oven, conditions that an aluminum or stainless **pan** might not survive. And since they’re ferrous, carbon steel **pan**s work fine with induction **cook**tops, which are also making headway in home kitchens. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This dish is easy to make, and it will only take around 15 minutes (a few minutes for preparing the seasoning and rubbing it in, 5 minutes for searing the first side, and 5-7 minutes for the other one). The seasoning will give your chicken a wonderful flavor, smokey and sweet. Your thighs will be golden brown, juicy on the inside, and crispy on the outside. It is very important to get rid of extra moisture, so they do not get soggy. Learn how to **cook** chicken thighs in a skillet below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Made in France, the de Buyer Mineral B was one of the deepest (2.06 inches), the second-widest (12.50 inches), and also the heaviest (96 ounces) **pan** we tested. If you’re looking to **cook** large proteins and want thick, heavy metal construction, with a lot of depth (for stir-fries, fried chicken and other single-**pan** dishes), the de Buyer is absolutely the **pan** you want to get. This is a multitasker that can be used to **cook** just about any meal on your stove or in your oven you can think of, and it is worth every penny — it will become your main kitchen workhorse. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unevenly Surface Heating – while carbon steel **cook**ware heats up quickly and is responsive to changes in temperature, for even heat distribution a multi-clad stainless steel **pan** will always win. Multi-clad **cook**ware features an aluminum core which is highly conductive, heating quickly and evenly. In smaller **pan**s, this may not be an issue but with a larger **pan**, you may find that different parts of your food may **cook** faster or slower, potentially troubling if **cook**ing meats or delicate foods like fish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thus, caring for cast iron essentially comes down to preserving the seasoning, which means drying it immediately after washing (to prevent rust) and giving it a coat of oil after each soap and water rinse. Keep your **pan** out of the dishwasher, and wash it with soap and water by hand. Contrary to popular belief, soap cannot remove the seasoning (although excessive scrubbing can). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Carbon steel **pan**s should be heavy-duty, durable, and versatile, but that doesn't mean they should be expensive. That's why we love the Merten and Storck 12-inch Carbon Steel Black Frying Pan—it performed exceptionally well in each one of our tests while being one of the most affordable in the group. This workhorse **pan** is easy to hold, clean, and use, and it's earned a top spot in our kitchens. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you own a carbon steel skillet, **cook**ing is always a pleasure. You can create a dazzling array of delicious dishes, from tender eggs and sauteed vegetables to elaborate nutritious woks. Our seared skillet chicken thighs are easy to **cook**, and they can make a wonderful weeknight meal or formal dinner. This versatile dish can be combined with a wide range of sides, from mashed potatoes to Lebanese rice. Your irresistible balanced meal will be ready in just 15 minutes! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Serious Eats has become an amazing resource for cast iron **cook**ware. From great recipes to seasoning instructions, myth busting to vintage restoration, we've got you covered. But there's another type of **pan** with similarities to cast iron that we haven't written much about, and it's made from carbon steel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, cast-iron **pan**s are durable kitchen workhorses. But, man, they are heavy. (Have you ever lifted a cast-iron **pan** full of roast chicken and vegetables and dropped it onto the kitchen floor due to the immense weight? If you don't care to get your bicep workouts done in the kitchen, there's a better way: there's a skillet with the same versatility and durability and less of the heft. It's called carbon steel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When searching for a good quality carbon steel **pan**, chances are you'll often hear the term "seasoning." Seasoning is the process of coating a **pan** with heated oil to create a protective barrier, which helps ensure a nonstick and rust-resistant surface. Like cast iron, seasoning carbon steel is a vital process, so we followed the manufacturer's instructions to season each **pan**. If a **pan** was labeled pre-seasoned, we did not do any extra seasoning to see how functional the manufacturer's coating was. Most manufacturers advised against using soap when cleaning, so we washed each **pan** with hot water and a scrub brush to help preserve the seasoning of each. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Steel wool is far too abrasive for nonstick or even stainless steel **cook**ware, but it's great for removing rust off of carbon steel, says Kalick. "If your **cook**ware becomes rusty, you can remove that with steel wool and a paste of baking soda and vinegar, using the steel wool as a scouring pad." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many carbon steel **pan**s ship from the factory coated in wax, which needs to be melted off in an oven at high heat before the **pan** can be used. Over time, after dozens of uses, the surface of a carbon steel **pan** will discolor and darken due to the oxidation of polymerized oils, which creates a naturally non-stick surface in a process known as “seasoning.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Carbon steel **pan**s are super durable and tough, which means they can also be on the heavy side. When shopping for one, keep in mind that these can be more cumbersome than your standard frying **pan**. If using heavy **cook**ware is an issue for you, make sure to look for a **pan** that has an ergonomic handle that makes it easier to maneuver. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The seasoning on carbon steel **pan**s is all superficial—meaning it just builds up on the surface of the **pan**. Cooking bacon in it is not effective for its inaugural seasoning. Instead, follow the method prescribed for cast-iron: Rub it down with a neutral oil and bake it, upside-down and set over a sheet **pan**, in a 350˚ oven for an hour. Then, the first few things you **cook** in your carbon steel should be high in fat, like bacon or a pork chop—as the fat renders, it will boost the layers of seasoning. The Bon Appétit test kitchen does not recommend buying pre-seasoned carbon steel **pan**s, as their quality is not as high. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Reactive to Acidic Foods – carbon steel and tomatoes just don’t go together. You’ll also want to avoid wine sauces and dishes with lots of lemon juice or other acidic foods. Keep in mind, a splash of vinegar or small amount of lemon won’t ruin the **pan** but simmering a wine or tomato sauce will strip the seasoning layer and you will be better served using a stainless steel or enameled cast iron pot as these are non-reactive surfaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Warm the **pan** on moderate heat and add 2 to 3 table spoons of oil. (Some also recommend adding salt and, for example, potato peels to help absorb any remaining traces of wax.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is lightweight, heats up fast, affordable, and highly durable. You do need to remember to season your **pan** before **cook**ing with it and then re-seasoning when needed. If you’re **cook**ing lots of acidic foods, you will end up disappointed. But if you’re looking to enhance your **cook**ware collection and looking for affordable pots or **pan**s that can be used with most foods, are easy to handle, responsive and will last for years, you should give carbon steel **cook**ware a try. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to sear/place in the oven, you would use cast iron. Cast Iron is also heavy and has the same "negatives", however you can season it properly so it will not stick, and there's no need to be careful cleaning it (with a chainmail + salt and you can get the cast iron like new). On the other hand, if you want non-stick, any T-Fal/Calphalon/Cuisineart non-stick **pan** will outperform the Cook Fit by 10x. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **pan** is ~30% heavier than the other 6 **pan**s we own of 10-12" size. It comes to 3.148 Lbs - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's important to note that because steel wool is such a heavy-duty abrasive, it will not only take off the rust but the layer of seasoning you've built up as well, says Kalick. To remedy this, just follow the re-seasoning steps above. "After the initial re-seasoning, you'll need to build that patina back up from scratch, which gives you a great excuse to **cook** fatty foods like bacon to help kick-start that process." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are some other more subtle differences that I could formulate into an argument about when to use one versus the other. I could point out that cast iron **pan**s tend to be thicker and heavier than carbon steel of the same diameter* and therefore end up heating slightly more evenly than carbon steel. I could say that this difference makes cast iron better for searing meats, while carbon steel, being lighter weight, is better for sautéing foods: the **pan** is easier to lift and shake with one hand,** and since the contents move around the **pan** constantly during **cook**ing, hot and cold spots don't matter as much. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
