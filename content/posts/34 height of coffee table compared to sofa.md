## 34 Things About Height Of Coffee Table Compared To Sofa | Blog
-   ‘Unfortunately, I often see a coffee table placed so far away or so low down that it renders its purpose useless,’ says Keren Richter, co-founder and principal designer at White Arrow (opens in new tab). ‘You ideally want your coffee table to be a similar **height** to your seating, and we like them to be roughly two thirds the length of the **sofa** dimensions. If you’re using two smaller tables side-by-side, aim for the total length of these to hit the two thirds mark too.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 18-inch guideline isn't set in stone, but generally provides maximum comfort and functionality for the **sofa** and coffee table combination. This measurement may vary if the table and **sofa** **height**s vary. In general, the **height** of **sofa** seats and the coffee table should be within 4 inches of one another, otherwise the arrangement may feel awkward or uncomfortable. If the table is shorter than the **sofa**, the kids may be able to reach it more easily if the table was pulled in another inch or two. For a small, round table, sit on the **sofa** to determine a comfortable distance; you may want to pull it in as close as 12 inches from the **sofa** so everyone seated can reach it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The size of your coffee table should be guided by thoughts on how you’ll use it, and who will use it. ‘So much goes into choosing the perfect coffee table,’ says Kate Hayes, co-founder of Atlanta-based Hayes Little Studio (opens in new tab). ‘Start by considering the environment; do you have children and need a more practical finish for your table? Is it a loungey, relaxed living room or is it something more formal and even traditional?' What kind of coffee table decor are you considering? 'These aspects all play into the **height** and shape of the coffee table selection,' Kate says. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Similarly to finding a coffee table that has the right **height**, you should look for one that has the right length in relation to the width of your **sofa**. Specifically, your coffee table should be approximately two-thirds the length of your **sofa**. So for a 96-inch **sofa**, for instance, you should look for a coffee table that's 64 inches long. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The rectangle coffee table is the classic go-to shape for many living rooms and couch types. There is a reason it’s considered traditional. It’s hard to get away from the even and sturdy design that fits with most **sofa**s. It can have drawers, different levels, and varying **height**s for all of your needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘Coffee tables should be located 18 inches from the front edge of a **sofa** or chair,’ says Victoria Sass, principal and design director at Prospect Refuge Studio (opens in new tab). ‘It really is a very narrow window between what feels natural and comfortable and what doesn’t, so I would always try to stay within an inch or two of 18 inches.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After you've figured out the **height** and length you're looking for, it's time to choose the ideal shape of your coffee table. Often, choosing between a square, rectangle, round, or oval coffee table boils down to the length and clearance required around it. Traditionally, your coffee table should be 12 to 18 inches away from your **sofa**—any more or less than that will feel uncomfortably close or far. Between your coffee table and your TV stand or fireplace, you should calculate at least 24 inches to 30 inches to leave enough room for circulating around the space. To find your ideal coffee table width, measure the length between your **sofa** and TV stand and subtract 42 inches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When looking for a **sofa** and coffee table that will complement each other well, you want to take into consideration a few things. First, think about the relative size of your **sofa** and coffee table, as well as the general size of your space. Your coffee table shouldn’t be taller or wider than your **sofa** – You don’t want anything to overpower it! You’ll want enough space on each end of your coffee table to create a comfortable, walkable, and useful living space. In terms of **height**, your coffee table should be about 1-2 inches lower than your **sofa**. However, in some spaces, we’ll occasionally go for a slightly lower coffee table depending on the size of the **sofa**, the seat **height**, and our clients’ style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How many hours do we put into choosing the perfect **sofa**, the perfect rug, the perfect chairs for our living room…only to throw in a hand-me-down coffee table that used to belong to Aunt Susan? (bless her heart). Okay, we don’t all go down the who-cares-about-a-coffee-table route. Plenty of you have definitely belabored the choice of a table, we’re sure, but regardless of what side of those scenarios you find yourself, you might need some guidance or inspiration in the coffee table shopping department. What size and shape go with what **sofa** size and shape? It might feel like a shot in the dark, but fear not, we’re here to help. We’ve put together a shopping guide with all the best coffee tables we could find—round, square, rectangular, oval!—and a few rules to keep in mind (with a diagram!) when choosing a coffee table. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Perhaps one of the most important things to nail in any room scheme is the sense of scale. A larger room works better visually if it has furniture of a similarly grand proportion, just as a small living room will feel calmer and less cluttered with pieces that are more petite. The same logic can be applied to a coffee table; large **sofa**s will overwhelm a tiny coffee table, while an enormous coffee table will be too distracting if your seating is on the small side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another handy rule to follow when choosing a coffee table is its "weightiness." In other words, it should complement the other furniture in the room to make the space feel proportional and balanced. What does this all mean? If your **sofa** has high skinny legs, consider a table that's solid all the way to the ground or has shorter chunkier legs. On the other hand, if your **sofa** has no visible legs, choose a coffee table that has higher skinnier legs. An interior designer once told me that when a room feels too "leggy," it doesn't feel as grounded—and it's something that's never left me. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this case, you want a table that isn’t so long that it overwhelms the **sofa**, but isn’t so short as to be overwhelmed by the **sofa** — look for a coffee table that is about two-thirds the length of your **sofa**. These proportions “help your living room look more balanced.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There's nothing more awkward than a coffee table that's too high or too low. To ensure you feel comfortable in your living space, opt for a coffee table that's the same **height** as the cushions on your **sofa** or one to two inches lower. Any more and you risk the space looking and feeling just a little off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We’ve touched on this a little already, but getting the **height** of your coffee table right is a determining factor in its success within your living room. Thankfully, there’s another school of thought to follow that means you’ll get it right every time. ‘In terms of **height**, we'd always suggest getting something as close to the **height** of the seat **height** of the couch’, says Sheena Murphy at Nune. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a few guiding principles that can help you get started. The width should be roughly two-thirds the width of your **sofa**, and the **height** should roughly equal the same seat **height** as your **sofa**. For easy and comfortable reaching distance, the advice is roughly 18 inches from your seating to the edge of the table. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a large comfy sectional or the traditional conversational set up with a **sofa** and a couple of chairs (kind of like Ginny’s living room above), a square table is a great choice. It fits perfectly in the L-shape nook of your sectional or the big space in the middle of your chat zone. The best part of a square table? You get the most styling space bang for your buck. Who doesn’t love a well-styled coffee table vignette? We really like the mix of the square top and round base of table #1 or #18 for a play on shapes. Similar to the shadow box table we talked about in the previous section, #2 from IKEA has a drawer with four sections, and the glass top lets you see all the pretty things you decide to store (definitely not the best option if you know you’ll just end up junking up that drawer with remotes and catalogs, though). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to size, most rectangular coffee tables will range from 16" to 20" in **height**, 48" to 54" in length, and 24" to 30" in depth. Round coffee tables range between 30" to 48" and ovals run between 22" wide and 54" long. These are some average sizes for reference, but keep in mind that antique or unique coffee tables may come in different shapes and sizes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The right length: Again, we must look at the length of the coffee table in relation to the length of the **sofa**. So, when choosing the right length, the table should always be at least two thirds the length of your **sofa**. For example, for a 96” **sofa**, the right table should at least be 64” long. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many times the **sofa** isn’t the only other furniture in the room. While this may sound like it complicates things, it actually opens up your options! With the **sofa** being the main feature, it’s standard to opt for a rectangular coffee table. But if you have other items like armchairs, shelving, or even plants or artwork, it’s easier to play around with coffee tables of different sizes and shapes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just as with the size and shape, the finish of your coffee table is very important. When choosing between a glass top versus a solid top, wood versus metal, or open versus closed, the right finish is determined by the rest of the materials in the room. Hence, you must consider the colour and material of the **sofa**, chairs, as well as the finish of your flooring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We were noticing that this was a post that a lot of people have been looking at recently so we thought let’s just put it up at the top of the blog again! Picking out a coffee table is something that you think you just instinctually know how to do… until it’s time to find one. That’s why we made this post so you don’t have to guess what size, shape, or type you need to make the perfect **sofa** match. Enjoy this quick little republish with updated shippable picks. xx - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To find the perfect balance of elements when designing a room, proportions are so important! In this case, we look at the coffee table in relation to the size of the **sofa**, sectional, or chairs around it. For instance, if your **sofa** has long thin legs, then the best option will be to have a consistently heavy table that reaches down to the floor. On the other hand, if your **sofa** has short bulky legs, then you'll want a coffee table with higher thin legs. This is an interesting visual strategy to ground items to the room in relation to its surrounding pieces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally, coffee tables come between 16-18” inches tall. On average, **sofa** seats range from 17-19 inches high. You want the tabletop to be a few inches lower than the **sofa** to make it easy to reach drinks or prop up your feet comfortably. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Pedrera Coffee Table has a **height** of 15” (38.1 cm), length of 42” (106.7 cm), and width of 35” (89 cm). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So how big should your coffee table be? A coffee table should be big enough to be positioned 12 to 18 inches away from all adjacent **sofa**s and chairs. It should be 2/3 the length of the adjacent **sofa**s. The **height** of the coffee table should match the **height** of the **sofa** cushions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A general rule for coffee table **height**? It should sit about 1-2" below the **height** of the **sofa** seats. But keep in mind that this is just a guideline. A very low-level coffee table can create a more calming and contemporary feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When thinking about the size of your coffee table, it's important to first consider the shape. This means taking into account the living space where the coffee table will go. How are your **sofa**(s) and chair(s) arranged? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the length and width are sorted, **height** is the final variable you’ll need to sort out before you dive into the fun stuff. A typical coffee table is between 40cm and 50cm tall, to accommodate the average **height** of your **sofa** (and the humans that sit on it!). Although most coffee tables are inherently a suitable **height**, consider whether it has a rim or ‘lip’ that’s taller than a comfortable **height**. If this is the case, the table should be slightly lower to allow for this. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, it needs to be the right size—both **height**wise and in terms of length and width. It needs to be the right scale and proportion to the space and needs to work with all your existing furniture. The material needs to fit with your lifestyle and work well in the room. It even needs to suit the needs of your family, whether this means that it has to be kid-friendly or have enough storage for TV remotes and other miscellaneous items. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After that, it depends on the size of the room, the furniture surrounding it, and your chosen aesthetic. If you only have one **sofa**, a smaller tabletop will suffice. If the coffee table will be used by people sitting on multiple **sofa**s, a bigger surface is more practical. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may want to start by thinking about upholstery. It's important that the style of your **sofa** feels congruent to the style of the coffee table. Coffee tables come in various forms, shapes, sizes, and materials. They can be made of wood, metal, glass, leather, upholstery, stone, reclaimed woods, or a combination of any of those elements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The right shape: Coffee tables come in a wide variety of shapes, but not all shapes will fit your room properly. You may already have a preference for rectangular tables compared to circular ones. However, what will really determine the shape you should use is not only your personal style but also the size of your room, the shape of your **sofa**, the circulation required, and the style you pick. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Consider rectangle (or oval but more on this shape next) if you have a standard **sofa** (or an extra-long **sofa** with chaise) so everyone can have easy access to their coffee, cocktail, or late-night snack of choice. This is also a great choice if you have a narrow space with minimal walk-around clearance. If you’re a household with more remotes or tech cords than you can count, think about getting a table with some functional but still sleek drawers like #1, #4, #18, or #21. It’s hard to see in the photo, but the table at #2 has a shadow box top (that’s great for putting in your favorite curiosities and trinkets but still having plenty of surface area for you know…real life stuff. Oh, and if you regularly eat in front of your TV (whether by choice or because you don’t actually have a formal dining area), a lift-top coffee table is super useful for not having to hunch over your plate (#10 and #20). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A coffee table is an essential aspect of a living room. It holds up your drinks, books, and decorations within arms reach of your **sofa**. Picking the right coffee table for the space is easy with all the options and styles available. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
