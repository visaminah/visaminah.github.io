## 90 Reference List: What Color Is Dark Teal Blue | Green Colour
-   Many people believe that you can’t mix colors to create the primary colors of light: red, green, and **blue** (RGB). However, the CMYK color wheel shows that mixing magenta and cyan together can give you **blue**. Of course, when it comes to painting, it’s much more efficient to simply buy **blue** paint since cyan and magenta paints are harder to come by. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For example, if you want “light **teal**” you can mix it with white. Conversely, if you want a darker version, you can mix it with a touch of gray, and this is called “dark **teal**”. An example of the first option is also known as the popular shade called turquoise **teal**. This color occurs when you mix more green and white than **blue**, which leaves you with a shade so bright that it almost has a yellowish undertone. When you think of the color of the sea on the coasts of Italy and Greece, you will come up with this calming shade of turquoise. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remember, for dark **teal**; you should add less white as mentioned above. If you want some different shades of **teal**, then you can try adding **blue**, green, and white in different quantity. Some people also use yellow to obtain a **teal** color. But we will suggest that use white only, for the perfect **teal** color and shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Jewel-toned interiors tend to feel very moody and oh-so-luxurious as proven by this saturated living room from Anne Roselt Design.

But it is also made using green color and **blue** color only. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Second, I find the official Behr swatch to be super deceptive. You can see from Tim’s photo that Black Evergreen is like a deep green-**teal**. Where Behr shows it looking like a dark gray green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Excellent complementary color for **teal** is cream. The cream is one of the warmest neutral colors and a smooth, soft color, especially when compared to the starkness of white. It is one of the recommended colors that go with **teal** when you want to create a bold, but less striking match than for example white. Cream and **teal** color combination is luxurious and visually striking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Teal is a versatile color when you think of it. Not only does it comes in various shades, but can accommodate exceptionally well with other colors like gold, cream/ivory, Navy, etc. If you are up for a little experimentation, combine **teal** with all of the above complementary colors to see fascinating results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Paint colors that go with **teal** include pink especially when it is a soft pink for example in a girl’s bedroom with soft painted pink walls and **teal** bedding.

-   Imagine if your walls are **teal**.

-   Orange, whether it be burnt orange, sienna, brick, or others within the spectrum, works beautifully to add depth and dimension.

-   As you all know that to make a **teal** color, we need **blue** and green color. And to make green color we can use a **blue** and yellow color which are primary colors. So, only by mixing these two primary colors that are **blue** and yellow, first, you can create green. Then you can add more **blue** tint to it along with the white color to make **teal** color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is a myriad of colors that go with **teal**, therefore, is it a great color to incorporate into home décor too.

Who knows, this might become your favorite room after this design change? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue and green are both cool colors that are next to each other on the color wheel. So, they can work together well in designs.

-   On the color wheel, **blue** and orange are on the opposite ends of each other. Because of this, they are complementary colors.

-   Colors in lights and printing use different color models than painting and other hands-on art forms. So, when you mix **blue** and green lights together, you get cyan, according to the RGB color wheel. This color wheel is a form of additive coloring that’s used to make colors on your monitor using only red, green, and **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, to create cyan with lights, you’ll need to use the RGB color model. The RGB color wheel is a form of additive coloring, unlike the other main color wheels, which are subtractive. In that case, the primary colors are red, green, and **blue**. Red and green make yellow, red and **blue** make magenta, and **blue** and green make cyan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Teal is a color that lands right between **blue** and green. It is typically achieved by combining **blue** and green with a white base.

-   This vibrant bedroom belonging to Megan Zietz of TFDiaries is a study in how to combine **blue** and green in style. A navy **blue** bed frame is layered with linens and pillows flaunting shades of **teal**, green, and orange. The persimmon hue adds just enough warmth to balance the cooler colors, while simultaneously matching the saturation.

-   The low-profile, **blue** sectional sofa in this living room by Decus Interiors is a delightful complement to the oversize abstract artwork hanging on the wall.

-   With the color being made up of greens and **blue**s, it is not surprising that some people might think that these are the best and most complementary colors that go well with **teal**. This actually couldn’t be more wrong! If **teal** was on (an expanded version of) the ROYGBIV (red, orange, yellow, green, **blue**, indigo, violet) color wheel, the shades of green and **blue** would probably end up on either side of it. This means that these colors are analogous to **teal**. While useful for creating a gradual, gradient-like effect, the problem with analogous color schemes is that it is difficult for an individual color to stand out because all the colors involved are visually similar to one another, This means that if you are seeking colors that look good with **teal**, green and **blue** are not the answer because these shades will only mute the impact of the hue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Teal is often used in logos, web design, and interior decorating–especially in the bathroom, library, and living rooms. The hue is an interior design staple because it adds a sophisticated splash of color to a neutral room.

-   Teal pops with bright white, and its color wheel match is coral. But it also works with cream, navy, pinks and especially gold and brown tones. Nothing looks quite so good as a gold-framed mirror against a **teal** wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Note: One of the easiest ways to experiment with color is to pull in a funky wallpaper with multiple hues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The final deciding factor for finding your meant-to-be **teal** comes down to the colour compass. Natural light is a glorious thing, but depending on what time of day your room receives it most, the tone of that light will be very different indeed and therefore, your paint colour can look almost like it’s got a filter on it. To choose the most harmonious hue for your room that means looking at the compass and understanding which colour best suits the point that it’s facing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

For example, if you have a gray couch, you could add a **blue**-green decorative pillow for a pop of color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although green and **blue**s nearly always look good together, deciding to pull in other colors can be a bit challenging. First, you need to make sure the third hue complements both the **blue** and green tones in the room. Then, you need to consider how you'll tie in the accent shade. A big piece of furniture? Funky wallpaper? Or a minimalist tile? No matter which route you choose, a piece of decor that combines two or more of the colors in your scheme will make it easier to tie the entire design together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   At first glance, you could easily miss the fact that there is a third color in this sophisticated **blue** and green living room by Studio McGee. That's the beauty of using a neutral shade like brown as an accent — it quietly fades into the background. Here, the stars of the show are a navy **blue** wall, complete with board and batten paneling, and a velvet green sofa.
