## 60 Reference List: What Goes Well With Black Dress Shirt | Should You Buy a Black Suit?
-   If you want to make a bold statement, wearing a black suit with a red **shirt** is your go-to combination. A red **shirt** can be a fantastic addition to your repertoire. It will give you the chance to be more experimental but keep it stylish and smart. Steer away from bright and flashy reds such as scarlet which can cheapen the whole look and unsurprisingly make people feel entitled to demand you park their car. Opt for a rich wine red or deep crimson instead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black pants are an obvious choice for women who want to wear black **dress**es, but pairing them with colorful pants can be a more interesting look. She can wear a black **dress** or a black t-**shirt** with white buttons. You can wear a blazer and slacks to a casual event like a wedding or holiday party without drawing attention. Slimfitting suits are best suited to taller men because they do not add bulk to their frames. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A black **dress** **shirt** is the perfect way to make a lasting impression. Whether you’re headed to a job interview or a black-tie event, a black **dress** **shirt** always looks sharp. Plus, it’s easy to style: just pair it with a black suit and you’re good to go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Picture this: it’s the start of a new week, you are wearing a white, spread collar **shirt** paired with an Italian silk, black-and-white polkadot tie (half windsor knot, of course). Matte-black, polished leather monk strap shoes – with silk black-and-white polkadot socks, match back perfectly with your tie. You look great, feel great, and are now ready to do a great job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A black **dress** **shirt** and an all-black suit look is the ideal combination for a more formal look. If you’re in doubt, go with black. Dark colors like red, brown, dark green, or navy (except jeans) might look great with that outfit, but they’ll be even safer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the main reason why you’ve been wanting to wear a black suit with a black tie without having a particular event to attend to is Men in Black. That film has been subliminally influencing your fashion subconscious for years without you even realising it. There’s nothing more polished and sophisticated than a man wearing a tailored black tie suit with a white **shirt**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   T-**shirt**s and khakis are my go-to attire, but khakis work well with t-**shirt**s as well. It is necessary to have a flannel **shirt** on hand. It comes with a collar, buttons on the cuff, and can be tucked in, making it a good addition to your khakis. There isn’t a single competitor in this combination because there’s so much winning going on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re going for a T-**shirt**, keep things smart with a crew neck design in a simple pattern or block colour. Anything that’s too baggy, with a neckline that’s too low down won’t work with the sleek fit of the blazer. You can also try a neat roll neck in a plain colour like grey or navy. Because of its unique shape it’s already eye-catching enough, so you don’t to go overboard by wearing it in a bright colour or highly patterned design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many men avoid striped **shirt**s because they just don’t know how to style them. A smart striped **shirt** with a black suit is a match-made in heaven! Stick with classic shades of stripes, such as blue and white or red and white. Too much colour will look awkward so stay with tried and tested colours! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A black **shirt** can be worn with jeans. Casual black **shirt**s like tees, polos, and Henleys would work better with casual-looking jeans in lighter colors and more distressing. Dressier black **shirt**s should only be worn with darker jeans, with minimal distressing and a tapered silhouette. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wearing a black suit with a white **shirt** accompanied by a red tie is a brilliant combination for a wedding. You can create a nice contrast using your white **shirt** as the main point of light and finish your look off with a dash of colour provided by your red tie. As we’ve mentioned before, it’s all about proportions and balance. So make sure you find the right width for your suit lapels, your shoulder size and fit of your black suit. A fresh white **shirt** is guaranteed to make the red of your tie pop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Flannel or plaid is another workable option. Inject a bit of individuality into your black suit by opting for a printed **shirt** that reflects your personality and style, just make sure not to go too overboard or you’ll stand out for all the wrong reasons. This is a great option for a date or formal occasion as it shows subtle flair whilst still keeping things understated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Alright, so I've given you quite a bit on black. I would say touching on collarless black **shirt**s, I didn't get into that too much. I think if it's made from fine-woven cotton, it can have a wool cotton mix. You can go with a few blends wearing that underneath. I've even got a synthetic, which is a performance **shirt** made by JUZD Streetwear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Think of the movie Alfie when Jude Law wear a light pink **shirt** with his black Ralph Lauren suit. Choose softer colours, otherwise one bold colour only. So a bold **shirt** or a bold tie but not both. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By the way: bugatti not only sells plain blue gents’ **shirt**s but also patterned versions. They look particularly attractive worn with a plain-coloured suit. However, if the suit itself is already strikingly patterned, combining the two pieces of clothing may not make a flattering overall impression. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A black suit and blue **shirt** can be worn with a red tie in many different settings ranging from formal or business-professional to smart-casual. Dark red ties (eg. burgundy, maroon, or crimson) would be more appropriate in **dress**ier settings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you do wear a black suit, wear it with black shoes and a white **shirt**. Black necessitates high contrast. The only time it is advisable to wear a colored **shirt** with a black suit is for a nightclub look – a black **shirt** or burgundy **shirt** without a tie, or a turtleneck look sleek and fashionable in that setting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s an unmistakable menswear look, consisting of khaki pants paired with a white button-up **shirt**. Why do we try and keep our outfits fresh instead of boring? There is no better fit than this. He can never go wrong with a relaxed **shirt** tucked into his Dockers easy khakis for a casual but put-together look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I've seen this overdone though a lot of times. If you've got a very light-colored face, it's just going to make your head really stand out, so you want to be careful with that look. You need to be a little bit more style advanced. If you're going to try to introduce a black **shirt**, I think you should go for something that is matching it with something that's clearly not black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A black **shirt** can look amazing as well. If you do that, you’ll need to create contrast with your ties, pocket square, shoes, and accessories. Otherwise, your look will appear a bit static and unimpressive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wearing a black suit will instantly make you look enigmatic. Be it your wedding or a friend’s wedding, a black tuxedo is the perfect attire to wear. Wear it along with a crisp white **shirt**, a pair of formal black shoes and some stunning accessories like cufflinks, a formal watch and the like. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A plain, solid-colored t-**shirt** combined with a black skirt will give you a chic and casual look. If you want to be a little edgy, try wearing a t-**shirt** with a graphic tee. It will also bring you a playful vibe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have black joggers, you can choose a neutral-colored slim-fit t-**shirt**. The t-**shirt** will give a balanced effect to your attire. If you want a casual and understated look, you can wear a plain white tee. If cold outside, match your joggers with a black logo hoodie. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can pair up your black top with jeans, palazzo pants, and even leggings in any color. This outfit is ideal if you go out with some friends for lunch. You can also wear light-colored pants if you want to brighten up and add vibrance to your black **shirt**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue and black are a colour combination that any gentleman can pull off. For daytime events, a light blue **shirt** still looks smart but brightens the look without being too formal like a white **shirt** does. A light blue **shirt**, navy tie and light brown shoes are the perfect items to pair with a black suit for non black-tie events, such as big meetings at work and weddings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before we fully dive into the world of **shirt** and tie combinations with a black suit, let’s set some ground rules on how a suit should fit – you know, so that we’re on the same page. Proportion is key with all clothing but it becomes especially important with suits, if you don’t get them right you’ll look sloppy, defeating the whole purpose of wearing a suit. For that reason, remember to get your black suit jacket tailored and sleeves and suit trousers hemmed in case they’re too long or too short. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Men with blue eyes and light skin should avoid combining a navy **shirt** with a black suit; a light blue one is a much better choice. On the one hand, it looks elegant and on the other, it goes perfectly with lighter colouring. Plus, it doesn’t look quite as formal as a white **shirt** (which would of course still match the look). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another colour that goes hand in hand with black is grey. Whether it’s a cool grey not much darker than a classic white **shirt** or a darker grey shade for a cooler, edgier look, any shade of grey works well! Similar to a blue **shirt**, light greys work best for daytime events and darker hues work best for the evening. Grey and black colour combinations require everything to stay in the neutral category so black shiny shoes and silver grey ties are the best way to go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wearing a black suit with a white **shirt** will create a crisp contrast that will make your entire outfit look sharp and polished. It’s a classic and timeless combination for a reason. Bear in mind that white is your accent colour and black should be the protagonist – the risk of looking like a penguin or a zebra is always around the corner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is no one answer to this question as it depends on personal style and preferences. That said, generally speaking, black **shirt**s can be worn with khakis and brown shoes without issue. The key is to ensure that the proportions are balanced and the overall look is cohesive. For example, if wearing a black **shirt** with khakis, consider pairing it with a brown belt and shoes in a similar shade. Alternatively, if you want to add a pop of color, consider pairing the black **shirt** with khaki shorts or pants and brown shoes with colorful laces or socks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re feeling extra stylish, a dark blue or navy **shirt** is a great option for evening events. It’s dark enough to look sleek but not too dark that it merges in with the black suit. You can finish the look with a skinny black tie but it’s not a necessity. Black patent smart shoes are a must here as brown gives the outfit a more casual feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So clearly you can see that this does not match exactly, but there's enough of a contrast. And if you're going in the same color scheme, you could mix it with greys, so black **shirt** with grey trousers or grey jacket. That is better than trying to go with anything in the navy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You might not think a light pink **shirt** would go well with a black suit but it does! You must stick with pastel pink only to give a more youthful look. Pink and black is a simple colour combination and goes well with other neutrals, such as grey. Stick with black patent shoes and a skinny black tie again so the pink **shirt** takes centre stage of the outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even if you rarely attend either of the above, a black suit jacket and trousers can be separated for a more informal look. A suit jacket over a casual outfit, such as jeans and clean sneakers, is perfect for special family occasions. Wearing smart trousers with a casual **shirt** is a great look for after-work drinks straight from the office. Black suits don’t have to be boring and corporate all of the time! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grey is great when paired with black but it’s been done endless times. Luckily for you, grey has a cooler and funkier brother called silver and he’s great fun. Wearing a silver **shirt** can add that additional touch of light that you’d get wearing a white **shirt** without the sharp colour contrast between black and white. Needless to say that you’ll look like a true gent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All collared **shirt**s worn underneath a black suit jacket should be long-sleeved. The look we’re going for here is smart and not casual. If it gets too warm, simply remove your suit jacket and the outfit will still look smart, whether you’re at a wedding, function or at the office. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “I think there's one thing missing from the basic **shirt**s, a black one. I think black **shirt**s always look very good and they have a little bit more ‘sex' in them than light colored **shirt**s.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Silver accents are an exception to the rule, but only when used sparingly. When bringing silver into the mix, consider going with a black **shirt**, black suit, and dark red tie. Then, put on black shoes and a simple white pocket square. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now **shirt** and tie combinations with a black suit are no secret for you, what a perfect time to add some of those coloured **shirt**s we talked about. And whilst you’re at it, why not throw in some funky ties as well? You don’t want to be unprepared for your next big event so plan ahead to fully become a master of contrasts and colour palettes. We guarantee you won’t regret it. One thing’s for sure – no one will ever ask you to stand at the back of pictures at your friend’s wedding because of your questionable taste in **shirt** and tie combinations.

-   Most women love wearing black skirts because they are versatile. However, there are specific colors that can match these skirts. The colors of the **shirt**s and blouses will also depend on what style you want to achieve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A black suit is a blank canvas so you can wear a statement **shirt** to update the look. What better way to try than with a classic country checked **shirt**? Whether it’s a fine check, grid print or gingham, try to use a smaller check print to give off smart vibes, rather than casual. Try to have a black or dark-coloured thread running through the **shirt** though to tie it all together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As said before, black **shirt**s are usually more appropriate for casual occasions but there are ways to go all-black-everything at special gatherings. Opt for a silky black **dress** **shirt** to add some lustre to an otherwise gloomy and potentially dull outfit. Try and pair your black suit jacket and black **shirt** with black tie with a pair of patent black shoes for a luminous finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When trying on a **dress** **shirt** for the right fit, there are a few things to note. You want to choose the fit and size of **shirt** that allows you to cross your arms with ease. Buttons should secure easily as well, and should strain as you stand still. Dress **shirt**s should be longer than typical tops as well, so they can remain tucked in. Around the collar, you should be able to place your index finger between the **shirt** and your neck, and the sleeves should hit right where the thumb and wrist meet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you’re getting ready for a job interview or simply want to look your best for a casual day at the office, it’s important to know what colors and styles of clothing go well together. Wearing a black **dress** **shirt** with khakis is a great way to look sharp and pulled-together, without being too formal. Plus, this classic combo is easy to mix and match with other pieces in your wardrobe. Here are a few tips on how to wear a black **dress** **shirt** with khakis like a pro. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best color that fits a black maxi or a-line skirt for casual spring attire is pale pink. To achieve a down-to-earth summer vibe, pair your skirt with a cropped t-**shirt** that has a neutral color. These colors include white, beige, brown, and gray. But if you want your outfit to be eye-catching, choose bold colors. Examples are bright red and hot pink. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On Fridays, wear your favourite raw, selvedge denim jeans, roll your cuffs (two turns) and throw on a basic white t-**shirt**, before sliding into some woven suede loafers. Your impeccably tailored black jacket adds an elegant, refined profile to your contemporary look. Now, sip on a whisky (neat) and reflect on your week’s accolades.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choose black **dress** **shirt**s that have darted waists. Avoid those **shirt**s that have boxy styles. Aside from that, you can pick belted tops and wrap-style tops. For black pants, select those that emphasize your waist. If you want a form-fitting top, you can try on a pair of straight-leg pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Colour blocking is a fundamental style skill and going with all black suit is perfect for formal ceremonies. A black suit and black **shirt** is the pinnacle of formality, so save this for you most formal occasions. In order to avoid looking excessively two-dimensional, it’s useful to carefully select different fabrics and textures for you to play around with. For example, you can opt for an off-white **dress** **shirt** to add a bit of shimmer to your outfit and prevent your black on black suit from looking too opaque. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because of their versatility, khaki pants are one of the most well-known. By matching any **shirt** available, you will be able to achieve this. The fact that they work well with either formal or casual **dress** codes is a plus. Blue, maroon, and red **shirt**s go well with khaki pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An all-black outfit can look sharp and slick, especially for the party season. Start by contrasting the textures between individual pieces, creating depth and spiking definition. For example, textured tie and **shirt** combinations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can achieve a classic look with your black button-up **shirt**. Dress it up with white-slimming pants and black pumps. You can also add silver hoops and wear red lipstick. This outfit will give you a smart work look . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you aim for a simple office look, wear a plain-colored tailored button-up **shirt**. Mix it with your black pencil skirt. The best combination is a red silk blouse with a pencil skirt for a classic conservative style. But if you want to make it more fun, you can partner the black pencil skirt with floral print or a polka dot blouse. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Is it appropriate for men to wear flannel **shirt**s and khakis? Is this question a debatable one? A flannel **shirt** will allow you to purchase larger size pants in your size. There’s no need to take care of your clothing, as the beltline is made of soft cotton and can be worn both ways. Khakis, which are the modern bridge between sloth and business attire, make a great stand out. A flannel **shirt** has a collar, making it acceptable to be required to wear shoes, a **shirt**, and other **dress** codes at any preppy establishment; even if you are dragged in by those establishments that insist on wearing shoes, **shirt**s, and other **dress** codes, you are accepted. Wearing khakis will make you feel more at ease than wearing jeans with the bare minimum of formal attire. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light blue **shirt**s have also become well-established in the business wear **dress** code. Of course, fundamentally, there is nothing wrong with wearing a slightly darker version. However, you should be aware of the fact that a navy **shirt** does not create a particularly striking contrast to a black suit and will ultimately hardly stand out. If you want to set accents and ensure that the overall look is not too bland, you can also resort to other ideas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may think we’ve gone bonkers but trust us on this one. A patterned **shirt**, whether checked, floral, or dare we say it… striped, can work wonders for a plain black suit. Anything that seems too over the top or eye watering will immediately be toned down to something that’s easy on the eyes, due to the stark magic of the black suit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wearing a coloured **shirt** with your black suit is a great option for office day wear or if you’ve got , say, a job interview coming up. Injecting a bit of colour into your formal wear can make feel wearing a suit less monotonous, but make sure that you are tasteful about it – that means no overly bright or garish colours. Similarly, a wedding is the perfect opportunity to whip out a coloured **shirt**, just as long as you don’t upstage the groom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To get the belt halfway up, make sure it is halfway up your thigh. Khakis can go with a variety of **shirt** colors, but blue, maroon, and red are the most appealing. Khakis can be worn with green, black, white, violet, and gray, but you might want to consider pairing them with a contrasting color like brown. Whether your **shirt** is partially tucked in (aka the French Tuck) or completely tucked in, whether you’re wearing jeans, chinos, or **dress** pants, you should always wear a belt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let's talk about colored versus uncolored black **shirt**s. Either way, it's going to send very similar signals, but a color black **shirt** is always going to be less formal than a white or a light-colored **dress** **shirt**. So if you're wearing it with your suit or sports jacket, it is going to be less formal than a lighter-colored jacket, even if it's solid. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If suits and tie combinations weren’t that important, Justin Timberlake and Jay-Z wouldn’t have had the urge to write and sing a whole song about them. As long as you’ve got your suit and tie, you’re guaranteed to leave it all on the floor tonight – provided that you’re pairing your black suit with the right coloured tie. No need for pre-paired **shirt** and tie sets, just keep reading. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Keep it casual with a clean and well fitted white or black t-**shirt**. Your look will be perfect for smart casual events. Complete the look with black sneakers or a derby shoe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
