-   Putting up a TV **antenna** is one of the best steps you can take toward breaking your reliance on pay TV and saving hundreds of dollars a year. Most areas of the U.S. have access to between 50 and 100 TV stations that broadcast over the air for free. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Winegard Flatwave Amped Pro is truly a “smart” **antenna**, with a built-in signal meter that you control through a mobile app and a Bluetooth connection. As you move the **antenna** around a room, every six seconds it gives you an update on the number of channels you can receive. In every location we tried, using the app to position the **antenna** helped the Flatwave Amped Pro rank either first or second in the number of channels received. The amp is USB-powered, the **antenna** is reversible with black and white sides, and you get a generous amount of cable. However, the cable isn’t detachable, and the Flatwave Amped Pro is usually about twice the price of typical amplified flat **antenna**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This long-range TV **antenna** works very well, starting with a UHF/VHF signal-equipped range with a built-in rotor and full 360-degree coverage to get the best signal. Its rotor is even capable of turning in opposite directions to help prevent tangled cables. 1080p HDTV reception allows for tons of over the air content from ABS, PBS, NBC, and other popular channels without paying for a cable subscription. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Indoor **antenna**s need to be mounted fairly close to your TV. And while putting it out of sight behind the TV would be ideal, this doesn’t always translate to getting the best reception. In other words, you may end up with an **antenna** hanging on your wall in plain view. Make sure the one you select isn’t something you’d hate looking at every day! Many **antenna**s are simple flat squares that can be painted over, which helps a lot in this situation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The reason you need one of these **antenna**s is that you probably live a long way from the nearest tower. But knowing exactly how much distance there is between you and the closest tower is good to know before you buy an **antenna**. The Tablo tool will give you an overhead map view of the nearest broadcast towers in your area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In terms of installation, this long-range TV HDTV **antenna** runs about the baseline. It requires connecting front, middle and rear sections using screws and wingnuts – a more involved process than a pre-assembled **antenna** with snap-on mechanisms. If you are OK with a more involved installation, its 100-mile range and excellent signal reception will most likely compensate for it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finding out that a certain channel you wanted isn’t available in your area can make you think twice about getting a TV **antenna**. Make sure you do your due diligence to understand what channels are available. There are several online tools like rabbitears.info that can help you with this. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We like the fact this long-range **antenna** offers a simplified and lighter weight design. It only uses a rotating head and short **antenna**s as opposed to the longer tree-branch style **antenna**s in its class. full HD (1080P), ultra HD (4K) quality really comes out crisp with little static in strong signal areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

It also has a high gain rating of 32 dB and comes with 33-feet of HD **antenna** coaxial cable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In terms of installation, no other long-range **antenna** we’ve researched comes close. Simply attach a mast clamp and coaxing cable before extending all of its parts open before mounting on a rooftop or outdoor. It’s almost as easy as installing some of the highest rated indoor tv **antenna**s. The free RCA Signal Finder app is also very intuitive with a simple address entry to find nearby channels and select stations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Antennas Direct DB8e 8-Element Bowtie Attic/Outdoor HDTV Antenna $159.99 at Antennas Direct See It (Opens in a new window) The decidedly retro-looking Antennas Direct DB8e 8-Element Bowtie Antenna is actually a very powerful multidirectional outdoor **antenna**. It features two panels, each with four elements and a reflector, that can be angled toward clusters of nearby stations to get the best results. It's still a multidirectional **antenna**, but a big one you can aim to get even better reception from over 70 miles away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our preference is for long-range TV **antenna**s to have a minimum range of 60 miles. In general, opt for a higher range in **rural** areas and a reduced range in urban areas, which are typically closer to broadcast towers. All long-range TV **antenna**s should offer UHF and high VHF reception for a wider variety of content. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Suitable for attic or outdoor mounting Cons Plastic mounting bracket feels a little cheap Best Prices Today: The Winegard Elite 7550 immediately impressed with its ability to pick up more broadcast channels than the competition at higher signal levels. It has a built-in amplifier and performed well on both VHF-High and UHF broadcast bands. Because of its size you’ll want this one in the attic or outside of your house. Read our full Winegard Elite 7550 review Antennas Direct Clearstream 4 Max — Best attic/outdoor TV **antenna**, runner-up Pros Good reception of strong to medium level signals on UHF and VHF-High - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most important consideration when choosing an **antenna** is range. In other words, how far away can the **antenna** be from a broadcast tower and still pick up the signal? For the most part, anything 50 miles and up will be more than enough, and even 35 miles should work, unless you live in a very **rural** area. Any distance below that, you’ll want to make sure there’s a tower close by, or you may have problems getting a good signal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Antennas Direct ClearStream Flex Amplified UHF/VHF Indoor HDTV Antenna $61.07 at Amazon See It (Opens in a new window) The ClearStream Flex is pricier than the ClearStream Eclipse, and larger. Thanks to its bigger size and included amplifier, this indoor **antenna** sports a much longer 50-plus-mile range than the Eclipse. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Monoprice Active Curved HD5 HDTV Antenna $18.00 at Amazon See It (Opens in a new window) Monoprice remains one of the best-kept secrets for home theater enthusiasts and installers, with reliable and inexpensive **antenna**s, cables, and other A/V equipment. The Monoprice Active Curved HDTV Antenna is a simple, inexpensive, slightly curved indoor **antenna** with an amplifier for a 60-mile range. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The ClearStream Eclipse is a simple circle that you can stick on any nearby surface, making it especially useful for TV setups where you don’t have much space but still want to add an **antenna**. It’s even paintable, so you can paint it to match your wall or nearby décor. The 12-foot coaxial cable also gives you plenty of options to place the **antenna** away from your TV. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An **antenna** is only as good as the materials used in its construction. Because these are outdoor **antenna**s, they need to handle wind, rain, snow, ice, and anything else Mother Nature throws at them. The level of weatherproofing you need, however, depends on your environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This best long range TV **antenna** for **rural** areas is very well rounded, starting with Ultra HD and ATSC 3.0 support for an improved audio and video picture adhering to the latest broadcast standards. UHF and VHF reception provides a neat variety of content. We like this long-range TV **antenna** for an attic or mounted outdoors on a rooftop, mountable to a mast. Consider this one of the better **antenna**s on the market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s a bummer when your family camping trip falls on the same dates as a major sporting event. Most RV **antenna**s don’t get great reception in remote locations, so you’ll need to upgrade to catch the game. Here are some options for the best outdoor TV **antenna** for **rural** areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When considering the best indoor TV **antenna**s, many can solve a number of TV problems in one swipe. They let you cut your cable bill, give you access to local news and sports broadcasts, receive HD or 4K broadcasts totally for free (in the right regions), and typically work with built-in TV tuners straight out of the box. And with today’s indoor **antenna** designs, there’s no need to mess with complicated outdoor placements: a nearby window or shelf is all you need! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Picks like our Antenna’s Direct **antenna** have a smaller range at 35 miles, designed primarily for those who live in more urban areas where TV towers tend to have plenty of overlap. This 1byone **antenna** goes the opposite direction. It has a massive 200-mile range that attempts to pick up signals from as many towers as possible, a much better choice for those living in small towns or more **rural** areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While the **antenna** is affordable, it’s surprisingly sturdy. The durable plastic makes it virtually indestructible, and the anodized aluminium makes it ultra-weather resistant. You don’t have to worry about it breaking if you live in an area where it rains a lot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turn on your meter and tune to the lowest broadcast channel in your area. Now rotate your **antenna** 360 degrees and stop at the highest signal strength. Use your compass and mark the direction of the highest **antenna** signal. Rinse and repeat this process for each channel and record the result carefully. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of our favorite features with this long-range TV HDTV **antenna** is its dedicated smartphone app, which allows users to check for nearby obstructions using augmented reality using a top-down map view. It is also a very formidable TV signal finder. Augmented reality also includes a satellite pointer to optimize your **antenna**’s location. It’s a high-end choice for anyone in the market for the best omnidirectional TV **antenna**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Kudos for long-range TV **antenna**s with UV and weatherproofing, helping them better respond to the elements. Copper end coaxial cables and surge protection **antenna**s are good to have. Note, despite the most durable long-range TV **antenna**s, signals are highly susceptible to thunderstorms and heavy rain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Every **antenna** is rated to receive frequencies in a different range. These frequencies are measured in megahertz. To put it simply, an **antenna** with a larger frequency range will be able to receive more channels, provided there’s no interference or signal interruptions from competing frequencies. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you live in an area with hills or forests, you may consider getting an **antenna** with a built-in amplifier (i.e., a preamplifier). The alternative is to purchase an **antenna** without an amp first, test its reception, and attach an amp to it later if you’re not satisfied. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HDTV Antenna has been our budget pick in this guide for a few years running. It performs almost as well as our top pick; if you’re within about 15 miles of the broadcast **antenna**s, you might not miss any channels with this one. It has an inline amplifier, includes a fairly generous amount of cable, and is relatively compact. The only downsides are that the cable is not detachable and the **antenna** is not reversible or paintable, so your only color option is black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the best things about it is that its compactness makes it easy to install in the attic, removing the need for you to set it up outdoors. But if you don’t mind the height, you can use the installation kit included in the box to quickly install the **antenna**. The detailed manual makes things that much easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We use a set-top box to scan for channels and record the number of RF channels received by each **antenna** and their strength. Each RF channel carries a number of digital stations, but the number is different per channel and can change, so digital stations received isn’t as useful a measurement. We scan several times and adjust the direction of the **antenna** on some rescans. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That being said, reducing interference usually relies on raising the **antenna** up higher. Generally speaking, mounting your **antenna** higher will reduce the number of obstacles between it and the broadcast tower you’re trying to receive signal from. Fewer obstacles equals less interference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Antennas Direct ClearStream Eclipse Indoor HDTV Antenna $29.90 at Amazon See It (Opens in a new window) Antennas Direct is a popular brand with a wide selection of indoor and outdoor **antenna**s. The Eclipse Indoor HDTV Antenna is a simple, flat, disc-shaped **antenna** with a stick-on design. You can slap it on any smooth surface, like a window, without using tape or any other adhesive. It's a multidirectional **antenna** and features a 35-mile range. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In terms of installation, this long-range TV outdoor **antenna** runs about mid-range. It does not come preassembled, but simple enough to mount in less than five minutes using a wrench and Phillips screwdriver to clamp together with a J mount masty and two U clamps. Kudos for its weatherproof parts which work well in extreme conditions as low as -50 Celsius. It’s certainly one of the best outdoor TV **antenna**s for rugged climates on our list. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many **antenna**s come with built-in signal amplifiers that increase their effective range by boosting the signal they pick up. This sounds like it should be a great feature to look for, but there are a couple caveats: External power source: Amplified **antenna**s usually require an external power source. With most **antenna**s you just need to connect the coax cable to your TV and you’re set, but **antenna**s with built-in amps also need to be plugged into a power outlet. This can make placement trickier, so keep that in mind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This long-range TV **antenna** handles over-the-air broadcast signals very well across all types of frequencies, good for 100 miles of coverage. It picks up popular channels such as FOX, NBC, PBS with ease. Our only criticism is that it takes incoming signals from a single direction and does not include a built-in rotor for 360° of movement, which helps capture signals more efficiently. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Look for the best long-range HDTV TV **antenna**s to carry a minimum 60-mile range. In general, opt for the longest range possible in **rural** areas sans shorter ranges in urban areas. They should also run VHF and UHF frequencies to get the most channels possible. Built-in amplifiers also work to correct lost signals as a result of cable deterioration and splitting to multiple televisions. Pixelation and dropouts should also be reduced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our only criticism is that this best indoor TV **antenna** offers an up to the 60-mile range and is more susceptible to obstructions such as surrounding buildings and farther distances from broadcast towers. Bonus points for coming in multiple colors and finishes to match rooftop or attic decor, which most long-range TV **antenna**s do not offer. It outperforms even in the best rabbit ear **antenna**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This long-range outdoor TV **antenna** offers a little bit of everything, optimized for indoor attics with excellent VHF and UHF signal reception – good enough for an up to 60-mile range. Free local TV channels such as NBC, ABC, and PBS could be had. Its mounting bracket and mast take less than five minutes to assemble with our preferred snap-on style installation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Knowing the real channel number will help you select an **antenna**. TV broadcasting in North America is spread across three frequency bands: VHF-Low (channels 2 through 6), VHF-High (channels 7 through 13), and UHF (channels 14 through 51). Because of the different frequencies in use, **antenna**s are designed to cover one, two, or three bands. Not every **antenna** covers them all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **antenna** is the best for **rural** hilly areas because it can be extended to nearly 17 feet tall with its boom length and the additional vertical height of the **antenna**. It will receive HDTV reception from towers up to 65 miles away and that range can be extended with Winegard’s Boost coupler. The **antenna** itself is made of zinc-plated steel hardware to improve its resistance to rust and corrosion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   AntennaWeb’s TV station tool categorizes nearby stations based on the sort of outdoor **antenna** you need to tune in. This is because indoor **antenna**s are highly dependent on the architecture of your home and any sort of structures that can interfere with signals. This doesn’t mean the map is useless for indoor **antenna**s, though; yellow and green stations can be tuned into with small and medium multidirectional **antenna**s mounted outdoors, which means you can probably get a signal from them using an indoor multidirectional **antenna**. For farther and weaker stations that require directional **antenna**s or a preamp, you’ll need to be able to mount it outside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not designed to receive VHF TV stations Best Prices Today: The Antennas Direct DB8e’s reception is just as impressive as its looks. This is a large, heavy **antenna** cleverly designed to receive weak signals with two **antenna** arrays, or in areas of better reception to point to towers in different directions. Read our full Antennas Direct DB8e review Antennas Direct 91XG — Best roof-mount TV **antenna**, runner-up Pros Good reception of weak signals - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Excess cable can get messy quick Best Prices Today: This **antenna** impressed us with its ability to pull in more broadcast channels than the competition. Further, those it did receive were a little stronger than from our runner-up, which should make for happier TV viewing. Read our full Winegard FlatWave Amped (model FL-5500A) review Channel Master Smartenna+ — Best amplified indoor TV **antenna**, runner-up Pros Automatic tuning to receive the greatest number of channels - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Directional **antenna**s are, well, directional. They tend to be shaped like fins, arrows, or tubes, and need to be pointed toward the stations they’re tuned to. This means they need to be adjusted to properly get signals from stations, so you’ll need to plan carefully when mounting them. Their ranges can be much, much farther than multidirectional **antenna**s, though, letting you tune into weaker and more distant stations if the **antenna** is pointing at them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you start shopping for an **antenna**, you should check what channels are available near you. AntennaWeb(Opens in a new window) has a helpful tool that lets you enter your location to see where the nearest TV stations are. It even provides a helpful map that shows distance from each station and the type of **antenna** you need to get a strong signal. Once you know what TV you can get near you, you can figure out the best **antenna** to buy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The amplifier of the RCA ANT3ME1 has a built-in signal-level meter that provides a near-instantaneous readout of the signal strength. This feature allows you to quickly find the optimum position for the **antenna**, a process that could take more than an hour if you instead use the TV’s internal channel-scanning process to evaluate different positions. The ANT3ME1 is essentially the same as our previous runner-up, the RCA ANT3ME, but with a slightly wider **antenna** design that helped it to perform roughly equal to our top pick before we used the meter. When we used the meter to fine-tune the **antenna**’s positioning, the ANT3ME1 sometimes outperformed our top pick. But the cable is not detachable, and the amplifier requires an AC outlet rather than USB power. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you’ve made your list, examine the Rabbit Ears results to find the channels you want to watch. Write down the number in parenthesis, which is the “real channel,” the “Direction (true),” and the color (green, yellow, or red). The colors will inform you if an indoor **antenna** will be sufficient, or if you’ll need an attic or roof-mounted model to pull them in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With this omni-directional digital **antenna**, you’ll be able to enjoy signal reception from towers up to 150 miles away. It has a built-in **antenna** for 360-degree reception and a high-gain, low noise amplifier to increase signal strength and reliability. The **antenna** itself is compact and comes with 33 feet of durable coaxial cable to make installation easier. The entire **antenna** housing features a UV-resistant, waterproof design that also improves signal reliability on windy and/or rainy days. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Channel Master **antenna** can receive a variety of signals from towers up to 100 miles away. It’s a directional **antenna** with a six-foot turning radius and 30 pounds of wind resistance (tested at wind speeds of 100 mph). It comes with a U-bolt mounting clamp to make installation easier and is designed to handle extreme weather. It’s made of half-inch aluminum elements with bifurcated rivets for added strength. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With a 109-inch boom length, you’ll be able to extend the Channel Master nearly 10 feet above the surface you mount it to. It receives low frequencies between 54 and 216 MHz and high frequencies between 470 and 700 MHz. The gain of this **antenna** is 10 dB for VHF frequencies and 16 dB for UHF frequencies and it has a front-to-back gain ratio of 17 dB. It’s also equipped with an F-type output connector and weighs a total of 11.5 pounds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No matter where (or in what city) we hung it, the Antennas Direct ClearStream Flex always ranked among the best in pulling in the most TV channels. Its flat design makes it easy to hang on a wall, and it’s reversible, with black and white sides (it’s also paintable). The **antenna** comes with a detachable amplifier that can draw power from your TV’s USB port, as well as a long, detachable cable, which is convenient if you want to replace it with a cable of a different color or length. The only downside is that the ClearStream Flex is a little larger than average for a flat **antenna**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It can drive a crystal-clear 4K picture to your TV with ease. But that’s not even the best part. The HD2605 comes with four splitters, allowing the **antenna** to connect to up to eight TVs. One of these **antenna**s is all you need to make the entire home cable-free. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Multidirectional **antenna**s are designed to pick up signals from any direction. They’re typically flat, shaped like rectangular sheets or discs that can be easily mounted on a window. If mounted properly, they can tune into any station within range, regardless of whether the station’s positioned north, south, east, or west. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The connection from your **antenna** to your TV is every bit as important as the **antenna** itself. You need a high-quality coaxial cable (“coax” for short) for the job. Coax has a center wire that carries the signal and is surrounded by a plastic insulator. An outer braid shields the center cable from interference, and an outer sheath protects the cable from the elements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The BEFORE **antenna** is made to support two TVs at a time without the need for a splitter that reduces signal strength. It’s rated for VHF frequencies between 40 and 300 MHz and UHF frequencies between 470 and 890 MHz. This **antenna** also receives FM signals and includes a built-in super low noise amplifier to provide a clearer signal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unless you have a stockpile of coaxial cables lying around, you’re probably going to need to use the one that comes with your **antenna**. Double-check that it’s not too long or too short for your room! Too long, and you’ll end up with a mass of cable dangling in space. Too short, and you may not be able to position the **antenna** optimally.
