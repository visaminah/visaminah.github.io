## 39 Interesting Facts What Colors Go With Dark Brown Wood Floors | paint colors that go with dark brown wood floors
-   Hardwood is an elegant choice in a flooring material that is versatile and timeless. This flooring type will complement both modern and traditional decor styles. Wood flooring adds an unmatched warmth and elegance to almost any room in your home. Different wall **colors** can bring out different undertones of your hardwood flooring, changing the look of your space altogether. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For Either Option, Earthy Colors Work Consider light and earthy hues to enhance the natural look of your oak. Everything from a gray to a lush green would bring out the grains and gorgeousness in your oak planks. Rich and light **colors** that complement the richness of oak, in any shade, include: Navy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wood **colors** and tones appear on many elements around our homes, including furniture, flooring, cabinetry, and trim. Stains and finishes can range from natural wood to light blonde to rich mahogany. These neutral hues play an important role in a room's overall color scheme. The paint **colors** and other accessories in the space, such as upholstered furniture and wall decor, should work together to highlight and enhance the wood's beauty, not clash with it. Refer to our guide to help you choose the best **colors** for wood tones and create a palette that showcases wood's natural good looks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For paint **colors** that go with red oak floors, consider hues that bring out the floor undertones. Dark and cool blue and green tones are excellent for enhancing the look of red flooring. Consider **colors** and shades such as: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To choose wall **colors** or fabrics that will enhance your wood pieces, consider the dominant hues in the finish to help guide your selections. You should also consider whether you prefer the drama of a high-contrast color scheme or the richness of low-contrast pairings. And don't worry about all the wood pieces in a room matching; the gathered-over-time look of mixed woods is perfect for spaces with a casual, comforting ambience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you walk into a room, the floor is one of the first things you see, so recognizing the components of the **brown** color of your floor is a prerequisite for choosing the **colors** that best go with them. If your floor is hardwood, the **colors** you choose for the walls should have tones that complement or contrast with the red, orange and yellow tones of the wood. If you can see green in the floor color -- which is possible with some hardwoods -- that's an important color to keep in mind when choosing the wall paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Warm wood undertones include red, yellow and orange. For warm undertones, opt for blue and green paint tones. You’ll likely want to avoid too much tan and cream because it won’t do anything to bring out your floor’s undertones and could appear too warm. Neutral wood undertones: Neutral wood undertones include gray, beige and taupe. Neutral hardwood flooring is more versatile — choose warm or cool paint **colors** for contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pairing hues of equal intensity or value creates low contrast. This doesn't necessarily mean the furniture fades into the background, however. For instance, when you put a dark mahogany chest or ebony table against a deep red or blue-green wall, you create a balance between two hues of equal strength. The value of the wood color equals that of the wall. The same principle works with medium **brown** woods and muted or medium-tone **colors**; the effect is more restrained because the tones are subdued. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With this, the flooring must be secured and fine to stand for years. However, it is not only durability which matters when deciding the best flooring. The **colors** and texture of the flooring is equally important. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you prefer more color on the walls, you have many options. Black is neutral, so you can pair virtually any color with it. Consider cool blues and greens for wall **colors**, being mindful of the size of the space. A dark shade on the wall with a dark floor tends to close in the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also use the wood **colors** as a cue for wall **colors**. For example, if the dominant color in the wood appears to be red, then a green background will enhance and intensify the wood's hue. Golden-yellow woods look handsome against warm red and earthy greens, teal, or eggplant. Brown woods with yellow undertones relate to buttery walls yet stand out boldly for high-contrast drama. Antique woods, which have a patina that offers depth and complexity, often combine several tones, which means they can look good against various light or dark **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The warmth of honey-toned pine shows up well against a medium green. This shade can bring out the yellow tones in the wood and balance them with cool contrast. A pale gray-green is another attractive, low-key choice to pair with light wood tones. Orange-toned wood + blue: As these **colors** are directly opposite each other on the color wheel, bright, intense blue will highlight orange tones in the wood. This high-contrast look is great for those who love bold color, but it could be too intense for areas such as bedrooms when you want to encourage relaxation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paint **colors** for oak floors can be especially tricky. But an easy-to-use color wheel rule comes into play in this dramatic room. Complementary **colors** are those located directly across from each other on the color wheel. Here, that's demonstrated by a rich midnight blue, like PPG's Victory Blue, on the walls and a yellow-orange tone on the wood floor. Dark wall **colors** can also add instant intimacy to an otherwise formal space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Acrylic is yet another dark cabinet material option. Acrylic cabinets are made from a durable, high-gloss, solid-color surface. They are available in both dark and light **colors**, although the color range is somewhat more constricted when compared to laminate options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So for flooring with cool tones, choose a warmer paint color for the walls like Pure White by Sherwin-Williams. And for warmer toned floors, stick to cooler wall hues on the color wheel. Cooler paint **colors** like Oxford White by Benjamin Moore allow for enough contrast against warm wood flooring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cool wood undertones: Cool wood undertones include green, blue and pink. For cool wood undertones, paint the walls yellow or red since they’re warm **colors**. Choose your wall shades carefully to avoid blue or green, cool **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By choosing contrasting **colors**, rooms feel more balanced and comfortable. Stray from choosing paints with similar undertones as your wood floors since they can make your space look too cohesive. If you’d like your **colors** to be equal, choose subtle wall color shades that are easy on the eye. With the right color combination, your home will be the perfect oasis for comfort and style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Flooring and wall **colors** are some of the most important choices that you will make for your space.
