## 9 Interesting Facts How To Use Peat Moss In Container Gardening | how to use peat moss in container gardening
-   Compost is not a new amendment for most gardeners; however, it can also be used as an effective **peat** **moss** alternative. When added to soil, it can improve soil structure, increase water infiltration and retainment, and add beneficial microbes. Using compost helps to reduce landfill waste, while providing your soil with rich nutrients, reducing your need for chemical fertilizers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Additionally, **peat** bogs provide a unique ecosystem, which supports numerous insects, birds, and plants. Scientists consider **peat** bogs to be as fragile and important as the rainforests. Thus, exploiting this valuable flora is a valid cause for concern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may have heard that using **peat** **moss** in the garden is bad for the environment. But how can it be? Peat **moss** has been used in gardens everywhere since the 1940s. It’s been the go-to amendment for many growers to help lighten soil and aid in water retention and drainage. While **peat** **moss** provides very few nutrients, it does supply beneficial bacteria and is a natural fungicide for your garden plants. But while this is all great for the grower, it’s not so great for the planet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peat **moss** consists of various sphagnum **moss** species that have decomposed. Sphagnum **moss** is often referred to as **peat** **moss** because it is marketed and sold in this decayed state. The plant’s cell structure allows it to hold almost 20 times its dry weight in the water, making it an extremely effective material for other plants to maintain hydration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Coconut coir has an ideal 6.0 pH level, which is perfect for most garden plants, and it contains natural antifungal properties. The processing and shipping of coconut coir make it a less favorable green alternative; however, coconuts are grown and harvested for consumption already, so it is considered an eco-friendlier alternative to **peat** **moss**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pine needles are best used as a top dressing or mulch for plants or trees. The needles knit together, creating a mat that water can penetrate, but the wind doesn’t easily blow away. Unlike **peat** **moss**, however, pine needles do not retain water and can’t help with increasing water retention. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many homeowners are graced with a yard full of evergreens, making pine needles easy to come by. Pine needles make a readily available and renewable **peat** **moss** alternative. While pine needles can alter the texture of your soil, they do not significantly affect nutrient levels. The tannic acid in pine needles makes them acidic but does not necessarily affect the pH of the surrounding soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Woody materials, such as wood fiber, sawdust, or composted bark aren’t the most ideal **peat** **moss** alternative, but they do offer some benefits. Wood-based materials have been added to commercial potting mixes for decades as a way to improve water retention and add organic matter. It opens the soil for better air circulation and water movement. The pH level in wood can be low, making the soil more acidic, which is good for acid-loving plants such as rhododendrons and azaleas, but not be the best option for plants that prefer a more alkaline environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Peatlands store nearly a third of all the world’s soil carbon. Once harvested, the harmful carbon dioxide is released back into the environment. And while **peat** **moss** is technically renewable, the rate of growth is extremely slow, taking centuries to fully develop. It is being harvested faster than we could ever grow it, essentially making it non-renewable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
