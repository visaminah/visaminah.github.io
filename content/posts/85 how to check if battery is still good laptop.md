## 85 Things You Should Know About How To Check If Battery Is Still Good Laptop | Battery Benchmark Laptop
-   If you take good care of your **battery**, you can extend its life. Follow your **laptop**’s recommended power settings, especially when it is off the charger. Keep your **battery** as cool as you can while in use or consider getting a cooling pad. Calibrate your **battery** once every six months or so to see how your **battery** is doing and keep tabs on it using BatteryInfoView. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While there are many great options for both Mac and PC fans on the market, no **laptop** is designed to last forever. If you’re experiencing power issues with your device, it may simply be due to its age. Generally, **laptop** batteries become problematic after 1-2 years or 300-400 charge cycles. If your **laptop** is older, your **battery** has likely been living on borrowed time and is ready to be replaced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To save even more power, take a tour of your apps and quit any that are running in the background and steadily eating into your **battery** life. On Windows 10, for example, we suggest you search for and enable the Battery Saver. This mode will automatically turn on when your **laptop** reaches around 20% **battery** life (more down below on why this is particularly important). This will automatically block background apps, keep your features like Calendar from syncing or pushing notifications, lower screen brightness, and other various changes that will conserve your **battery** so you can get to an outlet ASAP. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All **laptop**s are designed to cool themselves during use and dispel excess heat. If you notice your **laptop** is hot to the touch, your **battery** is likely working too hard and unable to cool itself. Often, an excessively hot **laptop** will also be noisy since the internal fans are working overtime to cool the gadget. NOTE: Always unplug your **laptop** and stop use if the machine is overheating to avoid further damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Furthermore, the **battery** is highly crucial because the device is mobile. If you look at the charge indicators on the **laptop**, you can determine if the charger is terrible. You can also identify a defective **battery** by running software, or only when the **laptop** is connected. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Today’s lithium-ion batteries are durable, but they can only take so much heat. For example, if you are charging your **battery** and it starts to get overly warm, perhaps because the CPU or graphics processor is working hard or the environment is overly hot, then shut the device down and pop the **battery** out if possible. Give it a break so that it can cool down, or you can move it to someplace with a lower temperature. Many modern **laptop**s have sealed batteries, in which case shutting the machine down and letting it cool is highly recommended if maximizing the **battery**’s lifespan is your concern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You also have specific pre-warning indications, so you can upgrade before your machine is useless. There are techniques for individuals using a **laptop** to find out whether their **battery** needs to be replaced. Let’s look at the various symptoms to look for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For optimal functionality, you must consistently update your computer’s software. When the manufacturer releases a new update, it not only has patches and upgrades but can also help programs run more efficiently, which will conserve **battery** power. The same operating system on a later patch could use significantly less **battery** power, giving your **battery** a longer lifespan without changing anything else. And so, review your OS and keep your machine — and its **battery** — on a healthy diet of updates. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The blue PowerShell command window will emerge so you can automatically type commands in Windows 10. Type or paste powercfg /**battery**report /output “C:\**battery**-report.html” in the box and hit Enter to start the command. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, if you’re one of the lucky ones and your **battery** hasn’t bit the dust yet, there are ways to check and see if your **battery** is on the way out. Click the **battery** icon in your taskbar (Windows) while your **laptop** is plugged in. If you see the **battery** has only charged up part of the way and is no longer charging, this is a decent indication that something is going on with your **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the most obvious signs it may be time to reassess your **laptop** **battery** is if it dies much sooner than it used to. On average, a full charge should produce about six hours of power or longer depending on the programs used. If your **laptop** is barely making it past a couple hours, it’s likely a sign the **battery** needs replacing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You shouldn’t leave your **laptop** in this state all the time, though, just when you’d drain the **battery** very quickly. As mentioned, it’s better to store your **battery** at 40% to 50% capacity than it is to store it at 100% capacity if you don’t plan on using it for a bit. Degradation is faster on fully charged, unattended batteries, especially at high temperatures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Nothing can put a damper on your **laptop** experience quite like a faulty **battery**. From trouble charging to overheating and more, there are a few tell-tale signs to look for when a malfunctioning **battery** is affecting your **laptop**’s performance. To help you spot the issue fast, CPR has compiled six common signs you need to replace your **laptop** **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **laptop** needs a working charger, power socket, motherboard, and **battery** to be able to charge. That gets you the juice to use your **laptop** while you’re on the go. When any of these four parts start to malfunction, you might end up having to plug in your **laptop** all the time. Let’s look at why and how these issues happen. Some of these are quite unavoidable, but you can still fix them pretty easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some computers appear on the **battery** symbol with a red X when it is severely low. If this happens, you can also get a notification when you pop up the **battery** symbol, which states, ‘think of substituting your **battery**.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you don’t want to download any dedicated apps, you still have options available. For example, you can open up PowerShell on your Windows computer and run the command “powercfg /**battery**report,” which will provide you a file path to this somewhat secret report. Copy or drag it to a browser window, and you’ll get a page with full information on your **battery**, including recent usage, cycle counts, usage history, and more. It doesn’t have the smooth interface of a monitoring app, but you don’t have to download anything extra to get it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When a **laptop** **battery** gets too hot, the electrochemical reactions inside speed up — but that doesn’t mean that the **battery** grows more efficient. Instead, the **battery** is now producing lots of energy that it cannot use and cannot safely route to any hardware. This creates even more heat, compounding the problem. Not only can this eventually damage the inside of the **battery** permanently, but it also wears the **battery** out with a bunch of chemical reactions that aren’t necessary but burn through a **battery**’s lifespan anyway. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Windows 10 operating systems provide a **battery** saver mode under their power settings. If you turn on the **battery** saver mode when your power is running out, you’ll be able to extend the **battery** life until you can get to a charger. By activating the **battery** saver mode on your computer, you will safeguard your **battery** from the damage that comes with letting it reach a 0% charge. MacOS has similar abilities. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It can make the other internal components of your computer more stressful if your **battery** uses more power to operate your application. In turn, this can heat your computer, leading to a severe fire risk. Is your PC heating up fast? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s no doubt that all batteries will wear out with time and usage. In general, users of Dell **laptop**s will notice an obvious decrease in the run time of their **battery** after 18 to 24 months. The power user may even notice this issue within 18 months. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Windows PowerShell **battery** report is generated, a built-in command-line tool that you never used before. The quickest option is to right-click on the Start icon and choose Windows PowerShell (Admin) from the menu. A pop-up window can ask for permission to make device changes; say yes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using the CD/DVD player, streaming media and the screen brightness use up the most **battery**. Dimming your screen even a lit bit can give you noticeably more **battery** life. Most **laptop**s have a power management control panel where power use can be reduced while on **battery** power, such as reducing the brightness of your LCD screen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Design Capacity is the original strength of the **battery** and the Full Change Capacity is performance you are currently getting. As the Full Charge Capacity number goes down, the less **battery** life you will get. If the Full Change Capacity is much lower than the Design Capacity, it’s time for a new **battery**. Confusing? Frankenstein Computers is here to help with ordering and installation of replacement parts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Batteries will eventually die, even when they are cared for properly. It can be frustrating when your **laptop** dies suddenly because of the **battery**. By following the steps outlined above, you can get a good idea of how your **battery** is doing and when you’ll need to replace it and avoid any infuriating shutdowns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is the BatteryMon software that will be used for checking your **laptop**’s **battery** health. You can download it here (it’s free). The steps are as follows: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This will generate a report called **battery**-report.html located in the Users\Your Username folder on your C: drive. Open and scroll down to the Battery Information section: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some serious **laptop** **battery** faults can be quite serious. You may notice that the **battery** is expanded and pushes the touchpad upwards. This can jam or break the touchpad. You definitely should get professional help if your **battery** is leaking fluid, or feels extremely hot. A damaged **battery** can leak corrosive liquid or even catch on fire spontaneously. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On many Windows **laptop**s, users have the option to replace their batteries if it looks like the current **battery** is performing very poorly. Here’s HP’s guide on how to do it, for example. Find the right **battery** model compatible with your **laptop** model if you want to go this route. Otherwise, you can always have a professional take care of it for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   b) Optimization status means that your **laptop**’s **battery** has been given an ideal cycle count and will remain in its top condition until it reaches the maximum threshold. In other words, your **battery** health is optimal. You can also see this detailed information from within the Battery Report from Step 1c. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also save it as a text file by changing the ‘Save As Type’ to All Files (*.*), giving it any name you want, and hitting enter after clicking ‘ Save ‘. Then open this saved text file to view all of the **battery**’s information. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While the occasional glitch may not always signify **battery** issues, be sure to make a note of how often your **laptop** powers down on you. If your Mac or PC powers off unexpectedly, and especially after a recent charge, you can likely assume a faulty **battery** is the cause. Try charging your **laptop** again, but if the problem persists your **battery** may be out of juice permanently. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Check your warranty to see if you have a replacement available for free or look online to buy your **laptop** **battery** replacement. Depending on your **laptop**, batteries can be relatively cheap. Most decent replacements are around $20 or less. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 3: This will take you to a new screen with information about your **battery**. You can see the cycle count, which will give you a good idea about how long the **battery** has been used and if it may be showing age-related problems. Apple says its MacBook batteries can last up to 1,000 cycles, but batteries nearing that number will probably experience some issues. You can also see a broad Condition report that will show if the MacBook is detecting any serious problems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your **laptop** is still not showing you accurate **battery** information, there are a few steps you can take to test your **battery** further to see if it is truly time to replace it. Unfortunately, Windows doesn’t come with a way to show you what your **battery** capacity is compared to the capacity it is designed for. Luckily, there is a third party software available to do this. The best part? It’s free (and absolutely clean)! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Likewise, keep the **laptop** off of your lap. If discomfort isn’t a good enough reason, with many machines, you’re also making the problem worse by blocking vents. You’ll want to make sure that both vents that pull in cool air and those that expel hot air are able to do their jobs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It can be tough to know at a glance just how your **battery** is doing. Devices like iPhones come with native **battery** maintenance settings and alerts that provide at least some information, but these diagnostics are harder to find on **laptop**s unless you install them yourself. Here are a couple of **battery**-monitoring app options for you to consider. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   PowerShell will inform you of the name and location of a created HTML **battery** life report on your PC. In this scenario, **battery**-report.html is called and has been saved on the C disc. You can now close PowerShell safely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally, people tend to leave the computer connected to the main power all day. However, this can eventually produce a fire risk. It’s time to consider a new **battery** if your **laptop** **battery** doesn’t keep charging. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In ancient, less enlightened times, there was a problem called “**battery** memory” that caused nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries to “forget” their full charge capacity and start charging at lower and lower levels. This problem doesn’t exist any longer thanks to modern lithium-ion batteries, but it has led to a lot of poor advice and arguments about **battery** care based on outdated information. It’s time to clear the air. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike many desktop computers, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to **laptop**s. Every machine is a little different, so finding out as much as you can about your **laptop** and its **battery** is important. Our tips apply to lithium-ion batteries, which are, by far, the most widely used batteries in modern **laptop**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your **laptop** charger is where power is transferred from the power point to your **laptop**. As a power adaptor, it converts the right voltage of power into the **laptop**. As most electronics do fail after long term use, it could also break down in the same way. This problem comes with a pretty obvious fix: get a new **laptop** charger, easy as. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sadly, computers don’t last forever. The **battery** is the most common region of a **laptop** that usually fails first. Battery failure can occur without warning at any time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Battery is used frequently for powering electrical devices like **laptop** and mobile phone. Any **battery** will wear down as time goes by. It’s necessary for you to check the health of **battery** so that you can decide whether you need to replace it with a new one or not. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, and perhaps most importantly, you should avoid placing your **laptop** anywhere it might become hot. That includes your car on a hot summer day, beneath a window that gets direct sunlight, or near a space heater. Unusual conditions such as these can do a lot of damage to a **battery** in a short period of time, though you may not realize it immediately. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In addition to issues stemming from charging, it may also be a warning sign if your **laptop** charges exceptionally slowly. A healthy **laptop** **battery** will charge quickly and retain its power when disconnected from the charger. If your **laptop** is charging at a snail’s pace, or even worse- only charging when connected to the outlet, you may need to replace your **laptop** **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Taking proper care of your **laptop**’s **battery** is important for ensuring your mobile machine can run as long as possible. Although **battery** technology has evolved in the background, outdating “best practices” from a few years ago, there are still a number of ways you can extend (or reduce) your **laptop** **battery**’s health. We’ve rounded up the top tips for how to care for your **laptop**’s **battery**, from how long you should leave it plugged in to how low you should let the **battery** drain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spare computer parts can come in handy when you need to run tests on your **laptop**’s hardware. If you’ve got a spare charger lying around, you can test your current charger’s status in no time. The spare charger should be able to charge the **laptop** if it’s a charger failure issue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is where having a warranty on your **laptop** comes in handy. The warranty on my Asus ultrabook came with one free **battery** replacement in the first two years. Near the end of my warranty, the **battery** was still fine but I wanted to take advantage of the offer so I ordered the **battery** from Asus. Moral of the story: you paid for the warranty, use it! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Once done with the installation, plug-in your **laptop** into AC power before launching the program. For non-AC power **laptop**s, unplug them first then plug-in to AC power after running this program. Keep in mind that if you’re using a **laptop** equipped with an external docking station/port replicator, please detach it first whenever necessary – having both plugged in at the same time could cause a short circuit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes a defective **battery** creates complications, so you have to remove it and use a **laptop** connected to a wall. How many years does a **laptop** **battery** last? A **laptop** **battery**, on average, lasts from two to four years (around 1,000 total charges). The whole life depends on the type of **battery**, how the computer is handled and how often you use your **laptop**. Is it worth replacing **laptop** **battery**? Regardless of how properly you handle the **battery** in your **laptop**, it will ultimately die. If you're fortunate, it's time to replace your **laptop** when your **battery** dies. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After following these steps, you may find that your **laptop** has charged all the way back up to 100%. If so, that’s great! Your **battery** is fine. It just needed to reset. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, you may choose to use pre-boot diagnostics to run tests on your **battery**. Pre-boot diagnostics is a built-in tool on all computers for users to diagnose possible issues on their hardware. With this tool, you can test the **battery**, and other parts like the hard drive and RAM. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can use BatteryInfoView (scroll to Feedback, towards the bottom of the page to download). Read the instructions and run the executable. This allows you to check what your **battery**’s manufactured capacity was intended to be against what your **battery** capacity is now. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you don’t find anything wrong with your **laptop** after running these tests and you still can’t fix the problem, it might be time to take the **laptop** to a professional. You might have a more serious issue, like a motherboard failure. It might be easier to leave it to the experts with these potentially dangerous and complicated hardware issues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s safe to leave most modern **laptop**s plugged in. In fact, most high-powered gaming **laptop**s work best when plugged in. The most important aspect of **battery** health is the discharge cycle. No matter how cautious you are, your **battery** will degrade over time as you discharge and recharge it. Whenever you’re running an intensive application — such as a game — you can run it while your **laptop** is plugged in to reduce the number of discharge cycles on your **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A sudden shutdown without any warning is an indication that your **battery** has died and is in need of replacement. A **battery** that doesn’t charge all the way may be an indication that the **battery** is beginning to fail. Calibrating your **battery** is always a good idea when these problems begin to occur; calibration can give you a better idea of what your **battery** health is and aid in determining whether or not it is time to replace it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At the end of the report comes a current, final **battery** life estimate. In this scenario, my PC is 6:02:03 a.m. at design capacity but is currently 4:52:44. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The power socket, where the charger and the **laptop** connects, can also fail due to long term use. As a connective part, the socket can wear out or get bent out. This makes it harder for the current to get through to the **battery**. It might still be able to charge the **laptop**, but may take much longer, and might not even reach full charge at all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Open and access the C drive for Windows File Explorer. The **battery** life report should be saved as an HTML file. Click the file double to open it in your favourite web browser. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How do I know if my **laptop** **battery** needs replacing? The highest sign you need a new **laptop** **battery** is overheating. A little more heat is usual as the **battery** runs. Your **laptop** **battery** that is not charged when plugged in may be a symptom that it needs to be replaced. Can I use my **laptop** with a dead **battery**? If the **battery** has failed considerably or the charging circuit has a defect, it may explode with the **laptop**. As long as you can, If a **battery** is dead, you can generally operate the **laptop**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In addition to performance issues, most **laptop**s are already equipped with technology to check their overall health. For Mac users, expect to receive a **battery** service warning when service is needed. For Windows users, consider generating a **battery** report to check your **battery**’s health. Depending on the messages from your **laptop**, you can easily determine whether it’s time to replace your **laptop** **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As with many **battery**-related questions, the issue of keeping your **laptop** plugged in when it’s reached full capacity is hotly debated, so there’s nothing wrong with turning your machine off and unplugging it if you feel more comfortable doing that. But generally speaking, the best thing you can do for your lithium-ion **battery** is to avoid letting it discharge below 20%. Plug it in and charge it when you can, and then rinse and repeat. The good news is that with modern batteries and systems, there’s really not much else you need to do — outside of anticipating that your **battery** will eventually start losing its overall capacity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The indication that your **battery** is dead will come if you try to unplug your **laptop** and it immediately dies without warning. Sorry to tell you, but your **battery** has passed on. At this point, there really isn’t a way to fix it. Just go to your **laptop** manufacturer’s website (if you have a warranty on your **laptop**) or good old Amazon and get yourself a shiny, new **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **battery** report provides several different sections with information about your **battery**. You can see exactly what kind of **battery** you have, recent usage data, and a long log of usage history. You can use this information to look for anything suspicious or out of place about **battery** operation. The Battery Capacity History and the Battery Life Estimates are particularly useful to check if your **battery** performance has declined recently or gradually lessened throughout the life of your **laptop**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   iv) A charge indicator with color codes for different levels of **battery** life. Just download it from their site, run the installer then choose a hotkey to run the app. The app will start running then integrate itself into the system tray. Right-click on its icon anytime for more options like calibrating the **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So what are the signs of a dead **battery**? One obvious sign is that it doesn’t hold very much charge, or not at all. Your **laptop** might shut down immediately after the power cord comes off. Apple Mac users may even get **battery** error messages like “service **battery**”, “replace soon”, or “replace now”. Dell and HP users may also get similar messages to service the **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If any one part in this process is faulty, then you’ll notice that your **battery** is not charging. Or you may experience other issues like the **battery** running out of charge very quickly, or charges very slowly. Charger or **battery** failures are the more common causes of a **laptop** that isn’t charging. Either way, testing your **laptop** can help you find out what’s wrong. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In some **laptop**s, the manufacturer has included a utility to calibrate your **battery** for you. Check the manufacturer’s website for the manual for your **laptop** and see if you have this utility. If you do, simply allow this utility to calibrate your **laptop** for you. It takes some time (nearly 3 hours for my **laptop**) so don’t be alarmed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Laptop is widely used for study and work. The **battery** is an indispensible hardware component in **laptop**. It powers up your **laptop**, making it possible for you to take the **laptop** out for work without connecting to the power supply. However, the **battery** will begin to wear down over time. This post offered by MiniTool tells you how to do Dell **battery** test in 3 ways. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Check your guarantee to check whether you have a free replacement or purchase your replacement **laptop** **battery** online. Batteries can be pretty cheap, depending on your **laptop**. Most reasonable substitutions amount to about $20 or less. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your **laptop** **battery** is important. You rely on it to keep your computer running, whether you’re working on a presentation or catching up on emails. So it’s important to make sure your **battery** is healthy and performing at its best. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Repeat step 1 and step 2 mentioned in the previous situation. Shift to the Advanced tab at the top by using the arrow keys. Look for the Battery Health option from the list. If it says This **battery** is performing normally, it means your **battery** is in good health. You don’t need to replace it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The very first thing you should do is calibrate your **battery**. Quite simply, calibration means allowing your **laptop** **battery** to discharge almost completely and then charge it back up again. This allows your **battery** to reset and do some self-diagnosis to see how much juice is actually left in your **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adaptive brightness modes are also a good idea to enable. These modes adjust your screen’s brightness according to ambient light to help save **battery** life when you are in a well-lit spot. You can also activate your **laptop**’s dark mode, which saves energy and also might be easier on your eyes. Any option that helps you save energy will prolong your **laptop**’s **battery** life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Contrary to some recommendations, you don’t need to routinely discharge a lithium-ion **battery** completely and then recharge it to somehow reboot or calibrate it — this is a destructive practice that’s very hard on your **battery**. Whether or not it’s a smart idea to perform a complete discharge a couple of times a year remains an unanswered question. Generally, the consensus seems to be that letting your **battery** discharge (without bottoming it out — aim for around 20%) and then charging it when possible is the best practice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   i) Current **battery** capacity as a percentage and as an icon with an indication for charging mode: This built-in feature allows you to check the current Battery health by seeing its charge rating in Windows itself. You can right-click on the desktop and select ‘Battery Status’. Here it will show you the current rating of your **laptop**’s **battery** and what it implies about your **laptop**’s **battery** health. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All **laptop** batteries are built to handle a certain number of charge cycles, usually somewhere around 500 full cycles — and sometimes even more. Essentially, a charge cycle equals one full discharge down to 0% and then a recharge back up to 100%. A discharge down to 50% and then back to 100% would equal half a cycle. Over time, each charge cycle decreases a **battery**’s capacity from its design specifications, meaning that the fewer times you drain it, the longer the **battery** lasts — all other things being equal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2.
