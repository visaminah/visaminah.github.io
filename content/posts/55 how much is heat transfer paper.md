Many people choose to use their hand held clothing iron. Our heat **transfer** **paper** is great for beginner crafters all the way to an advanced crafter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many customers complain to the custom heat **transfer** manufacturers, blaming them for bad **transfer** **paper**. The custom heat **transfer** supplier simply will have the customer send back one or two pieces from the customer’s custom screen printed **transfer** order or pull one from the production run.

-   Transfers can be heat pressed onto fabrics (both natural and synthetic) using standard plastisol supplier **transfer**s, color copier, or thermal wax & ink-jet computer **transfer** **paper**. Heat **transfer**s can also be printed onto mugs, plates, tiles, mousepads, ceramics, metals, glass and wood. For these substrates, sublimation **transfer**s are used. The important factor when heat pressing with sublimation **transfer**s onto non-natural fabric substrates is to be sure the material has the proper polyester synthetic coating, as well as a UV coating if protection from the sun and other rays is an issue. For this reason it is best to get the materials pre-coated from a supplier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the wax **paper** is in position, use a credit card to scrape the back of the wax **paper**, applying pressure so that the ink is **transfer**red onto the fabric. When the whole design has been **transfer**red, remove the wax **paper** by peeling it up. Don’t pull it across the **paper** or the ink could smear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is vital that you choose the right **paper** for the colour of the substrate you are printing on. In general terms, images printed image on Light Transfer Paper will provide a vibrant and accurate image on white and light coloured fabric. Ink is translucent and is not visible unless it is laid on a white or very light coloured background. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll also have better results if you use a high-resolution printer. High-resolution printers are better to prevent your image from being blurry or pixelated. Laser printers also work well for really detailed images, but again, you have to make sure to use **transfer** **paper** compatible with laser printers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you don’t have **transfer** **paper**, you can also make iron-on **transfer**s using wax **paper**. It’s worth noting that this should only be done with an Inkjet printer as Laser printers use more heat to melt the wax **paper**. Before printing on wax **paper**, you’ll still need to create and format your design on the computer to make sure that it is correct before printing it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first thing you’ll need to do is decide on a design. You can buy ready-made designs at your local craft store (and even kits with **transfer** **paper** included) or you can download designs from the internet. If you’re feeling creative, you can also create your own design on the computer using design software. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Transparent or clear heat **transfer** **paper** is mainly used to apply onto white fabrics; however, it can also be applied onto other very light colored fabrics. Transparent heat **transfer** **paper** is a very thin and transparent film. When applied to colored fabrics the color of the fabric shows through the transparent heat **transfer** film. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unit price above for a 10 sheets pack. Full color **transfer**s in any quantity – on virtually any material. Economical. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To use iron-on **transfer** **paper**, you have to create your design and print it on the right kind of **transfer** **paper** or buy a pre-made design. Once you’ve got your design, cut it out and position it onto the clothing. Then, just iron over it to **transfer** the design onto the fabric. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Transfer **paper** requires the use of high heat, so you definitely shouldn’t use any type of fabric that can become damaged easily due to heat. This is especially true for delicate fabrics such as wool and silk. And because different types of fabrics can handle different levels of heat, some **transfer** **paper**s are designed for specific types of fabric, such as cotton or polyester. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A common mistake (and an expensive one due to the cost of the **paper**) is not reversing the image prior to the **transfer** process where necessary. When using light **transfer** **paper** you must reverse the image and print it in mirror mode. The image is placed face down on the garment and when the **transfer** process is complete, it will appear the right way round. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are using transparent heat **transfer** **paper** you WILL need to mirror your image as the printed side of the decal will be placed down onto the fabric you are working with. When applying the clear heat **transfer** **paper**, the backing stays on until the heat **transfer** has been applied. However, if you are using white heat **transfer** **paper** you WILL NOT need to mirror your image as the printed side of your decal will face up when applying to the fabric you are working with. Another thing to remember when you are working with white heat **transfer** **paper** is that you will remove the backing from the printed decal before pressing onto your fabric. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The second type of ink-jet **transfer**s produced by sublimation ink-jet cartridges for making sublimation **transfer**s are currently only available for certain Epson ink-jet printers. This is an extremely popular and dominant **transfer** method in the industry. Sublimation inks have proven to be one of the highest quality methods of making custom sublimation **transfer**s with near off-set quality and strength. There is an excellent availability of a wide range of imprintable products for sublimation inks on the market today. Many of the company links below specialize in sublimation **transfer** inks & supplies. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The last step is to plug in your iron and set it to the appropriate heat setting based on what the **transfer** **paper** says to use. When the iron heats up, iron over the **transfer** **paper** using only heat and no steam. Steam can interfere with the design adhering correctly to the fabric. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll first need to **transfer** your image using **transfer** **paper** to use it. Then, allow the design to cool and then peel off the packing. Next, place the parchment **paper** over the design with the shiny side down and iron over the parchment **paper** for about 30 seconds. Finally, make sure you iron the parchment **paper** over the entire design, then remove the parchment **paper** and let the design cool again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll also need to consider the type of fabric you’re working with before choosing which **transfer** **paper** to use. Different fabrics require different heat levels to effectively **transfer** the image without causing damage. The specific **paper** you use is designed to work with those fabric types and levels of heat that are required. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark fabrics require the Dark Transfer Paper which a white background that is **transfer**red with the ink and blocks out the colour of the substrate from coming through the ink. Subsequently, suitable images tend to be block images or images that the white areas can be easily cut away as they will appear on the shirt once the **transfer** process is complete. Here’s more on the difference between light and dark **transfer** **paper**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cheap heat press machines are considered by many professional heat **transfer** manufacturers as “throw away” heat press machines. People are attracted to the low start up costs initially and then discover they ruin more shirts than the machine costs. May times you may be able to get the custom heat **transfer**s to apply, but then after one wash, the T-shirt heat **transfer**s peel off of the shirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Clear a space so that you're ready to start ironing your design onto your t-shirt. You can use an ironing board or any other table, whether it be in your kitchen, dining room or office. If you do not use an ironing board, just be sure to lay down a sheet of cloth to protect your table, as well as a few sheets of **paper** to place under your t-shirt as you begin to iron. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Avery inkjet **transfer** **paper** outperforms other t-shirt **transfer**s and is backed by a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee.

-   You don’t have to have any special kind of ink to print on **transfer** **paper**. It is designed to work with regular Inkjet ink. You’ll just need to make sure that your printer has enough ink in it to print the image. Other than that, you don’t have to make any modifications to your printer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Parchment **paper** is mostly used for baking, but some people use it with their iron-on **transfer**s. It can’t be used as **transfer** **paper** itself because it won’t adhere the design to the fabric. But, it is resistant to heat and is coated on one side with silicone, so people usually use it to seal their heat **transfer** designs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before printing designs to be **transfer**red onto light-colored fabrics, you’ll also need to mirror the image, especially if the design has text on it, due to the way light-colored **transfer** **paper** works. Mirroring it will make it appear backward on the screen. If you don’t mirror it, your image will appear backward on the t-shirt. This is not necessary with images that are being **transfer**red onto dark clothing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For example, polyester and cotton are two common fabrics used with iron-on **transfer** **paper**. If the t-shirt you’re putting a design on is made of cotton, then make sure to use a **transfer** **paper** designed for cotton fabrics. If it’s made of polyester or a polyester/cotton blend, make sure to use a **transfer** **paper** designed for polyester or blended fabrics. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Heat presses are recommended for professional and satisfying results simply because standard laminating devices and home hand irons can not get even near the temperatures required for a reliable **transfer**. Standard **transfer**s require anywhere from 375° to 425° F demand serious force in pressing often from 40-80 psi. These temperatures and pressures are simply not possible with other heated devices. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **transfer** is made up of a carrier **paper** and inks. When heated to a certain temperature and pressed with a significant amount of pressure for a certain amount of time, the **transfer** inks are passed over to the imprintable material. Some inks are adhered and embedded to the surface of the material, while others (namely, sublimation) permeate the coating of the material. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll also need to cut the wax **paper** so that it fits into your printer. The standard size of **paper** is 8 ½ by 11 inches, so make sure you cut the wax **paper** to that size. When you’re ready to print it, insert the wax **paper** into your printer like you would regular **paper**. Then, just print the image and remove the wax **paper** from the printer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The only other consideration is whether your product can be printed with a typical flat heat press or requires a specially shaped platen or base. Some products are simply not conducive to heat **transfer** printing due to their exceptionally odd shape. Again, feel free to contact us with any questions or requests for special projects. We would be pleased to provide a solution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We recommend experimenting with a small off-cut from the **paper** on a scrap piece of natural fabric to test the heat temperature and pressure of either your hand iron or heat press. We have full instructions for how long to press your design on our Instructions tab. Click here for Transparent Heat Transfer Instructions or here for White Heat Transfer instructions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Inkjet printers are most commonly used for printing onto **transfer** **paper**. They work using ink cartridges, so if you’re unsure if you have an inkjet printer, then ask yourself if it does indeed use an ink cartridge or just search for the particular model on the internet. Inkjet printers are great for printing basic designs that don’t have too many details, such as logos, texts, and basic graphics. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you look at the heat **transfer** **paper** if there is a blue grid, know that will be the back of the **paper**. However, if you get a pack of heat **transfer** **paper** that does not have a blue grid on the back you will look for the silky matte finish side. The silky matte finish side will be the front of the **paper** and the side that you will print your image onto. The other side will have a shiny almost glossy look to it. This will indicate that it is the back of the heat **transfer** **paper** and will Not be the side you print on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re using iron-on **transfer** **paper** at home, you’ll first want to consider which type of printer you have if you’re going to be using your own designs or downloading them off of the internet. You may not necessarily want to buy a different printer just to **transfer** designs onto t-shirts. Instead, you’ll want to work with what you have. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First time users are often unsure if their home (or business) Inkjet printer has suitable inks to allow the **paper** to work. This concern is unfounded, as normal inks will work just fine. The secret to the **transfer** process lies in the **paper** rather than the ink so there is no preference as to which printer or which ink you use as long as you are using an Inkjet printer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After years of selling and meeting hundreds of business owners who use Professional heat press machines, the Best Heat press Machines are the ones that are still in service after more than 10 years.

This is commonly how sports apparel is imprinted with names & numbers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When using dark **transfer** **paper**, the image is placed face up on the shirt before **transfer**ring and as such, there is no need to reverse the image. Neglecting this stage will cause the images to appear the wrong way around.
