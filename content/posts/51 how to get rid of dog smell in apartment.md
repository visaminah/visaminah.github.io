-   Our dogs can’t stop themselves from **smell**ing – it’s part of their nature – so it’s up to us to keep on top of our household chores in order to prevent a build-up of odours. The most important task when it comes to keeping the odours at bay is by vacuuming your home every week (or more frequently if needed). It may seem like overkill, but dogs shed rapidly, and each and every hair that finds its way in between your sofa cushions, underneath your rug, and in your bedding is going to cause a **smell**. Vacuuming can help reduce the numbers of loose hairs in your home, and, subsequently, help to minimise the **smell**. It’s the easiest and quickest method for keeping your home **smell**ing as fresh as a daisy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have carpets, start by sprinkling them liberally with baking soda. This is a natural odor eliminator, and completely safe for dogs. Let it sit overnight before vacuuming.

When you’re at home, and when the weather allows, opening your windows and doors will let in the fresh air.

So, fresh air in the house doesn’t just **smell** lovely; it’s better for your health. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is no way to stress enough the importance of vacuuming frequently for keeping dog **smell** out. At the very least, it should be a weekly chore to dry vacuum your floors and furniture. It’s a lot of work but absolutely necessary if you want to keep your house dog odor free. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s a good idea to change your filters at least twice a year whether you own a dog or not. When you own a dog you should do it once a month.

Clean and replace them as necessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Be mindful to flip mattresses and vacuum them dry before using a steam cleaner. Too often, you think, I’ll just steam clean to get rid of the **smell**, but if you skip this step – the strip and vacuum step – you’re going to create a disgusting amalgam of dog **smell**s. Vacuum everywhere, including under couches and behind cabinets to neutralize dog odors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I actually just spent the weekend at my friend's **apartment**, and while his room **smell**ed wonderful, the rest of his **apartment** **smell**ed like the trash hadn't been taken out in the four months he's been living there (even though it had been).

Your kitchen, car, dorm room, bedroom, and general living space will start **smell**ing fresh in no time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes no matter what you do, dirt and grime can sink into your carpets or rugs. And germs trapped deep in the fibres will cause nasty **smell**s.

Cleaning your carpets with a specialist shampoo three to four times per year will stop your house from **smell**ing of dog. Our pet-friendly carpet shampoo is 100% natural and entirely safe to use around your dog. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have an idea of where the previous homeowners’ pets used to spend most of their time, head straight to those areas first. Other good places to examine include carpets, curtains, vents, and heaters. These places tend to not only absorb odors, but also trap **smell**y animal hair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you’ve deodorized your home, it’s time to begin your regular routine to keep the dog **smell** away. After you’ve remade the bed and replaced the linens in the closet, sprinkle them with baking soda.

-   Waxy Ears Dogs’ ears are filled with sebaceous glands which produce high levels of wax.

-   Does your beloved canine leave a lingering ‘dog **smell**’ in the house? It’s the one downside of being a dog owner, and unfortunately there’s no miracle way to make a dog stop **smell**ing.

-   8 Use White Vinegar To Clean Stinky Furniture Amazon Heinz Cleaning Vinegar, $9, Amazon Is your furniture harboring some pretty rank odors?

Happilyemployed swears by this home remedy, "baking soda sprinkled generously, vinegar in a spray bottle, and a bucket of hot water and a wash cloth. Sprinkle, spray, wipe, repeat." The vinegar and baking soda will work together to eliminate any bad **smell**s that have been trapped in the fabric. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   6 Get Rid Of Bathroom Odors Amazon One-Drop Deodorizer, $12, Amazon If you get self-conscious about leaving the bathroom **smell**y at work or in a public place, you can eliminate bathroom odors quickly. All you need to do is place a drop or two of this solution into the toilet before or after use. Yayhotdogs says, "Use One Drop! It seems a little pricey, but once bottle lasts a long time and fits in your pocket or purse. That stuff is powerful!" - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If deodorizing doesn't remove the pet odor, the carpets and padding will have to go. Once you tear them out, scrub the subfloor with vinegar or an odor-removing product, and install new padding and carpeting. That is, unless the **smell** is in the subfloor, in which case that goes next. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1 Charcoal Air Purifier Bags To Neutralize Odors Amazoon Bamboo Activated Charcoal Air Freshener and Purifier Bags (Five Pack), $25, Amazon Reddit user Browtines says, "Charcoal naturally absorbs odors and other particles in the air... It's very, very porous, so it traps molecules and holds them (I think). But, I'm not a scientist!" Place these charcoal bags in your car, in your fridge, around your home (basically anywhere that **smell**s), and you'll begin to notice odors disappear from the air. You can use these for up to two years, simply leave them outside in the sun once a month for an hour to "refresh" and you're good to go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Keeping your dog clean and fresh is essential for a beautiful **smell**ing home. A wonderful **smell**ing dog starts with a regular brushing and bathing to remove dirt and odour causing bacteria. But it’s just as vital that you keep them as clean as possible between baths. Read our recent post about how to make your dog **smell** good without a bath for all our tips and tricks to keeping them **smell**ing fresher for longer. Explore our dog grooming collection to ensure your dog **smell**s amazing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cleaning up accidents as they happen will help to remove stains and foul odours. Anything from muddy paw prints to water bowl spills can stop your house from **smell**ing fresh. Use an odour neutralising stain remover to clean stains and eliminate dog odours. Our pet stain and odour remover is a must-have for removing stubborn stains quickly – just spritz and wipe away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Set up a paw-washing station at the front door to keep from tracking in **smell**s from outside every time you go for a walk. And if your furry companion is a feline, take an objective look at the kitty litter area. Keep it clean, change it out regularly and vacuum the surrounding area. Be sure to take time to scrub out the litter box with plenty of suds and elbow grease while you’re at it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sprinkle baking soda onto furniture that **smell**s and leave it overnight. Baking soda acts as a natural neutralizer and absorbs **smell**s. In the morning, vacuum your furniture thoroughly. Just a note: Although baking soda is safe to use around dogs, they shouldn’t consume it, especially in large amounts, so be sure to close this room off to your furry friends while the baking soda is working its magic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This will get rid of a great deal of the **smell**, but to really do a thorough job, you might want to rent a carpet cleaning machine with an attachment for furniture – or call a cleaning company to do it for you. Always start with neutralizing as much of the **smell** as possible before the shampooing, though, or all you will be doing is creating a hybrid of dog **smell** and perfumed shampoo. Not a good combination. And don’t use carpet shampoo on the furniture, or you could end up with ruined and **smell**y furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All of these odors combine to create that dog **smell** everyone hates. It’s easy to see how it fills your house. Unless your dog is confined to just one area of the home, wherever it goes, the **smell** will follow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your dog frequently comes in from the garden via your hardwood, tile, or linoleum kitchen floor, then this could be one of the main sources of dog **smell** in your home. A simple brush of the floor may well remove any loose hairs, but it’s not going to target the **smell**. Instead, try wiping the floor with Cif Floor Cleaner or Surf disinfectant, following the product instructions. It’s easy to use, it’s quick drying, and it’s safe for use in homes with pets. A thorough clean will not only remove odours, but it will also kill any bacteria and germs that have transferred from your dog's paws to your floors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Dog hair, dirt and debris can make carpets and rugs **smell**y. Vacuuming is the number one way to keep your carpets and floors clean and eliminate the causes of those nasty odours. Some dogs will shed more than others but keep your carpets fur-free by vacuuming at least once a week. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Have an unidentified **smell**? Look in your pet’s favorite spots for the source. Be sure to check out his favorite hiding places to see if he’s stashed a snack or over-used toy. If you’re still having issues, deep-clean all the usual suspects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adding nice **smell**s can help get rid of minor lingering scents. Fresh flowers, scented candles, and time-released air scent diffusers can all help you achieve this goal. Just be sure any scent you buy is dog-safe, as some essential oils can be dangerous for pets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Short answer: yes, probably. You might not notice it anymore because you’ve gotten so used to it. Someone walking into your house for the first time, however, will pick up on that dog **smell** right away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One way to keep your furniture **smell**ing fresh would be to keep your dog off the sofa. But we know first-hand that’s probably not going to happen. So, use blankets and throws to keep your upholstery and soft furnishings from **smell**ing of dog. Blankets and throws will protect your furniture from most dirt, debris, and dog hair. Simply shake them outside every day or two and machine wash them every one to two weeks, depending on your dog. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Instead of trying to cover up bad pet **smell**s with another, perfume-y **smell**, go with an enzyme cleaner. Enzyme sprays such as Nature’s Miracle break down the proteins in the mess to get to the root of the problem and truly clean. It can be surprisingly effective in attacking old messes too. Prefer natural cleaning products? Vinegar is also an effective odor neutralizer. Make your own natural spray by mixing equal parts water and vinegar. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s nothing that can dampen the joy of moving into a new place quite like the strong, unwanted **smell** of someone else’s pets.

But with some know-how, a bit of research, and good ol’ trial and error, we managed to freshen up our place. Now, what we learned can help you avoid some of the worst parts of this potentially arduous job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first thing you should do is rule out any medical reasons. All dogs **smell**, but if yours is particularly odorous, it could be because of a skin or dental infection. If you’ve noticed a stronger **smell** than usual, a quick trip to the vet should help you get rid of any doubts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Scent Marking Think dogs only mark their territory when they pee? Think again. Dogs are constantly producing odours that let other dogs know they’re about. It’s this scent-marking **smell** that’s really the classic ‘dog **smell**’, and it can easily be absorbed into your soft furnishings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once your house is free of pet odors, do what you can to keep the **smell**s from returning. When you're out, crate your dog or keep them outdoors. Limit the cat to one floor or room if possible. And don't forget pet bedding. Remove or replace it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Much like your dog’s bedding, their toys are full of bacteria and even mould. While the risk to your dog’s health is likely tiny, there’s an added incentive for keeping dog toys clean aside from the nasty **smell**. Keep soft toys clean by washing them regularly in the washing machine, separate from your other laundry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Perhaps the main reason why your whole house has a dog **smell** is your furniture and carpets. Even if your dog is not allowed on the furniture, its fur, its paws, its saliva are getting on everything else that your dog touches. Therefore your task has to be a comprehensive approach in order to get rid of dog **smell**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Face it: Unfortunately, there are **smell**s that linger at home when you're living in it (from cooking and working out to dirty laundry and poor ventilation), but that doesn't mean you have to live without knowing how to eliminate odors at home. I took to the internet to find out what to do about bad **smell**s, and I went to Reddit to dive deep for answers that worked for real people. After all, when you take the time to find the right odor eliminators for your space, it means that you're not just masking unpleasant scents — you're actually getting rid of them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You could hire a professional, rent a steam cleaner and do it yourself, or use one that you own. Make sure that if you use your own that it isn’t also infected with that same dog **smell** that you are trying to get rid of. Same thing with your dry vac; if it’s the same one you’ve been using for years to vacuum dog fur, chances are it has a dog **smell** to it too. If you want to start fresh, make sure your cleaning tools are fresh. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2 Odor Neutralizing Gel Beads Amazon Smells Begone Odor Neutralizing Gel Beads, $9, Amazon These odor neutralizing beads are a great way to get rid of bad **smell**s in a pretty way. You can place this out in the open and not worry about having something ugly cluttering your counter. The beads come in scents like 'Apple Cinnamon,' 'Calming Rain,' 'Fresh Cotton,' and 'Lavender Vanilla.' One reddit user says that it's the only air freshener that's ever actually eliminated the odors in their room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘Dog **smell**’ is a term that’s used commonly, but we never really hear of ‘cat **smell**’ or ‘bird **smell**’. Why? Do these animals not **smell**? Is it just dogs that are unfortunate enough to leave a lingering odour in the house? No. The reason why dogs seem to **smell** more than other household pets is simply that the parts of the body that tend to produce the greatest **smell**s are just bigger on dogs – areas such as the ears, the nose, and the paw pads. There are three main reasons why a healthy dog might **smell**: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   4 A Solid Baking Soda Based Air Freshener To Remove Odors And Leave Your Room Smelling Fresh Amazon Citrus Magic Odor Absorbing Solid Air Freshener (Six Pack), $25, Amazon If you have small areas that seem to trap odors like closets, bathrooms, refrigerators, basements, cars, and pet areas, you should find a solid air freshener. Adamcolter80 has had great results using a baking soda based, cake style air freshener to absorb odors. The air will be left **smell**ing wonderfully, and odors will be gone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Filling a completely empty washing machine with hot water, then adding a quart of bleach and running the machine for a couple of minutes to let the bleach mix around. Next, we opened the machine to air it out for a full hour before letting the machine complete its full cycle. Then, we followed these same steps one more time before the machine finally had a sterile, clean-**smell**ing odor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ridding your furniture and carpets of dog **smell** is a three part process: Strip and dry vac, shampoo and neutralize, and then deodorize. Start with furniture, linens, and bedding. You’ll want to remove all slip covers and cushion covers. If you can remove your pillow covers, remove them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Carpet is easy to identify as a dog **smell** absorbing part of the house. You may think because you have hardwood floors and linoleum that you don’t have a dog **smell** problem. Think again. That saliva and sweat coming off of your dog’s paws sticks to your hardwood floors too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For example, check your carpet padding by lifting your carpets and making sure that the pad beneath hasn’t been soaked with your dog’s waste. Even the floor underneath the pad may be giving off dog **smell**. Make sure to thoroughly clean and deodorize those areas too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
