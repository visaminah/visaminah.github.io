-   An imposing, four-poster bed may be the only element you need to transform your bed**room**. The intersecting lines and large scale of a bed have greater impact when painted black.

-   The color black is often thought of as a stark hue, and while it can be, you can also achieve a warm and cozy result if you think carefully about the rest of your palette. Haneen from Haneen's Haven shows us how it's done in her gorgeous black living **room**. The light brown sofa, terra cotta-colored lounge chairs, and vintage-inspired area rug flaunting the same colors keep the space from feeling cold and dreary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Their contrast makes **room**s much more gorgeous and quite fascinating. This color scheme is impressive because when anyone or designers highlight something within the **room**, it will truly stand out. Generally, certain colored furniture or even a carpet typically does the trick, but the thought of working with a living **room** in a detailed scale black and white can make the entire space harmonize by itself. Incredible, right? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Including a grey fabric armchair alongside your grey sofa will help tie the **room** together in a cohesive way. It also gives you the opportunity to create a cosy environment that’s perfect for socialising, reading or spending time with family. We’d suggest choosing a matching grey armchair but if you want to make it stand out, choose a different fabric such as a velvet armchair to make it more eye-catching. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whilst black living **room** **ideas** are endless, if you really want to make a statement, opt for a black and pink aesthetic. For instance, you could create a jet-black feature wall and pair it with pops of hot pink. This is an effortless way to add drama to a space. Go all out with statement lighting too! A sparkling, black glass chandelier will add a gorgeous, glam element. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Black furniture is often neglected. However, for those rejecting it, you are missing out! If you are not ready to go all black with your interior design, you could incorporate the shade through furnishings. A black sofa in a living **room** will make the biggest statement of all. If you have more than one couch, opt for one in black and the other in dark grey. This will prevent your lounge from coming off as too put-together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When people think of the colour grey, they normally think of cool tones. But, grey can actually be used to warm up a **room** too, depending on the shade you choose. Warm greys typically have yellow or brown undertones, and can sometimes be called ‘greige’, which is a combination of grey and beige. So, using a few decorative accents that complement the warmth, such as brown and orange, along with natural greenery, will create a lovely, welcoming feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You don't have to go with all-black-everything in order to pull off a black living **room**. Quite the contrary. The team over at Blackband Design balanced the dramatic hue with an equal amount of white, and the result is bold yet not overbearing. The black floor-to-ceiling, herringbone tile fireplace surround might otherwise feel heavy and weigh down the **room** if it weren't for the white walls and loads of natural light. The black ceiling beams, front door, coffee tables, and side tables punctuate the space and add a bit of edge, while the neutral textiles and light wood flooring add a cozy and inviting element. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you have catered to your living **room** suitably well, you can move ahead by decorating other parts of your home. When people visit you, the first thing they glimpse at isn’t your bed**room** or kitchen, it’s the living **room**! Consequently, this black, white and cream living **room** with accent colours will bestow such a gorgeous look that everyone will be mesmerised. The implementation of furniture, curtains and ceiling lights go hand-in-glove with each other. And that’s the pro-tip — the accessories should complement the decor. So, don this modern black and white living **room** decor and breathe your worries all out into thin air. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If high drama is your thing when it comes to home decor, then look no further than this monochromatic living **room** by Rach from Rasberry Flavoured Windows. She really went for it, incorporating a variety of materials and textures from the wall paint to the sofa to the flooring, all of which showcase a rich ebony hue. But the design is far from flat; in fact, it makes quite the impression. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Home decor is a blessing in disguise. It helps us explore our artistic side and bestows serenity and tranquillity in our home. Life can get legit brutal but don’t we all want a place where we could come back after a long day and feel at peace? Bet we all do. That’s where home decor plays a significant role — creating a beautiful (and breathable) space to live in that renders comfort and charisma! The living **room** is said to be the home’s soul and well, it needs to be well-furnished. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That said, we hope these **ideas** were helpful to you and you were able to make the best out of them.

-   You love the look of black walls, but worry the decorating idea won't look as good with the angled walls in your living **room**. However, the dramatic hue is actually a striking way to celebrate the unique architecture of your home. Consider following the lead of this eye-catching setup, and paint just one wall in the inky shade to really define the shape. Keep the rest of the furniture and decor neutral and minimal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Again, there are almost countless ways to create a black living **room**. It does, of course, depend on your personal style and how much of the dark shade you really want to use in your space. For example, the team over at Studio McGee managed to incorporate the edgy color in this transitional design by dressing up the walls with black wainscoting. The classic paneling adds warmth and a sense of tradition, while the bold hue modernizes the look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ditch the paint cans and brushes, and splurge on wallpaper instead. The textured black design in this living **room** by Heidi Caillier makes an unexpected backdrop for traditional sofas upholstered in a mauve floral fabric reminiscent of a different time. The surprising combination proves that the moody hue isn't limited to contemporary interiors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A piece of furniture in black creates an interesting focal point. Add some edge to your living **room** makeover with black furniture. For instance, a credenza, bookcase, or an oversize coffee table — like this dark wood-stained beauty — are quick and easy ways to integrate the bold color into your space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Including shelving on the walls is a great way to add interest and extra storage to your **room**. For a more luxe, expensive feel, paint the shelves in the same grey tone as the walls to make them seem integrated. This will give that particular wall a smart and sophisticated feel. You can also place black, white and grey pieces of decor on the shelves to tie the whole colour scheme together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

A silky silver rug, crushed velvet pillows and chrome side tables will give your grey living **room** a much-needed lift and a luxe feel.

-   Thankfully, the fun does not stop there with the pairing! You can utilise paler greys too if you want a softer and safer statement. This will create a contemporary farmhouse mood. If you incorporate in stark black décor against soft linen chairs, you will establish the perfect balance within a space. Alternatively, why not bring a third shade into the mix and go for a grey, black, and white living **room**? They all complement one another impeccably, for an ultra-modern and sensual living **room**, making anyone who enters it, fall in love! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Grey has the ability to add warmth to a colour scheme just as easy as it adds coolness. It can be both edgy and charming, calm and vivid and suit every season and every decor style. The opportunities are truly endless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We all know black works with white. However, if you want to add a little warmth to a monochrome aesthetic, add in some wooden accents through décor and furnishings. Living **room**s are intended to be cosy and inviting, and a little timber weaved in does exactly this! For instance, why not pop in a wooden cabinet and log pile? Elements as such will transform your lounge into an elegant space with rustic edge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Houseplants can bring so much joy to any **room**. They even have health benefits too as some can purify the air and help get rid of any nasty pollutants. But, even in the simplest of colour schemes, green plants will add a much-needed pop of colour and give the **room** more depth and life. Choose a large, statement plant for an empty corner in the **room** or several smaller plants to place on bookshelves, coffee tables or to hang from the ceiling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Creating a textured wall can be very hit or miss. But, if done right, it can give your living **room** a shabby chic, rustic vibe while adding something a little unique and very on-trend to your living **room**. A dark grey textured wall will ooze elegance with its perfectly imperfect finish. You can then complement the artistic wall with tonal hues and plush fabrics for the ultimate cosy space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Down for a roaring encounter of bliss? Well, take a look at this royally-crafted black and white living **room** decor.

Fire up the grills for something unique and incredibly fascinating and don this monarchal black and white living **room** decor right away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When choosing furniture, opt for a traditional sofa like a Chesterfield, but in a rich plum. This will keep the overall aesthetic modern. Decorate the sofa with cerise pink and patterned cushions of your choice. Show off accessories on simple, black floating shelves, which look fantastic mounted in a small alcove. If you have a hearth, plus **room** to flaunt decorations, go for an ornamental bowl in sparkling pink and fill it with tealights. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are planning on keeping the majority of your living **room** neutral, black window treatments will feel less overpowering. For instance, rich patterns such as our Sorento curtain will add interest and dimension in your lounge. We recommend layering a patterned curtain like this, above neutral blinds like the Tyrone, for a multidimensional appearance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Don't stop at built-in shelving — consider painting your fireplace surround as well. Designer Zoë Feldman did just that in this charming living **room**, resulting in a seamless uninterrupted finish. The rest of the space is light and bright, keeping the focus on the black accent wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do you look at the world in black and white? Usually that can be a bad thing, but in interior design, it is a very good thing. Monochrome doesn't mean boring, when expertly applied, this design concept can be executed in a manner that brings a living **room** to life. There are countless ways to use these colors in a way that is interesting and engaging. We have gathered thirty living **room**s that display this to perfection and incorporates this color palette in different ways. Do you see the world in black and white (and a few shades of grey)? Make your vision a reality, and have fun! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let your walls act as a dramatic backdrop for your home's minimalist aesthetic. Opt for an inky shade like gray that will add depth and complement your pared-down scheme, while a few oversize accessories and a hint of greenery infuse texture. This soothing living **room** idea from Historiska Hem and showcased on Coco Lapine Design is the perfect example of how black walls don't need much more than a few photos to make a statement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you take more to those dramatic, black living **room** **ideas**, keep furnishings very sculptural and slimline. This will crank up the heat on the drama of a dark space. Mid-century contemporary furniture, juxtaposed against a minimal space, creates a quirky contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With so much attention being paid to the bold color choice, it can be easy to forget about things like the lighting, but that would be a mistake. Follow the lead of Park & Oak and give your living **room** the ultimate glow-up with the help of a dramatic chandelier. The right fixtures can make all the difference, especially when you're working with a dark and dramatic shade like black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Can’t decide on just one shade of grey? Try layering the shades for the best effect. If you have light grey walls, choose a darker grey sofa, rugs, picture frames and other small decor accessories to add depth and contrast. Using different shades of grey rather than one will also prevent your living **room** from looking dull and flat, so have fun with the tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With this charming black and white living **room** wall decor, all of your I want an aesthetically-pleasing living **room** decor’, ‘my living **room** should make everyone stare’ wishes will be granted!

-   If covering your living **room** from floor to ceiling in black is giving you anxiety, focus your efforts on the furniture and decor instead. Got a white sofa? Add a black throw or a few accent pillows. Need a new floor lamp? Look for a fixture with a black finish. In this eye-catching setup, the sofa frame, throw blanket, light fixture, side table, area rug, and artwork make quite the statement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While many love the look of exposed brick — especially in an industrial loft space or home — it can limit how you decorate. But no need to worry. You can always paint over it as proven by Leanne Ford in this living **room**. Complete the sophisticated scene with worn black leather sofas and black slate floor tile. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Liven up your grey living **room** by including bold pops of colour.

The smoothness of marble also works beautifully with many shades of grey so it’s impossible to get it wrong. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re a daring kind of person who’s not afraid to make a statement, painting the walls a dark grey colour scheme can add a dramatic flair. Ideal for those who are fans of rock and roll, edgy and gothic style decors, dark and brooding shades will look striking in the living **room**. Just make sure you give your space lots of light from various lamps, otherwise, it won’t be usable at night. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you fancy a little DIY, get the paintbrush out and brush on a coat of rich ebony on your furnishings. This could be anything from cabinets to chairs in the living **room**. Before you know it, your furniture will become stunning focal points, and no-one will be able to take their eyes off them! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Creating a panelled wall is very on-trend right now as a way of adding texture to the walls.

-   Starting a new colour scheme can be daunting which is why we always recommend incorporating smaller items, to begin with.

-   White is a bright, peaceful shade that often conveys cleanliness and positivity. For many **room**s, white furniture and decor provides a blank canvas to help other colorful pieces pop. Radiant porcelain tones also reflect light to help small areas appear larger, while softer off-white shades promote a crisp yet cozy vibe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your living **room** features alcoves, you can highlight them by painting them a dark grey which will create a sense of depth.

-   Create a moody atmosphere by combining matte black walls and light-colored accents like blogger Judith from HUIZEDOP did in her living **room**.
