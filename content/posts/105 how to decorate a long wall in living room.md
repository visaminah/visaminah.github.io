Use architectural features wherever possible - existing arches, dado rails, picture rails - they can all be taken advantage of and painted in a contrasting shade to adjacent **wall**s. Don't have any rails or panelling? Try creating a visual version with a super neat horizontal line across your living room **wall** using FrogTape painting tape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

It’s one of the most common design and decoration dilemmas, and that’s why many homeowners face the same issues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Instead of classic tongue and groove **wall** panelling ideas, vertical panelling is an excellent choice for large **wall**s as it adds instant depth, warmth and interest.

-   Today in this blog, we will tell you some of the big **wall** decoration ideas. These easiest and creative techniques can be used on any **wall**, such as living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, and bathrooms.

-   To that end, I made several boards for sharing some ideas for a big living room **wall**. At the top and left side, of some of them, you’ll see some boxes. Those represent one foot. Most of these **wall**s are about 18 to 20 feet. If your **wall** is bigger, you’ll probably need larger furniture, or it’s also okay to have a little breathing space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Folding screens and room dividers are standing sculpture pieces in themselves. That’s why they’ll also work as decor for your bare **wall**s.

-   If you are a gardening enthusiast, you can transform the large blank living room **wall** into a unique plant **wall** that’ll add greenery to the room.

-   At first glance, large **wall** decor might seem like a bad idea for a small **wall**, since you don’t want to crowd or overwhelm the room. However, the truth is that small pieces can leave a lot of empty **wall** space, making the room feel awkward and even smaller than it actually is. Big **wall** decor, be it an oversized clock or a piece of DIY **wall** art, will anchor the room and take it from cramped to cozy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A little **wall**paper can go a long way. "Patterned **wall**paper turns the entire **wall** into an art piece," says Smith.

-   As I have shown you with floor plans, you can create a scale elevation drawing of your long **wall** plan. I use quarter-inch graph paper, but I find that 1/2″ scale is easier on the eyes for elevations. In that case, four squares will equal a square foot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

As a bonus, textile art introduces a new material into the room, adding a layer of interest. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Already have panelling installed but want to give it a little more...oomph? Try your hard at colour drenching. While painting the entire **wall** and mouldings in one shade might look a little empty on a plain **wall**, it is a perfect match for a panelled **wall** as the shadows cast from the natural light add plenty of decorative beauty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can go with any style or art of your liking and layout according to the **wall**. However, try this themed grid approach if you want a tailored and organized gallery **wall**.

Otherwise, you can use frames in different shapes, colors, and sizes and put them in any manner (See the above image for reference). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gone are the days when the wainscoting was considered stuffy and bulky. Nowadays, you can see many modern homes with wainscoting, and they look absolutely gorgeous.

While many artists sell complementary pieces that would look great together, you don’t necessarily have to buy a set. You can unify eclectically sourced paintings through their colors, styles, themes, or frames. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not only that, but a mirror centerpiece also helps to reflect light across the entire living room space and brightens it up. Thus, the space automatically opens up with this **wall** decor idea and looks bigger. Always go for a mirror having a unique and bold shape so that it can stand out and be the central attraction of the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   07 of 20 Play with Pattern Laurey W. Glenn Richmond-based designer Janie Molster used a striking Suzani to dress up with wood-paneled **wall**s of her Nags Head summer home.

Whether it’s a landscape painting or modern art, pick your painting/ art piece of choice and make an exhibit worthy **wall** in your living room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Simplicity is key when it comes to modern design, so stick to sleek, minimal decor to avoid cluttering the space.

-   09 of 20 Make Smart Substitutes Laurey W. Glenn; Styling: Buffy Hargett Miller Covering an entire living room in luxe **wall**paper is pricey.

Gold and black frames contrast with the blue hues in this space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This approach of one large painting often beats out the common layout of multiple small frames on one **wall**. It commands attention instantly and makes a bold statement. And, if you’re all about that minimalist vibe, this method of decoration works perfectly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take paint for instance. Painting a large **wall** in a living room in all one colour doesn’t do much to make the space look less huge, but using a variety of living room paint ideas in different ways can trick the eye into thinking it’s smaller than it is. The same goes for **wall**paper – one repetitive print on a large space can feel a little never ending. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Entertainment **wall**s have become an important living room feature, and now provide stiff competition for the traditional feature fireplace. TV lovers want their box in pride of place to achieve the optimum viewing angle, so increasingly the lounge fireplace is being bumped to a side **wall** or corner adornment. This interior reshuffle leaves space to imagine a new living room feature **wall** with the TV at its centre. It also presents extra requirements for storage of receiver and recorder equipment, plus movie media, consoles and games. So how do we achieve a modern vista beautiful enough to take the place of a mantelpiece, and on what do we now display our treasured items? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   It’s easy to get lost in all the complex decorating ideas out there, but you simply can’t go wrong with the basics. With their ability to brighten a room and show off a person’s unique tastes, paintings have always been a go-to for sprucing up blank **wall**s. Whether you go landscape or portrait, contemporary or impressionist, a handpicked piece of art is the perfect way to fill your living room with character. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An oversized **wall** shouldn’t be thought of in isolation either. It should be the anchor that ties the room decor together. ‘When I see a room with one strong, dominant **wall**,’ agrees Bethan Harwood, Partner & Home Design Stylist at John Lewis & Partners (opens in new tab), ‘I’m itching to change up the other elements to balance it and bring the room together.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light fixtures are an often-overlooked way to make a statement, so keep an eye out for attention-grabbing sconces, lamps, or overhead fixtures.

By framing the feature in this way, you subtly draw attention toward it while filling in the gaps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   If you have a large **wall** in your living room that’s needing... well, a bit of love, you’ve come to the right place. Having a big empty **wall** is much like a blank canvas.

-   Can't find (or afford) any large-scale artwork to hang on your **wall**? Klugh says creating a salon-style display with smaller pieces is the next best thing. "Filling up your living room **wall** with a collage allows you to bring multiple pieces together to create one big art piece," she says. "Depending on the sizes you are working with, the collage can be linear or organic—just remember to plan it out before putting it on the **wall** to ensure you achieve the desired effect." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To introduce depth and dimension, Klugh recommends adding an architectural element, like baseboards or crown molding. "Buy some wood planks from your local home improvement store and install them on the **wall** in the pattern of your choice to add a layer of interest," she says. "Adding an architectural element to your **wall** will help infuse some character into your space." If you can't add trims or moldings to your **wall**, Smith says floating shelves are a smart (and storage-savvy) alternative. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
