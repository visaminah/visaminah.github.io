## 8 Tips for How Long Does A Saguaro Cactus Take To Grow An Arm | How Old Is A Saguaro Cactus When It Grows Arms
-   Finally, a **saguaro** will be narrower in relation to its height. Barrel cacti are very thick and stout in relation to their height. Keep this in mind when looking at young **saguaro** – they’ll be skinnier, rather than rounded! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But first, let’s get one thing straight. The term “barrel **cactus**” doesn’t actually describe a single species of **cactus**. In fact, barrel cacti can be any roundish, barrel-shaped cacti from the genus Fero**cactus** or Echino**cactus**. Collectively, these two genera include roughly 40 different species of barrel **cactus**. No wonder things get confusing! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most obvious difference between a **saguaro** **cactus** and a barrel **cactus** is size and height. Saguaros grow up to 50 feet in height, though it can take them 200 years to reach that height. A barrel **cactus** will only top out around five to ten feet high. So if the **cactus** you’re looking at is tree-height, it’s probably a **saguaro**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both **saguaro** and barrel cacti will live to over 100 years of age. They’re important to the ecosystem, serving as food for animals and nests for some birds. With a bit of observation and practice, you’ll find telling the difference between these **cactus** species a snap! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To those of us new to the desert, it can be hard to tell the difference between a barrel **cactus** vs **saguaro** **cactus**. These large cacti grow across the southwestern United States. Young **saguaro**s can closely resemble barrel cacti, adding to the confusion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The fruits of both **saguaro** cacti and barrel cacti are edible. Saguaro fruits grow from the top of the plant and are roughly four inches long. They’re red, oval-shaped, and spiney. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You might not get a peek at the root systems of the **cactus** you’re trying to identify, but if you did, you’d notice a big difference. Saguaro cacti have deep roots to support their height. The roots of a barrel **cactus** are shallow, spreading out from the base of the plant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **saguaro** flower is beautiful and white – no wonder it’s the state flower of Arizona. The flowers grow at the top of the plant and at the tip of branches. Meanwhile, the flowers of a barrel **cactus** are generally orange, yellow, or pink. They grow in a circle around the top of the plant when the plant is quite old. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
