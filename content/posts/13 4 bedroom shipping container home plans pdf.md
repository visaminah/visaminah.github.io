## 13 Interesting Facts 4 Bedroom Shipping Container Home Plans Pdf | Shipping Container Home Floor Plans
-   The weight capability of these **container**s is quite amazing. You can stack as much as 7 **container**s on top of one another, meaning that the base **container** holds close to 200 tons (each **container** holds up to 30 tons of weight). This house covers at least 2,000 sq. ft. and has a big garage that can fit two cars. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **container**s were assembled around a steel framework. When you go inside you will see a living space downstairs with a sofa in front of a metal fireplace. The indoor staircase is also made of metal and leads to the top floor where you find the master bedroom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **container** house is a big one built with 40-footers. If you were to build a regular house thatâ€™s the same size, youâ€™d do it in twice the time. This home is in Costa Rica and is designed to withstand stormy tropical weather. For example, you can apply a special type of paint that protects the **container** against frequent rain showers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Inside, you will see the house looks like any other one: wooden floor, white walls, and a comfortable sofa in the living room. If you go upstairs you will find the bedroom that has a door (or a window, you canâ€™t tell for sure from the picture) that leads to the top of the first **container**. You can put some grass there or add a chaise lounge to get a tan during hot summer days. ðŸ˜‰ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Made of two **shipping** **container**s and other materials, this house covers 1,517 sq. ft. of Nederland, Colorado. The main living space is inside the **container**s where you will find two bedrooms, a kitchen and a bathroom, an office, and a laundry room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remember that itâ€™s not just a **container**, but itâ€™s a home dwelling thatâ€™s supposed to abide by local building code regulations. Thatâ€™s why you will need a permit and to make sure the house is not a fire hazard. The design seems a bit closed-off, but you can open it up a bit by adding larger windows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a big house of 2,200 sq. ft. located in Lille, France. The designer opted to not remove the **container**sâ€™ doors as they can be closed manually whenever you need some privacy. The inside is spacious and the link between the two floors is made of a slim metal staircase. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   If you want to keep the costs to a minimum, this is the design you want. You need to buy only one **container** and then make the necessary changes.

However, this is not a good idea for houses in rainy areas because wood rapidly deteriorates in contact with water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   8 **container**s are needed for this construction. Include the labor costs coupled with the materials needed to unite the **container**s, and you easily get to $200,000.

-   Although you canâ€™t tell from this picture, the house is located near a city of two million people, San Jose, Costa Rica.
