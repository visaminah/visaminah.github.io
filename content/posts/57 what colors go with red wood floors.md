## 57 Things You Should Know About What Colors Go With Red Wood Floors | Decorating With Red Oak Floors
-   Your wood floor’s undertone will determine which wall **colors** will work best with it. If you have a warm undertone, you’ll want to avoid warm **colors** like yellow, orange, or **red**. Instead, opt for wall **colors** with cool undertones like blue and green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red oak hardwood floors can make your room feel warm and cozy, with its rich shade and various undertones. When your floors are initially installed, your floors may have a light tan, dark brown, or pink tone, but overtime with sunlight and humidity, it may begin to have orange and amber tones. You will need to consider the overall shade of whichever color you choose to pair with your **red** oak hardwood floors, so that the walls will compliment the floors presently and in the future. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Again, there is no definitive answer to this question. However, you can pair light oak flooring with a variety of different **colors**, including black, dark gray, white, and light green. Experiment until you find the color scheme that best suits your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   White oak can sometimes look like it’s been bleached and be much lighter than you expect once it’s installed in your home. It’s important to keep this in mind when choosing the proper paint color. White paints with just a hint of undertone can bring that color into the room very subtly. However, going with a rich, dark color can bring out the beautiful oak. These **colors** include charcoal, cinnamon, navy, dark green, or even plum. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Reds, blues, light greens, and even a bit-a terra cotta can add some flavor to a cherry hardwood flooring setup. Not only are all of these **colors** a great contrast, but the right hue can even help accent and bring out some of the hardwood’s “cherry flavor.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can go with contemporary **colors** like black, dark gray, and deep **red**. These **colors** will provide a stark contrast to the light hardwood floors and make your home look very stylish. Or you can try a white-on-white living room with colorful accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your floors have more of a darker undertone, it is best to paint your walls a neutral color. Bright white, off-white, and light cream are great options, because they give a chic look to the space, but are not too striking, drawing attention to the beautiful dark hardwood floors. Gray is another solid option, because it includes various undertones that can be chosen to your preference based off of the undertones of your floors. If the undertones on your dark hardwood floors are lighter, it is best to do brighter **colors**, such as a light blue, soft gray, or subtle green. These delicate shades offer a wonderful balance between the dark floors and the lightly colo**red** walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When choosing a color for your walls, it’s important to consider the other elements in the room. If you have bright furniture or accessories, try using a lighter shade of paint so that it doesn’t compete with these items. On the other hand, if you want to use darker **colors** then make sure the floors are light so that it doesn’t create a jarring contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "Very often, people move into a pre-existing home with cherry hardwood flooring and want to incorporate their modern design sensibility," says Courtney Wollersheim, interior designer at FLOOR360. "Assuming their design preference follows what's trending — an earthy neutral palette and a version of farmhouse like Scandinavian or coastal or possibly midcentury modern — the first step is to tone down the strength of the floor color with wall **colors** in cool neutrals like greige, light creamy whites, or warm grays. Avoid paint **colors** that lean too warm or yellow, as they will bring out [the] **red**ness of cherry wood." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many homeowners that are looking to make interior renovations such as installing hardwood floors start with choosing the paint **colors**. In fact, when looking to change the entire look of each room in your home, you should start with the flooring. Let’s go over the steps involved: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light hardwood floors brighten up a room, and create a very lively and inviting feel. They are a very popular option among homeowners and business owners with the pleasant ambiance that they form. Light hardwood floors are best pai**red** with light and neutral wall **colors** that allow your hardwood floors to pop, without taking away too much attention from them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hardwood floors are a great addition to your home, and can create a very open and elegant space for you and your loved ones to enjoy. There are many different hardwood floor options to choose from, and there is also a large variety of interior paint **colors** to decide between. Once you conclude if you would rather have a natural shade or stained look to your hardwood floors, it is time to find the perfect wall paint color to compliment them. Follow this guide to know which hardwood floor **colors** and wall paint **colors** are the best combination for your rooms, and hire commercial painters like us to do the dirty work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Combining dusty rose with gray hardwood floors is a perfect way to inject some femininity into your home décor. The two **colors** complement each other perfectly, and the result is simply stunning. If you’re looking for a way to add a little bit of luxury to your home, this is definitely the way to do it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When two **colors** of paint are mixed, one will more dominant. That color gives the overtone while the other color that you don’t really see is responsible for the undertone. For instance, blue with a tad of green tinting makes turquoise. The blue is the overtone that you perceive and the green that you don’t really see is the undertone. Although you don’t really notice the undertone color, it is there and you will want to make sure other **colors** you use in the room, such as flooring, doesn’t clash with it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Or you can go completely white by having a white sofa, chair, walls, and tables. Just throw in a couple of plants and a bright-colo**red** throw pillow. We know white is beautiful and dangerous because of how quickly it can get dirty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Painting Company can help you envision your room or home with many color choices based on the wood flooring you choose. They can also help you narrow down those **colors** to those that match the space and your personality the best with our color consultants. Contact us a call today before choosing that color and we can make sure it’s the perfect one for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this blog post, we will discuss the best paint **colors** to go with cherry wood floors. We will also provide some tips on how to choose the right color for your home. Let’s get started! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Coastal styles tend to be between bright, airy, and plain in a good way. The light hardwood floors accent the furniture. Insert a beechnut brown or similar neutral or cream-colo**red** couch. Add striped black and brown throw pillows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cherry floors are quite popular. It may be due to the elegance they offer but cherry flooring also opens up many options when choosing paint **colors**. White walls with a slight undertone that matches that of the cherry wood can make those floors the focal point of the entire room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the best things about cool gray walls is that they can help to make your medium hardwood floors pop. The contrast between the two **colors** is really eye-catching, and it can help to brighten up your space. If you’re looking for a way to make your floors stand out, then this is definitely the way to go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lastly, **red** should also be avoided when working with cherry wood floors. This color is often too jarring and can make the space feel chaotic and busy. If you’re looking for a more subtle way to add some excitement to your home, try using a different color like orange instead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Throw in a few cream-colo**red** rugs and even some cream-colo**red** flower vases. The icing on top is a wall photo that’s a calm but bright blue or green. It makes the room feel like you are sitting on a patio on the coast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I don’t love **red**. It’s heavy to my eye and I think it needs lots of white to balance it out. I’m much more friendly with orange and cognac. So the one floor I would never want to live with is the Brazilian cherry-type burgundy **red** like the one above. Because I don’t want to be stuck decorating with **red**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Well, I would argue that too **red** or orange a wood floor is not a selling feature either. So I would choose to love the look while I live in it and paint them. The next owner will probably replace those floors anyway. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Designers are of two minds about whether you should pair warm cherry wood floors with cool- or warm-toned paints, so opt for a color and tone that suits your individual space and the atmosphere you want to create in your home. Cherry wood floors can be the dramatic highlight of a room or a home if you let lighter paint **colors** take a supporting role. White, off-white, beige, and cool grays are good options. Alternatively, the richness of the floor can be toned down with strong paint **colors** that have the depth to hold their own and neutralize the warm cherry wood. Think, sage and forest greens, navy blue, or peach and copper hues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For rooms with light hardwood floors, the best wall **colors** are ones that will complement the wood without competing with it. Pale or neutral shades are always a good choice, as they help to keep the focus on the floors. White walls are a classic option, but you can also go with light gray or light blue. Whatever color you choose, make sure it’s one that you love, as you’ll be looking at it a lot! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cherry hardwood floors or floors that have **red** undertones add a beautiful and compelling look to your room, and look best with rich wall **colors** to go along with it. If you are going for a cleaner and simpler look, white is still a great option with cherry hardwood floors. If you are going for a more drastic contrast, you can choose between shades of blue, green, and **red**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to create a calming space, nothing does the trick faster than sage green. Choose a pale shade like Behr Frosted Sage to highlight dark, **red**-toned cherry wood floors. From there you can take your palette light with white or cream accents and gold fixtures, or create a dramatic color scheme with **colors** like black or teal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And by the way, in general, my neutral colour wheel is not intended to identify undertones in wood. Wood floors that really need to be addressed in your decorating, for example. those that are straight-up orange or **red** (NOT orange-brown or **red**-brown) are going to be more saturated and less neutral than any of the colours on the wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another color that doesn’t pair well with cherry wood floors is purple. This shade can be overwhelming and make the space feel dated or even childlike. If you want to add some interest to a room with cherry wood floors, try using other **colors** like green or blue instead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here’s what I mean. The cabinets should be white. Adding deep blues also work well to balance orange and **red** wood tones. Remember this cherry cabinet kitchen? And the **red**dish-orange of the floors should be treated as an accent colour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another way to go bold is to go bold and neutral at the same time. Paint the walls a beautiful bold color like yellow, royal blue, or **red**. Add in a dark-colo**red** couch with black and brown accents. It will give you a beautiful bold living room that is also neutral. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Evoke the feeling of a **red** clay desert with a rich, earthy shade like Dutch Boy Native Copper. Pai**red** with dark wood floors, this rusty terra cotta will look both neutral and dramatic. Balance the color scheme with a royal blue sofa, or bring out the drama with black or burgundy. Native Copper would also make an ideal accent wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A light taupe, Dutch Boy Mousey Tint is a deeper alternative to Whispe**red** White. This shade will give your room a cozy, modern feel. For a sophisticated monochrome look, layer in other shades of taupe, brown, and cream. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red oak brings very warm, **red** tones to the room. Choosing the right paint color can help to bring that out even more. Pastels can help to lighten the room while deep **red**s can be complementary. Bright **colors** such as those in the family of aquamarine and yellows such as apricot can create a bright and stimulating atmosphere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light hardwood flooring is usually the most popular choice. Not only can it bring a light, open feeling to the room, it is also easier to keep looking clean since it doesn’t show as much dirt. You will also have many more options for paint **colors** when you go with lighter floors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And more neutral hardwood floors can be treated like a pair of blue jeans, they go with everything. More saturated ones that are more orange or **red** than brown ARE more limiting. They are a COLOUR that needs repeating, but matching the wall colour to them is not the answer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Warm undertones have a yellow, orange, or **red** hue to them. Cool undertones have a blue, green, or purple hue to them. Neutral undertones are a mix of both warm and cool hues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a few different **colors** that can bring out the best in medium hardwood floors. One popular choice is a light beige, which can help to brighten up the space and make it feel more open and airy. Another popular option is a rich chocolate brown, which can add a warm and inviting feeling to any room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dutch Boy Whispe**red** White is a soft cream that would pair nicely with the warmer undertones of cherry wood. A light neutral, it provides a clean backdrop for vibrant hardwood floors. Choose this shade if you'd like something with a little more warmth and weight than pure white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I feel like the current blue clashes with the **red** flooring in our office. I would like a neutral colour on the wall. Should I do warm or cool tones? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dark floors are very versatile and can be pai**red** with just about any color. For a cocooning effect, try using deep, rich tones. If you want something a little more modern, consider using lighter shades such as warm neutrals. These **colors** will help to brighten up your space and make it feel more inviting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have light wood floors, you can’t go wrong with white or gray. But if you want something a little more daring, try a bold color like **red** or blue. Light blue or lilac will also help to bring out the natural beauty of your wood floors. They will create a bright and airy feel in your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some of the best color options for dark hardwood floors are warm neutrals such as cream or light beige. These **colors** can make the space feel more open and airy. If you want a bit more contrast, try painting the walls white. This can really make the floors pop and give the room an elegant feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can’t go wrong with white walls, especially if you are wanting to make your space feel bigger and brighter, while also giving it a minimalistic and chic look. For a dramatic pop of color, it is best to choose some shade of blue, green, or **red**. Blue shades, especially cool blue, add a calm and easygoing feel to a room, and has become a popular interior paint option in contemporary-styled homes. Shades of green contrast very well with cherry hardwood, especially soft green tones which help draw the attention of the room to the flooring. Red walls will compliment the hardwood floors **red** tones, and will bring warmth to the space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While it is possible to have dark wood furniture on a light wood floor, it isn’t recommended. The dark wood furniture will stand out too much against the light hardwood floors and may make the room look too busy. Instead, try lighter-colo**red** furniture to create a more cohesive look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, a monochromatic color scheme might be monotonous, so consider adding in different shades or tones of the same color to add interest. You could also use accent **colors** to break up the scheme and add a pop of color. If you’re not sure what will work best, consult a professional painter or designer for help. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light hardwood floors pair with neutral styles perfectly. You can try a tan couch with light brown accents. Throw in some green plants and a cream-colo**red** rug, and you’ll have a beautiful neutral living room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are into color, going bold is the way to go. But most of the time, it isn’t a good idea to mix too many **colors** in one room. You can try a dark green couch with a light pink pillow. Throw in a bright yellow rug and some orange vases, and you’ll have a beautiful bold living room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cherry wood is known for its rich color and lustrous quality. It comes in six main varieties, which range in color from amber to dark **red**dish brown. Among the most popular choices for flooring is Brazilian cherry, because of its exceptional strength. On the Janka hardness scale (a measure of wood hardness), it ranks near the top, far above other common options like maple, oak, and pine. Other varieties, like black cherry, rank near the bottom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So to recap, yes, the floors in the example my reader sha**red** tip into the realm of orange-**red**, a saturated colour, not a neutral. And they are not as timeless and versatile as wood floors that are browner. But if she is ok with the limitations they impose (ie. if she can live with orange-**red**) balancing them with lots of pale fresh neutral colour and maybe some blue or green and decorating well is still the key to creating a beautiful space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Warmer, vintage, traditional and formal wood floors are often quite rich (especially relative to the current trend as I said). But when they are appropriate to the style of the home, they are absolutely worth working with. Think of the heavy and rich **red**dish-brown trim in historical Craftsman-style homes or the honey cognac oak in mid-century modern homes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Combining white walls and light wood floors is the perfect way to brighten up any space.For a more subdued look, try pairing light hardwood floors with light gray walls. The two **colors** create a subtle contrast that is both elegant and understated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So, there you have it—our guide to choosing the perfect wall color to match your wood flooring. We hope you found this information helpful and are now ready to take the next step in creating a beautiful home that reflects your unique style. Whatever **colors** you choose, don’t forget to keep your floors impeccable with a high-quality hardwood cleaner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The great thing about neutral **colors** is that they are all-purpose and never go out of style. If you get bo**red** with a neutral atmosphere, you can always add some color accents. For example, you can throw in a yellow chair or paint a cabinet **red** to liven up the décor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting walls a Bright white is a great option for a clean and polished look, while off-white shades are a bit calmer and softer, yet still chic. Any type of white interior wall color will also create the illusion of more space in your room. If you are not a fan of traditional white walls, gray and cream are also wonderful options. The neutral gray and cream **colors** will compliment your hardwood floors’ undertones nicely, and will blend in finely with your room. With light hardwood floors, it is recommended that you paint your walls and trim the same color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s certainly possible to choose **red** for the wall **colors** even with cherry floors. If that seems to be a bit too much, however, you can even choose pastel **colors**, such as blue. Grey is also a popular choice, especially with blue undertones. The blue helps to create a calming environment in the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
