-   Troy-Bilt has been associated with numerous great zero turn riding **mowers** on the market. Its products vary widely across mower grades, engine power and performance.

They also make some amazing walk-behind mower including one with zero-turn capability: you can read our top 3 Troy Bilt walk behind **mowers** review here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A zero-turn mower is a special type of lawn mower known for its ability to make 360-degree turns on a zero radius. Which in short means it can turn on the spot. Zero-turn **mowers** are large machines and I am regularly asked about the best small zero-turn **mowers** for getting around smaller yards or tight spaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Troy-Bilt manufactures four different kinds of Mustang riding **mowers**. These all have pretty much the same level of quality and durability. However, they differ in performance and price. Here is a side-by-side comparison of the Mustang 54″ XP Riding Mower and the Mustang 46″ XP Riding Mower. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now when I talk you through each of the products on the list below we need to appreciate the difference between a small zero-turn mower and the smallest. Typically a small zero-turn mower is a machine with a 42” cutting deck. There are **mowers** with smaller decks but to be straight with you, I am not comfortable recommending them, as they just don’t cut it! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You probably know all about the outstanding efficiency a zero-turn mower brings to your landscaping. But let’s put it straight out there, these machines are big. So it stands to reason that most residential users want to find the best small zero-turn **mowers**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   As the name suggests, the gas-powered zero-turn **mowers** use gasoline to power their 4-stroke engines. Their runtime depends on the size of their fuel tanks. For instance, a mower with 3 gallons fuel tank has a longer runtime than a 2-gallon zero-turn mower. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Typically, zero-turn **mowers** feature two control levers. You need to push the right lever forward and the left lever backward to turn left. Push both levers forward to move forward and backward to reverse. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, that doesn’t mean that other zero-turn **mowers** are compromised quality. I included the products on my list after thorough research and testing. So, you should not hesitate to pick any of them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   This also means that the engine will last longer and ensure better fuel economy. The air filter is designed to deflect any debris such as small stones or grass that may damage the filters. This is often the reason why other riding **mowers** require frequent filter changes. The dynamically balanced crankshaft of the Intek V-Twin keeps the mower operating smoothly and gives it a longer life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
