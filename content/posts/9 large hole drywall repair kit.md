## 9 Things You Should Know About Large Hole Drywall Repair Kit | large hole drywall patch kit
-   If you’re fixing damage that’s larger than a small nail hole, you’ll need to use a mesh **drywall** patch to complete the repair. Resist the urge to attempt to fill the hole with spackle as it will crumble after it dries. Most **drywall** repair **kit**s come with everything you need for wall repair, including the mesh, spackle, putty knife, and sandpaper. Begin by placing the patch over the hole, then spread joint compound over the patch and smooth around the edges. Once dry, sand until smooth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Avail yourself of pre-made products designed to simplify repair tasks. Patch **drywall** using **kit**s with reinforced center panels for larger holes and self-adhesive tape for smaller holes. A **drywall** compound and primer combo, such as 3M Patch Plus Primer, leaves a surface that’s ready to paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When repairing minor scratches or dents smaller than ½ inch across, fill them with a thin layer of joint compound (also known as **drywall** mud). Apply using a 3- to 4-inch putty knife made for repairing **drywall**—rather than, say, the kind of narrow utility knife you’d use for wood putty—smoothing the filler till it’s flush with the wall. Cracks or holes larger than ½ inch require reinforcing mesh prior to spackling. If you apply joint compound directly to large gouges, the damage will reappear as the house settles and the joint compound dries and crumbles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drywall is tough, but it’s not indestructible. Over time, gypsum-board walls can sustain ugly cracks or holes. Fortunately, **drywall** is easy to repair easy, but there is an art to it. Here’s how to patch a hole in **drywall** so it’s indiscernible to landlords, homebuyers, or visitors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In addition to nail pops, a settling house can also cause the corner **drywall** bead to buckle, crack, and crumble. If the wall corner was made with paper-faced corner bead, simply cut out the damaged area using a utility knife. Use tin snips to cut a new piece of paper-faced bead to replace the damaged piece. Apply a new coat of mud over the damaged corner using a trowel, then press the new piece of corner bead onto the area. Mud the sides, allow to dry, then sand smooth and refinish with paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you cut corners on sanding **drywall** the repair site will be noticeable, so take your time. Once the repaired area is dry, take to it with some fine-grit (100 or 120) sandpaper. After the first round of sanding, add a second layer of mud, spreading it about 2 inches beyond the boundaries of the first layer. Once dry, re-sand your repair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Be safe and don’t cut into a wall to repair a hole until you verify that electrical cords and plumbing lines aren’t running through the space behind it. If the hole is just a few inches wide, shine a flashlight into it to see what’s there. If you must enlarge the hole, carefully cut horizontally with a **drywall** saw—but avoid going deeper than an inch. It’s safe to assume that hot wires will be present near an electrical outlet, but don’t bet your life—or life savings—that homebuilders or renovators followed all electrical and plumbing codes. Wires and pipes are often found where they don’t belong. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The fine particulate of **drywall** compound could injure your lungs if inhaled. So always wear a dust mask when sanding **drywall** compound. Disposable gloves are also a good idea to protect your hands from the dehydrating effects of gypsum dust. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While there’s nothing wrong with calling a **drywall** repair professional, it’s important to understand how much more it will cost than doing the job yourself. A professional will charge at least $75 to repair small holes up to 4 inches in diameter, according to Fixr. Expect to pay between $200 and $550 to repair multiple holes and cracks in a single room. Fixing **drywall** is a DIY project that can save you a considerable amount of money. In fact, a **drywall** patch **kit** that includes all the necessary materials for repairing a small hole, like this repair **kit** from 3M, only costs about $10. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
