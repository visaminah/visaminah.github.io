## 7 Shocking Facts About Does Light Blue Go With Dark Brown | Light Blue And Brown Combination Outfit
-   Blue is a cool color, whereas **brown** could be either cool or warm. Also, **blue** is primary which means you can’t make it from any other color. But if you want to have a darker **blue** hue, you can mix it with its complementary color, orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you think of teal, you could visualize the deep oceans and seas. On the other hand, **brown** is as much a reminder of nature as **blue** is. It depends on how much **blue** you’re adding to the mix and how much **brown** is present - that decides what effect the resulting color has on the viewer and the environment overall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adding more **blue** to the mix would result in a bluish tint in the teal. So its tonal value would begin to lighten according to the **blue** being added. Note that the **blue** hue you’re using will also have an impact on the resulting color. For instance, if you’re using cerulean **blue**, it’s inherently lighter than ultramarine and would thus help make a dark and muddy **brown** less intense too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To create tonal values and contrast, all you have to do is use neutral colors. Keep in mind that **brown** itself is a neutral color. So in order to go darker or lighter for **brown**, the easiest method is to use white, grey, and black. Adding white to a color means you’re tinting it and making it lighter. Adding grey to color means you’re toning it and making a mid-range hue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adding more **brown** will result in a muddier appearance. It could be a good color for creating tones and the warmth or the coolness of the mixed color would depend on the **brown** hue you’re using. If you’re adding a lighter **brown**, it could result in a pastel shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hence, by mixing **blue** and **brown**, you can get two beautiful colors. Either it’s a teal **blue** or it’s a muddy **brown**. If you want the result to be a teal hue, you would need to make sure the **blue** is in greater proportion to the **brown**. Psychologically, the teal evokes calm and cool feelings just like **blue**, and **brown** reflects security but it is comfortable nonetheless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What comes to your mind when you think of **blue** and **brown**? For us, **blue** reminds us of the water, whereas **brown** makes us think of the vast soil and the **brown** hues in nature, such as tree trunks. While **blue** is a primary color, **brown** is a neutral color, however, both of them have more or less the same psychological impact. We love using them in our art and design projects because they provide security and calm feelings. But what happens when you mix them? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
