## 5 Tips to What Is The Best Drill Bit For 316 Stainless Steel | What Is The Best Drill Bit For Stainless Steel
-   A large part of the **drill**ing heat is due to friction between the cutting edge and the cut material. Adding lubricant reduces heat generation and lowers the cutting edge temperature, which helps your **drill** bit stay hard and sharp. Lubrication also helps to avoid built-up edge (BUE), chip welding, poor surface finish and numerous other problems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Put substantial axial pressure on the **drill** bit to reach a high feedrate of around .015″ (0.4 mm) per revolution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This article will tell you how to **drill** **stainless** right. In short, **stainless** steel is best **drill**ed using a **drill** press, low RPM and high feed, cobalt-alloyed HSS or carbide bits and oil lubrication. Proper technique and a large **drill** press allow also plain HSS bits to be used, but handheld **drill**ing should always use hardest bit material available. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The proper **drill** RPM depends on bit size and is listed in the table below. (The speeds have been calculated from a cutting speed of 30 SFM as recommended by Machinery’s Handbook.) The speeds apply for HSS (HSS-Co) twist bits, step **drill**s and hole saws – Carbide can go a bit faster. DRILL SPEED - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   NB. Small **drill** presses rarely have the gears to run 1/4″ and larger bits slow enough for **stainless** steel (<500 RPM). If you need to run overspeed, get HSS-Co bits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
