## 19 Shocking Facts About Steam Vacuum Cleaner For Fabric Sofa | How to clean a sofa – handy cleaning tips to spruce up your seating
-   Our couches see lots of action every day, and dirt and grime buildup can ruin the upholstery and send you to the store to buy a new **sofa**. But before you throw your current dirty couch away, use a steam cleaner to bring it back to life. Understanding how to steam clean a couch saves you tons of money and effort in the long run, and it keeps your **sofa** in top shape for years to come. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'There’s no denying **sofa**s require regular maintenance, and no matter how hard you try to keep your brand-new **sofa** looking as spotless as the day it came home, it’s inevitable some pesky stains will show up over time,' says Sofa.com (opens in new tab)'s Patricia Gibbons. 'You often won't have to do the whole top-to-toe deep clean, but we recommend lots of spot cleaning and opting for fabric protection to help your **sofa** keep its new, fresh look.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I like that there is also a hose cleaning attachment so you can clean vertical surfaces like the backrest or back cushions on a **sofa** or chair. Ultimately what I like best about this cleaner is how effective it is at removing stains. With little to no effort, you can remove stains from any upholstered or carpeted item in your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the cover has a tag, consult it, and follow the instructions for how best to wash the fabric. If you have concerns about washing a delicate blanket, hand clean it in cold water with a gentle detergent such as Woolite. Let the covers dry before you put them back on the **sofa** to avoid creating mold or musty odors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Shampooing, on the other hand, offers more in-depth cleaning results. Sofa shampooing entails using shampoo, and possibly other stain removal products, to clean the dirt out of the **sofa**. Sofa shampooing is usually performed by cleaning professionals who have the necessary equipment and products to clean the fabric **sofa** effectively. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using the steam cleaner is the most significant step in our cleaning process, but there are still a few things to do before you call it a day. There might be some stains that require additional attention and treatment. Before you start in on post-steam treatment, though, allow the **sofa** to dry out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   De Hygienique’s **sofa** cleaning treatment effectively cleans and removes dirt from the **sofa**. We are technically trained by international cleaning institutions and equipped with safe stain removal products to tackle different types of stains on the **sofa**.

-   Use a foxtail and dustpan to clean off large debris, and then follow up with the **vacuum** cleaner. Get into all crevices and cracks and the undersides of the cushions and **sofa** as clean as the top. If you encounter stuck-on crumbs, gently rub the spot with a damp cloth to dislodge and pick up the remaining matter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After the cushions are clean and dry, it’s time to tackle the big job and steam clean the **sofa**. It’s essential not to rush the next part of your cleaning regimen, as a proper steam cleaning is a slow affair. Move slowly as you clean, and let the steam work into the fabric and pull out stains and dirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Where does the dirt go when you steam clean? When using a **sofa** steam cleaner, the dirt does not “go anywhere”. Instead, the dirt is broken down by the heat from the water vapor but remains in the area. To remove the loosened dirt from the area, you need to manually wipe it with a steam mop, cloth, or **vacuum** it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There's some controversy as to whether **sofa** covers should or shouldn't be washed in a washing machine, with many finding that the covers don't go on the same afterwards or look out of shape. Generally manufacturers say 'dry clean only' to avoid such outcomes. However there are those who swear by putting loose covers in the washer on a wool wash – saying they come up like new. It's a case of how brave you feel about washing your own **sofa** covers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gently wipe your **sofa**, using a circular motion, with a leather cleaner. 'A specialist conditioner from a quality care kit will help to clean and condition your **sofa**, reviving the sheen of the leather and preserving its soft suppleness,' says Suzy McMahon, buying director at Sofology. 'To prevent the leather losing its colour or from becoming dry, apply this conditioner twice a year.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cleaning expert and Instagram sensation Lynsey Queen of Clean swears by a steam cleaner for keeping her **sofa** in tip-top condition. ‘I steam clean mine with a handheld steamer,’ Lynsey explains. ‘What steam will do is it will refresh it. It will kill any germs and bacteria that’s in the **sofa**. And if there are any stains on there, it will help the stain lift,’ she adds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Working on a damp couch is counterproductive and won’t dislodge the stains. Check all areas of the **sofa** for dampness before you continue with your deep cleaning. That includes making sure that the underside, back, and other seldom-seen areas of the couch are bone dry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   I love a cream colored **sofa**. They are light, chic, beachy, and when I see a family with small kids or pets with a clean, cream colored **sofa** I think to myself, “wow, they really have it together.” A beautiful cream **sofa** felt both aspirational and unattainable to me as a mom with two small (messy) boys. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Bissell Little Green Upholstery Cleaner is less than 10 pounds and is easy to store.

-   When we sit on the **sofa**, the weight of our bodies and our small movements grind in the dirt, making it difficult to clean.

-   A thorough **vacuum**ing before you break out the steamer removes pet hair and animal dander. It increases the odds that the rest of the cleaning goes smoothly.

A thorough inspection can provide peace of mind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
