## 145 Interesting Facts Difference Of Condo And Townhouse | difference of condo and apartment
-   For some people, **condo**s and **townhouse**s make a definitive purchase decision. For others, this may not be the case. If you do not like rules out of your control, **condo** or townhome living might not be for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Renting a **townhouse** is usually more expensive than an apartment or a **condo** because you get so much more space. Again, actual rent prices vary based on location. Townhouses can also be more expensive because of the additional HOA fees. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are no HOA fees for apartments. These costs are included in the rent. Co-op apartments pay a monthly maintenance fee covering insurance, upkeep and employee salaries to name a few. Co-op apartment has more stringent acceptance criteria than a townhome or a **condo**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also try **townhouse**s for sale near me or **condo**s for sale near me as well. Both of these search terms should provide you with some communities to check out. Laying the groundwork for what you can expect will be a valuable start to your property search. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Evaluating HOAs takes effort. It is very important not to assume anything about a particular HOA until all of its documents have been read, as this is one area where a homeowner can save a lot of money. Fees, be they high or low, are not a consistently clear indicator of whether an HOA is good or not. Some **condo**s and **townhouse**s might have low HOA fees that ultimately mean few services are offered or, worse, the services offered are no good, making monthly or annual fees wasteful expenses. Other **condo**s and **townhouse**s might have high fees that cover many services and amenities and ultimately save money as the HOA may have special deals with local service providers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In real estate, a **condo** is a single-family home that is contained within a larger structure. In most buildings, there are multiple apartments per floor, so you may have neighbours above, below, or right next door depending on your particular **condo**’s floor plan. From luxury high-rises in urban locations to suburban home complexes, they may be found just about anywhere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In most cases, you’ll buy a **condo**, own your unit and everything inside, but you will pay monthly fees for things such as building maintenance and utilities. Those fees rely on how much each homeowner contributes to ensuring they stay up to code and running smoothly. These are among the things you should know before buying a **condo**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **townhouse**, sometimes known as a townhome, is a property that shares one or more walls with the neighbors. These are single-family homes frequently constructed in rows of identical houses. They are sometimes referred to as row houses when aligned in this fashion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Buying a home can be a stressful process, and all of the complicated real estate lingo can make things even more confusing, especially for first-time homebuyers. With so many different architecture terms and types of homes out there, it can be hard to know where to begin your home search. Deciding what type of home is the best for your needs is a great place to start. Townhouses and **condo**s are both great types of homes, but there are some key distinctions that might make one of these homes suit your lifestyle better than the other. Let’s start with defining what the architectural differences between a **condo** and a **townhouse** are: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Condos do have one safety concern that **townhouse**s do not — at least not to the same extent. Condos, like any home, can be bought, rented out, or resold, meaning good and bad neighbors come and go. Having bad neighbors is a concern that exists with any close-quartered apartment living; the difference is that a **condo** is a more serious investment that is harder to get out of if the quality of one's neighbors declines. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Townhomes are typically bigger than **condo**s or apartments. They can have very large floor plans with multiple stories. So if you want big, a townhome would be the way to go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Townhouses offer more privacy than an apartment or a **condo** would. With apartments and **condo**s, you typically share a ceiling and floor with other tenants in addition to the left and right walls. Given the row by row line-up of **townhouse**s, tenants only have to share a wall on either side with their neighbors, and these walls will likely be soundproof. You may not want to throw a party mid-week, but playing some guitar in your room probably won’t stir up any complaints Amenities: Like apartments, many **townhouse** communities come with amenities, including trash removal, swimming pools and gyms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hoa fees for townhomes are usually lower as compared to a **condo**. Owners are financially responsible for the upkeep. They also do not pay for exterior insurance through the HOA. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Townhouse owners, like **condo** owners, must maintain their dwelling units. Townhouse owners also usually must maintain any land they own adjacent to their **townhouse**. That may involve mowing a small law, sidewalk repairs, or snow removal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **condo** is not the same as an apartment. While both are types of homes typically located in complexes, the two have several distinct differences. If you are thinking about buying a **condo** or an apartment, it's good to know those differences before deciding where to live. Here is some information on each type of home to give you some insight on which might be the best option for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The biggest advantage of renting an apartment is cost. For several reasons, renting an apartment versus a **townhouse** or **condo** might be less expensive in the long run. Renting an apartment for the first time can be scary — more so when you learn that you should make at least 40 times the rent in annual wages. Yet renting an apartment as opposed to a **condo** or a **townhouse** can reduce the number of expenses you pay and the cost of those expenses you do have. Here are some of the other benefits of renting an apartment: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – The number of amenities that a resident gets while staying in a **condo** is unrivalled. Facilities include gyms, party rooms, rooftop BBQ areas, open and green terraces, meeting rooms and yoga rooms. Cost – The cost of staying in **condo**s is cheaper compared to other real estate properties. Usually, fees for maintenance are divided between all the residents and the owners. Therefore, the cost of living in a **condo** is more affordable for most people. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Affordability: Condos are usually cheaper than houses because of the size. Although the size is small, it doesn't mean they're not spacious enough to fit your needs. Do some research before purchasing a **condo** so you can determine if it's worth what you want to spend on it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Limited maintenance: In **condo**s, there is not a corporate entity providing 24-hour supervision. If something goes wrong in your apartment, there is always somebody to take care of it. With a **condo**, you have to work with the schedule of the **condo** owner, if doing repairs is even a mutual agreement. Since **condo**s are not regulated the same way as apartments, your landlord could decide not to be responsible for the maintenance or upkeep of the property. The owner is hopefully invested in the property, but often not without a price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In a complex of **condo**s, homeowners communally own common areas and all exteriors. These areas are kept clean and in good condition with the money brought in by HOA fees. Even the roof of the complex is communally owned. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This was called a **condo** conversion property. (There is a legal process to changing an apartment building into individual units for sale.) Most of the time the units are renovated and slapped with a pretty bow to make them more appealing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A townhome can be part of a Planned Unit Development (PUD). Townhome owners are responsible for the entire single-family unit: the inside, possibly exterior walls and roof (depending on set up of HOA), but definitely the land it sits on. A **condo** owner, by contrast, does NOT own the land that it sits on or the exterior. A **townhouse** owner is responsible for payment of all real estate taxes, maintenance and repairs of the property. In this way, it is a similar living experience to a single-family home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Townhomes may or may-not have common areas with joint ownership. Townhouses are generally part of an owner’s association, especially if it is a maintenance-free community or offers other amenities. Generally, the monthly HOA fees are lower for a **townhouse**. Since the type of community varies wildly, this can affect your resale value. While monthly fees might be higher in **condo**s, the extra care given to the shared living space and community areas can pay off when it comes to selling your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What would you say if someone asks you to explain the differences between a **condo** and apartment? There’s a very good chance that you might not have the necessary information to answer that question properly like most of us. The concept of **condo**miniums or **condo**s is still new and unfamiliar to the people of Bangladesh. We tend to consider both to be the same. However, there are some differences that are significant enough to make them distinct from each other. Both of these types of dwelling have their appeals and neither is essentially better than the other; it’s all about your priorities. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Maintenance – The maintenance required for a **condo**minium is very minimal. Residents will only have to look after their houses and not the open spaces. The corporation or HOA owns most of the **condo**s as well as the communal and other spaces within the building. However, any **condo** fees will cover all maintenance work that might be required. (1) Overall, the money spent on maintenance fees is cheaper in a **condo**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **townhouse** is a housing style where there are multiple independent and identical houses that are usually in a row. (2) Townhouse owners own the land as well as every interior inside the **townhouse**. Townhouses are a perfect single-family home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you purchase a **condo** **townhouse**, you own the individual unit you live in, but not the exterior. The outside of your unit and common areas are owned by the **condo** residents collectively and maintained through monthly maintenance fees, or **condo** fees. If you aren’t one to undertake snow shoveling or general upkeep such as lawn cutting and leaf raking, this is a great option for you. Your **condo** fees will also cover significant expenses such as replacing faulty windows or a damaged roof. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The safety and privacy of a **condo** or townhome depends on the structure. Some **condo**s are very secure, offering advanced security features, such as electronic door lock systems and video surveillance in common areas; other **condo**s are not developed with top security in mind. Townhouses come with many of the same security features (and issues) that a traditional detached home does. Of course, most safety depends on the location. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now we’ve weighed up the pros and cons of both homes, it’s time to sum things up. Starting with **townhouse**s, that provide a sense of freedom and individual space. They have separate entrances and parking spaces. Even the outdoor space will be separate for **townhouse**s, making it a private home suitable for family life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Instead of asking, “What’s better?” ask, “What’s right for me?” An apartment for the budget-friendly. A **townhouse** if you need more space but hate the suburbs. A **condo** for a nice in-between. Think about what makes a home special to you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Size: A **townhouse** is larger than an apartment. Townhouses can be two to three stories high, giving you lots of space for dining, entertaining and storage. Most **townhouse**s also include areas for outside activities, such as grilling, barbecuing or playing games in the yard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The word **townhouse** refers to a style of construction. As with a house, a townhome owner own both the structure and land where it sits. They own the interior and exterior including the driveway, roof, and lawn. Because townhomes share common walls the owners own the front and back yards of their townhome. However, ownership does not include communal areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The advantages of living in a **condo** are directly related to its management. Working with a private owner affects how issues are treated and how comforts are offered. Renting a **condo** is right for you if you favor a personal touch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Townhouses are available in two types of ownership: fee simple and **condo**minium. Because you only own the inside of your townhome when you buy a **condo**minium, the HOA is responsible for maintaining the exterior and yard. Maintaining the front, back, and side yards is a responsibility that comes with fee-simple ownership. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In terms of privacy, **condo**s and **townhouse**s may or may not seem private. For those easily bothered by noise, it is wise to ask about how thick the shared walls are and to even talk to neighbors before purchasing a **condo** or **townhouse**. Some infrequent noise (e.g., an occasional party) is to be expected, but everyday movement should not be easily heard in a **condo** or **townhouse** that is built well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A reputation for luxury follows **condo**s. Condos were built to be owned, so appliances are high-quality, the walls have a neat coat of paint, floors are shiny. Renting a **condo** means these luxurious commodities are all available to you. Amenities: Condos can also have amenities just like apartments do. Pools, gyms and community rooms are often available for tenants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main difference in comparing a **condo** vs. a **townhouse** will be what you’re required to do. Living in these homes gives owners different levels of responsibility for the property. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Investing is never a guaranteed thing. The value of a **condo**, townhome, or single-family detached home depends on numerous market conditions, many of which are out of your control. You have no control over any of these elements. On the other hand, **condo**s and townhomes have some advantages when it comes to aspects that are within your control. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This means that you own a common tenancy with the other unit owners. Shared areas and the building exterior, such as driveways, recreation and landscape areas, parking spots, sidewalks, roofs, hallways, and elevators are managed and maintained by the **condo** community. They take care of shared areas, as well as services like trash removal, lawn care and snow removal. This home owners association (HOA) is a conduit for all the homeowners to pay for various expenses of operating the property. Since all **condo** owners share the costs of common areas, they tend to have higher home owner association fees. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Plus, **condo**miniums are owned and rented by individuals so renting a **condo** is more of a personal, one-on-one process. The landlord may or may not stay on site (It depends on the architecture and personal preference of the owner.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Co-op apartments are typically owned by large corporations. Residences there can own but instead of owning structure(townhome) or airspace(**condo**) they own shares the corporation issued giving them a proprietary lease. A certain amount of shares are assigned to each unit depending on unit size and sometimes location. These are not considered real property. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main difference between **townhouse** options is how ownership works. With a freehold **townhouse**, you own the home and its land. With a **condo** **townhouse**, you own the interior of the home only - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With **condo**s, the common areas including hallways, the roof, stairs, elevator, and even the land are shared among all the **condo** owners in an undivided interest. There is a homeowners association that manages a **condo** complex. A **condo** can be attached or completely detached dwellings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another one of the clear differences between a **condo** and apartment is the space required to house this type of dwelling. Residential apartments have limited features and amenities that don’t require a lot of space. Even with leaving necessary empty space for adequate air flow and natural light, the space required is significantly less than that of a **condo**minium complex. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before purchasing a **condo** or **townhouse**, potential buyers should ask for a copy of the HOA's meeting minutes, financial statements, and rules and regulations, the latter of which are often known as CC&Rs (covenants, conditions, and restrictions), but can go by a variety of names. Depending on the HOA, these documents can make for a lengthy read — up to 50 pages, all together — but they are important. They tell buyers how restrictive life may or may not be under the HOA, how financially sound the managing body is, and how often (and by how much) HOA fees have increased over time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Condo fees also cover exterior work such as roof repairs, siding, gutters, sidewalks, etc. Owners of **condo**s are typically not individually responsible for leaks in ceilings, window repairs, clogged toilets, etc. These repairs are typically paid for by the **condo** board which in turn collects due(**condo** fee) each month from the owners). The fee can vary from year to year depending on how many maintenance items/issues the community had the prior year. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The ownership of an apartment is different from a **condo** in that it is a rental property. You will only be responsible for the interior of your unit. You pay rent to live in your unit, but you can't make any changes to the appearance of the building without approval from the complex. This is typically a much cheaper housing option than a **condo** or a home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’re likely to have neighbors above and below you with **condo** ownership. Condo and apartments usually are very hard to distinguish visually from the exterior. You really can think of a **condo** as an apartment you own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The premise of a **condo** is that occupants have agreed on shared space. Most people enjoy **condo**s because they don’t have the burden of keeping up with maintenance. However, the downfall is how close your neighbors are to you. Therefore, it is important for occupants to understand that their neighbors may not always act how you’d like. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The greatest disadvantage of renting a **townhouse** is dealing with the management of space. As townhomes offer the feeling of homeownership, you’ll want to consider a few extra things associated with maintenance and living space. For this reason, it is easier to rent an apartment than to rent a **condo** or **townhouse**. Renting a **townhouse** is only a good idea if you can handle something quite similar to a home and that neighborhood that comes along with it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **townhouse** is typically a two-to-three story attached or semi-detached row-style home. A **townhouse** can be owned in fee simple estate, in which one owns the land and the improvements on the land. A **townhouse** can be divided into **condo** units. A **townhouse** can also be divided into apartments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Plus, the rate of **condo**s is rapidly increasing in Toronto. This mainly due to the demand and lifestyle benefits that a **condo** provides. However, at the end of the day, it is all about your requirements. If you are looking for a place where your kids can have their own space and enjoy in the backyard too, **townhouse**s are perfect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **townhouse** is not an apartment, but a house built within a row of connected houses. Most **townhouse**s are built more narrowly than traditional detached homes and are usually two- to three-stories tall. Depending on where it is in the row, a **townhouse** shares one or two walls with the other homes. Most have a small backyard and frontyard. With their connected walls, **townhouse**s share some characteristics with duplexes and triplexes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Most of the **condo**s in Toronto are in bustling neighbourhoods. Homes in popular areas tend to have better public transportation, making your **condo** location convenient for reducing your commute from your home to work. Amenities – The number of amenities that a resident gets while staying in a **condo** is unrivalled. Facilities include gyms, party rooms, rooftop BBQ areas, open and green terraces, meeting rooms and yoga rooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But there is a lot more to understand than just linguistic differences. I.e. **condo**s in the USA are referred to individual living spaces in a building, and in the UK, an apartment can be a set of rooms set within a house. So let’s understand all these terms better: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Style: Condos are inclined to have character. Your landlord likely lived in the **condo** at some point and may have decorated with a unique taste compared to the often generic setup of an apartment. Altering the interior of your space is typically less restrictive in a **condo**. Especially if you’re a long-term resident, your landlord may be willing to let you paint or make other adjustments that fit with your personal style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Townhouses typically have lower HOA fees since they typically require less upkeep and have a smaller number of features, which lowers their costs. However, this does not imply that maintaining a **townhouse** will always be less expensive. For example, if you don’t pay HOA fees to cover the landscaping or exterior care of your **townhouse**, you will still have to foot the bill. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Landlord Rules: You may have to abide by specific rules established by your landlord, which you don't have in a **condo**. There might be restrictions on pets in an apartment building, for example. And depending on where you are in the country, there can be strict laws about how long a car can sit parked on the street or in a driveway before it is considered abandoned and towed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you’re renting your own place for the first time or are moving again, you’re probably looking at various rental options. Perhaps your first thought was to rent an apartment. However, **townhouse**s and **condo**s are also available to rent. Now that you know what some of your options are, learn more about the differences and compare the advantages, disadvantages and costs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re leaning more towards buying a **condo**, you’re not alone. The **condo** market in Toronto has seen a drastic rise as of late due to immigration and the booming jobs market. Learn more about their pros and cons here: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main advantage of renting a **townhouse** is the change in lifestyle. Renting a **townhouse** is similar to renting an apartment, except you may be responsible for HOA fees. Living in a **townhouse** is comparable to owning a home minus the mortgage loan. This means more space, fewer restrictions and a taste of suburbia, among other things. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Condo associations generally cover many more maintenance issues than **townhouse** HOAs do. While much depends on the fee structure and size of the HOA, good **condo** HOAs handle maintenance in many of the same ways that large rental apartment management companies do: by fixing problems within a **condo** (e.g., a leaky faucet) and by maintaining common areas and exteriors. For example, grounds are maintained by gardeners and roofing is replaced as needed by professionals, all paid for with money taken in and held by the HOA. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Residents staying in **condo**s have to pay monthly fees for all the standard space amenities. This might be an issue for most residents since not everyone uses these spaces or amenities. Less autonomy – Condos in Toronto are subjected to the bylaws stated by the **condo** corporation. Due to this, residents might not be able to make changes to their homes. They might not even be allowed to decorate their home during holidays. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Depending on the homeowner’s association and other factors, not all **condo** complexes qualify for financing. (That is a whole other can of worms for a lender to address.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Convenience: Condominiums are designed to have everything you need for your daily living right at the building. This includes a grocery store, shops, dry cleaning service, etc. You don't have to worry about going outside as much as if you were living in an apartment. You can find the best **condo**s that feature even a restaurant, a park, and a gym. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both **condo**s and residential apartments have a ton of aspects that make them attractive. Which one of these is right for you will depend entirely on your preference. But as far as differentiating goes, you should probably have the answer to the question ‘What are the differences between a **condo** and apartment?’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Condo’s come in all shapes and sizes. They usually fall in the middle. They are bigger than most apartments but smaller than a townhome on the average. Again, **condo**s can come in 2 story versions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Townhomes are also used interchangeably to reference **condo**s. A townhome is at least a two-story property that is attached to another. There’s at least one shared wall between your townhome and the one attached to yours. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dues: Owning a **condo** doesn't mean you don't have to pay for anything else. There are still fees in place such as HOA dues that you have to cover. There are also monthly or yearly **condo** fees for the upkeep of the common areas, exterior maintenance, and other amenities. The HOA board usually sets these fees, so they can vary from building to building. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Boat slips? Condos. Office buildings? Condos. Malls? Condos! In Georgia, a **condo** is simply defined by the legal relationship owners have to the land and each other. Essentially, if something has individual units owned exclusively by a buyer AND common elements that are jointly owned by all co-owners, in Georgia, it can be designated a **condo**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The disadvantages of renting a **condo** stem from the same origin as the advantages of renting a **condo** — individuals. When working with individuals, there is not a set of foundational guidelines that **condo** owners are entrusted with to conduct business. Everything is case-by-case. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Everything other than the residential units themselves is collectively owned by all of the **condo** development's owners. The land on which the **condo** is built, the hallways, the parking lot, the laundry room, the swimming pool, and anything else that is not inside a unit is shared property. This shared property is also known as “common elements.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re deciding whether to rent an apartment or buy a **condo** or townhome, the decision comes down to what you’re hoping to accomplish. If you value a maintenance-free lifestyle, you’re better off renting an apartment. This way, there’s no lawn to mow and the landlord will take care of all maintenance, both inside and out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Condos are governed by a board of directors who work with the **condo** corporation to oversee its overall operation. Because you don’t own the exterior of your home, you’re not free to make any changes or improvements without permission from the corporation and, even then, you’re limited in what you can do. If you want to replace your fence, for example, you can’t simply do it yourself. The corporation would have to determine that all fences under their management would need to be repaired or replaced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you think a **townhouse** or apartment could be right for you, check out our rental communities. Triple Crown Corporation has more than a dozen professionally managed properties, so you’re sure to find one that fits you. Many of our properties allow pets and include appliances such as a washer and dryer. Many of our luxury townhomes feature fireplaces and vaulted ceilings. See if renting one of our apartments or **townhouse**s is right for you! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   More autonomy – Residents have the freedom to make changes to their **townhouse**s without any issue. As they are detached homes, they can alter the interiors as well as exteriors. This is one of the main reasons why homeowners prefer **townhouse**s. They can decorate and personalize their **townhouse**s as per their liking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But what defines a **condo** is the way that they are owned. Condo owners only own the inside of their residential unit. For this reason, **condo**s are sometimes called "walls-in" properties (because you own everything from the walls in). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both **townhouse**s and **condo**miniums can come with rules you may not like. For example, if you have pets, you may not be able to have them. In some communities, the type of pet may be restricted, or there could be a weight requirement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Responsibility – Residents have higher responsibilities when living in **townhouse**s. They do not have the luxury to call the maintenance for any sort of repair work that might be needed for the property. So, **townhouse** owners will have to carry out all the repairs and maintenance that’s required themselves. This includes everything from plumbing issues to lawn care. All the fees are on the owner, not the entire building. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You will need dwelling insurance at a minimum. Some townhomes/**condo**s will cover interior walls as well as anything attached to it. Review your community’s insurance policy. Liability insurance and personal property insurance is also necessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main difference is how ownership works for each option. With a freehold **townhouse**, you own the home and its land. With a **condo** **townhouse**, you own the interior of the home only. Its land and surrounding areas are collectively owned by the group of **condo** unit holders, which, in turn, is managed by a **condo** corporation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Townhouses usually have fewer common areas. Though **townhouse**s share one or two walls, they are considered individual and independent homes, usually with individual yards (that may be fenced) and carports/garages. Very little is jointly owned. However, in some cases **townhouse**s may be part of a larger neighborhood which has a communal area, such as a small playground, pool, or park. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **condo**, or **condo**minium, is a single-residential unit that’s housed within a larger building. Condo layouts vary by building, but most buildings have several units per floor, so you may have other units above, below, or next to you. They can be found anywhere, from luxury high-rises in urban areas to residential buildings in suburban areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That said, while previously it depended solely on whether a family or an individual is buying the house – things have changed. For example, it used to be the case that **condo**s didn’t have many amenities. Nor did they have much open space like a **townhouse**. However, both options are much more accessible than ever before as homes for people of all lifestyles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Another added benefit of staying in a **condo**minium is that residents will live around lots of people. Living in a **condo** is great for building social circles. Plus during emergencies, having good neighbours can be really beneficial. The location – Most of the **condo**s in Toronto are in bustling neighbourhoods. Homes in popular areas tend to have better public transportation, making your **condo** location convenient for reducing your commute from your home to work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The apartment only has one title of ownership for the whole building. An apartment is owned by the person or entity that owns the entire apartment building. There is only one title of ownership with an apartment building for all of the apartments, whereas a **condo** building has as many titles of ownership as there are individual apartments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first time a **condo** association tells you that the flowers you’ve planted need to go, you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about. Always have a checklist to compare living in a traditional home vs. a **condo** before marking a final decision. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No land is owned in a **condo**. Instead, it is the space inside the apartment that is owned. In contrast, those who own a **townhouse** actually own the land their home is built on. Both **condo** owners and **townhouse** owners must pay property taxes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The homeowner association will have insurance to cover the communal areas. A **condo** unit owner will need to have **condo** insurance for their belongings, much like you would have when renting an apartment. Having insurance is vital whether you are purchasing a **condo** or a **townhouse**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – The cost of staying in **condo**s is cheaper compared to other real estate properties. Usually, fees for maintenance are divided between all the residents and the owners. Therefore, the cost of living in a **condo** is more affordable for most people. Safety – Condos have higher security for residents, as units are close together. Also, residents can pay for additional security services and gadgets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you live in an apartment, the building will be managed by a property manager who will care for everything inside your unit and in the common areas. However, if you live in a **condo**, you will have to handle things independentaly. Everything outside your unit will still go through **condo**minium management (e.g., snow removal, landscaping), but the inside of your **condo** will be up to you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As with all real estate costs, location determines the greatest portion of a **condo** or **townhouse**'s value, but there are many expenses to consider. HOA fees and what they cover should be taken into account, as should property taxes, any and all insurance expenses, and (especially in the case of a **townhouse**) home inspection costs. The mortgage interest rates for buying a **condo** are also usually higher than those for buying a **townhouse** or detached home; making a down payment of 25%, rather than 20%, can help mitigate this, but it's a high upfront cost. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Why are builders marketing **condo** **townhouse**s as freehold **townhouse**s? It’s simple. The word **condo** has a negative stigma for those wanting pure homeownership. But, why does the builder not just build freehold **townhouse**s then? This is because the builder can build a larger amount of homes under the **condo** **townhouse** designation while still receiving very close to the same market value as ones that are pure freehold. They can build more homes on their land and realize more profits. Meanwhile, the homeowners feel like they are getting a freehold home but that small maintenance fee tends to grab your attention 10-15 years down the line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to **condo**s, they are an excellent option for those who prefer the busy city lifestyle. Condos also provide homeowners with better security. The close proximity to the city is a big attraction of a **condo**minium too, especially if you commute to work. Finding a **condo** within a short walk of work is ideal! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **townhouse** is larger than an apartment. Townhouses can be two to three stories high, giving you lots of space for dining, entertaining and storage. Most **townhouse**s also include areas for outside activities, such as grilling, barbecuing or playing games in the yard. Pets: Because a **townhouse** is meant to be more like a traditional home — and typically has a yard — they are more likely to allow pets. Check with the homeowners association or management to be sure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When comparing the architecture of a **townhouse** vs. a **condo**, **condo**miniums usually are part of more significant buildings that can look like apartment complexes. The unit’s exterior often does not have many distinguishing characteristics with a **condo**minium. Condos will share at least one wall and, in some cases, multiple walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Townhouses, or townhomes, are another kind of common interest ownership property. It's a bit confusing because a **townhouse** is a type of structure: more than one story, and usually attached. In some places, **townhouse**s are more commonly known as row houses (or, for a certain type of **townhouse**, brownstones). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are potential drawbacks with **condo** and **townhouse** living, however. Condos and **townhouse**s can be expensive to own — especially **condo**s — and depending on how an individual HOA functions, they may or may not feel as though they are worth the money spent. Some also find the restrictive nature of an HOA frustrating, wishing instead that they could do more of what they would like without having to consult neighbors (in which case a detached home that isn't connected to an HOA is the best solution). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Condos almost always have higher HOA fees than **townhouse**s do. This is because **condo**s have more shared spaces and often some unique amenities, such as an exercise room or rooftop barbecue, which require more money to cover. Water, cable or DSL internet service, some insurance coverage, and other services or utilities may also be included in a **condo**'s monthly HOA fees. Townhouses often have HOA fees as well, but they are usually much lower and often only cover a small set of services, such as waste service and lawn care. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   About the author: The above Real Estate information on a **condo** vs. **townhouse** was provided by Bill Gassett, a Nationally recognized leader in his field. Bill can be reached via email at billgassett@remaxexec.com or by phone at 508-625-0191. Bill has helped people move in and out of many Metrowest towns for 35+ years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **townhouse** is a cross between a single-family home and a **condo**. They’re typically two or three stories tall and share walls with the next-door properties, but they don’t have any units above or below them. Townhouses are often a popular option for first-time homebuyers and young families, and they can also be found in age-restricted active adult communities. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some people use the term apartment interchangeably with a **condo**; however, the ownership abilities are very different. Apartments are a group of residences located in a complex or cluster. An apartment is a property with a landlord that requires you to secure a lease agreement in order to live there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **condo** vs. **townhouse** topic is confusing, even for some real estate agents who don’t know the key differences. While these property types hold some similarities, there are also significant differences. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Traditional houses still offer a more significant investment return than **townhouse**s and **condo**s in most areas. Home appraisals have less variation when models in the neighborhood are the same footprint or square footage. The only distinguishing characteristics will be interior amenities. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Owners of a **condo** own the interior airspace of the **condo**. They do not own the land on which it sits or the structure itself. And of course, they can own a percentage in communal areas. However, this is not always the case. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In general, rules and regulations are a bit stricter for **condo**s than for townhomes because HOAs play a larger role. There are pros and cons to having more rules, depending on what your preferences as a homeowner are. Some people value having more freedom of expression when it comes to their landscaping and property, whereas others prefer a more uniform look. These rules can be helpful because they make things like assigning parking spaces or keeping up with maintenance efficient, but it might mean you have less freedom to alter the property to your tastes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Be sure to review the bylaws to confirm what you are responsible vs your home owner’s association. Your lender will typically require you to get an HO6 policy which is designed for **condo**s. It covers your personal items, the interior, and some structural items (like walls). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Townhouses have higher resale values due to demand. Townhouses offer residents freedom and independence. People are willing to pay a higher price for this, especially when the residence is located at a prime spot. Selective maintenance charges – Residents staying at **townhouse**s pay maintenance charges depending on their requirements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **townhouse** is a hybrid of a single-family residence. In most cases, they’re two or three stories high and share walls with the homes next door, but they don’t have any units above or below them. Many first-time homeowners and young families prefer **townhouse**s, which can also be found in active adult communities. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Townhouses often require a lot more self-maintenance or the private hiring of professionals to fix problems that eventually arise. A **townhouse** may or may not have an HOA at all, and those that do are less likely to cover grounds upkeep or even major maintenance concerns, like roof replacement. However, there are exceptions to this, so asking after what a **townhouse**'s HOA covers is paramount. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hoa fees are typically higher than other types of homes. With **condo**s, there are more upkeep charges not to mention exterior insurance charges collected by the HOA. On a positive note, homeowners insurance is cheaper as the owner only needs to ensure the interior. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Townhouse owners do, however, have a lot of responsibility when it comes to the maintenance and upkeep of their home. Detached homes, in general, are not as secure, as they have windows and doors based on a ground level with easy access. In the **townhouse** vs **condo** debate, this is one round **townhouse** can’t win. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most common configuration of a **condo** is that of an apartment within a complex. What makes an apartment a **condo** is the fact that someone can own the interior space of that apartment and jointly-own the spaces outside of it (e.g., halls, exercise rooms, parking lots or garages, pools, the building's roof). Sometimes an independent office within a multi-unit complex is also called a **condo**, but this is less common. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The cost of buying a **condo** **townhouse** is typically lower than a freehold, which makes it an attractive option. While housing prices have increased across the board, a **condo** is still a viable option for many would-be buyers. When looking at your budget, make sure you factor in the amount of your monthly **condo** fees and keep in mind that they’ll likely go up incrementally over the time you live in the house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If HOA fees are significantly higher than those found in similar places nearby, or if a **condo** complex has more renters than owners, reselling a **condo** may be difficult. Moreover, **condo**s appreciate more slowly than **townhouse**s or detached homes that are more suitable for families, so it may be some years before a **condo** gives a good return on investment — if it ever does. Thoroughly research the local housing market before buying a **condo** or **townhouse** to rent out or resell. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In a physical state, apartments, flats and **condo**miniums are more of the same. The term ‘apartment’ is mostly used in American English, ‘flat’ in British English, and ‘**condo**minium’ in Canadian English. They all indicate a set of rooms that are on a particular floor and are meant to be used as a residence for individuals and families. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the con side, a freehold **townhouse** is similar to a detached home in that you own the physical house and the property it sits on. You are, therefore, responsible for all improvements, repairs and maintenance – inside and out. Upkeep can be a large ongoing endeavor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Maintenance: When it comes to maintenance, **condo**s are usually taken care of by the homeowner association (HOA). If there is a **condo** board in place, it will determine how to maintain and promote the **condo**s. You'll also be responsible for any repairs that need to be done within your unit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Condos often cost less than **townhouse**s and, contrary to popular thought, can be similar in price to apartments. But it isn’t always so. The most significant factor after location is size. A **condo** downtown will cost more than one in the suburbs, and a larger **condo** will cost more than a smaller unit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you value your privacy, the community lifestyle might not be for you. Since you will be living closer to your neighbors than in traditional single-family homes, you will be able to hear your neighbors more. In **condo**s, you could have people above and below you as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For example, the homeowner association could decide that the decks need replacement. When you are part of a community with numerous units, you may find that your building is farther down the list of completion. In a **condo** community, you can often find yourself waiting for things to get done that take longer than you would like. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **condo**minium , or **condo** , is a type of housing wherein a very specific part of a larger property — almost always an apartment within a complex — is privately owned by the homeowner, while all other connecting areas of the complex are communally owned by all **condo** residents. Townhouses , or townhomes , are individual houses that are placed side-by-side, where one or two walls of each house are shared between adjacent homes. Condos generally have higher HOA fees and are smaller, while **townhouse**s have lower HOA fees are built with more square footage. Both types of housing are found more frequently in urban areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Condos are typically amenity focused as these are their selling points. You will find a clubhouse for parties, golf courses are common on **condo** sites. Landscaped pools and coordinated activities are also present. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Freehold **townhouse**s are typically attached to other houses, on one side or both. Despite being physically attached, you still have the freedom to make your house your own. You can renovate the home as you see fit without adhering to guidelines or seeking permission. You’re also responsible for your own snow shoveling, grass cutting and any landscaping you wish to do. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Towns homes can be a little more private than **condo**s and especially apartments. It is much like a residential neighborhood except the owners share walls. You don’t see as many big club areas like the **condo**s or apartments have. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For **townhouse**s, there are two types of ownership: fee simple and **condo**minium. With **condo**minium ownership, you only own the inside of the townhome, so upkeep of the home’s exterior and yards will be covered by HOA fees. With fee-simple ownership, you’ll be responsible for maintaining your home, as well as the front, back and side yards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One other thing to keep in mind is that new-home builders are often marketing **condo** **townhouse**s as freehold **townhouse**s. They do this by simply saying there is a small fee for items such as snow removal and landscaping. However, in the vast majority of cases you are still purchasing a **condo** **townhouse**. You will know because you will receive a booklet with the by-laws of the **condo** corporation along with a status certificate once you take possession. Now, you should really know this upfront on signing but if you’re ever confused about the status of what you own, those two documents (along with checking your title) will serve as the biggest pieces of evidence. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main difference between a **townhouse** and an apartment is its structural management and organization. Townhouses are free-standing and give the impression of being a traditional house. An apartment is a unit in a larger building that encompasses a community all inside the same walls. There are multiple tenants, all managed by the same entity with the same regulations for everybody. Most renters live in apartments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because of the homeowner’s associations, you’ll be obligated to follow a set of rules for the neighborhood. There are often restrictions on parking, pool hours, renovations and any other change that can affect how the community is standardized. Utilities: Since a **townhouse** is more like a traditional home, renters are usually responsible for paying for utilities. Be prepared for higher utility bills than in apartments since there is more space to light and heat. The HOA may include some utilities in the monthly fee. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some families prefer to stay in **townhouse**s due to the independent nature and freedom they create as detached homes. Though, as they are conjoined with another property they will share walls and outdoor boundaries. It isn’t as ideal when the goal is total and utter privacy for families. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You have less to worry about when you own a **condo**minium. There are more conditions and restrictions that you need to follow, however. This is because you share much more in a **condo** development over a townhome community. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Apartment blocks are owned by a single entity, but **condo**minium towers are owned by a body corporate. Picture: realestate.com.au - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lifestyle: The apartment is not a permanent living arrangement but a short-term home that allows you to enjoy a particular lifestyle. It could be the lifestyle of an upscale suburb or near a major city where cultural and entertainment activities abound. If you are not ready to committ to purchasing a home or **condo**, renting an apartment is a great way to enjoy a certain location and/or lifestyle for a period of time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Townhouses – with their windows and doors leading onto the street – are not as secure. Since these are individual properties, residents don’t have security services like those available in **condo**s. Buying your own security systems to protect your home can be expensive. Higher expenses – Not only will people have to pay a higher amount to get a **townhouse**, but people will also have to pay more for the services as well. Townhouse expenses are greater than **condo**s overall, due to being a single-family home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Deciding where to spend the next year of your life is not easy. You may be struggling to choose between a **townhouse** versus an apartment versus a **condo**. All three options come with plenty of pros and cons, after all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Typically, **townhouse**s have lower HOA fees because they often require less maintenance and have fewer amenities. However, that doesn’t mean you’ll always pay less to maintain a **townhouse**. if you aren’t paying HOA fees for the maintenance of your **townhouse**’s landscaping or exterior, you’ll still be responsible for paying for that maintenance when it’s needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In general, rules and regulations are a bit stricter for **condo**s than townhomes because HOAs play a larger role. There are pros and cons to having more rules, depending on what your preferences as a homeowner are. Some people value having more freedom of expression when it comes to their landscaping and property, whereas others prefer a more uniform look. These rules can be helpful because they make things like assigning parking spaces or keeping up with maintenance efficient, but it might mean you have less freedom to alter the property to your tastes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An apartment is a housing unit that is leased for a period of time by the owner to another. This has no ownership of the apartment unit and occupancy of the unit terminates once the lease expires. A **condo** can be in an apartment building if the building was converted from a rental to a **condo**minium. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Home buying across Canada has become increasingly challenging, particularly for first-time home buyers. House prices have outpaced income, and those who have been eying a single-family, detached home are often discovering it isn’t financially feasible. The good news is that there are other, more affordable options available that will help you enter the housing market. One such example is a **townhouse**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For those who enjoy city living, a **condo** or **townhouse** can be a good fit, especially for first-time homebuyers. Not having to worry about exterior work, like gardening or landscaping, or roof replacement, makes **condo**s ideal for some, and having access to certain amenities is a bonus for many. Similarly, having a small yard in which to sit or garden in is a **townhouse** selling point for those who want some features of a traditional detached home but still want a more urban living experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

The decision of which is best for you will mainly depend on the type of lifestyle that you lead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Despite all of the differences between **condo**s and townhomes, these types of homes share many similarities and are both great options, depending on what you’re looking for.

-   Condo owners only have access to the interiors of the property. The communal area, parks, amenities, etc. are usually owned by the Homeowners Association (HOA). As a result, **condo** owners are subject to HOA fees. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
