-   It’s always important to keep design style in mind when **decorating**. Maintaining a consistent design theme throughout the room will make the room feel comfortable. Homeowners with a country or rustic themed living room should pick up a cowhide rug with a combination of beige and a shade of brown. The brown tone will pair well with a brown leather sofa. If a natural cowhide rug isn’t an option for your home, consider a faux cowhide rug that has brown as the primary color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With the leather **couch**es, you can add one different chair or two for visual interests. It can be a bold-looking chair in bright colors like yellow or red. It can also be the set of a **couch** and a table in a color that mixes in the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can add curtains in dreamy colors like white and cream in a room with dark brown **couch**es. You can also add bold curtains in colors like pink and wine red. Moreover, your curtains can be plain and can also be with bold patterns that mix well with your brown **couch**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here’s the deal, when **decorating** a space that has a brown **couch** as a focal point, you have to balance the heaviness of the brown furniture. You can balance the furniture with different shades of paint, window treatments, accessories, rugs, and even pillows. Consider this, if you have a dark chocolate brown sofa, dark moody walls, and then layer on darker accents like a rug – your space will feel dark. That is not always a bad thing. If you are looking for a moody and warm space, then that may work for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brown sofas aren't limited to a single **decorating** style. Pair one with eclectic patterns and prints for a global-inspired vibe.

-   Go for taupes, lighter-toned browns and neutral linens to create more of a relaxed rustic vibe. Make a neutral sofa stand out by setting it against a darker background colour. A half-and-half painted wall treatment is an easy way of adding darker colour to a living room without it dominating the scheme. A darker colour on the bottom creates a grounding effect, with a paler colour at the top adding height and a feeling of spaciousness – a great option for **decorating** the wall behind the sofa. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Given that your **couch** is the anchor piece in a living room or family room, you'll want to look to its hue first to ensure that the rug you select will be complementary.

-   Loading up any **couch** or sofa set with loads of big and small cushions can give any interior a beautifully attractive look. These cushions can be of any color that you wish to have. Neutral, dull, or attractive and bright, any kind of color, in contrast, will work with brown leather **couch**es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Expanding off of the idea of adding a side table, let’s not stop there! Now, all we need is a larger version to set in front of the **couch**. This is where you’re able to get very creative, keeping in mind what type of brown leather **couch** decor you’d like to invest in. The coffee table may be one of the first things that people observe when taking a look at your living room, so choose wisely! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another way to prevent a brown leather **couch** from overwhelming a room is to make almost everything else white. It takes a lot of a lighter color to balance a very dark one, so feel free to go all-white if you'd like. Crisp white ceilings, walls, and floors help keep this cozy nook light and bright. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'This modern button-backed **couch** in pecan adds a warm glow to this potentially otherwise dark scheme,' says Jennifer Ebert, deputy digital editor, Homes & Gardens.

-   All the **couch**es in the same shade would look great if paired with the right-side elements. Also, you can mix and match the **couch**es of different shades of brown leather in the same room.

-   Pillows are absolutely essential to almost any **couch** or comfy chair you decide to decorate your room with.
