-   Super**intelligence** by prof. Nick Bostrom is the book on Artificial Intelligence safety. Bostrom imagines how we can create an Artificial Intelligence far superior than we could even think and what risks does it entail. He thinks of examples of how things can go wrong and if super**intelligence** can replace us as the dominant lifeform on Earth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **books** provide an optimistic look at data and AI, yet there is a budding genre of negative takes. They, too, are good—if read with a critical eye. The best is Privacy is Power by Carissa Véliz on the need to take control of personal information (read our blurb). Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O’Neil is an unfair hit-job: the data are innocent—it’s people who are to blame! (Listen to our podcast with the author.) The Atlas of AI by Kate Crawford is a litany of AI’s woes, from its environmental toll to unemployment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   When Elon Musk, one of the busiest men on the planet, was asked about his secret of success, he replied, ‘I used to read **books**. A LOT’. Later, Kimbal Musk, Elon’s brother, said, ‘He would even complete two **books** in a day’. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I love this book. Having read a ton of **books** trying to teach machine learning from various angles and perspectives, I struggled to find one that could succinctly summarize difficult topics and equations. Until Andriy Burkov managed to do it in some 100-odd pages. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   He’s said, for a long time, that Kurzweil is half right. If we get AGI, the outcome could be absolutely wonderful. But it could also be terrible. He warns about the possibility not so much of a super**intelligence** going rogue—like Skynet, or HAL in 2001—but more simply of an immensely powerful entity that would not set out to damage us but have goals that could do us harm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   From the curated playlist on Spotify or intelligent recommendation on Netflix, AI is seemingly everywhere. With artificial **intelligence**, it is now possible to speak with someone even if we don’t speak their language. One of the ways to understand AI and the change it is bringing to our lives is to read **books** written on AI. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I certainly hope it will. Things like immortality, the complete end of poverty, the abolition of suffering, are all part of the very, very good outcome, if we get it right. If you have a super**intelligence** that is many, many times smarter than the smartest human, it could solve many of our problems. Problems like ageing and how to upload a mind into a computer, do seem, in principle, solvable. So yes, I do think they are realistic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let’s talk more about some of these themes as we go through the **books** you’ve chosen. The first one on your list is The Singularity is Near, by Ray Kurzweil. He thinks things are moving along pretty quickly, and that a super**intelligence** might be here soon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence, the first edition takes a bottom-up approach to problem resolution, examining the fundamental techniques (beginning with search-based methods and progressing to knowledge-based methods) and focusing mostly on the **intelligence** portion. The book covers both traditional and modern approaches to the problem, such as Tabu Search and Beam Search. The book is an entertaining read because of the simple explanations for the ideas, as well as the abundance of examples, illustrations, and commentaries. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In his book Homo Deus, he argues that humanity will increase his efforts to achieve total happiness, immortality and God-like powers and that may result into various possible futures. Will humans lose control to machines? Will the man be worshiped as God? But the man idea throughout the book is that it will end in uncoupling our **intelligence** from emotions. Harari dives deep into philosophical issues such as consciousness, human emotions, individualism so if you’d like a little philosophical questioning and thinking, make sure you read this book. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A radical and optimistic view of the future course of human development by "the best person I know at predicting the future of artificial **intelligence**" (Bill Gates).At the onset of the twenty-first century, humanity stands on the verge of the most transforming and thrilling period in its history. It will be an era in which the very nature of what i... - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Very interesting for the public that usually follows this blog on a regular basis, since it fits perfectly with their profile. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This book is written by Jeff Heaton. It teaches basic artificial **intelligence** algorithms such as dimensionality, distance metrics, clustering, error calculation, hill climbing, Nelder Mead, and linear regression. It explains these algorithms using interesting examples and cases. Needless to say, this book requires good commands over mathematics. Otherwise, you’ll have tough time deciphering the equations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Artificial **intelligence** is an area of computer science that allows us to develop intelligent machines that can act, think, and make decisions like people. Artificial **intelligence** arises when a machine can learn, reason, and solve problems in the same way that humans do. You don’t need to pre-program a machine to accomplish some task using Artificial Intelligence; nevertheless, you can design a computer with programmed algorithms that can work with its own **intelligence**, which is AI’s greatness. A few examples of AI which we witness in our everyday lives include: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Those who know of these advancements are keen to master this concept, including us at Analytics Vidhya. When we started with this mission, we found various forms of digitized study material. They seemed promising and comprehensive, yet lacked a perspective. Our curiosity didn’t let us rest for long and we resorted to **books**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In a slim volume, James Lovelock—a British scientist who originated the Gaia hypothesis that the Earth acts as a self-regulating, living organism—predicts how “cyborgs” may help people in the future, notably by keeping the planet temperate so both man and machine can survive. The AI-infused bots will be vastly more intelligent and faster-thinking than humans (and may keep us as pets, he suggests). But we should be willing to cede our place on the pedestal to a superior **intelligence**, he says, even if their answers are so intricately reasoned that they are ineffable to the human mind. Mr Lovelock passed away last month on his 103rd birthday, so the book represents some of the final thoughts of a very special thinker (read our review). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Singularity, as Ray Kurzweil has described it, is the point where humans and the **intelligence** of machines will merge. Once this happens, machines will be far more intelligent than all of the human species combined.

-   In this book James Barrat (a documentary filmmaker for National Geographic, Discovery, PBS and more) characterized Artificial Intelligence as humanity’s final invention. It clearly exposes the risks that may arise from General Artificial Intelligence, it indicates that super**intelligence** does not necessarily imply benevolence and it summarizes the last years of research on potential AI threads. And it does so thought extensive research and detailed interviews with people in the field. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes. He always seems to be devoid of doubt. I think that’s one of the things that makes him quite controversial. But he is something of a genius. Not only does he write fascinating **books**, but he’s also had a very successful career as a software entrepreneur. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To pick just one book, it would be Mr Kissinger’s, et al. Artificial **intelligence** humbles humanity and their analysis shrewdly explains why. ■ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Deep learning is the most promising development in the field of artificial **intelligence**.

-   Artificial Intelligence is one of the most trending buzzwords in technology today. With technologies such as Siri and Alexa, we’re seeing more and more how computers can simulate human thinking processes and even perform tasks that were once considered too difficult to be carried out by machines. Artificial Intelligence has spanned the imagination of science-fiction writers, philosophers, and technologists for some time now. For many people, AI remains a bit of a black box — something that can’t really be understood or defined. To help with that, we have created a list of **books** that will help you to explore the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence, but before that, we should have a basic understanding of AI. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But what is the wellbeing of humans? People don’t agree on that. In fact, all of us contradict ourselves: You don’t have to dig very far to work out that we have internally contradictory goals in our system, and probably had to in order to get by. A super**intelligence** which is programmed with such an internally inconsistent and possibly incoherent goal is either going to be paralyzed or have to change its goals, or could end up with some pretty perverse outcomes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The crux of this book is a big idea: AI marks “a new epoch” since it ends the Enlightenment’s ethos that placed humans at the centre of all that is knowable (displacing God), putting in their stead machines with superior **intelligence**. The book does a great job of explaining how AI systems work, though a chapter on business is lacklustre. Yet the analysis on international security is exceptional. Henry Kissinger, America’s pre-eminent foreign-policy thinker, is clearly spooked by AI weapons and calls on the West to develop them (so as to not cede them to a foe) while urging immediate AI arms-control talks. Since AI responses may be unlike human ones, the environment is more unpredictable and dangerous, the book argues (read our review). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a wonderful, humorous introduction to AI that is a fast read which is full of examples. It makes a great gift for friends or family who don’t know much about the field, and we imagine it would be especially interesting to teens as well as adults. We think it has more technical details and more interesting, on-point examples that most of you will appreciate. This book is a quick read, explaining to the casual audience how the algorithms that are being used by today’s machine learning systems are different from the super-intelligent metallic characters we so often see in movies. Anyone who wants to discuss how artificial **intelligence** is shaping the world should definitely read this book. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We’ve shown you the 21 best machine learning **books** that you can go through to advance in this field. Machine learning is a top job option these days. So it’s about time for you to learn about it and make a profitable career out of it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
