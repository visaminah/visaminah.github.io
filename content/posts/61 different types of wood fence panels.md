-   Believe it or not, **fence**s have a history that dates back to prehistoric times. But before we explore the history of wood **fence**s in detail, it is crucial to discuss what they really are. A **fence** is a type of barrier that helps enclose an area to limit access or control escape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It features a light color with visible grain knots, making it appear super distinctive. Oak **fence**s are best identified by their wavy grains as opposed to their color. A neat finish gives the grain a lovely highlight, elevating the beauty of the **fence**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, it is still recommended to treat the **fence** with a stain to beautify the barrier. Continuous moisture, snowfall, thawing, and dry air can easily affect redwood. And staining helps prevent it from becoming old and damaged. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many different types of wood that **fence** **panels** can be built out of. The most common types of wood **panels** you’ll find in your local hardware store may depend on your location. Some trees are native to certain areas, and therefore may be more or less common, and more or less expensive, depending on where you live. We have provided an estimate for each wood material cost, but it may vary depending on your location. The following outlines some of the types of wood you may come across when choosing your wood **fence** **panels**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are popularly known as close-board **panels** and are good for marking boundaries, and also for privacy. They are made from tapered boards which are joined together to form a solid wooden **fence**. You can buy boards and construct your **fence** or a ready-made feather edge **panels** ready for installation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These are the horizontally waney-edged also known as the overlap **panels**. They are made from boards cut directly from the trees (with some having the bark on) which are slightly overlapped. Some edges may be square and they offer maximum security and privacy for your garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Galvanised steel posts (we install a great system called Durapost) are lighter and stronger than concrete, but twice as quick to install. They don't warp, crack or rot, and they can withstand winds up to 110mph. They're compatible with almost any type of **fence**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When layered with a protective coating or finishing, red cedar offers an increased service life. Therefore, it is best to treat it with stains, oils, or other types of coatings. Red cedar **fence**s are striking in appearance, with straight grains and uniform textures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, you should know that choosing a more durable wooden **fence** can save you money over the long term. It is recommended to extend your budget to choose more durable woods if you intend to live longer in your home. If you plan to move out in the near future, you may choose more affordable wood that may not last as long. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Be sure to treat your **fence** with weatherproof solution to protect against moisture and extremely low or high temperatures. The finish should also contain UV protection, which will preserve the natural color of the wood longer. Clean and refinish the **fence** every other year to maintain its look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Broken posts can be identified by wobbling when handled.They can be replaced, and the existing **panels** attached, providing they’re in good condition. If the **panels** are damaged but the posts are intact, then individual **panels** can also be replaced. Old, dried **panels** can’t usually be repaired, as they break when nails are hammered in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another distinctive physical feature of cypress is its coarse texture with straight grains. Fences made from young cypress trees are less durable than **fence**s made from old cypress trees. Before you invest in cypress **fence**s , it is best to ask the seller about the construction of the cypress **fence**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Redwood is the most commonly used wood for wood fencing. Although it is costly, its overall quality and aesthetic appeal make it worth the expense. Since this variant of wood is rot and pest resistant, it is considered as the best choice of material for a **fence**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In our journey to build a beautiful, long-lasting wood **fence**, we have chosen to offer California native, sustainably harvested redwood. This hearty wood is beautiful in its natural state, but can also be stained or painted. When choosing the best wood for a **fence**, redwood is always a great choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   –This is the most durable and most suitable for domestic **fence**s. The wood has been treated with chemical preservatives and been put into a chamber to withstand damages caused by severe weather conditions and pests. However, pressure treated **panels** will still need regular maintenance but they are easy to work with and will serve you for years without the need for replacement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are worried about the cost of your new **fence**, remember that one of the best ways to get the best price is by choosing a reputable installation company. An experienced installer will help you know what’s best for you and your property, will know and understand fair pricing, and will only do the highest quality work. With an experienced installer, you can avoid all the potential DIY pitfalls and skip right to the beautifully installed wooden privacy **fence** of your dreams. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “We are very impressed with the quality and service that we have received from Jay Fencing with the installation of a 6 foot **fence** across the back of our yard. The structured schedule that was outlined for us for the installation was spot on, even with the different weather conditions. The installers that came to the house were very nice people, they were hard workers and did an excellent job. I highly recommend this company; and when the time comes to replace the **fence**s at the sides of our property – guess who we will be calling! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bear in mind that no type of **fence** lasts forever. They all come with a limited lifespan. In the case of a wooden rail **fence**, the wood will probably last 10 to 15 years at the most. This is only after you have fully repaired the **fence** until there is no scope for more repairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like cedarwood, cypress has a vivid odor that can cause respiratory irritation in people. If you have scent sensitivity, avoid investing in cypress **fence**s. Like many other wood types, cypress is rot and insect-resistant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you are shopping for wooden **fence** **panels** for domestic or commercial garden, irrespective of the size, our experts at Sheds to Last offer free consultation and advice on the best design, type of wood and routine maintenance that will keep your **fence** strong for years. We can help you with site survey and then make recommendations based on our findings. We also do the costing for you with no obligation. Wooden **fence** experts will consider the purpose of your **fence**, environmental factors and the most appropriate design that will cater for all your requirements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have painted your wooden rail **fence** once, you will have to keep repainting it to avoid rotting and moisture. The element that you can’t paint is the bottom of the post as it is installed in the ground. Eventually, it may rot and will need to be replaced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pine also possesses prominent grains with darker knots. This gives the fencing material a unique appearance, worth a second glance. As compared to cedar **fence**s, pinewood fencing is much cheaper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Everyone has a budget. And your budget will affect which wood type you can afford for your **fence**. If you have a limited budget, likely, you may not want to choose the longest-lasting and sturdiest option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **fence** should already be tanalised – this is a treatment carried out by placing the timber in a big tank where a preservative is forced into the wood under pressure. I don't normally recommend extra treatment as it can stop the wood from breathing. If you are going to treat your **fence** then ensure the material used is oil based. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Picket **fence**s are perfect for those after front garden ideas. They are typically rather low in height, with a good space between each timber. They are great for creating kerb appeal and neatening up front gardens or for separating areas of the garden off from one another and around ponds or swimming pools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On top of potential ergonomic issues the DIYers may face, there may also be a host of technical issues the DIYer can run into while working on their **fence**. Fence installation requires a lot of precision. If you dig your hole in the wrong spot, it will need to be filled and re-dug. This can leave a nasty, lasting mark on your yard! A shallow hole will not be sturdy, leading to potential structural issues down the road. Proper planning and precise marking will ensure little or no mistakes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wooden **fence**s will always have a special place in the design of a home. You can chose among different types of woods depending on the aesthetics and functionalities you want to add. The wood **fence**s serve different purposes include privacy, noise reduction, and security. Wood **fence**s also offer many design and construction options. The most popular ones include picket, post and rail, wood lattice, louver, and vertical board **fence**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Picket Fence: Picket **fence**s are a classic and traditional look. If you want aesthetics, you will definitely get it with a beautiful new picket **fence**! Picket **fence**s are often painted white but can be painted whatever colour you choose, or left natural. Like post and rail **fence**s, picket **fence**s do not provide a lot of privacy and are not the best **fence** to contain children or pets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Having them installed will elevate your outdoor beauty in a unique way. Red cedar comes with a distinct scent too. Of course, this does have one drawback; if you are allergic to certain smells, red cedar **fence**s may not be the wisest fencing option for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you choose a timber **fence** it will usually come in a natural wood colour. If you don’t like this look, you can paint the **fence** a different colour. Even if you like the natural colour of the timber, it’s a good idea to safeguard your **fence** against harsh weather with a protective treatment for wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally, lattice **fence**s come in redwood and cedarwood types. The best part is that this type of **fence** can be painted in any color. Modern homeowners typically prefer white or red **fence**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is so much more to a wood **fence** than just **fence** boards. Our **fence** boards and 2x4s (rails) are made of California redwood while the posts and kickboards are typically pressure-treated douglas fir. We also offer a variety of metal **fence** post options including postmasters, and bolt-ups. To Classic Fence Co, wood fencing is a craft. We take great pride in our work and have the utmost respect for you and your property. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This makes the wood long-lasting and an excellent wood fencing option. One of the downsides of cypress **fence**s is that they can be pricey. Cypress trees are native to the Southern United States; their transportation can spike up the trees’ overall cost. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, today, picket **fence**s are an ornamental way to keep pets and children within their house. Traditional homeowners use wooden or whitewashed picket **fence**s in their front or back yard. Many modern houses also feature picket **fence**s in PVC – a lightweight but strong plastic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Are you aware of all the fencing bylaws in your city, town, or district? Ignoring fencing bylaws can cause major problems down the road – including potentially needing to tear down your **fence** and install a new compliant one. An experienced installer will know the bylaws so you don’t have to worry about your **fence** following the law. They’ll help you choose: Stuck trying to decide between two types of wood? Can’t pick between a picket **fence** or shadowbox? A **fence** installer will help you pick the right materials and styles for you, your home, and your family. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pine trees grow up quickly, so as soon as the trees are cut down, they are replaced with new ones. Therefore, pinewood **fence**s are easily available in the market at an affordable price range. So if you have a tight budget, pine **fence**s are an attractive choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cypress has a naturally occurring compound called cypretine that protects it against insects. It is also a rot-resistant option for outdoor fencing. It is on the expensive side of the wood **fence** spectrum. Like other options, staining can help increase your **fence**’s lifespan. It is recommended to finish the stain with a sealant to strengthen the protective feature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Didn’t notice how much your backyard tree has grown in the last five years? A **fence** installer will be able to see all of the potential problems and obstructions, such as thick roots, rocky soil, and even slopes that may be difficult to work with. Not only will an experienced installer be able to recognize these issues, they also know the solution to them. Worry free – When you go with an experienced and professional **fence** installation company, you won’t have to worry about all that could go wrong. When doing-it-yourself, you are in charge of everything – including mistakes and potential problems, but when you hire a reputable company, you can sit back, relax, and watch as the professionals help create the property of your dreams. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As it is clear from this article, not all types of wood are equal. The best way to choose a wood **fence** is to consider the different characteristics of different wood variants. Once you have done this, you can then pick the one that best suits your preference and budget. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should know that pinewood comes with a tendency to get damaged easily. Scratches and dents are a common sight among pine **fence**s. However, these marks give pinewood **fence** posts an aged look, allowing them to have an old-world charm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, even if you love DIY projects, doing it yourself can be a big challenge. Post hole digging and **fence** installation can cause a host of ergonomic issues for the installer. Instead of renting a post hole digger, some opt to make their own digging device. Digging with a home-made digger can cause serious injuries if the device is made incorrectly or used by an inexperienced handyperson. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hardware stores: Rona, Home Depot, and Lowe’s are all common places to purchase **fence** **panels**. Purchasing **fence** **panels** from a large hardware store will offer many options, including styles and wood types. It’s easy to compare prices and determine a close approximation of how much your **fence** will cost in total. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pinewood is a variety of softwood which is found in many parts of the United States. Although it is softer than hardwood, this form of softwood is naturally stiff and resistant to shock. Owing to these features, pinewood makes for the best wood for **fence**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Redwood’s unique structure makes it ideal for outdoor construction. It weathers nicely and is naturally unappealing to pests and termites. Unlike some woods offered, redwood is less prone to warping and moving. Its naturally beautiful grain and red and white color make it an attractive choice for horizontal wood **fence**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although cedar **fence**s offer a wide variety of benefits, they have a few disadvantages as well. As compared to other wood **fence**s, cedar **fence**s are expensive. It is a general rule that the more attractive and durable the wood is, the costlier it is. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
