-   Navy **blue** and tan is one of the classic combinations on the list. Navy **blue** works nicely with just about any neutral, but the warmth of tan creates an especially balanced look.

-   Orlando Bloom, David Beckham, and Zayn Malik. What to consider: Instead of reaching for harsh colour pairings, opt for more neutral bases and then add a warm version of your favourite colour such as a pine green or a warm **blue** to keep it interesting.

For this look, stick to greys for the walls and floors and bring in those pops of color with furniture and accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

And, if you tan, there’s still a noticeable shift between the colour of your skin and the colour of your hair. People with this kind of complexion typically have very deep brown eyes or clear **blue** eyes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gray **clothes**, whether they’re light gray or dark gray, pair the best with lighter or brighter colors. Gray makes colors stand out against it, making it the ultimate support color. Whether it’s red, green, **blue** or orange, gray makes all these colors pop. Avoid combining gray with other muted colors as it creates too muddy of an appearance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
