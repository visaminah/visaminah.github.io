## 42 Shocking Facts About How Do I Know What Model Shower Valve I Have | Old Delta Shower Faucet Parts
-   Pro-Tip: Most manufacturer’s back up their **valve** cartridges, and other parts, with a Limited Lifetime Warranty. So when in need of a part or troubleshooting, contact the manufacturer’s product support line to get to the bottom of the issue and the free parts necessary to make the repair. Read more here: https://www.the**shower**headstore.com/blogs/news/**shower**-head-faucet-warranty-information - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By 1958, just four years after the new **valve** was launched, Del­ta's sales topped $1 million (CAD $1.38 million). Del­ta is still one of the best-selling fau­cets [4] in North Amer­ica. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When choosing between types of **shower** **valve**s, you also need to know how many **shower** heads you will be using for your project. Pressure balancing **valve**s are good for one to two **shower** heads at most, as they are equipped with standard sized ½” water inlets. As for larger **shower**s with more **shower** heads and body sprays, you’ll need a different **valve** type because this ain’t gonna cut it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Plumbing Codes: There are a lot of Chinese sellers on sites like Amazon selling nice looking **shower** systems, but they may not be up to code with American plumbing standards and/or not have compatible fittings with American plumbing systems. Reliability: Should you ever have an issue, like your **shower** **valve** leaking, having purchased a national brand with a reputable customer support team will save you a major headache. Repair parts are easy to get a hold of, whether it’s for free through their limited lifetime warranty or at your local hardware store if it’s really time sensitive. With off-brand products, it may be very hard to find repair parts. And when you are talking about **shower** **valve**s that are installed in your wall, that could mean the difference between being able to fix your existing **valve** and having to open up the wall to remove the entire defective **valve**, all because you couldn’t get your hands on replacement parts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The plumber intends on keeping the same **valve** in the wall. In that case, I would give you a word of warning. If the **valve** is not a pressure balancing **shower** **valve** , make sure that he (or she - I know some badass female plumbers too!) changes it out to bring the **shower** up to code. If it is up to code and you decide to keep it, determine the brand and **valve** name so you can find the right **shower** trim to go along with it. (For example: Moen (brand) Posi-Temp (**valve** name). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pro tip: When shopping for diverter **valve**s, keep an eye out for 2-way diverter **shower** **valve**s and 3-way diverter **shower** **valve**s. A 2-way **valve** means that you can divert water between two **shower** heads, whereas a 3-way **valve** can run water to those independent **shower** heads or to both at the same time. I’d always opt for the 3-way! For thermostatic **shower** **valve**s, you’ll typically need one diverter per **shower** head or spray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **valve**s can require more frequent maintenance, as the internal cartridge balancing the pressure usually has a spool in it that can get locked up over time due to scale and heavy mineral deposits. That will inevitably cause your **valve** to not produce a consistent water temperature until you get a pressure balance **shower** **valve** replacement cartridge. But that’s a small price to pay for safety. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before beginning confirm your brand and model **shower** faucet. Then purchase all parts necessary for the job. If you’re unable to identify the model of the **shower** faucet, take the old cartridge out and have a plumbing supply sales person identify it for you. It’s always a good idea to take a picture of the faucet handle and trim with you, as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And it even goes a step further. Brands, such as Moen and Kohler, even have different types of **shower** **valve**s that require specific types of trims. So you cannot just assume that “oh, I have a Moen **valve**, any Moen trim kit will work.” You must identify both the brand name and **valve** type before selecting your trim kit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Diverter **valve**s are IN ADDITION to the main rough-in **shower** **valve**. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen clients buy diverter **valve**s thinking that they were the main **shower** **valve**, only to be sadly disappointed when passing it along to their plumber...leading to project setbacks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dur­ing his wartime service with the U.S. military, Perry started tinkering with a design for a better "fluid **valve**" that combined the control of water flow and blending of water temperature in one simple device. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The older model Delta Monitor **shower** faucets were very well made and easily repaired. But they had, in my opinion, one major flaw. The faucet is constructed of two heavy brass sections connected by three soft copper tubes. So, if the bonnet nut seized, which it does often, an impatient or inexperienced person can break the **valve** and shut the home water system down until the faucet is replaced. Be careful! I highly recommend you let a professional make this repair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **valve** is still widely used in economy faucets including Delta's own Found­a­tions series of faucets. Delta ball **valve** and Mo­en cartridge **valve**.The Del­ta ball **valve** was one of the most successful faucet **valve**s in history, controlling Del­ta fau­cets for most of 60 years.The **valve** is still widely used in economy faucets including Delta's ownseries of faucets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My favorite **shower** **valve** repair is Moen. It’s a well-built and simply designed faucet that works well. It rarely needs repairs. There are two models that are the most common. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, start by turning off the water supply. This can be done by locating the cut-off **valve**s (there will be one for hot and one for cold). If you are working on the **shower**, you will have to locate the main water **valve** for the house which will be outside along the house or building. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll find these diverters installed just above the main **shower** **valve** with their own separate control. For pressure balancing **valve**s, you’ll only ever need one of these diverter **valve**s (as you’ll only be able to use up to two **shower** heads). For thermostatic **shower** **valve**s, you can have multiple diverters to control all of your **shower** heads and body sprays. Typically, for thermostatic **valve**s you need one diverter per **shower** head or spray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you pinpoint the exact temperature that you want for your **shower**, you never have to deviate from it. That’s because thermostatic **shower** **valve**s have a dial for the temperature and a separate control for the water volume. Again, with most pressure balancing **valve**s, once you shut off the water you lose the temperature “memory”. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most people know the brand of car they drive and whether their computer is made by Dell or Apple, but few can tell you off the top of their heads the brand of their **shower** faucet. It's critical to figure out the brand when you need to replace a cartridge because every brand now makes its own unique replacement parts. You can't use one company's parts for another brand's products. A stamped brand is a sure-fire **shower** **valve** cartridge identifier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The previous two types of **shower** **valve**s are “main” **shower** **valve**s that control the flow and temperature. Diverter **shower** **valve**s, on the other hand, are optional **valve**s that divert the flow of water between multiple **shower** heads. So, if you are only planning on using one **shower** head, you can skip using a **shower** **valve** with diverter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   They allow you to shut off the water to the **valve** so you can repair it without having to shut the main water source off. If you live in a building with multiple other residents, this could mean that you would have to shut off the water to the building or floor before you can fix your **valve**, which will take some time to get approved by the building’s superintendent. Even if you just live in a single family home, with these check stops you can work on the **valve** without stopping your washer from running water...you get the point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here are our top picks for the different types of **shower** **valve**s, factoring everything that we’ve discussed above. To keep it simple, we’ve selected one trim style per **valve**. However, brands typically offer 10-20 different styles of trims for each of their **valve**s, so you can do your own research if you find that these styles aren’t necessarily your cup of tea. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next you’ll see the Moen 1222 pressure balancing cartridge. The **shower** **valve** escutcheon screws are in a diagonal pattern. This is most commonly called the Positemp cartridge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the common pressure balancing **valve** problems is that there isn’t the ability to control the volume of water. So when you turn on the **shower** it starts at the coldest temperature at full water pressure. There are certain **valve**s that offer temperature memory and volume control but you need to know exactly what to look for. Hang around until the recommendations section, and I’ll give you some good options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Are you installing a walk-in **shower** or a tub/**shower** combo? That’s important to know, because there are 3- and 4-port **shower** **valve**s. A three-port **valve** will have one for hot, one for cold and one port up to the **shower** head. A four-port **valve** will additionally have a port down to the tub spout. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First there is the standard Moen cartridge model 1225. This is for the older style **shower** faucet that isn’t pressure balancing. If you have to pull the handle on your faucet to turn it on, this is the cartridge you need. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The plumber intends on providing the **valve**. Some plumbers have preferred **valve**s and will install one without even consulting you. (Of course the best plumbers will inform you, but let’s not assume anything.) If this is the case, and you are comfortable with that, confirm the brand and **valve** name so you can get the compatible trim (which I’ll discuss later), same as in the previous instance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At this point, your best bet is to carry the cartridge to the hardware store to get help with **shower** cartridge identification. Plumbing shops and home improvement centers usually have books that the clerks use to identify faucets. And many employees will have a working knowledge of brands. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The site search function is fairly robust. It does well on product searches. A search for "Cassidy sink faucets" turned up all of the sink faucets in the Cassidy collection, but the term "sink' was crucial. Otherwise, everything in the Cassidy collection is displayed: faucets, **shower**s and **shower** components, tub fillers, tub spouts, and bathroom accessories such as towel racks, robe hooks, and toilet paper holders – 257 products in all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you see no brand name anywhere, you'll need to remove the **shower** cartridge. Before you take it out, remember to turn off water to the **shower**. If you don't know how to shut off the water **valve**s to the **shower**, just close the water **valve** to your entire house. This is often located behind the hot water heater, but you can also use a curb key and shut it down in front of the house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   PPI (Xiamen) Industry Co., Ltd. is a Chinese manufacturer of faucets and **shower**s. It manufactures its own PPI line of faucets sold in Asia and the Mid-East. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is an important question to ask before spending too long exploring the different types of **shower** **valve**s. Make sure you even need to provide a **shower** **valve** for your project. Two instances come to mind where you normally wouldn’t have to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After his discharge in 1945, he applied for a patent on his "mixing **valve**." It was awarded in 1952 (U. S. patent 2592062).[3] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Delta also continues to use a version of the washerless **valve** for two-handle faucets in its Classics collection. These are easy to identify. Any cartridge that rests on a rubber seal and spring such as the RP25513 or RP1740 is a washerless **valve**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now there is variance in stems (cartridges), **valve**s, and splines. Because of this, you will need to know how to identify the brand of your faucet before you can fix it. Knowing what you're working with makes it easier to disassemble and fix. You can begin this process by: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So how do thermostatic **shower** **valve**s work? Unlike a pressure balancing **valve** that uses a spool to control pressure changes, thermostatic **shower** **valve**s use...well...a thermostat that regulates the temperature. This is a much more precise way to control the water temperature. You can literally control the temperature down to a degree, while with pressure balancing **valve**s you’ll be sticking your hand in and out of the **shower** to find the “right” temperature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Delta **shower** faucets are also one of the best value faucets you can buy. They are designed simply and the parts are easily found. They have more models from which to choose, however. So cartridge identification can be a little tricky. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brands like Pfister don't sell parts in local hardware stores; do check Amazon, however, as many parts can be found here and delivery time is as fast as 1–3 days. Take note of which parts are interchangeable: Keep in mind that some rubber seats, O-rings, and springs may not be interchangeable. They can look similar between brands, but they may not be the same. Delta **valve** seats, for example, look very similar to Pfister's design, but the diameters are different which will definitely result in leaks and other problems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many models of Moen **shower** faucets. But the most common takes the standard Moen 1225 cartridge, 1200 cartridge and the pressure balancing Moen 1222 cartridge. If your faucet is the older style that you pull out the handle to turn on the water flow, 1225 or 1200 cartridge style, you may need to exert a lot of force to get the cartridge out. Hard water deposits can create a lot of friction inside a **shower** faucet. If it’s the Positemp **valve** style that turns on only, it will be the 1222 cartridge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After refining the design to make it more easily manufactured, he licensed the **valve** from Landis and founded Del­ta Fau­cet to make single-handle faucets using the new **valve**. At first, the company made only kitchen faucets. It added bath fau­cets in 1960. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   is a manufacturer of fau­cets, **shower**s, plumbing fittings, and bathroom accessories founded in 1990. It is an manufacturer. Its primary business is the design and manufacture of bath and kitchen plumbing products for other companies. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In its last known "Buy American Act" catalog in 2011, Delta claimed to manufacture 100% of its faucets equipped with Dia­mond Seal Tech­nol­ogy **valve**s in the U.S. That statement is no longer true. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Simply put, you cannot use any old **shower** trim with any type of **shower** **valve**. The trim is the decorative escutcheon plate and handle that you see and touch, which controls the **valve** inside the wall. Like a car, where you wouldn't use Mercedes-Benz parts on a Toyota, the same applies to **shower** **valve**s and trims. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
