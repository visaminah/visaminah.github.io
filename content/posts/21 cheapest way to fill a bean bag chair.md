## 21 Tips to Cheapest Way To Fill A Bean Bag Chair | Natural Bean Bag Filling
-   For starters, the positive customer feedback got us interested in the product. Made from virgin polystyrene, these pea-shaped pellets have an approximate diameter of 3/16 inches, which is the perfect bean **bag** filling size. And it’s due to their small size that they become sufficiently dense when stuffed inside a bean **bag**. However, you can always adjust the quantity in the bean **bag** according to your comfort and filling preferences. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Compressed foam or memory foam has gained recent preference for bean **bag** **chair** refills. It’s a specific kind of polystyrene that undergoes special processing to increase the density and viscosity of the beads. Because they can be compressed to about one-quarter of their resting shape, packaging and transportation become relatively easy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To create a minimal mess, it’s recommended to stuff the bean **bag** **chair** with the whole pellet **bag** and zip it up, leaving a small gap. Once the **chair** is filled, rip the plastic and take it out. Alternatively, you can also leave the plastic on when you fill bean **bag**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Up next on the list is the Posh Bean**bag**s Bean Bag Refill. Another one of our affordable favorites, this 100 L **bag** is also available in various other weight variants at pocket-friendly prices. Be it for a new bean **bag** or refilling an existing one, this filling can do it all! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike the Big Joe Bean Bags Refill pack, the packaging for this one doesn’t have any cut-markings, but it shouldn’t be too difficult to stuff the beads into the bean **bag**. For this, we’d recommend putting a tight ring (made of cardboard or plastic) around the opening. This will prevent the beads from falling everywhere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To begin with, the grade A poly beans deserve all the praise for being both durable and fluffy. These qualities make the pellets very suitable for enduring the wear and tear of regular use by adults, kids, and teenagers on bean **bag**s. On that note, the 100 liters pack should be good to stuff a couple of average-sized bean **bag** **chair**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Be it an office or a lounge or a home, these **chair**s are used extensively across places. So, it comes as no surprise that the beans flatten over time and require regular replacement. Or, you may add some filling for extra bounce and comfort. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best way to get the most out of a bean **bag** is to fill it up to 1/3rd of its total capacity. Remember that it’s easier to refill rather than empty a bean **bag** because all you need to do is unzip it and pour the beans through a funnel. Then, zip the **bag** tightly and place the inner **bag** inside the bean **bag** cover for safekeeping. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Gold Medal Bean Bag Refill is made from high-quality polystyrene to ensure optimum comfort for users of all ages. This bean **bag** filling comes in simple packaging and is available in many sizes to fit varied needs. Plus, getting one won’t make you break the bank. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   EPS or expanded polystyrene is the most commonly used refill for bean **bag** **chair**s. These beads are mostly preferred for their lightweight and rigid structure, which in turn, helps them hold up shape even after prolonged use. Additionally, they resist heat and moisture better than some other materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s then when you head out to buy a bean **bag** refill. And with similar-looking bean **bag** types, getting confused is only natural. However, for our DIYer friends, making bean **bag**s is simple and easier for you to choose the filler along with the **bag**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Depending on the type of filling and design of the **bag**, using a bean **bag** may help manage tension in the lower back to reduce back pain. Bean **bag**s can improve your posture while supporting the joints and muscles to realign the spine. Moreover, thanks to the adjustable nature of the fillings, bean **bag**s can conform to your shape, height, and size to deliver maximum comfort irrespective of your sitting posture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We start things off with the Big Joe Research Megahh Bean Bags Refill. These polystyrene beads come in a 100 liters **bag**, which is enough to refill one bean **bag** or pool float. What’s more, this bean **bag** filling won’t burn a hole in your pocket. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Xtreme Comforts are known for their quality bedding and related accessories, and this product is no exception. Not only for bean **bag** **chair**s, but this shredded memory foam filling can also be used for couches, cushions, pet beds, mattresses, stuffed toys, and a lot more. So, count the brownie points. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Irrespective of the type of filling, most bean **bag**s go flat after some years of regular use, especially if the **bag** contains polystyrene beans. These beans are made of 98% air, thanks to the multiple air pockets present inside them that make them comfortable. This also means that the beads lose air with time, and to keep the **bag** from sagging, it would be best to change the beans after every 5 years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As we near the end of our list, it’s time to introduce shredded memory foam filler for bean **bag**s. This product from Xtreme Comforts is also suitable for a variety of couches and stuffed toys. If you’re looking for an effective alternative to beans, you may want to check out this filler alternative. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Moreover, the precise construction of the pallets ensures that the bean **bag** **chair** can take up the desired seat shape, irrespective of the quantity. If you like your **chair** to be extra squishy, add fewer beans than required. Likewise, add in more for extra firmness and support. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   More often than not, large bean **bag** **chair**s can take up to a day to inflate fully after they are filled. That’s why it would be best to prepare the bean **bag** accordingly and start inflating it a day before when you plan to give it to someone. After inflation, if you find that the **bag** feels heavy or too stiff, remove some of the stuffing so that it’s more comfortable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We also liked how the packaging has clearly written instructions for hassle-free refiling, which will come in handy, especially for first-time users. But if that’s still not enough, we’d recommend making a DIY fill tube for the purpose of filling your bean **bag**s. You can also rub a dryer sheet on both the bean **bag** and refill **bag** opening to get rid of unwanted static from the bean **bag**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To calculate the number of beans you need to refill a bean **bag**, simply divide the total volume of the **bag** by 50,000. The result will help you determine how many **bag**s of beads (weighing a kilogram each) you’ll need to ensure that the bean **bag** is comfortable and fluffy. Also, remember to round up the value, and in most cases, you’ll need 4 **bag**s of beans (300-400 liters). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, the foam fluffs up even before you start using it, which will give a fair idea about the required quantity. Simply empty the packet inside the bean **bag** **chair**, fluff the filler up with your hands and wait for 30 minutes. You can then adjust the quantity according to the desired stiffness or bounce. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
