## 5 Shocking Facts About 3 Foot Wood Fence Ideas | 3Ft Fence Ideas
-   Fences that are six feet tall should block most views from the ground level. “I’d advise not going any taller than you have to, both to save on expenses and to limit the shrinking, enclosing effect **fence**s can have on a space,” Lenhart says. If you do need extra height, he suggests adding 12 to 18 inches of lattice on the top of a **fence**, which will add privacy while minimizing the visual impact of a taller **fence**. If you opt for a natural privacy hedge, these can be much taller and often go up to 12 feet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your home should be the place where you feel the most relaxed, but without some privacy **fence** ideas it’s hard to truly unwind if you feel like you’ve got unwanted eyes peeking over your shoulder. “Privacy fencing, either along a property line or around a specific area in your garden, creates a sense of sanctuary, seclusion, and peacefulness,” says Janice Parker, a landscape architect based in Greenwich, Connecticut. “A garden should, at its best, connect us to nature, and this is simpler to do when you can relax in a peaceful setting. Hidden areas, made with privacy screening, create a sense of mystery, as you do not see all of the garden at once. Mystery makes a great garden!” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Privacy **fence**s cut the land into lots, which can be problematic for the bugs, insects, and other wildlife that live there. “As a rule of thumb, **fence**s should be at least two inches off the ground to let critters the freedom to move between properties,” Fargion explains. In general, he says privacy **fence**s make the most sense on small properties, like town house gardens. For larger yards, he suggests making use of natural greenery, like trees, to keep unwanted eyes from infiltrating your space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best privacy **fence** will depend on each homeowner’s goals for the **fence** and their yard. “By necessity, privacy **fence**s must obscure sight lines,” Lenhart says. For this reason, many privacy **fence**s are made from solid **wood** and designed to be completely opaque. If the goal is to have complete seclusion, something solid without any gaps would likely be the best choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are also **fence**s that are a little more open and offer breathability in a space. “Obviously, a privacy **fence** fails if you can clearly see through it, but there’s a gradient with which designers can play,” Lenhart notes. In these instances, he says the goal is to include gaps that are large enough to be visible, but small enough to prevent a clear view. “The homeowner’s style and priorities will dictate the particular **fence** design to use on a given project,” Lenhart explains. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
