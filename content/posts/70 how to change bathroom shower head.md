-   To remove the old **shower** **head** from the bathtub, start by unscrewing it from the pipe that extends from the wall.

It's important that you have the right size. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turn off **shower** taps. If **shower** continues to drip, a plumber may need to replace washer and O-rings in tap **head**. If there is no leakage, remove the old hose from wall elbow using multigrips. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Inspect the **shower****head** and pay attention to the water holes. Brush over the holes with an old toothbrush, or you can use a pin to remove limescale and scum. Once this is complete, reattach the fittings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In conclusion, adding a handheld **shower** **head** to your bathtub is a great way to increase the flexibility and functionality of your bathroom.

With a little bit of planning and some basic tools, you can add a handheld **shower** **head** to your bathtub easily and effectively. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’re almost done! If you can see that the leak is no longer an issue, it’s time to reattach the **shower****head**. As you’re doing this, be careful to not screw it on too tightly. This could break the **shower****head** and cause further problems. Once that’s done, you can turn your home’s water supply back on and enjoy a fully functioning **shower** again! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the **shower** **head** is clean and the O-ring has been checked, tape the attached threads to the stem of the pipe with Teflon tape.

-   Now that you know what to set aside for this task, let us talk about how to replace your old **shower** **head**.

In other cases, you may need to join the **shower** **head** to an extension arm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To fix the problem, remove your **shower** **head** from its **shower** arm, and wrap Teflon tape clockwise 2-3 times around the **shower** arm. Your **shower** **head** may come with a washer on the end. If it does, check to see if that is worn out and needs to be replaced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first step is to choose the right handheld **shower** **head** for your bathtub. There are many different types of handheld **shower** **head**s on the market, so it’s important to select one that will work well with your specific bathtub. If you’re not sure which type of handheld **shower** **head** to buy, consult with a salesperson at a home improvement store or look for online reviews. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wrap Teflon tape to the threads on the neck. You’ll need to fully wrap the threads about three or four times. Anything less than that might not make a sufficient seal, but anything more might make it too tight to screw the **shower** **head** on. Apply the tape in a clockwise motion to prevent the tape from becoming unraveled as you screw on the new **shower** **head**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a traditional single spray **shower** **head**, you might want to trade up to a more modern design for improved functionality. Detachable **shower** **head**s allow you to enjoy the spray of a regular **shower** and then detach the **shower** **head** to rinse hard-to-reach places. It’s especially useful to install these **shower** **head**s in homes with pets as it makes bath time much easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, you need to clean up the threads of the **shower** arm to ensure they will take the new **shower** **head** securely.

You could always use an old toothbrush to get in between the threads and clean out any built-up grime and rust to make it extra clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Adding an optional hand **shower** is another easy installation that will add versatility to your bathroom. A hand **shower** is especially, well, handy for bathing kids and pets. Hand **shower**s come in several types of mounts: they can be mounted on a sliding wall bar, directly to the **shower** arm or to the wall itself. Some hand **shower**s are stand-alone, and others are used in addition to a traditional **shower** **head**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The faucet on a combination tub and **shower** consists of a tub spout over the tub, a handle or handles and a **shower** **head**. The handles turn the water on and off, and water is dispensed from the tub spout or the **shower** **head** when the water is turned on. If your faucet looks worn and outdated, replace it with a new, modern faucet. Simply remove the old faucet in order to install a new faucet that suits your décor and personal style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With these steps, you should have your new **shower** **head** installed and ready to use. You may experience low water pressure if there are leaks or some other obstructions. To fix, follow the instructions in the last step. But if it’s still persistent, its time to call on recommended local plumbers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **shower** **head** was placed as high as it could go without running into problems with the low ceiling. The arm is long enough to extend over the bathtub edge, so water won't drip onto the tiled deck when the **shower** is first turned off. Over time, the coil will relax and hang straight down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **shower** **head**s usually have a handheld sprayer that connects to a flexible hose on a vertical bar mounted to the wall. Following manufacturer instructions, attach the **shower** **head** to the water supply and mount the bar to the wall. Shower panels or technology enable **shower** **head**s: These are the most complicated **shower** **head**s to install and may require a plumber to come out and install them for you if you are not confident with DIY, and the manufacturer instructions are too difficult to follow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To install a wall-mounted hand **shower**, select a spot to install the hand **shower**, taking the height of who will be using it into consideration.

Attach the wall bracket with screws, and slide the bracket cover over it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The O-ring, a circular rubber part of the fixture, is inside the **shower****head**. It attaches to the various threads when the **head** has been unscrewed. When this part of the **shower****head** breaks, it can cause leaks and may need to be replaced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A common part that wears away and needs to be replaced is the rubber washer (or O ring). You'll find one of these in the **shower** **head** and another behind the taps or lever that you use to turn on the **shower**. If you have a single lever, you'll have just one washer but if you have two taps then you'll have two washers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remove the wall fitting or wall elbow by hand. Pick off old plumber’s tape and clean thread on pipe protruding from wall. Undo screws holding rail brackets. If screws are rusted, drill out screw **head** with 2mm then 4mm drill bits, remove fitting, then remove old screws using vise grips. Pull out old plastic plugs, or cut them flush with or below tile surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Everything went back into place easily, and he moved on to the finished side of the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Using an adjustable wrench, turn the **head** counterclockwise to unscrew it from the **shower** arm completely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To fix this problem, replace your **shower** diverter. Before you do, also check to see if there’s anything in your faucet blocking the diverter or if the washer in your diverter is bent or broken. It could be that you only need to replace that part rather than the whole **shower** diverter valve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   : Relatively easy to install, handheld **shower** **head**s are simply connected to the end of the **shower** arm clockwise, then the **shower** hose is connected to the mount.
