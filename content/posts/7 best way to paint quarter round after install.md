## 7 Unexpected Facts About Best Way To Paint Quarter Round After Install | Best Way To Paint Trims
-   is the most common type of shoe molding, and you can buy inexpensive (**paint**able) pine shoe molding for $5 to $6 per eight-foot section. Hardwood shoe molding, including oak, ash, and walnut, which can be stained to match your trim, runs $6 to $10 per eight-foot section. Medium-density fiberboard (MDF) shoe molding is made from a combination of resin and sawdust, and it is similar in price to pine, at $5 to $6 per eight-foot section. MDF is even more flexible than wood, so it’s a good choice if you have a lot of uneven gaps under your baseboard, but while suitable for **paint**ing, it doesn’t stain well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since it's easier to rout the edge of wide board than a narrow one, a good strategy is to rout one edge of the stock board and then rip off one length of **quarter** round on the table saw. The board should be secured to the work area with at least two C-clamps while you're routing, and you should always move the routing bit so its leading edge bites into the wood. You can lose control if you move it the other way. Set the table saw fence exactly 3/4 inches from the near side of the blade when ripping to get perfectly formed **quarter** round. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   shoe molding is made from a combination of resin and sawdust, and it is similar in price to pine, at $5 to $6 per eight-foot section. MDF is even more flexible than wood, so it’s a good choice if you have a lot of uneven gaps under your baseboard, but while suitable for **paint**ing, it doesn’t stain well. Polystyrene shoe molding is the least expensive option, running $2 to $3 per eight-foot section, and it’s meant to be **paint**ed.

-   As I said, there’s no hard and fast rule for this. Some people prefer **paint**ed **quarter** round even on hardwoods. Lay some sample pieces in your own room before making a decision. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paired with baseboard and stained or **paint**ed to match your trim, shoe molding (also known as “base shoe”) is a small, thin strip of molding that gives your room a finished look. Shoe molding adds a decorative touch while covering any gaps that might lie between the bottom of baseboard and the floor. Not all types of baseboard are suitable for installing shoe molding, however, so keep reading to find out if this slim trim is right for you—plus how to install it flawlessly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’ve been looking at baseboard finishing trim, you’ve probably discovered **quarter**-round, too. As the name implies, this type of molding is one-**quarter** of a round dowel (split a dowel down the middle, then further split the halves, and you’ll have **quarter**-round). While **quarter**-round can be installed along the bottom of baseboard, trim carpenters and homeowners tend to prefer the sleeker look of shoe molding, which is taller and narrower than its curved counterpart. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Most folks know that hardwood flooring companies generate a lot of profit from trim pieces. If you want to avoid paying the high price for matching trim, but still want a clean, finished look, consider buying unfinished trim pieces at your local big box and staining the to match your prefinished floor. This will save you 50-75% off buying matching trim, and you likely won’t be able to tell the difference (especially if your hardwoods are oak or pine, which are readily available in unfinished trim at home improvement stores). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
