## 4 Shocking Facts About Does A Stamped Concrete Patio Increase Home Value | does a stamped concrete patio increase home value
-   A **stamped** concrete **patio** is an excellent addition to your home’s exterior. It can be decorated with patterns, images, and colors that can match the architecture or interior of your home. Stamped concrete is easier to clean than natural stone because it doesn’t absorb water as stone does. The only disadvantage to **stamped** concrete is its cost compared to regular concrete—it’s more expensive to install than typical paving stones or bricks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The pros of **stamped** concrete include its durability and long-lasting nature. While unsealed concrete will eventually wear down over time due to weather exposure, **stamped** concrete will maintain its initial appearance even after years of use. Stamped concrete also provides added traction compared with unsealed concrete, which makes it less slippery when wet or snowy conditions prevail outside your home during winter months (or any time of year). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The surface of unsealed concrete is more likely to be slippery in wet conditions than sealed concrete. The reason for this is simple: sealants make the surface more slippery, and they can be removed from **stamped** concrete if you don’t like your design or color choice. Sealants can also be used to help make the surface less slippery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Stamped concrete **patio**s can be decorated with engraving. Engraving is a process that involves tracing a design onto the **patio** and then carving out the pattern using a hammer and chisel to create grooves in the surface that will hold dirt or stones for your garden bed. You can also use engraving to make a decorative border around your **patio** by tracing patterns around it on its edges. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
