-   Troweled **plaster** finishes and rough wall **texture**s are making a comeback. They can be left in their raw state or painted to feature subtle differences in hue. I love layered **plaster** walls because they feel like you’re stepping into the vestibule of an art gallery, or ducking into a neighborhood cafe in Europe. There are different types of **plaster** one can work with: clay, lime, and gypsum. For a a more detailed explanation on the differences, see this article at Remodelista. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Old House has a technique for mimicking the look of rough **plaster** by using paint and cardboard. I’d be inclined to mix in some flour to get a more matte raised **texture** look like I did with these earthenware look vases. If you give it a try, let me know how it goes! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With this treatment, the wall itself becomes the art. There isn’t much need to cover it with anything more than light fixtures, small shelves, or petite paintings.

Anything that mimics the imperfection of **plaster** walls that have aged over time, whether real or faux, can look good in the proper space. It’s really about creating a mood: urban loft, café chic, or old world ambiance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
