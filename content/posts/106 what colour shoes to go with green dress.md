-   When it comes to choosing the right **shoes** to wear with a **green** dress, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, consider the color of the **shoes**. Yellow **shoes** can be a great choice, as they will add a pop of color and contrast nicely with the **green** dress. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, let’s talk about your safest options: black, brown, and white. These colors go with just about any outfit, so they don’t come with much of a risk. Plus, since they’ll pair with more than just your **green** clothes, you can get a lot of use out of them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Floral tops are a must-have piece for summer, and you can get some versatile looks by pairing this piece with **green** pants. A **green** bell-bottom with a floral print top is an easy ensemble to create a casual yet elegant appeal in the summer season. A crossbody bag and wedge heels look perfect with this outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black jeans and brown **shoes** is a minefield of differing opinion and one not worth marching into if you’ve any personal doubts. But if you’re confident, then it’s a look that can work, so long as you stick to **shoes** in a shade that’s nearer black than tan. Although again, boots are easier to pull off, here, particularly Chelseas, which give you the air of someone who’s just left One Direction to find a direction of their own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If it’s true that a man’s outfit is assessed from his **shoes** up, then it’s their shade that first colours someone’s judgement. Footwear, like everything else in menswear, has grown less rigid recently these days you can wear Oxfords with jeans and trainers with a suit. But the key to pulling either off is in colour-matching; get the shade wrong, and you can look like a car salesman on a night out or like you’ve changed into your comfy **shoes** for your commute. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Black men’s **shoes** are the smartest so it’s quite obvious that you should be wearing them with formal outfits. Black or darker shades of grey or blue suits and slacks are all good choices for black **shoes**, especially black oxfords. Most of the time you’ll find yourself wearing them in formal settings: offices with strict dress codes, funerals, weddings or other events. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to lean in the more natural feel of **green**, a floral pattern is always an option for you. Outfits with this pattern are great for either a carefree outdoorsy look or for a more elegant and regal feel. This will solely depend on the design and color of your pattern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   1 Go Neutral Emerald is a hit in all seasons, but fall collections often pair it with black. Rock an emerald-**green** wrap dress with black pumps or knee-high boots for a cool-weather look; add black tights for extra warmth. When the temp calls for baring your legs, slip on an emerald sundress and wedge or flat sandals in nude, tan or beige. Browns also work well with **green** -- opt for a rich espresso or cognac shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a few key things to keep in mind when choosing **shoes** to wear with your dress. First, consider the color of your dress. If you’re wearing a light-colored dress, opt for **shoes** in a similar hue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you’re wearing a **green** dress or **green** pants, white **shoes** are a great option. But if you can’t find the right shade of white, consider off-white or cream to get the same effect. Sometimes, bright white can create too much of a contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just make sure that you’re up for some maintenance. You’ll have to clean your white **shoes** more often than you’d have to clean black or brown **shoes**. When it comes to white **shoes**, your best bet is to stick to indoor events. If you’re going to be outside, opt for something darker. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It doesn’t matter what colour your **shoes** are if they’re scuffed. Find a polish that matches, or a neutral polish if you’ve gone for something wilder, and keep them in good nick. They’ll last longer, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Plaid shirts are an excellent partner for your **green** pants and make you ready for anything casual. White, blue, or black plaid shirts are cool combinations for your **green** pant.
