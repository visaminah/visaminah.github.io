In other words, if you like being different, you won’t go wrong with this shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As it turns out, copper and magenta can be a good team! Obviously, the secret of making these **colors** match lies in ombre. Let the deeper shade sit on the roots and apply the bright one to the ends. It will not only help you to create a harmonic look but will also save your hair from damage. Since brighter **colors** require bleaching, it’s better to apply them to the ends, as it’s harder to restore damaged roots. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Celebrity hairstylist Chuck Amos— who works with Tracee Ellis Ross, Alicia Keys, Erykah Badu, Solange, and Lion Babe—suggests opting for tinted shampoo or conditioners for colo**red** hair . “This way, you can enhance your color during the wash process,” he explains. “Even if you're born with **red** tones, you usually need color boost on a regular basis. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Colors are divided into blue-based and yellow-based hues, meaning they have cool or warm undertones. Skintones can also be cool or warm. Natural **red**heads usually have a warm undertone to their skin. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Auburn is the so much desi**red** middle ground between **red** and brunette hair **colors**. Also, it’s a fantastic option for women who’d like to add a hint of **red**dish warmth to their brown locks without stepping out of their natural **colors**. Coat your brown shade, whatever it is, with a burning fiery auburn to bring out your hazel or green eyes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I've got pasty white skin, arms full of freckles and bright orange hair. I don't really know what I should look for this spring and could use some help. I usually avoid bright **red**s and oranges because they tend to be too much. I know what to avoid but not what to look for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While most peachy color ideas feature something soft and subtle, you can move in the opposite direction and show another side of the popular idea. Such contrastive looks can’t do without **red** ombre, which, in its turn, should form a seamless blend with your roots. The best thing is, a dramatic shade like this will suit any complexion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If a colorist thinks like an artist and takes the hair as a canvas for masterpieces, the color session results in not hair **colors**, but pieces of art. And this amber glaze is a perfect example of such color jobs! The way the amber is applied does look like a glaze: it covers the brunette base softly, yet saucily, providing tons of natural shine and dimension to the hair. What makes this idea so special is the color placement: it’s applied strategically to leave the charm of natural locks present. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   42. Orange Red Hair. Perfect **red** hair idea for bold and daring women. Keep other girls wow-ing in awe with this stupendous **red** hair. Definitely not for the color-shy ladies and those who prefer subtle hair shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ever wonde**red** what would happen if copper and deep **red** **colors** were mixed? Well, here’s the answer that goes beyond any expectations. The color is bright, yet deep, and **red**, yet with brownish hints. If you have a closer look at the idea, you will see that the coppery portion works for the glossy finish, and the **red** color builds balance with the brown base. Together, these shades give birth to the classiest **red** hair color that suits all complexions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Copper highlights can be added to darker **red** shades to add realistic dimension and make **red** hair color look brighter and more energized. Ask your stylist to try balayage highlights for a modern, natural effect. Add copper highlights to **red** hair color if your skin is fair or golden, and if you have green, brown or hazel eyes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While the deepest version of copper gives a more brunette finish, its lightest shade can bring you closer to the **red**-hair community. Light copper is meant for girls with pale or extremely light skin tones and light eye **colors** like green, blue, and pale hazel. That’s because it has a golden hue which regulates the temperature of the whole look and builds the perfect balance, making the light complexion less drastic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're contemplating whether you can pull off **red** hair, just go ahead and stop right there. You heard it here first: It doesn't matter if you're the fairest of fair or melanin-rich — there's a fiery hue out there that will work for you. And one that will earn you oodles of compliments to boot. Still skeptical? Give us a chance to change your mind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The key to home hair dyeing is working with your skin tone, not against it. If you have pale skin, **red** hair can be a great natural look for you, giving you that ultra-fashionable Celtic goddess vibe. It's certainly easier to find a **red** if your skin is porcelain or pale pink. Even pale complexions vary though, with some featuring warm hues like pink and others cooler in tone with yellows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red is conside**red** by many to be a classic nail polish color. But like all **colors**, it can be divided into cool and warm shades. Warm **red**s are yellow-based and tend to lean to the orange side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   10. Picture-Perfect Reddish Brunette. The striking shades of auburn and burgundy highlights on this messy lob present a **red** hair color that is truly gorgeous. The chocolate lowlights set off and enhance the color. The dark base underneath helps to create a smashing dimension. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How about you to amaze everyone with the purest form of ombre? Yes, we’re talking about the good old dark-to-light combinations. Only this time, we’ll show you this idea in the **red** hair context. Those who have brunette hair **colors** can lighten up only the midshafts, while other bases will require total bleaching. An orange hue will be a breath of fresh air to your brunette base that will show off your bright self. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
