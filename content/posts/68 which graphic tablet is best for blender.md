## 68 Shocking Facts About Which Graphic Tablet Is Best For Blender | Best Tablet For 3D Modeling
-   Budget/price We’ve mentioned this already a few times of course, but it is simply a fact of life. Deciding which is the best animation **tablet** for you will of course in part be dictated by how much you’ve got to spend. This will vary for everyone of course, and while the more you spend, the more you’ll get, there are plenty of great cheap animation **tablet**s out there – we’ve included some in the guide above. The tech has really come a long way since Wacom dominated everything, and it's worth taking a look at our feature on the best Huion **tablet**s feature, for example, as these offer great value. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Intuos Pro comes in small, medium, and large sizes (each with a different size of active area). And give you the option to customize it by selecting the pro, paper, or regular bundle. In many ways, it reshaped the professional standards in creative graphics **tablet**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   is a KDE configuration module that allows remapping buttons and mapping a **tablet** to a monitor. It also supports **tablet**-specific profiles and hotplugging. It does not work on Wayland as it requires the wacom Xorg driver. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ► 5th) Another "Nice to have" extra: anti-glare coating. Yet another nice to have, some graphic **tablet**s with screen incorporate an anti-glare coating or glass that reduces reflections, especially when working outside on bright days. Manufacturers like XP-Pen are starting to add this feature to their drawing **tablet**s, so if you can get a **tablet** with this, it's a plus. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you talk about art **tablet**s, you know you'll be seeing big names such as Wacom, XP-Pen and Huion. However we have added our favourite picks from other big-name brands like Apple and Samsung if you're wanting a **tablet** you can use for both animation and more general use. We've also included some older **tablet**s that offer amazing value for money as long as you don't need the most up-to-date technology. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ► 3rd) Screen resolution and colour quality: Ideally you would get a Full HD or higher resolution screen. Not all drawing screens are though, and this is a factor in the cost of a drawing monitor. Drawing **tablet**s with lower resolution screens can be cheaper and still be good enough depending on user needs. It is also important for the screen to have good color quality or color gamut, this is measured in % of NTSC or % Adobe RGB. If you are on a tight budget, you can save some money buying a pen display **tablet** with a non-Full HD screen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some **tablet**s may be too recent to be supported by your current kernel. On Wacom devices, this is represented by a "Unknown device_type" message in your dmesg output. In this scenario, it is possible that the out-of-tree version of the drivers have support for your **tablet** before it is upstreamed to the kernel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This big-screen **tablet** monitor offers full HD capabilities with 4000 LPI resolution and a crisp 230 FPS tracking speed that makes for quite a dependable drawing interface. When you combine this with 2048 sensitivity levels of the stylus pen, you get pinpoint accuracy for every stroke. Besides, the screen has a 3000:1 contrast leading to a display many graphics **tablet**s aim for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best drawing **tablet**s and graphic **tablet**s on the market share one thing in common: pressure sensitivity. The higher the pressure sensitivity level, the more accurate and tactile the experience becomes. This allows for precise finger and stylus control, creating realistic effects like brushstrokes and ink flow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most graphics **tablet**s will work out of the box with Arch Linux. Additional configuration is required for certain extra features, such as button remapping and adjusting the **tablet**'s aspect ratio. This article explains how to configure your **tablet** under Xorg. For configuration under Wayland, see #Wayland and libinput. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ► 2nd) Choose whether you want your drawing **tablet** to be Wireless: this is one of the things that can make a noticeable difference in terms of comfort while using the graphics **tablet**. A wireless drawing **tablet** is always a good thing as it reduces the amount of cables over your desk and allows you to work more comfortably. Therefore our recommendation is to make Wireless functionality a priority when choosing a drawing **tablet**, if at all possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   some graphics **tablet**s don't have shortcut keys, so in that case you will keep using the keyboard to access the shortcuts for the software you are using. Using a wireless keyboard in conjunction with your drawing **tablet** will help you reduce the number of cables and keep a tidier, less cluttered desk. Protective case: especially if you are using a **tablet** computer (Windows, iOS) or an Android **tablet**, it is highly recommended to keep it safe from scratchs and bumps with a protective case. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This budget-friendly graphics **tablet** has a 15.6 inches display and shorter express keys on one side. The stylus is so lightweight that you feel like using a real brush. You can set up custom key bindings in order to map directly to its display and to map the two screens together. Doing so is very helpful for getting reference images on one monitor and paint on the other – all with a simple keybind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When xf86-input-wacom is not installed, or when you are using Wayland, graphics **tablet**s are handled by libinput. In this scenario, configuration through xsetwacom is not possible. You can only configure your **tablet** through the settings that are available in your desktop environment or Wayland compositor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ► 5th) Pressure sensitivity levels: All graphics **tablet**s have pressure sensitivity, although some have more levels than others. This determines how accurately does the **tablet** detect the pressure applied on the digital stylus while drawing. Bear in mind that pressure levels is not the only factor to determine the responsiveness, accuracy or smoothness while drawing on a graphics **tablet**. What matters is an overall smooth and natural response, no broken lines, no delay when drawing lines, etc. But in general more pressure levels should be a good indicator of the accuracy of the drawing **tablet**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   05. Wacom Intuos Pro (Large) A great Wacom **tablet** with a large drawing area Specifications Drawing area: 311 x 216 mm Screen resolution: n/a Pen pressure sensitivity: 8,192 levels Connections: USB 2.0, Bluetooth Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Jessops (opens in new tab) View at Laptops Direct (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Generous drawing area + 3D pen compatibility Reasons to avoid - Bluetooth can be laggy - Lightweight - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unlike physical mediums, drawing **tablet**s work along with software to create different effects—which means that you can switch from something like digital watercolours to digital calligraphy in an instant. You can draw, sketch, edit photos, and more with the natural comfort of holding a pen. Whether you're a beginner or pro, a graphics **tablet** can be your artistic conduit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Galaxy Tab S8 ultra is another top option if you'd prefer a general purpose **tablet** over a dedicated drawing **tablet** for animation. The Galaxy Tab S8 ultra is the largest of three welcome updates to Samsung's **tablet** range. It's bigger than the S8 and the S8+, and it comes complete with Samsung's brilliant S-Pen, which means that you get all the physical tools you're going to need for animation straight out of the box. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drawing areas of **tablet**s are generally more square than the usual widescreen display with a 16:9 aspect ratio, leading to a slight vertical compression of your input. To resolve such an aspect ratio mismatch you need to compromise by either reducing the drawing area height (called Force Proportions on Windows) or reducing the screen area width. The former wastes drawing area and the latter prevents you from reaching the right edge of your screen with your Stylus. It is probably still a compromise worth to be made because it prevents your strokes from being skewed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mapping custom commands to **tablet** buttons can be done through Xbindkeys or sxhkd. First, you may want to remap the button to a function key or mouse button that's not available on your hardware, such as F20 or mouse button 10. Then follow the configuration instructions for either program. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   : It prevents the touch-sensitive graphic **tablet** surface detecting the palm of your hand and disrupting the drawing flow. Screen protector: if you buy a drawing **tablet** with screen, it is a good idea to protect its screen from scratches with a protective film. Many pen display **tablet**s come with a screen protector included, but if yours doesn't, it is highly recommended to get one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Android offers plenty of animation apps, though we do wish the Android **tablet** experience wasn't STILL so poorly optimised. Google has been promising to look at this for years now – but so far has not appeared to do so. Still, the Android **tablet** does have one ace up its sleeve over Apple alternatives: a micro SD card slot for storing apps and media. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Krita only requires that Qt is able to use your **tablet** to function properly. If your **tablet** is not working in Krita, then make sure to check it is working in Qt first. The effect of **tablet** pressure can then be tweaked in the painttop configuration, for example by selecting opacity, then selecting pressure from the drop down and adjusting the curve to your preference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are ten programmable keys on the **tablet**, including two on the pen. Although its surface is prone to smudges but is slick and very easy to clean. The super-thin design makes it extremely portable. Like other Graphics **tablet**s on this list, it supports the Linux distro. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For folks who are old-fashioned and want a **tablet** that feels more like a drawing pad, XP Pen Artist 15.6 pro can be a great option. In terms of features and performance, it can be compared to Wacoms, but it comes at a much lower cost. It’s driver, though still in beta version, works like a charm. XP-Pen is the pioneer among others to offer company developed drivers for Linux. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   06. Huion HS610 The best cheap drawing **tablet** for on-the-go animating Specifications Drawing area: 254 x 158.8 mm Screen resolution: n/a Pen pressure sensitivity: 8,192 levels Connections: Micro USB (USB and USB-C adapters included) Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Great value + 16 customisable ExpressKeys Reasons to avoid - No iPhone compatibility - Requires external display - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wacom has made some savvy overtures to animators with its **tablet**s, including full compatibility with lots of useful animation software. This can mean a lot of time-saving quality-of-life improvements – we liked the ability to move characters' body parts rather than having to withdraw them. It makes up for one of the things the Cintiq 16 is lacking – built-in shortcut ExpressKeys, which can also be remedied with the purchase of a Wacom Express Key Remote (can generally be picked up for $99). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In our Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra review we found this **tablet** boasts one of the best displays in the business: an utterly gorgeous 14.6-inch Super AMOLED display, with vivid colours and deep, dark blacks. Design-wise, it's basically the same as the previous S7 Ultra, with more or less identical physical proportions. It's still comfortable to hold and draw on at the same time, if you like – and we loved the slim design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Usually it is recommended to rely on Xorg's auto-detection or to use a dynamic setup. However for an internal **tablet** device one might consider a static Xorg setup in case autodetection does not work. A static Xorg setup is usually not able to recognize your Wacom **tablet** when it is connected to a different USB port or even after unplugging and replugging it into the same port, and as such it should be considered as deprecated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3D scanning camera (on the top models of the range) Check Price See Our Review Wacom's MobileStudioPro is the reference **tablet** computer for graphic design, digital drawing/illustration and 3D creation. It is especially designed for drawing and digital illustration, graphic design, 3D modeling/sculpting, video editing and all creative applications in 2D and 3D. This is not just a plain **tablet**, it is a powerful computer optimized for digital creation, with enough power to run the most demanding design software such as Photoshop/Illustrator, Adobe Premiere or 3D modeling/sculpting programs like 3D Studio Max, ZBrush or SolidWorks. This is a **tablet** computer for drawing and designing at a professional level, for students or future professionals of 2D and 3D design. You can see the full review here, including a breakdown of all features and models of the range. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ► 4th) Choose whether you want multi-touch functionality: This means that you can zoom in and out with two fingers on the **tablet** surface, or you can pan and move around the canvas with multiple finger touch gestures on the **tablet** surface. This feature is usually only found in top of the range drawing **tablet**s. You will have to decide if you want your drawing **tablet** to have this feature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **tablet** offers precision control when sketching, painting, or drawing when bundled with the stylus Pen Pro 2. The anti-glare screen coating reduces parallax to create a pen-to-paper feel. This **tablet** includes an adjustable stand that allows you to adjust your work level. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   is XP-Pen's official, proprietary Linux driver. AUR is a cross-platform user space driver for several different **tablet** models. More information can be found on the project's website. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Need more than just a drawing **tablet**? Thanks to massive improvements in its stylus technology and display sensitivity, our testing judged that Apple's iPad is now a serious contender in the drawing **tablet** market, and the latest 12.9-inch iPad Pro is top of the range. Not only is it one of the best **tablet**s ever, it's also a serious tool for animators, whether you want to use as a stand-alone **tablet** or hook it up to your computer as a pen display. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Arch Linux kernels include drivers by the linux-wacom and DIGImend projects. linux-wacom supports Wacom devices, while DIGImend supports devices from other manufacturers. Both projects publish a list of supported devices: linux-wacom, DIGImend. After connecting your **tablet** via USB or Bluetooth, it should show up when running dmesg as root and be listed in /proc/bus/input/devices (and also on lsusb output for USB **tablet**s). If your **tablet** does not show up, or if certain features do not work, see #Device not recognized by the kernel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   should be kept disabled as I do not think GIMP supports such things. Alternatively, to use such features of your **tablet** you should map them to keyboard commands with a program such as Wacom ExpressKeys. You should also take note that the tool selected for the stylus is independent to that of the eraser. This can actually be quite handy, as you can have the eraser set to be used as any tool you like. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note: Because X uses buttons 4-7 as the four scrolling directions, **tablet** buttons 4 and higher are translated to mouse buttons 8 and higher by default. While xorg.conf uses the actual button numbers, xsetwacom uses the translated mouse button numbers. If you are going to remap your buttons through xorg.conf, the "button 8" example above would use Button4 . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are a 3D artist working in the field, you will want to check out the world’s first 3D Lightfield Tablet. This Lume pad brings your screen to life with an immediate, immersive, interactive 3D Lightfield experience. With this **tablet**, you create or convert 2D photos and video into 3D. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is another affordable option by Huion – an all-around great **tablet** with a comparatively large work area (8.7 x 5.4in). The pen pressure sensitivity of up to 8192 levels is on par with most higher-end graphics **tablet**s available today. Additionally, it comes with a 233 PPS report rate and 5080 LPI resolution, offering you much better quality images. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most popular **tablet** for designers in 2021 is the Wacom Cintiq 22, which has a price of about $1,200. This **tablet** features an HD screen and graphic monitor, 8,192 pressure levels, and Windows operating system. Weighing only 1.5 kilograms it is ideal for carrying with you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In general, a graphic **tablet** has a blank, solid surface that represents what you're seeing on your computer or laptop screen. Drawing **tablet**s and pen displays, on the other hand, show you what you're working on in real time. A drawing **tablet** with screen will have a digital display, which help by showing an artist exactly where they're working. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What kind of **tablet** do animators need? There are three kinds of **tablet**: graphics **tablet**s (connect to a PC or Mac), pen displays (drawing onto a screen) and computer displays (as the name says, a computer and display combined). All are good for animation, but go up in price the more tech is on offer. If you can afford it, a computer **tablet** is excellent – this can be an iPad Pro, Wacom Cintiq or Huion Kamvas Pro. The good medium ground is a pen display that uses a computer to power the software but enables you to draw onto a Full HD screen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hope this helps you find the best drawing **tablet** for your needs. If still have questions, we can help you out. Ask your question in the comments section further down and we will reply to you with personalized information. If you haven't done so yet, take this quick test (it's fun!) and you will discover the perfect Drawing Tablet for you, based on your budget and requirements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One reason why working with this model feels so natural is because, At 13.3 inches, the drawing surface is similar to a sheet of notebook paper. It supports HD (1920 x 1080) display with a wide viewing angle. The **tablet** itself is lightweight and compact, yet it is big, which limits its portability. What’s more, the package comes with a **tablet** stand that can be used in three different positions for your comfort - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Xorg treats the buttons on **tablet**s and pens as mouse buttons. Tablet buttons start at 1, pen buttons start at 2 (1 is the tip contact event). Since most applications do not allow mapping shortcuts to mouse buttons, users may be interested in remapping these buttons to keyboard buttons. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're wanting a broader amount of choice, we have a guide to the best drawing **tablet**s. It's pretty similar to this one, but could be of interest if you want to make an even more informed decision. If you're shopping for a young creative looking to make their own masterpieces, why not check out our dedicated list to the best drawing **tablet**s for kids? For now, let's take a look at the best **tablet** for any aspiring animator. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **tablet** works flawlessly. There’s virtually no lag with quick strokes, and the same can be said for jitter (no matter the speed). That means you can draw details as much as you like. The programmable buttons (2 on the pen) aren’t very trigger happy, so you don’t have to worry about accidentally pressing one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ► 6th) Battery-free digital stylus: Most graphic **tablet**s include a rechargeable digital stylus which means it has a small rechargeable battery inside, which you have to recharge through USB every so often. Some **tablet**s however include a battery-free digital stylus which means you don't have to care about running out of battery or recharging it. This is convenient as it is one less thing to worry about. In general this is a good feature to have, so if you can get a graphic **tablet** with a battery-free pen, even better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   if you buy a drawing **tablet** with screen, it is a good idea to protect its screen from scratches with a protective film. Many pen display **tablet**s come with a screen protector included, but if yours doesn't, it is highly recommended to get one. Wireless keyboards: some graphics **tablet**s don't have shortcut keys, so in that case you will keep using the keyboard to access the shortcuts for the software you are using. Using a wireless keyboard in conjunction with your drawing **tablet** will help you reduce the number of cables and keep a tidier, less cluttered desk. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ► 4th) "Nice to have" extras: 3-in-1 cables. Pen display **tablet**s generally use 3 cables: a HDMI cable for video, a USB cable for data, and a separate power supply cable. Some **tablet**s however include a convenient 3-in-1 cable that incorporates the 3 functions in one cable, reducing the amount of cables over your desk and helping you keep a much tidier workspace. If you can get a pen display **tablet** with a 3-in-1 cable, it's a nice to have extra. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Controls and shortcut keys When you're just starting out with a drawing **tablet** you might not feel that having a set of shortcut keys is that important. Trust us, though: once you find your feet and get into your flow, you'll regret not having enough customisable shortcut keys when you're continually having to pause to hit actual keyboard shortcuts. Shortcut keys can seriously speed up your workflow; some **tablet**s will have one or two, some will have as many as 16, and others will have none – though many of these will be **tablet**s like iPads, which offer other advantages. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Wacom Cintiq 16 gets its name from its 16-inch screen, which is a good size for most users. When we tested it, we found it's not the biggest, with Wacom **tablet** screens going as large as 32 inches, but most people probably don't need that much display real estate. The Wacom Pro Pen offers 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity, and if you're into 3D animation, you also get compatibility with the Wacom Pro Pen 3D. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This isn't as large as the Wacom Cintiq 16, coming in at 13-inches the Xencelabs fits neatly with an Apple MacBook or iPad Pro – demonstrating its mobile credentials. This is a graphics **tablet**, not a pen display or computer **tablet**, so you'll need a device to plug it into. The quality is excellent and the bundle of goodies really sets you up for work – the Quick Key remote is a particular life-saver. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The PD1560 is a **tablet** that shows GAOMON can really go toe to toe with popular brands like Wacom and XP-Pen. Though GAOMON doesn’t develop specific drivers for Linux systems, you can still run it on a Linux system using Wacom’s drivers. There are several other ways to make it work, too, but we won’t go into specifics. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ► 3rd) Choose whether you want tilt sensitivity: This means that you can change the thickness and texture of the brush stroke depending on the inclination of the digital stylus with respect to the drawing surface. This is useful to simulate traditional drawing techniques such as charcoal, real brushes, etc. This feature is usually only on the top range graphics **tablet**s such as the Intuos Pro, etc. Hence, decide beforehand if you are willing to pay more for a graphics **tablet** with this capability. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are thinking of buying your first drawing **tablet** or you want to know how to find out what is the best drawing **tablet** for you, it is highly recommended that you check out this quick guide about how to pick a graphics **tablet**. If you are in doubt, take this simple test and you will immediately know what graphic **tablet** is right for you. If you want personalized assistance, we can help you decide which model to get or answer any questions you have about graphics **tablet**s, just leave a comment in the comments section and we will reply to you as soon as we can. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our test found that the new M1 chip makes this **tablet** an absolute powerhouse, with ultra-fast performance that essentially puts this iPad on the level of a Macbook. The mini-LED powered XDR display is also best-in-class, with 1,600 nits of peak brightness, 1,000 nits of full-screen brightness, greater contrast and better control of local dimming. Drawing with the Apple Pencil also feels fantastic, with incredible sensitivity and that unmistakable Apple design that makes it comfortable to use in the hand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a non-Wacom **tablet** that has missing features, you can report a **tablet** test to DIGImend drivers authors in order to include its functionalities into the driver. The DIGImend diagnostic tools are available on the AUR as AUR . You will also need the lsusb and usbhid-dump programs available in . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Prepare the script for **tablet** configuration. When started from the systemd user service, the needed variables DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY should already be set. See systemd/User#DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY for details. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Works with Surface Pen digital stylus with 4096 pressure sensitivity levels Check Price See Our Review The Surface Pro 6 is the reference Windows **tablet** computer for graphic design, animation and 3D design, only surpassed by the number one in this list (further down). In particular, the screen of the Microsoft Surface Pro 6 is a spectacular display, with better than Full HD resolution and an impressive colour quality that has been featured in some technical articles as one of the best screens found in **tablet**s. The latest version of the Surface Pen (sold separately) has 4096 pressure levels, but it gives a pretty good drawing precision and good responsiveness when drawing on screen. The Microsoft Surface Pro 6 is a full **tablet** computer, reliable and versatile, which you can use not only for designing with Photoshop, Illustrator or 3D modeling software, but also for any other general use software. Here you can check the price of this impressive device. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sway allows you to map inputs to specific displays, including drawing **tablet**s. This will set the aspect ratio of the drawing **tablet** to the aspect ratio of the display. To do this, you will need your display's name and the **tablet** us identifier. To get a list of display names run: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Display vs graphics There are two main types of drawing **tablet**: display **tablet**s and graphics **tablet**s. Display **tablet**s have a built-in screen, while graphics **tablet**s are drawing surfaces that require an external display such as your computer's monitor. Display **tablet**s are the better choice for animation where possible, as having your drawing surface and your display in the same place makes for a smoother experience, and makes it easier to take advantage of the various animation software programs. However, they also tend to be more expensive than graphics **tablet**s – and if you already have invested in a high-quality monitor, a graphics **tablet** may be the more cost-effective choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The IPS LCD capacitive 10.8” touchscreen, 16M colours, a multiple-touch point supported screen is protected by high strength cover glass. For just under $1,000 this is a top **tablet** among 3D artists in the industry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, since this is an Apple product, you already know what the downside is. The iPad Pro 12.9-inch M1 is a very, very expensive **tablet**, and if you don't need its blistering, top-of-the-line performance, there are options on this list to suit smaller budgets. But if you can afford it, you won't regret it – our iPad Pro 12.9-inch (M1, 2021) review explains why. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To make sure, check the rules contained in the files executed after /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-wacom.conf for anything that looks like graphics **tablet**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are using libinput, graphic **tablet**s that have a stylus and a touchscreen might not support touch arbitration out of the box because the devices are not grouped into the same libinput device group. You can fix this by writing udev rules. For example, if the touchscreen is recognized with 0001:000a and the Wacom **tablet** with 0002:000b , you can create /etc/udev/rules.d/80-touch-arbitration.rules as a rule that groups these devices into the group f865e87b : - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
