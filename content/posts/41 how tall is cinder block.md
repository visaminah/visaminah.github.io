## 41 Things About How Tall Is Cinder Block | how tall is concrete block
-   Concrete block is a tough, long-lasting material. Because **cinder** blocks are not particularly rigid, many construction codes forbid their use. Concrete block is significantly more durable than **cinder** block. Cinder brick is commonly utilized in small areas such as garden walls or project barriers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It was built about 1942, and is a simple, two-story, rectangular **cinder** block building with a gabled roof. Wikipedia This example is from Wikipedia and may be reused under a CC BY-SA license. From - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   It is built of variegated brick over **cinder** block with a steel frame and a reinforced concrete foundation. Wikipedia This example is from Wikipedia and may be reused under a CC BY-SA license. From - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Consult a structural engineer to design the footing including where to ins**tall** the vertical reinforcement, which usually is placed every 24 inches. Normally a foundation wall with seven rows of blocks will be 24 inches wide and 12 inches deep and should have a footing 30 inches below grade.
