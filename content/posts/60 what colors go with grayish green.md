-   'Grey can be surprisingly versatile and will happily layer with many colours such as inky blues, smoky **green**s and rose pinks,' explains Patrick O’Donnell on behalf of Farrow & Ball. Giving Sulking Room Pink, Inchyra Blue and Green Smoke as examples. 'However, if you want to keep the palette more monochromatic, layer tones of grey like Ammonite with Mole’s Breath.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A super popular smoky **green** hue, Green Smoke by Farrow & Ball is one of my favorites on this list. An army **green** color, subdued by gray undertones, Green Smoke really makes a statement. This color pairs beautifully with off-white **colors** and mustard yellows, just to name a few. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before 2020 ended, Pantone announced the Colour of The Year. For 2021, they were actually two. One of them was Ultimate Grey. With so much focus on this colour, you can help but wonder what you can mix and match with it? What **colors** can you pair with grey clothes? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We may be biased, but Farrow & Ball’s Pigeon shade is our go-to grey-**green** paint color. This shade evokes cozy and soft feelings and finds its name after the color of the pigeon bird. It brings out the vibrancy of brass material and matches pewter and greys beautifully. If you’re looking to incorporate a touch of **green** into your home, this shade is for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I love that this **green** is very dark but not overwhelmingly **green**. It almost looks charcoal in certain lighting. It’s a great dark **green** wall color that can almost look neutral in the right lighting! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With its subtle mix of blue and **green** pigments, Blue Gray creates the most relaxed of rooms. It has the magical quality of gently shifting between blue and grey depending on the light and time of day. We opted for this shade at the #kennyreno to achieve the Scandinavian look the clients were after. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'One of my personal favorite color combos is gray and **green**. Specifically, look for cool, mid-tone grays with blue undertones and cooler **green** hues (pistachio, light olive, etc) as well. This combination adds naturalism and freshness to whatever space it is in,' says Kazimierski. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While we might not be able to identify or name all of them, there’s one thing we know. Grey is everywhere. And if you are thinking of dressing up, there are numerous shades of grey that you could choose from. Apart from that, you can pair it up with different **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **green** color has a lot of gray undertones to it, making it not feel too bright. It instantly makes a room feel cozier. It’s definitely on the **green**er side for bluish **green** paint **colors**, but there is blue to it that can be brought out using blue accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The key to a great match lies in coordinating the tones. Warm gray shades go well with other warm-toned **colors**, like taupe, blush pink, butter yellow, and burnt orange. On the other hand, you can pair cool gray with other chill tones like navy blue, sage **green**, and cool whites. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The color grey has come to represent different things. It’s an awesome color that compliments so many other **colors**. It’s no wonder that a lot of brands lean towards grey.

-   As a rule of thumb cooler-leaning **green**s and yellow-toned **green**s like lime, fern **green**s, jade **green**s and emerald **green**s work best with crisp true whites. You have more choice with more muted, dusky **green**s like sage and pistachio. They will usually work both with a bright white to add a freshness to these more muted tones or an off-white for a more warm, cocooning feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ’When introducing colour accents to lighter greys, think about the undertones of the pairing first and then the contrast you wish to achieve. Ammonite a soft stony grey will team beautifully with blues and **green**s such as Inchyra Blue or Hague Blue as both have the gentle undertones of nature, such as the delicate brown note found in Ammonite and the **green** in Inchyra Blue.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
