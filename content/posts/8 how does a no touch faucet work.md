## 8 Tips for How Does A No Touch Faucet Work | Touch Faucet Not Working
-   If you are having trouble with your **touch** **faucet**, bring in the Central Valley experts at All American Plumbing, Heating & Air. We’ll get your kitchen **faucet** working like new in no time. To schedule an appointment, call us at (209) 509-4448. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first sensor is attached to the handle which is made of brass. Since brass is conductive, the entire handle of the **faucet** is a **touch** sensor. The second capacitive sensor is connected to the spout. As the spout is also made of brass, the spout is also a **touch** sensor. However, depending on what is defined as the spout, there may be two exceptions: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just like a standard **faucet**, when you experience low water flow, the first place you should check is the aerator. This small metal disc inside the **faucet** adds air bubbles to the stream, which conserves water while giving you the feeling of high-pressure water. However, over time the aerator can get clogged with mineral deposits or other debris. Try removing the aerator, soaking it in vinegar, rinsing it, then reinstalling it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The solenoid valve works with the **touch** sensor to turn the **faucet** on and off. If the valve is worn down, it will not push or pull as effectively as it should, and may need to be reset or replaced. You can find the solenoid valve underneath the sink, attached to the battery pack. Replacing the solenoid involves some electrical knowledge. Since you’re dealing with electricity and water, it might want to let a professional handle this issue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are two capacitive **touch** sensors in **faucet**s with Touch 2 O® Technology. The first **touch** sensor is connected to the handle and the second sensor is connected to the spout. If a **touch** sensor is connected to anything conductive (wire, metal sheet, metal bar, etc.) that conductive element becomes an extension of the **touch** sensor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One difference between a **touch** **faucet** and a standard model is the inclusion of a battery pack. As you might guess, when the batteries start to die, the **faucet** isn’t going to work as well. Most **touch** **faucet**s will have LED lights that warn you of low battery. Refer to the **faucet** user manual for instructions on how to replace the batteries – the process should be fairly easy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Over the past few years, **touch**-sensitive **faucet**s have become more and more popular. These fixtures allow you to turn the water on and off simply by **touch**ing them – not by turning handles. This can be convenient when you’re cooking or cleaning, be more hygienic than putting your hands on handles (such as when you’re handling raw meat), and help you conserve water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A capacitive **touch** sensor is basically a sensing device that measures capacitance in its environment. When a **touch** sensor is connected to the **faucet**, it first establishes a baseline level of capacitance. Once this is established, it then looks for an increase in capacitance that occurs when a person **touch**es the **faucet** (the human body’s 22 pico farads). The sensor detects the increase in capacitance and either turns on water flow or turns off water flow. When the person releases the **faucet**, the decrease in capacitance is also detected. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
