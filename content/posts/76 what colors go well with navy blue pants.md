## 76 Tips to What Colors Go Well With Navy Blue Pants | How to Wear Blue & Gray – Color Combinations for Blues & Greys in Menswear
-   Red shirts can be worn with **blue** pants and brown shoes in smart-casual settings. Dark red shirts (eg. burgundy and maroon) often work best when wearing dark **blue** pants such as those in navy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Depending on the shade of your **blue** suit, black dress socks can be a stark contrast against the trousers. The **blue** you choose is completely up to you; go for a lighter shade if you’d like something a little more casual, or perhaps a royal **blue** if you’re looking to really make a statement. Whatever you decide, coordinating black socks with **blue** dress pants is an almost fool-proof way to assemble a classy, stylish outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like all dark **colors**, navy **blue** is the perfect backdrop for making bright bold hues really pop. A sunny mustard yellow stands out so vividly against navy **blue** walls even just a splash of it becomes the focal point in a room. It's also a lovely shade for warming up a navy **blue** color scheme as this steely **blue** living room demonstrates – the dark walls and cool grey sofa need that accent of something warmer to make this space feel more inviting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you ask most people if they would wear navy **blue** and black together, they would say no. However, if you are Parisian, that’s a different story. Parisians in general stick to neutral tones like black, grey, brown, and navy **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The color wheel already tells us this is a combination that's meant to work. Complementary **colors** sit opposite each other so orange was made to pair with **blue**, the warmth balancing out the cool of the navy. And it doesn't have to be a dramatic high-contrasting scheme (although we do love how tangerines really zing against navy), a deep rusty orange looks beautiful against the moodier tones of a dark **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A. The light **blue** jeans emphasize the more casual look, so they are perfect if you are wearing them for outdoor activities and hang out with friends. The dark-colored jeans comparatively look semi-formal, so it’s better to wear them to an event where you don’t want to look formal or casual either. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dress to impress is the mantra every employee works toward while they are getting ready for their office. As first impressions are important, so is the idea of maintaining that charm every day. Here are some of the best **blue** pants matching shirt looks for every employee: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Though the Gentleman’s Gazette focuses on classic style, we’d be remiss not to mention the most popular article of casual clothing and probably the most popular **blue** fabric worn throughout the world–denim. We don’t specifically think of wearing gray with denim, but maybe we should take this page out of the classic menswear book and apply it to casual wear too. Blue jeans can easily be paired with a gray sports coat, provided the jeans are not overly distressed and the jacket casual enough, like something in an unstructured cotton or with sufficient texture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The same techniques mentioned above can be used when wearing sports coat and trouser combinations, though some men may be put off by the perceived difficulties of coordinating an additional article of clothing: pants in a different shade. If you begin with **blue** and gray, this is actually a piece of cake. Like the navy suit, the navy blazer is a staple, foundational item of menswear. Technically, a solid blazer has to be **blue**, so begin there and add gray pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A french tuck is when you tuck only half of your shirt usually just the front of it. This idea helps your look be stylish and professional too, especially if you have a long-length blouse on top. Another way of wearing it is by putting on a navy **blue** or black cardigan on top of the blouse as well as the pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This combination of a plain pink shirt and **blue** pants also looks great when it comes to smart formal wear for business meetups. The color which is not generally included in men’s fashion is actually a very good match when paired with **blue** pants. Both light and dark shades of pinks workout great making the wearer look charming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Patterned or creatively colored shirts do not work well with navy **blue** pants. Also, make it a hard and fast rule not to pair navy **blue** with black ever.This is because dark **colors** block out each other. Navy **blue** pants can also be teamed up with the right pair of shoes and accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although pairing a gray tie with a **blue** suit and vice versa is nearly foolproof, there are some ways for you to make the most of this combination. For one thing, avoid too strong a contrast between the two **colors**, which is the general rule for any color coordination. So, if your suit is dark gray, avoid a really pale **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A bright orange shirt can be worn with navy **blue** pants. The contrast between the two **colors** is striking and looks great on any man or woman. You can wear it with confidence as it will definitely make you stand out from the crowd. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both light and dark colored shirts can be matched with light **blue** pants. White, Navy, Black, Striped, etc. are some of the shirt options that you should tip toward to pair with your light **blue** pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you are donning dark **blue** or sky **blue** pants, the one constant that will be perfectly suitable is the plain white shirt. Bright and simple in outlook, white color shirts scream classy. So, if you want your colleagues to take you seriously in a business meeting, then use the magic of a white shirt and **blue** pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although **blue** and gray is usually a conservative combination, one of the boldest things you can do for your overall outfit is to wear these **colors** as footwear. Dark navy Oxfords are the best choice with a suit since they resemble a standard black business shoe with just a hint of added color, but they are difficult to find. Those with dandy impulses and in a less conservative environment could go with brighter **blue**s, such as a **blue** wholecut Oxford or monk strap, paired with a light gray suit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For some, a purple shirt may seem out of place, but wait till you try it with navy **blue** pants. A purple shirt and navy **blue** pants are a delightful combo to incorporate into your regular wardrobe. Finish with a pair of dark brown leather tassel loafers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes we are clueless and it is quite hard to make a decision. No worries, there are an immense number of ways to come up with a solution. You should always look closely on your skin tone and then head up to stylize the **colors** of your outfit . While being creative is important, you also need to determine the time of the day for instance during day time women can opt for light yellow shirts or peach hued ones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Beyond avoiding sharp contrast, try adding complexity and interest to your **blue** and gray combinations by introducing textures and patterns. Sure, you can start simply with a white shirt, solid tie, and a plain worsted wool suit, but this gets boring fast. An easy way to add a pattern while remaining classic is to use a gray glen check tie in silk (or wool for winter) with a navy suit. For a gray suit, get a navy grenadine tie in either a large or fine weave (garza grossa or garza fina) to inject texture. In the reverse scenario, pick up a silver grenadine for a **blue** suit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue on **blue** might sound bland, but going all over with a single color always has a surprisingly striking effect. Trying pairing navy **blue** furniture, whether that be a sofa or a headboard, with slightly lighter rich **blue** walls for a calming and cocooning look. Add some much-needed warmth with gold accents as can be seen here with the mirror and the lighting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The vintage style of wearing denim shirts is still going strong. They are a good part of the sky **blue** pant matching shirt collection that you must possess for the picnics and club events. Denim shirts bring out the body’s contour in perfect lines. So, pair this combination with a set of aviators and shine brightly amidst the crowd. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are 3 simple rules I like to stick with when thinking about wearing navy **blue** and black together. The main thing is don’t think too much about it, follow these 3 simple rules and this just might become a color combination you go to all the time. It’s definitely been a combination I have been wearing a lot of this Fall and will continue into winter as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bright colored socks are best suited for those looking to make a statement. Pair yellow, red, purple, or green socks with your **blue** dress pants and you’ll probably get some (positive) comments.

Try finding a matching pocket square or tie to pull together your whole look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A. Certainly, you can wear leather trucker jackets with **blue** jeans. This classic symbol of American heritage is really cool to wear. However, a denim trucker with jeans will look awkward, so avoid it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One common way of wearing your navy **blue** pants to work this year is with a matching blazer. Women everywhere enjoy buying matching color suit sets because it’s a quick and easy outfit idea. Also, it’s a fun way to still look professional at work and add some color to your work wardrobe. Navy **blue** pants and blazer sets can be fun, and you can find some with different prints. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The second suit a man should own when starting a business wardrobe is a gray one, but here the recommendations vary between a mid-gray and a charcoal. In either case, you simply take the opposite approach as your first suit and coordinate with a **blue** tie. The entire range of gray presents a neutral backdrop for any mid – to navy **blue** tie to work. And, the fact that both **blue** and gray are cool **colors** ensures they will pair naturally. Even if your gray suit contains warmer brown tones, you’ll have no issues because **blue** also combines perfectly with brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2.You may also go with a white polo and **blue** dress pants for a simple yet elegant appearance. Also, if you want to rapidly design your outfit with a pair of shoes, go with white low top sneakers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It also pairs well with the majority of your wardrobe. Read on to find out how to wear navy **blue** shirts and pants. These tips will help you create the perfect outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A. White baggy button-down shirts and oversize t-shirts look wonderful with thin **blue** jeans. You can even go with an ash gray V-neck sweatshirt with a thin white tee underneath for a catchier look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A. With light **blue** jeans, wear dark color tees, flannels, hoodies, and turtlenecks. And pair light **colors** upper wear with dark color jeans. Usually, light grey, white, and beige color look gorgeous with dark **blue** jeans so consider them if you have never tried them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Accessories, including gloves, hats, and scarves, are another great way to use these two **colors**, and, again, you have two broad options. If you have a gray coat on, you could go monochromatic and select elegant gray cashmere-lined peccary gloves to match tones. Alternatively, go with a contrast and choose a pair of bold petrol **blue** leather gloves in lamb nappa leather. With a scarf, you may be able to “kill two birds with one stone” by purchasing a double-sided version, like this dark **blue** and gray one in alpaca from Fort Belvedere, which lets you contrast or blend with a flip of the cloth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pants are a must-have in a man’s wardrobe since they come in a variety of **colors** and may be worn for a lot of events. However, if being different isn’t your thing and you’d prefer to stick to classic hues, you can wind up with only black or navy **blue** pants. So, if you want to wear navy **blue** pants and shirts and yet seem fashionable, you’ll need to know what shirt color works with them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Navy suits and **blue** dress pants are fixtures in men’s style. Ranging from light shades of baby **blue** to deep navy and available in a range of textures and patterns, odds are that you have several pairs of **blue** dress pants in your wardrobe. But what color socks should you wear with them? Whether you're wearing navy trousers or a full on **blue** suit, read on for tips on choosing the proper pair of socks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Women everywhere have been enjoying working from home because it’s comfortable and easier. Working from home has many benefits, one being that you can work and not worry about what to wear that day. For those who still are required to work in person, you find yourself having to pick out new outfits daily. Well, luckily with the right paint of navy **blue** pants you can come up with different looks to change it up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lilac and lavender have been gaining quite a bit of traction recently, with trend forecasters predicted it's likely to be the color of the year 2023. It's a very calming hue, that much like pink does need something darker to ground it and give it a less saccharine quality. Hence why it works so well with navy **blue**. It has the same cool undertones but adds a softness to the darker shade and you can find lilac shades that are so subtle, they almost just act like a neutral. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The opposite move–a gray sports coat with navy trousers–is rarer, maybe because it is generally more difficult to pull off a lighter jacket with darker pants. However, there’s no reason to be dissuaded, as long as your **blue** pants don’t look like the bottom half of a suit. Here, a pattern can be your friend and using a gray sports coat that contains a pattern, again the classic glen check or Prince of Wales, will enhance your chances of success. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, navy doesn’t have to be worn just with neutrals like black, white and taupe. It can go beautifully with so many **colors**. For major impact, try wearing with orange, red or yellow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In general, light colored dress pants and light colored dress shoes are more casual while darker pants and darker shoes are more formal. With this in mind, light shades of brown shoes with **blue** dress pants can be paired with more colorful socks for a sharp casual look. Alternatively, wear darker shades of brown shoes with **blue** dress pants for a more professional look. When choosing accompanying socks, opt for more reserved shades of grey, navy and black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This isn’t a color combination that is worn a lot in the states and I haven’t figured out why. I assume it’s just because for so long there’s been a “quiet” rule that you can’t wear these two **colors** in the same outfit. European designers have been using this color combination for years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Socks are also a terrific option to coordinate **blue** and gray. As a rule, begin with the principle of matching socks to your pants, not your shoes. You can show some panache by wearing socks that contain the complementary color to your pants (for example, **blue** socks with gray trousers ) or, better yet, socks that contain both **colors**, like a light **blue** and light gray shadow stripe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Navy **blue** and blush pink are the classic hues to choose for the most sophisticated, grown-up look. The shades just work so well to balance each other out. The muted warm rosy tones of blush pink counteract any of the cooler tones of the deep **blue** and the navy prevents the pink from looking too sweet and sickly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Navy **blue** pants are a wonderful wardrobe staple.The eye looks for something different. Since there isn’t a difference in tone or colour, the eye looks at the figure as one continuous shape and looks at you against the background, of the world, to find contrast. Girls can also use chunky necklaces to complete their look. Yellow shirts can also go with navy **blue** pants and give it a day time look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Smooth silky feel and a demure look, a satin shirt is the lethal combination of both these elements for partywear. But, when paired with **blue** bottoms? You are going to top the stage. Maroon, light **blue**, and black are some of the satin shirt **colors** that go with navy **blue** pants. So, get one of the satin shirts for your special date and impress them all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can either go with the classic white or black shirt and **blue** pants combination. Or you can spice it up with a satin shirt or floral print in the mix. It totally depends on the kind of vibe you are trying to give for the party. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'There are plenty of complementary color options to choose from when it comes to navy. To create a contrast, look at **colors** such as browns, reds and oranges. Orange sits just next to yellow on the color wheel and works particularly well with navy as the bright tones of the orange make the dark **blue** appear even deeper.' says the designer and head of creative at Swyft (opens in new tab), Kelly Collins. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Today, I’m trying to exemplify many of the concepts we discussed. Most of my outfit elements have **blue** and gray in them; the largest of these would be my **blue** jacket and gray trousers. The jacket is a bit lighter than a standard navy, probably in something more like a medium to even a royal **blue**. It’s plain in color to ground the trousers which have a bit more texture in their weave. As mentioned previously, my shirt features a micro check pattern in light **blue** and dark gray, perhaps even almost black, but everything is working harmoniously within the color pairing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both being jewel-like tones, navy **blue** and deep rich purples are a sumptuous combination that would be perfect if you want to create a cozy but sophisticated living room or bedroom. Experiment with a deep aubergine on the walls and combine it with a statement piece of navy **blue** velvet furniture for a pairing that's moody and dramatic but also so elegant and timeless. Add in some golden accents for extra glamour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These are one of the shirt types that every formal wardrobe must include. Your office look is incomplete without a variety of checked shirts. Plus, they go well with various colored pants, especially sky **blue** pants. Whether they are block-checked prints or intricate checked prints, you are liable to give off a good formal vibe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   White or gray t-shirt. Navy **blue** sweatshirt. Light pale color button-down shirt. Mandarin style jersey. And turtleneck with a sports coat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A unique variety of shirt options that most don’t possess, dotted printed shirts will help you stand out in the crowd. So, if you want to make a good impression, then pair a dark printed shirt with white dots for good measure. This will look wonderful as a dark **blue** pant matching shirt option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These are hues linked with ‘sweetness,’ and they are also appropriate for casual attire. Wearing two bright **colors** together, on the other hand, is best avoided since it may be highly overpowering. To make the entire suit seem appealing, males should stick to soft **colors** like pastel pink. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Printed silk ties with **blue** and gray geometric patterns or knit ties with both **colors** in them are likewise excellent options. I especially like the versatility of striped ties with either a repp pattern or large block stripes for this purpose. If you get a tie with stripes of both **colors** you can wear them easily with either gray or **blue** suits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue, Pink, and White are the **colors** that you have already been chasing for a long time. So, this time why not try something new and make your look a little appealing too.

Highlight your style with a new twist for the upcoming business meeting by making changes in your wardrobe with this trendy color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Navy **blue** is also a favorite choice among the stars.

She totally nailed the look styling the attire up with black sun shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As illustrated in the graphic above, **blue** dress pants can be worn with a diverse range of sock **colors**. For a more traditional look, try navy, black or grey dress socks with your **blue** pants. To add a splash of color, orange, light **blue** and red dress socks will all look fantastic with **blue** dress pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We couldn't not have a crisp white right up there as one of the best **colors** to pair with navy. It's the oldest, most tried combination and we will never tire of it. Classic, clean, and crisp it's a mix that lends itself to any room and any style, but it works particularly well in kitchens for a look that's bold and yet timeless. Consider opting for a two-tone look, mixing dark navy cabinets with a true white island. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most people don’t like wearing the same color shirt and bottoms, but when matched and tucked properly it can be pretty alluring.

With dusty **blue**s set to be big in 2022, bring in on-trend touches of pale **blue** to harmonize the room, creating a serene and tranquil living space where navy stands proud.’ explains interior designer Juliette Thomas (opens in new tab). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pastel **colors** are always a favorite in blouses, especially when going to work.

Also, because of their fun **colors**, you don’t have to do much with your outfit as the top will give your outfit the stylish look it needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The rule of thumb in menswear is to match your socks with your dress pants, although they don’t have to exactly match. Instead of focusing on finding the identical color of socks as your pants, opt for sock **colors** that complement your **blue** dress pants. This will break up any monotony in your outfit while still creating a smooth, tasteful transition down to your shoes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The style epitome of fashion in color, a plain black shirt combination with **blue** pants will give you a pristine look with sharp edges. It will help you create a mysterious and sensual aura that is likely to look good throughout the day and night.
