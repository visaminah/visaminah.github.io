## 9 Interesting Facts How To Clean High Ceiling Vents | 20 Foot Duster For High Ceilings
-   Some people like to combine the vacuum and the wipe methods for a comprehensive **clean**ing. Vacuuming gets rid of loose dust and wiping gets the rest. Be aware that vacuuming is not as effective on kitchen **vents** where grease might make dirt sticky. Use a degreaser or rubbing alcohol and wipe method for kitchen **vents**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Regular ducted heating **clean**ing is an important task in order to protect anyone inside your home from illnesses and foul odours. Sometimes dust and debris can also build up inside your ventilation system and block airflow, which stops the furnace, evaporator coil and blower from working properly. This can cause your unit to work harder and use more energy, making it cost more to operate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Prep a sink or bucket full of warm water with some mild detergent (dish detergent is fine). Give them a scrub down on both sides of the vent cover. If you’re **clean**ing a larger vent cover, you can use the bathtub or take it outside to use the hose. Let them dry thoroughly before replacing—particles moving through the **vents** will stick to the wet surfaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Luckily, getting them **clean** and keeping them **clean** is easy. Gather your **clean**ing supplies and set aside a few minutes per vent cover and you’ll be on your way. Here’s how to **clean** vent covers quickly and easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have had a little bit of success by using a bathroom **clean**er with bleach--I saturated a rag with it and pressed it against the ceiling. But still there is some of the dust left. The problem is I really can't rub hard because of the popcorn, and I have no idea what color white the ceiling is and I refuse to repaint all the ceilings in the house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another approach to **clean**ing vent covers is to vacuum them. This will get rid of dirt and dust buildup without the risk of spreading grime to walls and floors. It also decreases falling debris when you’re **clean**ing ceiling **vents**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At least once a year, you should give your vent covers a deep **clean**. Go ahead and vacuum them then remove them from the wall, floor, or ceiling. Ceiling **vents** will have screws that need to be removed but you can do this with a screwdriver. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wet your rag or sponge with the **clean**er, then simply wipe away dirt. If you’re **clean**ing a vent in the kitchen, the dirt might be a bit sticky. Use a degreaser or rubbing alcohol if that's the case. Climbing on a ladder and reaching over your head to **clean** ceiling **vents** can be dangerous so be sure to have someone nearby to steady you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I am trying to get finished **clean**ing a home I inherited to sell. On the popcorn (yuck!) ceiling near all of the A/C **vents**, there is some kind of caked on dust in the direction the air flows out of the vent. It is especially worse in the kitchen from all the years of cooking grease. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
