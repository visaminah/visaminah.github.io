## 43 Unexpected Facts About What Color Goes Good With Yellow Shorts | VIRGIN NEON YELLOW SHORTS
-   Green is made from a combination of **yellow** and blue, so it isn’t surprising that green is another option to pair with **yellow**, though the earthier versions of these colors look best together, and usually with green as the accent color. For example, a sport coat in the ochre or camel tone looks good with a forest green tie in winter. However, an olive green sport coat can be equally accessorized with an earthy **yellow** knit vest for autumn flair. Both colors are excellent choices for pants when paired with accessories of the other tone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What Shorts Go With A Yellow Shirt? With a **yellow** t-shirt and brown **shorts**, you’ll add serious style to your everyday casual look.

-   Yellow includes a range of colors with vivid names: buff, butter, gold, mustard, ochre, and even tan, which necessarily must contain some **yellow**. Depending on its tone, **yellow** can either be a strong accent or treated like a neutral, so it remains a possibility for multiple seasons and climate conditions. In the spring, a pastel **yellow** tie would pair well with sky blue, for example, while in hotter weather, a true **yellow** knit tie or mustard linen jacket might be chosen. In winter, rich **yellow**s that contain some brown are ideal, as in an ochre sportcoat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Keeping it in the family is a mantra you need to remember. The safest way to do this is by blending different shades of the same color.

-   What Colours Go With Yellow? A **yellow** top is the perfect outfit for a summer day. You can wear blue jeans, white or black bottoms.

-   The soft-short revolution. Perfect for the gal on the go, drawstring or pull-on **shorts** are easy-peasy and so, so cute. We like a **yellow** plaid print with a white tee and canvas sneaks.

-   Yellow is an excellent way to brighten up gray, which is a prominent color in menswear. For those who find gray to be a bit drab, **yellow** accessories can lighten up otherwise very gray outfits. A lighter to mid-gray suit and pastel **yellow** pairing seem to work best. Alternatively, a warm **yellow** sportcoat and gray trousers are even more unique and sophisticated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What Colours Go With Pale Yellow Clothes? The best way to style **yellow** is with neutrals.

-   Again, blue is the way to go with **yellow** chinos, in the form of a shirt and/or sports coat. A blue jacket will subdue the **yellow** of the trousers more than a shirt alone. My personal preference, if wearing **yellow** trousers, is to choose a pastel rather than a hotter **yellow**, something closer to the color of lemonade than the lemon itself. Remember that, as a rule, pastels or lighter **yellow**s go with lighter blues while hot **yellow**s require richer blues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the other hand, in cold weather, browner **yellow**s like ochre and camel are the best choice and are quite restrained. Because the **yellow** tones are already muted, they act like neutrals.

Whatever it’s called, the color is useful as an example from the **yellow** family that isn’t too overwhelming and that can be matched with trousers and ties of various colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What Goes Good With Tan Shorts? Whether you’re wearing khaki **shorts** or a colored top, they’re versatile. The beige tones of khakis do lend themselves to some colors that blend well with them.

-   At the Pitti Uomo winter show held each January in Florence, you are sure to see at least one Casentino wool overcoat in **yellow**. It’s a bold move that leans toward peacock style, but it is often said that what is would be outrageous in a suit or sportcoat can be acceptable in an overcoat, such as wide lapels, strong patterns, and brilliant colors.
