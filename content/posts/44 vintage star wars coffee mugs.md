## 44 Facts Vintage Star Wars Coffee Mugs | Star Wars Coffee Mug Starbucks
-   While it may not be as ostentatious as the Sculptured Boba Fett Helmet Mug featured earlier our list, it is far more practical for everyday use. This incredible **coffee** mug is made of high-quality ceramic and features a brilliant raised bas-relief design. We also love the scratched and dented look achieved by the incredible paint job. The great part about owning a Boba Fett mug such as this one is that even if you scratch or chip your mug, it will blend right in with the design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Its practicality not only makes it perfect for everyday use, but it is also a great gift idea for any grown-up Star Wars fans. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just like previous Tiki **mugs** featured on our list, the Boba Fett mug is equally functional. In fact, it has a decent capacity of 14 oz (397 ml) for your favorite beverage. Moreover, it is suitable for washing in the dishwasher, albeit in the top shelf. On top of that, it is also marked safe for microwave use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   If you thought we were done with cool and quirky **mugs**, then you are highly mistaken. In fact, we have yet another series of products which are as ostentatious as they are functional. More on that later. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, this is where its functionality ends, and just like the other steins/**mugs** featured earlier, this mug is not safe for microwave use, nor is it suitable for washing in the dishwasher. But, to be fair, most buyers will not purchase this product for regular use. Instead, this amazing BB-8 mug makes for a great collectible, and if you are buying it for that reason, then we highly recommend this product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While it may not be quite as large as some of the other **mugs** featured on this list, it still manages to offer a decent 12 oz (355 ml) capacity for your favorite beverage. And we believe some people might actually prefer that instead of a gargantuan mug. Moreover, this **coffee** mug is quite practical for everyday use. In fact, it is not only suitable for dishwasher use, but it is also microwave-safe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The BB-8 stein/mug is quite large. In fact, it has a rather substantial capacity of 32 oz (946 ml), which if you ask us is more than what the craziest of **coffee** drinkers can handle. Then again, this incredibly cute BB-8 mug is not just meant for your **coffee**, it is also a stein. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not everyone is a fan of flashy and ostentatious products, and if you are someone like that, then this **coffee** mug is surely going to pique your interest. If this mug seems familiar, that is because it is a variation of the “Freeze, You Rebel Scum!” Ceramic Coffee Mug we featured earlier. While the former had a black and white color combination, this one comes with a rather cool combination of red and black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you loved the previous product on our list, then you will surely need to check out this minimalistic **coffee** mug with an incredibly witty print. Just like the Star Wars “Who’s Your Daddy” Darth Vader **coffee** mug, this product is made from high-quality ceramic and finished with a premium black printing on the side. Moreover, it has the same capacity of 11 oz (325 ml), and we believe that should suffice for all but the craziest of **coffee** drinkers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although the **coffee** mug we have featured has a decent capacity of 12 oz (355 ml), it is also available in an incredible 20 oz (591 ml) form. In case you are planning on using this as your regular **coffee** mug, then we must admit that it is neither microwave-safe nor is it suitable for dishwasher use. Then again, we are quite confident that any Star Wars fan will be more than willing to make this sacrifice for this incredible Star Wars Heat Reactive Light Sabers Mug. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While the previous R2-D2 mug featured on our list was not an official Star Wars product, this one is. Moreover, it will be a great companion to the C-3PO **coffee** mug we reviewed earlier. Just like the C-3PO mug, this product is also made of high-quality, durable ceramic. It even features a highly detailed exterior paint job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are a big Star Wars fan but are not fond of ostentatious objects, then this incredible Star Wars Imperial Logo Mug will be right up your alley. How, you ask? Well, for starters, it features an incredibly cool matte black paint job which gives this **coffee** mug a stealth appearance. Moreover, the beautiful blood red emblem of the Galactic Empire and the subtle “Star Wars” outline text complement the stealth look very well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you loved our previous helmet **coffee** **mugs**, then you will surely be impressed with this product. Star Wars fans will be all too familiar with the legendary assassin, Boba Fett, and this incredible product is a perfect representation of the character in the form of a **coffee** mug. What is even more impressive than the concept is the incredible attention to detail. In fact, this mug’s brilliant paint job incorporates the dents and scratches of the original Boba Fett helmet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This incredible product is as practical as it is stylish. In fact, it comes with a rather sizeable capacity of 14 oz (397 ml), and we believe it should suffice for all but the craziest of **coffee** drinkers. Moreover, it is safe for microwave use and suitable for washing in the top-shelf of the dishwasher. However, if you plan on using it regularly and want it to stand the test of time, then we would advise you to wash it by hand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, hold on! We understand you are getting tired of these incredibly cool but highly impractical steins/**mugs**. But, we promise this is the last one. This amazing BB-8 Ceramic Stein/Mug is not only overflowing with cuteness, but it is also made of high-quality ceramic. Moreover, it is built perfectly to BB-8’s shape and finished with a premium paint job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If we have one gripe about this product, then that would be the paint job. Unlike the previous Boba Fett **coffee** **mugs**, we have featured, this one does not embrace the scratches and dents of the Mandalorian warrior’s armor. Then again, it is only a minor gripe, and we believe that most people purchasing it as a collectible item will love it regardless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you were looking for the ultimate C-3PO **coffee** mug, then this is where your search ends. This incredible sculptured stein/mug is shaped in the form of C-3PO. It is made of high-quality ceramic and is finished with a premium shiny gold paint. And that surely makes it one of the most ostentatious products featured on this list. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hence, if you are looking to buy this mug as a replacement for your regular **coffee** mug, then we would advise against it. There are many more functional products featured on our list, and those would make a much more logical choice for an everyday **coffee** mug. However, if you are looking to buy this as a collectible item, then we highly recommend this product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   When it comes to the functionality, this elegant **coffee** mug does a great job. While it may not be as large as some of the other **coffee** **mugs** featured on this list, it can still hold a decent 12 oz (355 ml). Moreover, it is marked safe for microwave use, and it is also suitable for washing in the dishwasher. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you loved the oval **coffee** **mugs** we featured earlier, then you surely need to check out this incredible The Force Awakens BB-8 Oval Ceramic Mug. Just like the Yoda oval mug and the Darth Vader oval mug, this product is constructed out of high-quality ceramic. Moreover, it features an incredible glossy orange paint job which is finished with a high-resolution print of BB-8. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Chewbacca’s facial expression looks quite menacing here, doesn’t it? Despite his angry expression, we believe that this mug will bring nothing but joy to those using it. Just like the other Tiki **mugs** we have featured, the Chewbacca Tiki Mug is no different when it comes to the construction. In fact, it is not only made of high-quality ceramic, but it also features a premium glossy paint job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While Darth Maul cannot win a battle of fame against Darth Vader, this incredible **coffee** mug can definitely hold its own against any Darth Vader mug when it comes to the cool factor. In fact, we love the matte black paint job and the incredibly cool molded face of the Sith warrior. We have to commend the Disney design department for doing a brilliant job in highlighting Darth Maul’s scary facial tattoos on this mug. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you loved the incredibly cute BB-8 Ceramic Sculpted Mug, then you will love this product inspired by the iconic R2-D2 character from Star Wars.

-   Just like the “Freeze, You Rebel Scum!” Ceramic Coffee Mug, this one is also capable of holding 12 oz (355 ml) of your favorite beverage. Moreover, due to its sturdy ceramic construction coupled with the high-quality paint job, this **coffee** mug is much more functional compared to the ostentatious products featured on our list. In fact, it is not only safe for microwave use, but it is also suitable for washing in the dishwasher. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, neither its design nor its functionality are the most impressive things about it. That honor would have to go to its current price, and at this value, we cannot recommend it enough.

In fact, it has a cavernous capacity of 20 oz (591 ml), which should suffice for even the craziest of **coffee** drinkers. Moreover, it is marked safe for microwave use. However, just like the previous Vandor products, we suggest not to wash it in the dishwasher. If you can do that, then this incredible **coffee** mug will easily stand the stern test of time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Continuing with the minimalistic theme is the Star Wars “Who’s Your Daddy” Darth Vader **coffee** mug. While it may not be as cool as some of the other Darth Vader products featured on this list, it was never meant for that kind of audience. In fact, this mug is understatedly cool, and we believe that is exactly what some people are looking for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The C-3PO mug is quite a unique product because of its tall and quirky design. This **coffee** mug is shaped like C-3PO’s torso, and we must say that Star Wars has done a fantastic job in designing this mug. We absolutely love the quality of the ceramic used for this product along with the intricate paint job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Needless to say, its whimsical and cheerful appearance does not aid its functionality. In fact, this Kylo Ren mug can only hold 10 oz (295 ml) of your drink. Moreover, it is neither suitable for washing in the dishwasher, nor is it microwave-safe. Then again, this product was never meant to serve as a replacement for your regular **coffee** mug, and if you are buying for that purpose, then we would advise against it. However, if you are planning on gifting this mug to a Star Wars fan or purchasing it as a collectible, then we highly recommend this product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Moreover, it can be washed in the dishwasher, and it is also marked safe for microwave use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While its design and heat reactive feature may break the cool scale, this **coffee** mug does sacrifice a fair bit when it comes to the functionality. Sure, it has an incredible capacity of 20 oz (591 ml) for your favorite beverage. But its bold design features mean that it is not safe for dishwasher use, nor is it microwave-safe. If that does not bother you, then you can go right ahead and purchase it without a second thought. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
