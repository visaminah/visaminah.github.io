## 27 Fun Facts What Color Wire Is Hot In China | Does wire color matter in electronics?
-   Answer: It could be the ground **wire** or any. Just focus on the power **wire**s and have trial and error on both data **wire**s. You can also check my other **wire**s colors in my articles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My most frequent issue is diminishing conductivity/connectivity at points of pin contact. Also weak or discontented **wire** contacts to pins. (Fragile poorly designed cables) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, if we’re talking about DC circuits and electronics, quite often you’ll find a red white and a black **wire**. (Often, but not always …) In the world of DC electronics, the accepted wiring convention is that the red **wire** carries the positive voltage, and the black is circuit ground. Usually the red is marked as + (plus) and the black is marked as – (minus). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1.I have a USB cable (I-phone 6) which has three **wire**s light Red,White & Green, other than this it also has a Non- insulated **wire** wrapped around these three **wire**s. Could you please let me know the order in which i need to join it with USB connector. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note that the wiring inside a webcam has four **wire**s unless it also has a microphone built in. If so, you can trace the **wire** to the mic. If you look, you'll notice that the Nokia USB pinout has the same code. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My **wire**s are bkack white. Second charger i spliced there was 2 white and 2 blue **wire**s. One blue **wire** has silver **wire** and the other 3 **wire**s are copper. What **wire**s do i use to charge my s5 as the charging port is broken. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The issue can arise when installing LEDs using an external power supply/driver, such as with LED strips (tape lights) and LED bars or even pendant lights. On the AC input to the power supply, you need to connect the hot/positive **wire** to the corresponding input of the power supply. But on the low voltage DC output side (12 – 24 V), the black **wire** means negative, and the red **wire** is hot/positive. If the power supply has terminals on the output side instead of coloured **wire**s, the temptation would be to connect the black **wire** to the + (positive) terminal, and the red to the minus. But, LEDs being polarity-sensitive devices, the light won’t turn on! What’s more, there are even some special LED strips that can be damaged by reverse polarity connection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have a galaxy note 5 i use for experiments with root which fascinates me to no end for some reason. But the **wire**s from the connected battery broken off ( which is why it was given to me) and the battery is no where to be found. Ive grown tired of being bound to a wall so im trying to test out how i can use a usb cable and batteries such as the little 9v square batteries to keep it on while i walk around. Anyone that can help give me some ideas please email me with note 5 in the subject line i would really appreciate it. Thanks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Question: I have a yoga microphone with a USB connection that I want to use with a stereo round plug. Using your cabling info I expect I would use the black **wire** for earth and the green and white for the mic connections. Is this correct? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While American Wire Gauge is common place in many parts of the world and especially in certain industries (transformer manufacture for example) it is profoundly unpopular with engineers everywhere except perhaps the US. It is a totally useless **wire** specification for all but the **wire** manufacturers. Does it help you to know that a **wire** has the diameter of a **wire** drawn from 1oz of copper to 24ft in length? Or would you rather know the diameter or cross sectional area? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So for your projects the positive and negative **wire**s should have their own colour especially since this is where you often have to connect to external power, and then the signal(s) can have a third (or more) colour. If you have a small set of hookup **wire** spools, you can develop your own code particular to your projects; for example, blue for inputs, yellow for digital signals, violet for analog, and green for the output side. This will help you for years to come in troubleshooting. Remember that the colour is for your benefit and adjust your rules to your designs. If you keep the project, you can write the code down too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For LEDs, the red **wire** should be positive and the black **wire** negative. That’s it. Black **wire** should never carry positive in DC wiring. Got it? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But now that low voltage LED lighting is commonplace, the question of “where to connect the black **wire**” has become confusing. Essentially, LEDs are a form of DC electronics – another name for LED lighting is SSL lighting, which means Solid State Lighting. As DC electronics, **wire**s attached to LED devices usually (should) conform to DC wiring colour-code conventions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I cut the usb 4 **wire** cord one mine to **wire** up with a 2 **wire**.... now the 2 **wire** was white and green , I used the white and green on the 4 **wire**. Will this charge up my drone? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   AND NOW – we’ve noticed a rather disturbing trend of LED products coming out using white and black **wire**s, with the black **wire** connected to positive. That’s really confusing. (China, I’m looking at you!) What’s going on? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hi, I'm trying to attach my phone charger to a battery made of pennies, and I got the battery to work (it made 6.5 volts), but I don't know how to attach it to the charger. The charger has four **wire**s (red, green, black, and white), but I don't know how to attach them. Any ideas? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Question: I plug a mini Jack into my blue tooth speaker, the Blu. It cuts out and the mini is dominant. If I want to keep blue tooth up, which **wire**s do I use out of the little USB, coming out of the speaker for an additional direct speaker hook up? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Always assume that **wire** colours means something if you are working on an existing device, even if all it means is that this blue **wire** is a different circuit than that violet **wire**. I have been a broke student and **wire**d electronic prototypes with the one roll of red hookup **wire** I had. They eventually worked but I paid in time troubleshooting. My professional work used national electrical code **wire** colours in large gauge but the low voltage signals used a different colour combination, but the **wire**s were physically different which also helped separate them. And in production, each product was the exact same to simplify the repair department work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On older wiring such as this rubber and fabric-jacketed household wiring from a U.S. home, figuring out what the heck the **wire** colors are can itself be a challenge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If we’re talking about typical 110-120 volt AC wiring as commonly found in homes, shops, offices and so on, the black **wire** is “hot” and white **wire** is “neutral”. There is also a third **wire**, usually bare without its own insulation, which is a safety ground **wire**. These types of **wire**s are found in BX and Romex /NMD90 cables. Without splitting too many hairs over terminology, that can roughly translate into black meaning “positive” and white meaning “negative”. Remember, we’re talking about AC (alternating current) here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It could be the ground **wire**. Identify which are the power **wire**s then identify the two data **wire**s. The fifth should be your ground. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My best guess is that there are some product engineers out there who want to “do it right” and so they go to trusty google (ok, it’s Baidu in China, as Google is blocked …) to find out what color the **wire**s should be, and where they should be connected. And … they find some article that says black is positive/hot and white is neutral negative. But what’s missing is the fact that info is about AC WIRING only! It doesn’t apply to electronic devices like LEDs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **wire** colours you have referred to, such as the green yellow for earth is actually required by a multitude of international standards to be reserved for the purposes of protective earth conductors. For the most part, there are no specific colours associated with an active or neutral for example in a permanent installation mains circuit. Any associations of colour to purpose in mains wiring is purely conventional rather than specified by a standard. Mains cables on the other hand are far too uniform to be accidental. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Answer: No need. It could be the ground **wire** or any. Just focus on the power **wire**s and have trial and error on both data **wire**s. You can also check my other **wire**s colors in my articles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My charger has four **wire**s, red, green, white, black. There is also a bare **wire** leading from the front of the plug itself. What is that for? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Inside every USB cable there's always a couple of **wire**s that are twisted together. Those two are always the data **wire**s. This applies also to webcams, and notabily laptops' internal ones, and can be good to know because in those webcams usually **wire**s are not colour coded. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Answer: Check the wirings by splicing the **wire**. It could be the ground **wire** or any. Just focus on the power **wire**s and have trial and error on both data **wire**s. You can also check my other **wire**s colors in my articles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
