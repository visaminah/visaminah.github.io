## 9 Facts Test Exterior Paint Colors App | APPS FOR PAINT COLORS
-   Choosing between Sherwin-Williams and Dunn-Edwards, it basically came down to personal preference, Kunkel said. Dunn-Edwards seems more focused on identifying **colors** (color match), then providing resources to find samples of the color. Sherwin-Williams does have a color explorer, but it also has two different methods of viewing selected **colors** on different surfaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most digital color-choosing tools also offer stock photos of sample rooms and sample houses to “**paint**” with your choice of **colors**. Sometimes you can find a photo that has a similar layout to your room or house in order to give you an idea of how the color will look in your own room. Then you don’t have to upload your own photo. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   He also said: “One feature that made Sherwin-Williams’ app stand out was their Insta**paint** view which uses your phones camera so you can point your phone, detect the surface you want to **paint**, then allow you to choose the color you pick to be overlaid on whatever wall, door or surface the phone camera is facing. The quality of the **paint** color is not as high when compared to other methods in this app, but it is an interesting concept.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the past several years, **paint** companies – including Sherwin-Williams, Dunn-Edwards and PPG – have tried to solve that problem. They’re all developing apps that allow you to test your color choices on rooms or exteriors of houses using your phone or tablet or PC. They call these programs **paint** visualizers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paint visualizers were designed to make it easier for homeowners to choose **paint** **colors** for a room or a whole house. After all, the **colors** on the little chips you pick up at a **paint** store often end up looking very different when you **paint** the great room in your house. Of course, many homeowners buy sample cans and **paint** large squares of color next to each other on their walls. That can help, but it’s not completely satisfying. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   PPG was last, but not because it worked poorly, he noted, “I had to use the browser to play around with the color matcher as their app requires an additional piece of hardware to be purchased. PPG has similar **paint**ing features to the other two companies, and its website was fairly easy to navigate. That being said, their **paint**-a-room feature can be difficult to work with.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You want to re**paint** your home, but you’re worried about the color. Maybe you saw a house the other day that’s exactly the shade of gray you’re looking for or found inspiration for an interior room color. How can you find out what the color it is and how can you decide if it will look good on your walls or not? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Instead of doing everything yourself, you can visit a brand-name **paint** store and have them download a photo of the room or a wall you want to re**paint**. After they do that, they will “re**paint**” the picture in the color or **colors** you choose. Let them do the technical work of setting up the boundaries where the **paint** should go. This can often work better than you doing it all yourself. But check in advance about whether the store will perform this service. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are also a number of **paint**ing apps that you can download that are not connected with **paint** companies. If the app you find is free, they may have lots of ads connected with them. These can be annoying but shouldn’t hinder the function of the app. Some apps may have the option to pay a small fee ($2.99 or so) in order to get rid of those ads. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
