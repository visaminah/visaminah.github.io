## 120 Things You Should Know About What Are The Two Colors That Go Good Together | 2 Color Combinations
-   As the name suggests, Crown Royal is wh​​iskey fit for royalty. How appropriate that the Canadian-based Whiskey uses royal purple, gold and red in their logo. In addition, the logo pairs an elegant cursive font with an ornate crown atop a velvet pillow. The imagery, **colors** and text all play their part in shaping the brand’s identity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At some point during my color self-education it was brought to my attention that not all **colors** are made equal — at least to our human eyes. We perceive pure **colors** as having different values: a vivid yellow is much lighter than a vivid purple. Of course, black or white can be added to lighten or darken them but, as mentioned earlier, their intensity is then reduced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hues are **colors** in their most pure, vivid form. They are **colors** at their fullest intensity. You might know them as bold **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hues are important to remember when combining two primary **colors** to create a secondary color. If you don't use the hues of the two primary **colors** you're mixing **together**, you won't generate the hue of the secondary color. This is because a hue has the fewest other **colors** inside it. By mixing two primary **colors** that carry other tints, tones, and shades inside them, you're technically adding more than two **colors** to the mixture — making your final color dependent on the compatibility of more than two **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to build on the natural warmth within the color yellow, the best option is to stick with **colors** close to this shade on the color wheel. Reds and oranges are perfect for highlighting the warmth in yellow. Browns can be extremely effective too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another way to soften high intensity is to introduce desaturation. Here it is applied to only one of the two **colors**, for a more unusual result. Stimulation-wise the contrasting hues and the presence of light-dark contrast help boost the impact of these combinations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You might be wondering, how come cool and warm **colors** make a bad combination. We all know the rules of complementary **colors** and how they look good **together**. Green goes well with magenta and blue looks great with yellow. And I agree with that – complementary **colors** make a great base for color palettes if you know how to use them properly. However, let’s move to a more specific sphere – interior design and see how complementary **colors** react in the environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The color wheel was first invented by Sir Isaac Newton in the 18th century when he tried to condense the color spectrum into a wheel and visually represent the relationship between them. The wheel has been segregated into the following categories. While we will focus on using it for clothing and outfits, this theory is universal and applies to just about anything that deals with **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In summary, the more intense the two **colors** are as a whole, the more stimulating the combination. The further away they are from their purest, most intense state, the less stimulating it becomes. Specially if the **colors** are desaturated! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   are hues that have been mixed with black. You’ll know them as dark **colors**. Tones are hues that have been mixed with white and black, creating gray undertones. These are also called muted **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Neutral **colors** are self-explanatory. They are just muted, plain, and subdued. Black, grey, whites, off-whites, taupe, etc., fall into the neutral category. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Vibrating **colors** but gentler, more tolerable for the eyes. Almost all the ingredients for vibration are present: contrasting hues and minimal light-dark contrast. However, the overall intensity is reduced by the addition of white to both **colors**, which also reduces vibration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hues of **colors** like red, orange, yellow, brown, etc. are warm **colors** – they make things look smaller in size, and that’s why most of us prefer wearing warmer **colors** when we want to look slimmer. Cool **colors**, like hues of blue, purple, green, etc., are soothing **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gold and purple work well **together** because they’re both shades often associated with luxury and indulgence. Purple has a long history of being a hard-to-obtain color reserved for the wealthy. Gold, of course, is something we link to precious metals and elegance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using the right **colors** and matching them perfectly can be a deal maker. Choosing the perfect color for an outfit is what sets you apart. And, that’s why color and its theories continue to be the pivot for not just clothes, but everything else like interiors, hair, makeup, and much more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The easiest combinations for green are white and black, as you can hardly go wrong with those. Green combined with earthy browns creates a look that reminds of nature, and beige looks particularly good with green. Blue and yellow also pair well as its analogous **colors**, and complementary pink makes a fantastic accent color when paired with dark green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In your visualizations, you often want **colors** to stand out. There are different ways to achieve that. Colors stand out: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let me explain: dark **colors** usually don’t have the most pleasant associations – death, depression, blood, you name it. So, a couple of them in one place emerges the viewer into the darkest feelings that they personally associate with these **colors**. And not just one, but all **together** as an unidentified heaviness. That’s why dark with dark color combinations are best avoided. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you become more confident with **colors**, colorful backgrounds can seem like a good idea. But they come with two big drawbacks: First, they easily distract from your data. Second, they’re limiting your potential color palette and are therefore hard to work with. In fact, the more saturated your background, the harder it gets — so desaturated **colors** are your best bet. Here are some rules of thumbs for the HSB/HSV color space: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let’s say we begin with a combination of intense blue and orange and want to reduce its amount of stimulation. One could, for instance, add a moderate amount of white to both **colors**. Since what matters is the average intensity of both **colors**, one could also considerably lighten one of the two and leave the other untouched. And, of course, the more white is added, the less stimulating the duo becomes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I sometimes see charts — especially area charts — where neighboring elements have the same lightness. You can easily check this: Just convert your **colors** to black & white (e.g., with an external colorblindness simulator or with our Datawrapper colorblind check). If they all have the same gray, they’re the same lightness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, it’s crucial to evaluate the environment in which the combinations are used. A warm and cool tone mixture doesn’t work well in the interior design, and vibrating **colors** are extremely deceiving in web design. Making sure that your chosen qualitative color scheme transmits the message you intend them to and in the most comfortable way possible for the viewer is the safe path for the designer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because complementary **colors** have such a strong contrast, they are the boldest combination you can make, which can create a color clash if you combine two at too high an intensity. The best way to combine complementary **colors** is to contrast their brightness. These **colors** look best **together** when one is darker or lighter or more muted than the other. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Soft shades of yellow and pink **together** have a wonderfully romantic vibe to them. We often associate pink with romance and affection, while yellow is a color typically associated with joy. Together, the **colors** can create an aesthetic perfect for conveying friendship and caring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Saturation and brightness are as important as hue. In fact, you can create new **colors** when you change just the saturation and brightness. Here are two color pairs with the same hue, just different saturation and lightness: ⬤⬤ / ⬤⬤. (If you change the hue just a tiny bit, you’ll achieve even better results: ⬤⬤ / ⬤⬤.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is not the right article for you if you’re trying to find good gradients or shades. But if you need to find beautiful, distinctive **colors** for different categories (e.g., continents, industries, bird species) for your line charts, pie charts, stacked bar charts, etc., then read on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another trick of the trade is to balance out any **colors** you choose to mix carefully. Anything done proportionately is a foolproof way of coordinating your outfit. Like they say, too much of anything is good for nothing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That comes with problems: If you work with small areas like lines and dots, light and desaturated **colors** can be hard for your readers to distinguish. But even if legibility is not an issue — e.g. for bigger areas — your visualizations should have enough visual contrast with the background to confidently communicate: “Hey, I’m here, and I have something to say.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We come into contact with an incredible variety of **colors** day in, day out. But how many of us really know much about the theory behind how **colors** work? Or what they mean to viewers on an emotional level? Color psychology is a far-reaching field of study and one that matters more than you may think when dealing with branding and marketing efforts. In fact, according to Forbes, color improves brand recognition by up to an incredible 80%, while consistent brand presentation across platforms can increase revenue by almost a quarter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Golden yellow and white **together** are also an excellent combination. As mentioned above, golden yellows are usually associated with things like luxury and wealth. At the same time, white is a shade connected to creativity, peacefulness, and purity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The color wheel is a visual guide to the color spectrum. You can see how different **colors** relate to each other by how far apart they are on the wheel. Understanding the color wheel for clothes can help you create a balanced outfit as a beginner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next in your quest for **colors** that go **together**, understand color psychology, or how each color impacts a viewer. Knowing how to evoke the right emotion for your brand can help you decide on which **colors** to include. You can read more about logo **colors** and the specific color meanings to help with this process. Also, pay attention to logo psychology for guidance on how to pair **colors** with shapes and typography to communicate your message. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When combined **together**, red and white make pink. But when juxtaposed against one another, the **colors** create an eye catching result. Think about where you see red and white in life: stop signs, lighthouses, a lipsticked smile. These all instantly grab your attention. To jog your memory, here are a few other classic red and white logos: Coca-Cola, Target and CNN. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This company took a risk and used a unique logo color scheme of two bold and bright **colors** sandwiched between black and white. (Remember, the general rule is no more than one to three **colors**.) And this four color logo paid off. The highly recognizable logo builds upon a simple note icon and TikTok wordmark. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are pale or yellow toned, opt for **colors** from the colder side of the palette, such as grey, navy blue, varying shades of green, aqua, emerald, burgundy, etc. If you have a deeper skin tone, you can pull off brighter or warmer shades of brown, coral, honey, gold, amber, taupe, etc., as they look amazing on this skin tone. All said and done, an ideal way to do this is to always to strike a balance between warm and cold **colors**. The same applies to your eye makeup too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Triad **colors** are a combination of three **colors** equally distant from each other on the color wheel. Contrary to common perception though, you don’t have to wear all three **colors** for this combination to work. You can pick two **colors** from a triad and wear them **together**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bright pinks and yellows **together** are a lot more aggressive. The two **colors** are extremely vivid, which leads to a fusion of confident and eye-catching shades. Bright pink and yellow used **together** in large doses can look garish and overwhelming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As we have already mentioned, **colors** have different moods and associations, and they influence us even more when we are placed in a room filled with certain hues. For example, a living room with marigold orange walls would bring a sense of coziness and playfulness. On the contrary, a bedroom with navy blue decor would create a refreshing and calm ambiance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also add both white and black to a color to create a tone. Tone and saturation essentially mean the same thing, but most people will use saturation if they're talking about **colors** being created for digital images. Tone will be used more often for painting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Worth noting? Different audiences may perceive **colors** differently. The meanings listed above are common for North American audiences, but if your brand moves into other parts of the world, it’s a good idea to research how users will perceive particular **colors**. For example, while red typically symbolizes passion or power in the United States, it’s considered a color of mourning in South Africa. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I hope this article was helpful! If you want to continue reading: There are quite some articles on this blog about color, e.g. about **colors** for gender, **colors** for political parties, colorblindness (part 1, 2, 3), and what to consider in general when using **colors** in your visualizations. If there’s a great trick this article is missing, let me know at lisa@datawrapper.de or in the comments below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yet, at first, let me get this straight: any vibrant color is beautiful, but it all comes down to a matter of how we perceive **colors** because not all people see the right **colors** the same way. Why do certain people like certain hues and others don’t? To my mind, it’s all about the associations that these **colors** evoke. Some people might associate light cyan with the color of the clear sky; equally, for some, it’s just a color of the hospital walls. Also, the important factor is how we use the **colors** and how we combine them, as some of the combinations might have an opposite effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Similar to the above-mentioned point about neon **colors**, we have another “fighting for your attention” unique combination — a huge design “no go” – vibrating **colors**. So-called vibration happens when two bold similar **colors** (usually with the same intensity) are placed next to each other. They create an impression of movement: some flow on top of each other, and others resemble a dent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To pair these analogous logo **colors** successfully, try using muted or softer shades rather than two bright **colors**. Consider using gradients or choosing one dominant color and highlighting a second. Red and pink work well for fashion logos and beauty logos. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the whole, it’s not about the color itself; it’s about the things that are associated with this color and how it works in specific color combinations. As we have discussed, neon pairs and vibrating color combos are just too aggressive to the viewers’ eyes, so that instead of attracting their attention, these **colors** put them off. As for the only dark color combinations, the associations, and feelings that these **colors** evoke come into the play. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While many may associate neon **colors** with ‘80’s ski jackets, the hues also can represent vitality and vibrancy. Pairing a bright color with bold black text helps anchor the eye and focus on the brand name. Neon **colors** can also represent warning signs and danger, so be sure to factor in balance if considering this for your logo design. Neons can work well in fitness logos or for young vibrant brands. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another analogous logo color scheme, yellow and green evoke cheerfulness and youth. These **colors** both uplift the viewer and, when used **together**, effectively create visual harmony. For Sprite, the **colors** not only help the brand stand out, but foster an association to the product. The soft-drink beverage’s **colors** represent the refreshing citrus fruit shades and lemon-lime flavor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As a general rule, use between one and three **colors** in your logo design. Since your brand identity contains your logo, be sure to pick at least one dominant color to appear across all your branding assets. When in doubt, keep it simple to maintain a clear brand message and persona. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If it’s a printed or patterned outfit, let the print take over. Prints and patterns are usually a combination of one or more **colors**, so you must leave it at that. Keep the accessories in the neighborhood; more **colors** only makes it clumsier and unruly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some people just prefer being muted and subdued with their choice of **colors**, and end up opting for just the neutral shades. If this is you and you do not want to change drastically, go with one cool or warm color, and leave everything else neutral. It’s always best to keep it this way! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Disclaimer: This article is just an opinion piece only, and it’s not intended to offend somebody’s taste or choice of color. The way you see **colors** might be different from the way we see them. Thank you for understanding! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can wear blue with white, black and gray. It reminds of seas and beaches when paired with brown and makes easy pairing with analogous **colors** cyan, turquoise and green. Lastly, it provides fetching contrasts with yellow, brown, red and orange. You almost can’t go wrong with blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The bright **colors** work as overlays, with small amounts of color pops energetically bursting out the sides. How fitting for a social app that lets users watch, create, and share 15-second clips of dancing, music, laughter and much more. Many users now associate these **colors** solely with the app’s icon, which sits on their phone menu icons, in their social feeds and in the background of their everyday lives. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yellow is a color not frequently worn by men. It’s a vibrant color that looks overwhelming on a man when worn in large quantities. It can also make your skin look washed out if you’re not wearing the right kind of yellow, especially when you already have a pale skin tone. For these reasons, most men avoid it al**together**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Reducing the overall color intensity by, for instance, gently desaturating both **colors**. Reducing the distance between the two hues by, for instance, using a yellow-green instead of the original contrasting green. Reducing the light-dark contrast by, for instance, lightening the red. This will have the additional effect of reducing the overall color intensity (yay). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are three secondary **colors**: orange, purple, and green. You can create each one using two of the three primary **colors**. Here are the general rules of secondary color creation: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is the impetus behind the color wheel, a circle graph that charts each primary, secondary, and tertiary color — as well as their respective hues, tints, tones, and shades. Visualizing **colors** in this way helps you choose color schemes by showing you how each color relates to the color that comes next to it on a rainbow color scale. (As you probably know, the **colors** of a rainbow, in order, are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tip: Understand cultural difference Use **colors** that are culturally appropriate. For instance in Western cultures white colour represents pure and innocence whereas in some South Asian cultures it is the colour of death. We love this book on understanding colour meanings around the world! Check out this post on Color psychology and how colour tricks used by top companies! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let’s start with the basics. Originally created by Isaac Newton in 1666, the color wheel is a great reference with which to understand how **colors** relate to each other. Primary **colors**—red, blue, and yellow—are the three off which all others are based. And secondary **colors**—orange, green, and violet—are obtained from mixing two of the primaries **together** (red and yellow for orange, red and blue for violet, and blue and yellow for green). Accordingly, tertiary **colors** go further in-between, giving us yellow-green, blue-green, blue-violet, red-violet, red-orange, and yellow-orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Technically speaking, pink and blue complement each other. However, many cultures see them as gendered opposites. The two **colors** create a balanced composition in the Baskin-Robbins logo. This palette communicates the beloved ice cream brand’s trustworthiness, dependability, and warmth—from their pink ice cream sample spoons to the blue text on their customer service page. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   UI and UX designers use Figma for digital design and prototyping, and their brand’s logo reflects their creativity through color. Playing with subtle gradient and bold contrast between color and shape, the Figma logo strategically communicates through design. The stacked **colors** resemble both a grid and the letter F, cleverly combining these details in a rather simple but strong layout. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   are **colors** in their most pure, vivid form. They are **colors** at their fullest intensity. You might know them as bold **colors**. Tints are hues that have been mixed with white. You’ll know them as light **colors** or pastels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Last, but not least, we’ve decided to include a logo example that uses five **colors**. In some cases, the more color, the merrier, as long as you understand each shade's strengths and weaknesses and how they work **together** to create a cohesive picture. In this case, Naüe uses delicate **colors** within the font to subtly express a certain joie de vivre. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Two highly-saturated **colors** instantly bring energy and life to this logo. The LA Lakers’ logo embodies the team’s vibe and symbolizes the energy and movement of basketball. Fans can easily recognize this lively logo color combination, whether in a packed stadium or on a single jersey—, an important unifying detail for a sports team’s fan base. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As Duolingo puts it, “The world is a diverse and wonderful place. We want to reflect that in the people we see, and the **colors** we use—that's why we've developed a bright and beautiful palette.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No matter which color scheme you choose, keep in mind what your graphic needs. If you need to create contrast, then choose a color scheme that gives you that. On the other hand, if you just need to find the best "versions" of certain **colors**, then play around with the monochromatic color scheme to find the perfect shades and tints. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Working with complementary **colors** can be tricky. Be sure to vary shades and saturation levels. Complementary **colors** of the same intensity can look like they are vibrating when placed next to each other. This can be disconcerting, to say the least. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The positive and negative aspect of the split complementary color model is that you can use any two **colors** in the scheme and get great contrast ... but that also means it can also be tricky to find the right balance between the **colors**. As a result, you may end up playing around with this one a bit more to find the right combination of contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Monochromatic color schemes use a single color with varying shades and tints to produce a consistent look and feel. Although it lacks color contrast, it often ends up looking very clean and polished. It also allows you to easily change the darkness and lightness of your **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The combination of **colors** that are equidistant from each other on the color wheel is called ‘triadic.’ They look great **together**, but some might argue that they can be OTT. However, you can choose the muted shades of these **colors** to make your outfit. A pair of green cargos with a pastel pink top and powder blue accessories or shoes will look sophisticated and tasteful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These comprise red, yellow, and blue. No two **colors** can be mixed to achieve these shades. Everything else is derived from these **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Keeping it in the family is a mantra you need to remember. The safest way to do this is by blending different shades of the same color. However, that will inevitably get monotonous and boring very soon. Remember how we discussed complementary **colors**? (Red and green, violet and yellow, blue and orange.) Play around with a combination of these **colors**; they will look great when put **together**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That’s because these warm **colors** and blue are super versatile for categories. Yellow and orange and red look very pleasing **together**, but people will still perceive them as different: ⬤⬤⬤ — which is exactly what we want for categorical **colors**. And blue is more flexible than any other hue. Lots of blues, no matter if dark ⬤ or light ⬤ or saturated ⬤ or not saturated ⬤, look pleasing, calming, and professional. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, that’s also a matter of taste. But if you’re not sure if your **colors** are too pastel-ish, simply try to make them more saturated and darker. Just see how it feels. And if it feels good, keep it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   CMYK stands for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key (Black). Those also happen to be the **colors** listed on your ink cartridges for your printer. That's no coincidence. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With that said, some rules are made to be broken. Depending on your industry, business, and brand values, you’ll know if your audience would prefer a multitude of **colors**. Some colorful favorites include NBC, Google, Toys R Us, Crayola, NASCAR and Slack. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2,2” x 2,2” composition I have been testing combinations with. Before increasing the complexity, I hoped to understand how two **colors** work **together** first. I have compiled close to 500 of them by now. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   , which is the same idea but for “live images”: It lets you capture **colors** from your environment. (It’s fascinating to see how desaturated many **colors** are around us!) Play “manual color picker”: Look up your screen. Which **colors** do you see? How dark and how saturated are there? Which hues are close by; which ones are opposite on the color wheel? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remember: For every context in which customers interact with your product, they make associations to your brand **colors**. Often, they first come across your logo. When using a three color combination, choosing one predominant color and two accents helps to create a cohesive design. Orange and red are both bright **colors**, while the lemon green is refined and soft. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **colors** will go well with yellow when the right tones are chosen. However, certain **colors** may look too aggressive when used in large quantities. For instance, black and yellow is often associated with caution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You might think like this: “I need five **colors** for my chart. So I’ll use green and yellow and blue and red. And… um… maybe orange? Or purple!” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ombre is taking over everything from hairstyles and cakes to nail art and decor, and not to forget, outfits. Party-wear outfits, bridesmaid dresses or just a simple jeans and top in ombre can turn heads. Diminishing shades of the same color either in ascending or descending order works great. If you are sporting separates, you need to bring it all **together** with the top, bottom, shoes, and accessories being in sync. Wear ombre outfits for your Christmas or winter parties, goes perfectly with the theme, and the weather too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I find it easier to think about CMYK in terms of its corresponding numbers. CMYK works on a scale of 0 to 100. If C=100, M=100, Y=100, and K=100, you end up with black. But, if all four **colors** equal 0, you end up with true white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Think of a juicy watermelon slice or a long-stemmed pink rose and instantly you know these hues work **together**. This logo color scheme pairs a bright pink with a pale mint green to create a powerful composition. Since pink and green are complementary **colors**, they pair well in almost any shade, saturation or brightness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Our **colors** are opposite each other on the color wheel, so they’re clearly complementary. Yay! But they’re also unusable: The two oranges are way too similar. And everything looks so… bright. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A relative of HSB/HSV is the HCL color space. It uses the same parameters (Hue, Chroma = saturation, Lightness), but is closer to “how we really see **colors**.” Datawrapper uses the HCL color space for its color picker: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Overall, it’s not only painful to look at these saturated color combos, but also the moving sensation might be very disorienting. Especially in web design, where convex shapes might signify a button or other system elements. More than that, legibility plays a pivotal role in navigation and overall understanding in any type of design, so having these bright **colors** that make you look away is not the way to go. Thus, I would suggest changing one of the **colors** completely if it’s impossible to omit the duo al**together**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   are hues that have been mixed with white. You’ll know them as light **colors** or pastels. Shades are hues that have been mixed with black. You’ll know them as dark **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   . Try to use them in your next chart. Install Adobe Capture , which is the same idea but for “live images”: It lets you capture **colors** from your environment. (It’s fascinating to see how desaturated many **colors** are around us!) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   CMYK is the subtractive color model. It's called that because you have to subtract **colors** to get to white. That means the opposite is true — the more **colors** you add, the closer you get to black. Confusing, right? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So what would happen if we were to mix the two polar opposite atmospheres? They will clash and look quite hideous. Needless to say that a person would also feel quite unsettled in such a space. Possible solutions would be to change one of the **colors** in the pair for a more appropriate counterpart – an analogous color or even white or black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red and green, violet and yellow, blue and orange – complementary **colors**, as the name goes, work best when put **together**. These are exactly opposite to each other on the color wheel. They might seem bold to look at, but the outputs will be perfect. If you observe carefully, your spring and summer clothing is mostly designed using complementary **colors**. While some might argue against this concept, it is actually a matter of choice as some like making bold statements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A common reference for choosing a color palette is the work of Cynthia Brewer on ColorBrewer. The **colors** were chosen based on perceptual patterns in choropleth maps, but most of the same advice applies to using color in any type of plot to distinguish data patterns. If color is solely to distinguish between the different lines, then a qualitative palette is in order. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're not an Adobe user, you've probably used Microsoft Office products at least once. All of the Office products have preset **colors** that you can use and play around with to create color schemes. PowerPoint also has a number of color scheme presets that you can use to draw inspiration for your designs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As a non-designer, I often find it difficult to find just the right **colors** for my amateur projects. Whether I'm creating a simple image to support my content or more elaborate projects such as a slide deck or infographic, I frequently spend a good amount of time looking for the perfect color scheme. I ask myself questions like: Do I want my design to be inviting? Provocative and bold? Or intelligent and elegant? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There's a lot of theory in this post, I know. But when it comes to choosing **colors**, understanding the theory behind color can do wonders for how you actually use color. This can make creating branded visuals easy, especially when using design templates where you can customize **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to marketing, no choice should be made on a whim—and that includes color. The hues you choose to infuse into your work and your brand send underlying messages to your audience. A certain combination of **colors** can create a unique aesthetic while creating specific emotional connections that impact buyer behavior. But to be sure your visuals are communicating the right thing, you need to know what kind of feelings common **colors** trigger. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best solution would be to use a toned-down right shade of one of the **colors**. As you can see in the picture, the neon cyan color was switched to dark indigo blue. In this way, you will be able to use neon pink as a statement color and don’t overstimulate the viewer. Moreover, in such vibrant color combinations, the neon would be powered by the lightness or, in our case, the darkness of other **colors** to make use of its best qualities. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you wear black clothes with other black clothes, you must make sure that they are the exact same shade, as otherwise, one garment will look washed out. For the same reason, you should avoid wearing grays that look almost black. Otherwise, black goes with any other color, but looks especially good when contrasted against light or bold, vibrant **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hue is pretty much synonymous with what we actually mean when we said the word "color." All of the primary and secondary **colors**, for instance, are "hues." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How dark and how saturated are there? Which hues are close by; which ones are opposite on the color wheel? Pick **colors** from beautiful data visualizations. Change a few **colors**. Do they still work well **together**? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The color scheme uses three **colors**: A color and two other **colors** that are directly adjacent to the first color’s complement on the color wheel. This provides the visual interest of a complementary color scheme but without the vibration. It also allows the use of more color. Examples include: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Neon **colors** are known for being eye-catching, bold, and daring. However, with such distinct qualities, they are also referred to as disturbing and reckless. Because of these two contradicting sides, having two or three neon **colors** alongside each other is not the best of options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The opposite is true, too: Don’t make your **colors** too dark and saturated when you’re using a bright background. If in doubt, try it out. Make your **colors** lighter, pull some saturation out of them and see how it feels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re using **colors** with different lightness (“Get it right in black & white”), you’ll need to balance them out. Try to desaturate bright **colors**. Put more saturation in dark **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the distance becomes small enough, you’re basically using complementary **colors**. And that’s a great choice! Lots of complementary color pairs look fantastic **together**. When in doubt, use complementary **colors** and their neighbors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also combine **colors** that all belong to the same hue, but differ in intensity. This creates a monochromatic outfit. For example, pairing light blue with dark blue, or a muted green with light green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Gray clothes, whether they’re light gray or dark gray, pair the best with lighter or brighter **colors**. Gray makes **colors** stand out against it, making it the ultimate support color. Whether it’s red, green, blue or orange, gray makes all these **colors** pop. Avoid combining gray with other muted **colors** as it creates too muddy of an appearance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Matching two or three continuous shades on the color wheel that blend well with each other is called analogous color matching. When you put an entire outfit **together** based on this, it looks both striking and stylish. If you are wondering how to style that orange or camel trench coat of yours, pick a shade on either side of the color in the color wheel and work with that. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Neon **colors** will definitely attract the attention of readers. But these readers won’t thank you. Most of us get a bit stressed out when we see them: “Highly saturated, light **colors** will NOT be appropriate [to communicate] Serious or Trust, or Calm,” researchers Bartram, Patra, and Stone explain in their paper “Affective Color in Visualization” from 2017 (PDF). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The effect of disturbance and disarrangement as if something is wrong, but you are not sure what exactly. On the one hand, it has no distinct mood, and it’s hard to notice something. On the other hand, when you do notice the **colors**, it has no point of visual interest. You would probably want to skim the piece and move on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue is the quintessential color when it comes to menswear, as I guarantee everyone reading this has plenty of blue in their wardrobe already. Whether it’s jeans, suits, sports coats or T-shirts, we tend to gravitate toward blue. It’s an effortless color to wear. But what **colors** go well with blue? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red looks great when paired with neutrals like white, black, gray or navy, which make the bold color pop. It also looks great with earthy browns or with contrasting **colors** blue, yellow and green, as long as you contrast the intensity as well. Mustard yellow, army green and light blue make particularly fetching color combos for red. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By adding your brand **colors** to your various marketing efforts, a consistent look will begin to emerge. This in turn helps boost brand awareness and memorability, giving your audience something to look for and remember when engaging with your business. Check out this handy color calculator to start experimenting with different combinations and see what works best for you and your company. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Analogous **colors** are next to each other on the color wheel. You can easily recognize when **colors** are analogous, because they look the most alike. These **colors** are easiest to match because they’re so closely related. Just make sure the **colors** don’t match too closely, as it will create a mismatched look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to three color logo combinations, it can get a little tricky, but you can get it right if you understand each shade’s unique nuances. Monday.com’s bold tricolor logo hits the mark. The project management tool improves workflow and streamlines collaboration, so what better **colors** to elicit a response than those of a traffic light? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Usually, having two (or more) neon **colors** results in them fighting for your attention, meaning that, in the end, it’s just hard to concentrate on any of them. Also, it’s just painful for some people to look at a bunch of neon **colors** in one go because it hurts their eyes. Not the best way of transmitting information if you ask me. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, the next time you’re creating a data visualization and you’re not happy with your **colors**, analyze them in the HSV/HSB color space, e.g., with colorizer.org: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can make great color combinations with yellow though. It tends to serve best as an accent color used for accessories. Of course, if you’re bold enough, you can opt for a yellow T-shirt, polo, shorts or even pants. You’ll certainly make a statement. When doing so though, opt for neutral **colors** like white, brown, black or navy for the rest of your outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Navy clothes combine well with white and light brown **colors** like beige or camel. These **colors** provide an eye-pleasing contrast with the dark hue of navy. Pink, red and orange make fantastic complements to navy clothes and are great **colors** to use as accents in accessories. (The navy suit with a crisp white shirt and red tie will never go out of style.) Pairing the dark blue with lighter tints of blue creates a soft monochromatic look that’s always a safe bet for men. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
