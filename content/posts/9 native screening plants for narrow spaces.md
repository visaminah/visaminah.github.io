## 9 Fun Facts Native Screening Plants For Narrow Spaces | Tall Plants For Narrow Garden Beds
-   If you want to use grassy **plants** to divide a part of your garden from the rest or accent a feature of it, you can’t go wrong by choosing Reed grass (Calamagrostis), Chinese fountain grass (Pennisetum) and Silvergrass (Miscanthus). If you’d rather have somewhat of a transparent barrier, then your best choices are verbena and lavender. If you want to provide privacy for your overlooked garden, you might want to choose **plants** like Clematis and rambling rose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some of the best potted **plants** for privacy you can choose are tall evergreens like Sasanqua camellias (Camellia sasanqua), Indian hawthorn (Rhaphiolepis indica), and Japanese box (Buxus microphylla). For a fast-growing screen, any type of clumping bamboo is a great choice. Suppose you have a narrow planting space available. In that case, you can use a trellis with a climbing plant like Star jasmine (Trachelospermum jasminoides) or White mandevilla (Mandevilla boliviensis) for a compact screen of green with a wonderful splash of white flowers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like we mentioned earlier, you can also use **screening** **plants** in pots. This way, you can have a living privacy fence in a place where it wouldn’t be possible otherwise, like on your balcony, for example!

-   You have to consider whether you will obscure views, block sunlight and whether your **plants** will shed their leaves all over your neighbour’s property. Furthermore, you must absolutely avoid planting invasive species, as such **plants** can overwhelm local ecosystems rapidly and what’s more, buying and selling the seeds of invasive species is illegal and prosecutable in Australia. Check out government-issued lists of invasive species for your area before choosing what to plant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take note of how much sun your balcony receives daily and whether it’s constantly windy, as well. As we said earlier, different **plants** enjoy different amounts of sunlight on a daily basis. So if your balcony is West-facing and gets only a smidgen of the sun in the late afternoon, then you’d have to choose **plants** such as succulents and shade-loving climbing **plants**. For a windy terrace, it’s best to select small shrubs that won’t get tattered by the constant breeze. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Strategically placed **plants** can help hide certain unsightly features, such as a gas meter, trash can or even your neighbour’s ugly fence. You can also use **plants** for the opposite reason – to draw the eye towards a certain feature of your garden. Screening **plants** can help provide privacy for overlooked gardens, as well. This can be done with wooden or metal arbours, trellises and arches, which can all be combined with a variety of different plant species. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   One of the most important factors to consider for your potted balcony screen, besides the **plants** themselves, is the pots you will place them into. The pots need to be big enough to house the plant’s roots with room for future growth while also being heavy enough to keep the big, bushy **plants** from blowing over in the wind. If your **plants** are growing slowly, the soil dries out too quickly, or the **plants** keep falling over from strong gusts of wind, then you need to re-pot your **plants** into bigger containers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
