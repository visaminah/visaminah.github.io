## 77 Unexpected Facts About How Much Is A Maaco Paint Job | Ho! Ho! Ho! Talented Texas Maaco Painting Team Scores Big Holiday-themed Painting Title
-   That's the one thing I love about a decent budget **paint** job. It makes the car look nice, but you can still enjoy the car and not go into a frenzy every time you have to leave it unattended. The other thing I like about the Maaco here is that I can drop the car off on Tuesday and pick it up on Friday. They are the masters of the quick turnaround **paint** job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   i don't believe there is a **paint** of any kind that will last 20 years without being garage kept. i know they won't in florida anyway. i'd be happy with five years for a **maaco** job though. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I've actually been pleasantly surprised with the results each time.. but MAACO, like all **paint** shops, is going to be as good as the guys they have in the booth. The one I have gone to has some skilled techs working there. I compared their work to other shops in the area and they were noticeably better than other 1-offs and Maacos within driving distance of my house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choosing a mainstream color like black, white, or gray is the cheapest way to go. If you want a specialty color, especially one used by a premium automaker, you’ll pay more. Also, keep in mind that changing your vehicle’s color will cost more because of the work it will take to **paint** the engine bay, door jambs, and more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like many things in life, you’ll absolutely get what you pay for when it comes to professional **paint** jobs. You can swing into a budget shop and be out the door for $500, but don’t expect it to be a top-notch job. A solid, high-quality **paint** job averages around $5,000. In general, you can count on **paint** job prices to vary based on: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, you can. In fact, it’s never been easier or more affordable to do so. Many people go the traditional route by paying for a new **paint** job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You've never seen a job done witrh Sikkens base/clear. I'd be willing to bet it will last 40 years left outside in the sun & rain 24-7 (if done right). Of course I spend about $1,000 on materials when I **paint** a car. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **paint** jobs will take 2 – 3 business days to complete. The Maaco website claims that 80% of cars fall into this category, though it might take and extra day or two if your car needs serious repairs or additional parts. While most customers can pick their car up the day after it’s dropped off, many Maaco locations do offer rental vehicle assistance. This can be helpful if your car needs extra work and you need transportation in the meantime. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Obviously, if you want a show car finish, you're going to pay for it. Sure, it may not be perfect, but that's a hellova great **paint** job for $600.Obviously, if you want a show car finish, you're going to pay for it. IP: Logged 09:32 PM - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Maaco's answer to that will be "Yes". They make sure to mention that if you do the priming yourself they're not responsible for any **paint** adhesion problems you might happen (heard the speech a few times myself). I used an automotive primer and never had a single problem with adhesion.. so I would recommend staying with something like Duplicolor Automotive Primer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some vehicle **paint** shops boast a turn-around time of three days or less, but in general, you should expect your car to be in the shop for at least a week. Why does it take so much time for the car to be re**paint**ed? New **paint** cannot be applied directly to old **paint**. The fading, oxidation, and irregular surface of a vehicle’s existing **paint** does not allow for the smooth application of a new coat. Removal of the existing layers of **paint** and other prep work must be completed before new **paint** can be applied. If a car requires extensive prep work, it will also raise the total price for the **paint** job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   5 more days passed without a word so on the morning of 4/25/22 I called and was told that the car should be ready for pick-up that evening. I picked the car up on the morning of 4/26/22 and as the employee drove it around, it could be seen to have blue **paint**ers tape holding the hybrid emblem on the repaired fender. The employee explained that they had just applied the emblem and that it would be dry by the time I got it home and I could remove the tape then. The employee got out of the car, said "Thank you for your patience", while handing me my key, then left me with my car without an offer to inspect anything. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can expect to pay between $500 and $1,000 for most basic services. Standard Service – This often includes sanding and removing any rust before beginning the **paint** job. You can expect to pay anywhere from $1,000 to $4,000 depending on how much work needs to be done. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So you found a ding in your car’s **paint**. Maybe you put it there, maybe someone (or something) else did. It’s not the worst thing in the world, but it sure does make your nice, shiny toy feel a bit less magnificent. If you’ve never had to deal with this before now, you’re probably wondering, “How much does car **paint** repair cost?” There are quite a few factors that play into what that number will be in your specific situation, and I’m going to break it down for you! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is the simplest and least expensive **paint** option. At this tier, Maaco will apply a single-stage enamel **paint** that will have a nice gloss finish. The company guarantees an accurate color match and will include a one-year warranty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Member since Nov 2004 I believe the quality can vary based on each shop. And when judging quality, its also important to keep in mind in most cases these **paint** jobs are a few hundred bucks at Maaco while a "real" body shop would cost you 2 to 3 thousand or more. I'm just trying to maximize what I can get from Maaco, get the best **paint** job I can for the money, and not get taken at the same time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The difference between a good **paint**job and a SHOW job is the wet sanding and buffing that occurs after **paint**ing. If you learn how to do this you can pay for a 1500 dollar **paint**job and make it look like a 3000 dollar job. Its pretty easy to do if your careful and the results will amaze you. But I doubt any MACCO job will last for 20 years. Unless its garage kept. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should also consider any maintenance details put into your vehicle. For example, if you regularly wax your vehicle, then your **paint** lasts longer. If you do not wax your vehicle, then you can expect lower durability. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As to how much prep.. It's hard to answer without seeing the part you're dealing with. The **paint** is going to show every dip and scratch and rough spot.. so you want the piece you bring them as smooth as possible (especially if you're going with a dark color). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Member since Apr 2001 HOw much 'prep' is required. I need just a front bumper **paint**ed. I have it completely sanded down to the urethane, but do i have to prime it and wet sand it a few times, or should I just bring it to them 'raw'. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many people may have concerns about when to get their car **paint**ed. In some cases, you will have an obvious sign that you need new **paint**. For example, if the **paint** is peeling, damaged, or discolored in various areas, then you need a **paint** job to refresh the look of your vehicle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before bringing your vehicle to a **paint** or auto body shop, take some time to get the facts. Understanding what the **paint**ing process entails makes it easier to choose whether or not to have your vehicle re**paint**ed. Armed with the facts, you can make a more informed decision. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Member since Jan 2007 People i know all say **maaco** sucks. ( I never went there). I dont know. But there has been recent threads talking about this and they all say **maaco** doesnt do a good job at all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is a MAACO job using their integrated clear.. the top three pictures were taken 3 years after it was **paint**ed. the last was taken about 2 months after it was **paint**ed: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Basic costs range from $300 to $900. Standard: The cost of a standard **paint** job usually includes sanding the body and removing rust before **paint**ing to get an attractive finish. Standard costs range from $1,000 to $4,500. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Hats off to the team at Maaco Burleson, TX, for their creative design, attention to detail, and use of my favorite **paint** color – Petty Blue!,” Petty said. “If you looked at all the hoods entered in the contest, there was some phenomenal stuff. Ghosts, snowflakes all under the **paint** but this was the perfect one with Santa and the Maaco shop. That was what this was all about.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This middle-ground option is more expensive but comes with a single application of urethane-based **paint** instead of enamel **paint**. Urethane is more resistant to scratches, chips, and general wear and will last a lot longer. This option comes with a 3-year warranty and accurate color match. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is the most expensive tier, but it comes with a two-stage **paint** job where the base coat and clear coat are applied separately instead of the combination mix that is used for single-stage **paint**. Two-stage **paint** jobs will last a lot longer and tend to look nicer with a glossier finish. This package comes with “superb color match” (according to Maaco’s website) and a 5-year warranty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The prices at Maaco do vary from year to year and are always subject to change. But generally, the cheapest **paint** job that Maaco offers costs around about $300. This is the cheapest service that Maaco offers, and it is very unlikely that you will find a **paint** job cheaper than this. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   HOw much 'prep' is required. I need just a front bumper **paint**ed. I have it completely sanded down to the urethane, but do i have to prime it and wet sand it a few times, or should I just bring it to them 'raw'. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Getting a car re**paint**ed can be an expensive process. On average, a total car **paint** job can cost between $1,500 – $3,000, which is more than you may have spent on your car in the first place! Well, this is where Maaco comes in. Maaco is known for offering low-cost car **paint**ing services that are significantly more affordable than most options out there. But does the decreased price come with decreased service? And how much does Maaco charge to **paint** a car? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re looking to save money, keeping your original color is usually the less expensive choice. However, this decision is up to you. You can **paint** your car any color you want it to be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Here’s the thing, when I worked for dad, I worked six months to a year in every part of the shop,” he said. “I’ve been in the body shop before so I know how much work goes into even the prep before you **paint** the car.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Maaco locations offer over 45 different auto colors including Candy Apple Red, Deep Plum Pearl, Dark Blue, Silver Mist, Bright White, and Medium Gold. They also do a pretty good job of custom matching colors, though it should be noted that they use their own brand of **paint**. This means it will probably differ slightly from the original manufacturer’s color. Your best bet is to ask about color matching when you get your estimate and see if your local franchise is confident that they can either match the pre-existing color or apply a new color that will look the way you want. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The short answer is 10-15 years. The long answer is that **paint** durability on a vehicle varies based on the type of **paint**, the quality of the **paint**, and the final touches used by professionals. As a general rule, you want to get your car **paint**ed every five to ten years. If your vehicle is kept in a garage with limited UV damage, then you may be able to get your **paint** to last longer. Vehicles that spend most of their time outdoors in the sun may need new **paint** more often. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In most cases, urethane **paint** is used when you want a long-lasting **paint** job on your vehicle. You can also opt for acrylic enamel **paint** on your vehicle for long-lasting results. Water-based **paint**s are the sustainable option that is ideal if you want your car’s **paint** to be environmentally friendly. The acrylic lacquer **paint** is the thinnest option and does not last as long as other **paint** jobs; however, it is the lowest cost, and you can have a top coat added to make it last longer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Having your car re**paint**ed is an investment in many ways. Not only will you treat yourself to a vehicle with a like-new finish, you will add to its residual or resale value. By investing in re**paint**ing, you can get a higher trade-in value for an older vehicle. You can also raise your asking price when selling a used car directly to a buyer. But, for cars more than 10 years old, you should consider if the improved trade-in value will outweigh the price of re**paint**ing the car. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Not to mention the quality of the **paint**. Like the old saying goes, you can't polish a turd. Not to mention the quality of the **paint**. Like the old saying goes, you can't polish a turd. IP: Logged 11:10 PM - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you feel that you’re skilled enough to do the job at home, and keep in mind that this is a big if, you can get a similar result for much less money. Supplies can run anywhere from $100 to $1,500, depending on what you already have at home. Also, keep in mind that if you don’t have a well-ventilated area where dust and debris can’t get to your new **paint** job, it’s probably best to let a pro do the work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Would it be possible to wet sand at home, take the car to the shop and mask it off yourself before they **paint** it ? i was wondering how hard it woul be to take off the body panels yourself, wet sand them, then take them to Maaco to **paint**. The hardest pieces would be the roof / A pillar and rear roof / B pillar. ?Would it be possible to wet sand at home, take the car to the shop and mask it off yourself before they **paint** it ?

-   On 4/5/22 I arrived at the office to pick-up the vehicle with my wife and was handed a piece of paper and asked to sign it. I asked if we should go and inspect the vehicle first and he agreed and we walked out to inspect it together. Upon inspection I noticed numerous areas where the **paint** ran, numerous areas where **paint** appears to have "Globbed-up" especially bad around the roof antenna and damage on the front passenger fender and rear bumper that wasn't there before and had been **paint**ed over. I inquired about the damage and was offered no apology or explanation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many people don’t realize that vehicle **paint** shops may have to remove everything from the interior of the car during the **paint**ing process. This may include the dash, console, and even the seats. There is some risk that these items could be damaged by the **paint**ing process and so they’re removed beforehand. Additionally, some step in the process may be inhibited by the presence of these interior components. Removing them allows **paint**ing to be done the right way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of us have considered changing our vehicle’s color, but very few actually go through with it. That’s for a few reasons, mainly related to cost and time because changing a car’s color is a lot more involved than just **paint**ing in the same shade. Before changing your car’s color, here are some things to keep in mind: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you choose water-based **paint** or acrylic lacquer **paint**, then you can expect the **paint** to last around five years. You can increase the lifespan of the **paint** with a topcoat; however, exact durability is relatively low when compared to other options. If you choose urethane **paint**, then you will have the most long-lasting results and may hold off on new **paint** for more than five years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Prices for car **paint**ing depend on a few different factors – mainly prep work required, the number of parts and panels to be **paint**ed, and the quality of the **paint**ed used. When you request an estimate for a car **paint**ing, ask the auto repair shop to put the included surface prep measures in writing. You will want to assure that damage will be repaired or minimized before getting re**paint**ed and know exactly which parts will be **paint**ed. This may include fenders, the inside edge of the car door or under the hood. Be sure that the estimate also includes a final clear coat for a long-lasting **paint** job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A functional older vehicle can be transformed with a coat of fresh **paint**. Just make sure that it will be a valuable investment. If the car isn’t in good condition otherwise, re**paint**ing it may turn out to be more expensive than the car is worth on resale. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Member since Jan 2001 If I could know I was getting a **paint** job as good as yours, I'd take my Fiero to a Maaco next week. It's just too inconsistent from location to location. IP: Logged 11:52 PM - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To give you a simplified answer straight-up, Maaco will give you a decent **paint** job on your car for a couple hundred bucks. The actual cost and quality of the **paint** job depends on several factors, though. Here, we’ll take a closer look at how much Maaco charges to **paint** a car, what factors can affect that price, how long it usually takes to get a car **paint**ed, what colors they offer, and if the **paint** job is worth it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The differentiation between horizontal and vertical surfaces has to do with dust and other particles settling on the car. It’s nearly impossible to keep particles from interfering with a spray **paint** job on horizontal surfaces outside of a controlled environment. This is why you’d be better off taking your car to a body shop with access to a clean, well-ventilated room specifically for that purpose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, in most cases a Maaco **paint** job is worth it. While it is not the best type of **paint** job available on the market, when you consider the cost of a Maaco **paint** job then it is definitely worth the price that you are paying. But it is important to remember that Maaco is one of the more budget-friendly car **paint**ing options, and the value that you get is equivalent to the price that you pay. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After a while, that shiny new car you were so proud of starts to look dingy and faded. The **paint** has taken a beating over the years and all you’re left with is a car in a different color (or colors) than the one you started with. You could throw in the towel and just buy a new car, but those are the words of a quitter. Your other, much braver choice is to have the car **paint**ed by a pro, or yourself, to restore its former glory. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generally, **paint** jobs range between $3,000 and $10,000. In contrast, you can find a high-quality car wrap for somewhere between $2,500 and $5,000. Since a good **paint** job can cost more than double the cost of a professional vehicle wrap, many companies with fleets choose them over **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you get started, you’ll need two things above all else: time and space. Give yourself enough time to sand, repair, **paint**, and dry your vehicle. This is a crucial step that can save you big headaches with smeared or damaged **paint**. Space is vital, because unless you’re a machine (you’re probably not), **paint**ing a car will take time. You’ll need a safe space to store the car where the **paint** job can be done without damaging the **paint** or annoying your neighbors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On average, matte black **paint** jobs cost around $2,500. If you go for a higher-end option, you could even pay up to $6,000! To get a more exact quote, contact your local shop to learn more about their rates and services. While **paint** jobs can be expensive, you can always offset the price by saving in other areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   4.How Much Does A Maaco Paint Job Cost? - Quora A Maaco **paint** job can cost anywhere from $200 to $500, depending on the size of the car. Why is a MAACO **paint** job so cheap? Does Maaco do a good job **paint**ing cars? How much does it cost for Maaco to **paint** a truck? How do I prepare my car for a Maaco **paint** job? More results from www.quora.com - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When I do a full **paint** (which is rare for the last several years because most people don't want to pay what I charge for full **paint**) it is show quality. BUT I do recognize that the Maaco franchises provide a needed and beneficial service to the public. If you have an old car that runs good but looks bad and you can't justify $3,000 to $5,000 for a medium priced **paint** facelift then the car is a good candidate for a Maaco **paint**job. What has given places like Maaco a somewhat tarnished reputation is unrealistic expectations of people paying $250 to $500 for a **paint** job and expect to get a $10,000 show winning custom **paint**job with a life time guarantee. My experience is Maaco provides good value for the money spent, but don't expect a $10,000 custom **paint** job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The costs to **paint** a car vary depending on where the work is done, the size and complexity of the vehicle to be **paint**ed, and the quality of the **paint** job itself. In general, expect to pay anywhere from $300 to upwards of $10,000 for a professional **paint** job. The upper end of that price is where we find metal flake, multi-colored, and custom **paint** jobs, so unless you’re prepping your car for a show there’s really no need to spend that much. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you do go with them.. I would recommend spending more money for the higher-end services where the clearcoat is not integrated into the **paint**. Otherwise you can't wetsand the car and may have issues with waxing depending on the thickness of the **paint** (happened to me on one of the cars) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Known for their economical **paint** and bodywork, Maaco went in search of a team of **paint**ers from across the country who could design the perfect Christmas-themed **paint** job. Provided with blank hoods from LKQ, there were dozens of entries but it was the team of Monique Hayes, Mary Acly, and Roy Robles from Maaco in Burleson, TX, who took it to a whole new level with a holiday-themed hood design. The team’s unique holiday hood took top honors and it wasn’t lost on Petty that they used the iconic “Petty Blue” in their final masterpiece. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Instead, the price that you are given is solely based on them spraying **paint** on your vehicle with no work being done to prepare the car. This can result in many **paint** jobs not looking as good as you may expect for the cost you are paying. Maaco does offer services where preparation is completed on your vehicle, however, these are significantly more expensive than the basic packages they offer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For minor **paint** chip, scratch, and scrape repair, you’ll pay between $150 and $250 for all of the damage they can fix on your vehicle. Touch-up is great for small, shallow chips and scratches. Dent repairs will cost about $75 per panel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Keep in mind that there will be an extra cost if you have Maaco change the color of your car. This is because the old **paint** needs to be completely stripped away before the new can be added. This is a much more labor-intensive process than their usual approach of sanding down the pre-existing **paint** enough to create a firm bond with the new coat, but not enough to remove the old coat completely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you do not have obvious signs, you may assume that your vehicle does not need new **paint**. In some cases, you may be correct; however, if you notice any rusting, oxidation, or fading, then you need new **paint** on your vehicle. Even if the rust is a small spot and doesn’t seem important, it can grow quickly without proper maintenance and new **paint**. A **paint** job removes the old **paint**, rust, and oxidation before applying new primer and **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Member since May 2000 The Maaco here in town does some very good work but for the price they skimp on the prep work. If you can do the sanding yourself, then prime , wet sand and mask some critical areas and then bring it to them to be **paint**ed, you'll probably have decent looking **paint**. However, if you take you car there "in the raw" and rely on the poorly educated, unskilled, cheaply paid Mexican labor that most Maaco shops use to do the sanding, then expect your Fiero to look like sh*t IP: Logged 04:15 PM - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Here’s the deal, listen, when I think about Maaco, it’s when I have dented my fender, chipped the **paint** and need to go to Maaco and get my car **paint**ed,” Petty, who recently served as judge of Maaco’s ‘12 Days of Paint Jobs’ contest, told Kickin’ the Tires. “I don’t think about them **paint**ing custom cars but I do now.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My gut is that its all in the PREP. I'm guessing that you can get away with the cheapest enamel **paint** they have, if the surface is prepped right, while the best 2 part **paint** they have will look like crap without good prep. But since I've never done body work myself, I don't know what to ask for, so I'm turning to all the great Pennock Fiero experts. IP: Logged 12:24 PM - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have had 2 cars and one truck **paint**ed there using their Ambassador service. Each painjob cost me around $300-$400 after tax and I did the prep work myself. In two of the three cases it was a color change (black > silver and silver > charcoal) and the other was a cleanup job on my Trans Am. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Having your vehicle **paint**ed is an undertaking that can bring a lot of satisfaction. Not only will your car look like new, its exterior durability can be significantly enhanced. Choosing to have your vehicle re**paint**ed also requires an investment of money and time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first question you’ll need to answer is what type of damage your vehicle has. Below is a list of the most common types of **paint** damage. When you’re clear on what you’re dealing with, we’ll move on to how much it will cost to repair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Member since Jan 2007 I havnt had any personal experience with **maaco** but my dads friend has had his iroc **paint**ed there with the presidental. THe **paint** last about 3 years before it started to peel. I do know the people here are to cheap or lazy to **paint** the door jams so your kind of screwed unless you can do that yourself. ------------------ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you look at the services that Maaco offer, their quotes are significantly cheaper than the prices that you will get from other suppliers. This may seem too good to be true, and in a way it kind of is. The primary reason why Maaco **paint** cars so cheap is because the price that you are given does not take into account the cost of preparation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
