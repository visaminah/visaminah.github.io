## 17 Tips to Best Electric Heater 500 Square Feet | What Is The Best Electric Heater For A Large Room
-   Efficiency can be difficult to determine because an electric infrared **heater** technically has 100 percent efficiency, but it may actually cost more to operate than the best natural gas garage **heater**. This is due to the cost of electricity over natural gas or even propane. If you are looking for a **heater** that uses almost every watt of energy for heating, then an infrared **heater** can be the best option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best garage **heater** for a space can produce enough heat to be comfortable, without breaking the budget. Heat output for gas-powered **heater**s is measured in British thermal units (BTUs). Gas garage **heater**s typically range from 12,000 to 30,000 BTUs or more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Portable garage **heater**s can be placed anywhere in the garage. Fixed or mounted garage **heater**s should be installed in the coldest corner of the garage, directing the heat and airflow toward the center of the garage. Make sure that **heater**s are installed at least 24 inches away from the walls, and always check the manufacturer’s directions for use to make sure that you are installing the unit properly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **heater**s advertise the maximum square footage the unit can adequately heat with a standard 8-foot ceiling. If a garage has a higher ceiling, take that into consideration and pick a size up. Insulation will also affect the warmth factor in a garage. Even a high-capacity **heater** cannot prevent icy drafts from entering through poorly insulated doors and windows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best type of **heater** for the garage depends on your needs. Large garages benefit from a natural gas or propane **heater** because of the high heating capacity, allowing the **heater** to adequately warm the space. However, an electric garage **heater** is a safer alternative and the heating capacity is suitable for smaller garages. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   is more common with portable garage **heater**s, but even some wall-mounted **heater**s can have oscillating louvers (vents) that can change the direction of the airflow. This feature helps to properly distribute the heated air throughout the garage, with an almost 180-degree rotation. Remote controls offer the convenience of being able to control the **heater** from anywhere in the room, so there’s no need to get up and walk over to turn the heat off or to change the temperature setting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Radiant garage **heater**s feature highly polished reflectors that direct infrared heat outward for spot heating, or, in the case of large overhead units, heating an entire garage. Radiant **heater**s warm objects directly in front of them—think of sitting near a campfire—so you can start feeling toasty in a jiffy if one is pointing in your direction. Because radiant **heater**s offer steady warmth without blowing air, they are well suited to DIYers, particularly those who enjoy finishing wood. Radiant heat will not stir up the unwanted dust particles that can mar a woodworking project’s finish coat. Powered by natural gas, propane, or electricity, these units are available either mounted or portable and in a range of sizes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cool-touch exteriors are common with portable and wall-mounted garage **heater**s. The **heater** has a shell made of fiberglass or plastic, which are poor conductors for heat. The exterior of the **heater** stays cool, despite the heat produced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   are common with portable and wall-mounted garage **heater**s. The **heater** has a shell made of fiberglass or plastic, which are poor conductors for heat. The exterior of the **heater** stays cool, despite the heat produced. Overheating protection makes sure that the **heater** doesn’t burn out its own system. When the **heater** senses dangerous temperatures, it turns off to prevent external damage to the room and to stop internal damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Then, each **heater** was tested for output. We turned each **heater** on and let it warm up the garage, taking note of how long it took to warm up and reach the temperature. This is also the point at which we checked the additional features, such as humidifiers, thermostats, and timers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The installation of a garage **heater** can be very simple. Portable garage **heater**s only need to be positioned and provided with fuel or electricity to function. However, wall- and ceiling-mounted garage **heater**s are more difficult. While these **heater**s often come with the hardware required to install the **heater**, some products don’t have mounting brackets. If the **heater** doesn’t come with a mounting system, the manufacturer will typically provide instructions on how to properly install and mount the **heater**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes, a garage **heater** can be too big. If it is too big, the excess heat produced quickly makes the garage feel uncomfortable, forcing you to open the door to release some heat. If you have a smaller garage, consider using a portable **heater** to keep the space warm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We tested these garage **heater**s for installation, output, and safety features (to a degree). First, we removed each unit from the box and set them up according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Many didn’t require any setup, while others required installing legs, hanging brackets, and installing wiring. We took note of each, relative to the type of **heater**, as gas and 220-volt **heater**s are expected to be a little more involved. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It depends on the size of the garage. Typically a good estimate for electric **heater**s is that for every 10 watts of output, the **heater** can warm up approximately 1 square foot of space. This means that as long as the garage is 150 square feet or smaller, a 1,**500**-watt **heater** is more than adequate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Warm up your work space, garage, or business with the perfect space **heater**. You can fight winter’s chill with electric **heater**s in a range of styles and sizes, from under desk **heater**s to whole-room tower **heater**s with a remote control. Shop our selection to find space **heater**s, garage **heater**s and baseboard **heater**s to warm up every room of the house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   makes sure that the **heater** doesn’t burn out its own system. When the **heater** senses dangerous temperatures, it turns off to prevent external damage to the room and to stop internal damage. Automatic shut-off systems are similar to overheating protection in that the response is to shut down the **heater** to prevent damage. However, this system is typically triggered by the **heater** being knocked over, though there are some products that also shut down if the **heater** senses a short in the wiring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   allow the user to set a specific temperature using an electronic keypad or a remote, ensuring that the **heater** works to reach this temperature and then only activates to maintain the heat. Oscillation is more common with portable garage **heater**s, but even some wall-mounted **heater**s can have oscillating louvers (vents) that can change the direction of the airflow. This feature helps to properly distribute the heated air throughout the garage, with an almost 180-degree rotation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
