## 30 Things You Should Know About How To Make Shirts With A Heat Press | How To Print Your Own Shirts
-   Here is the good news: You can print more than just T-**shirts** with your **heat** press. In this article, we’ll review a few of the additional items we’d recommend trying out. Remember, any time you are using a new substrate, we recommend going through the testing process again to ensure you have the correct **heat** and pressure. You may also want to use different types of transfers for different substrates. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Who doesn’t love unique, custom-printed socks?! Socks are a fun way to make a fashion statement and express yourself, so it’s no wonder consumers are demanding special designs. Since socks are relatively small compared with items like T-**shirts** and hoodies, you can often fit multiple pairs at once on your press. This will help you crank out the volume when needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whatever mat and machine you are using, put your HTV glossy side down onto your mat so you will be cutting on the matte side (see image below). Remember, we are cutting on back side of the vinyl where the **heat**-sensitive adhesive is. This side will be more matte. The glossy side of the vinyl is the side with the clear plastic backing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Time to set your temperature that is required to **heat** press your garment. Scan over the instructions that are printed on the **heat** transfer vinyl to find the accurate temperature that's best (you might have to Google it if the instructions are not included – it is crucial to have the right settings. Different types of vinyl require different settings). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Graphic t-**shirts** are an expression of you. They are wearable art or statements.. They can be designed for the sheer fun of it, or even start your own custom design t-shirt business. It is a great way to put your graphic design software to good use — by designing artwork for a t-shirt **heat** press. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **heat** press machine for t-**shirts** works the way it sounds. It transfers a design onto a substrate (the underlying substance or layer). The t-shirt is slipped onto an electronically **heat**ed surface called the "platen." A transfer sheet with the design is positioned on the fabric. By closing the cover and applying some pressure, the ink, adhesive, or vinyl melts into the fabric. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **heat** press machine is very affordable to acquire and a device that can be operated with ease. These machines are available with various features that come in three basic sizes. Choose the equipment based on the nature of the printing you intend to do with it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But if you are wanting to make really unique **shirts**, then learning how to use and design in CDS is essential. Once you get used to it, it’s really pretty straight forward software. I have a five-part series on in-depth Cricut Design Space tutorials if you need additional help learning about it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, adjust your cut settings to work with the material you are using. This process will be a little bit different for every cutting machine, but just make sure to choose the settings for the particular type of **heat** transfer vinyl you are using (flocked HTV will have very different settings from smooth HTV, for instance). Working with my Silhouette, I selected Heat Transfer Material, Smooth from the Materials menu. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What Cricut vinyl should I use for **shirts**? Cricut iron-on vinyl is great to use for **shirts**. The iron-on Cricut supplies come in Patterned, Sportflex, Glitter, Foil, and Everyday varieties. What do I need to make t-**shirts** at home? Start with the basics to make t-**shirts** at home. You’ll need blank t-**shirts**, svg files, vinyl, a cutting machine, and a **heat** press. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   And to make things a bit more confusing different brands call the type of vinyl that adheres to materials with **heat** by different names. Cricut vinyl for **shirts** is called iron-on vinyl. Other companies call it **heat** transfer vinyl or HTV for short. So it is the same thing, just different brand names. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ink-based graphics are prepared by printing onto special transfer paper with an inkjet printer or a laser printer. It is just like printing on regular printer paper — it is that simple. Using a high-quality transfer paper ensures better **heat** press t-shirt quality. Place the t-shirt on the press, with the paper's transfer side down before you close the press. If you are concerned about the ink bleeding through, you can insert a piece of cardboard between the front and back of the t-shirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Have you ever tried using t shirt vinyl to create custom **shirts**? How did that go for you? I have never had luck using an iron with **heat** transfer vinyl. Never. The Cricut EasyPress has been a god send, it makes making custom **shirts** easy and fun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Graphic t-**shirts** are visually appealing and a great way to distinguish your individual personal tastes. The designs draw attention to what you "stand for" and deliver an important message. As an artist or graphic designer, they are ideal for showcasing your work. Using a t-shirt **heat** press, you can bring your artwork to life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   HTV has a clear plastic carrier sheet that covers the top of the vinyl, and the other side is where the **heat**-sensitive adhesive is (it is not sticky or tacky to the touch). You cut your design on the adhesive side, and then the clear plastic sheet on the other side holds your design in place until it is applied to your shirt or other surface. So, to make sure our design looks right when it is applied to the final surface, we need to first mirror or flip the design before cutting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pre**heat** the shirt itself before adding t shirt vinyl. This removes any moisture in the shirt and helps smooth out any wrinkles. This should only be done for a few seconds. Then just position your vinyl on the shirt with the carrier sheet up as shown below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The fabric you are printing on must be **heat**-compatible. Heat presses can reach 400 degrees Fahrenheit, so stay away from synthetics with a low melt point. Cotton, spandex, and polyester are suitable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Then all brands have different types of iron-on vinyl. Specialty iron-on vinyl includes patterned, glitter, holographic, sparkle, printable, mesh, flex, mosaic, and more. My recommendation would be to try at least two different brands and see which one you like working with the best when making custom t-**shirts**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Positioning the substrate and transfer: The t-shirt is placed onto the platen, and the **heat** transfer paper is set face-up on the appropriate location of the t-shirt. Pressing the product: Once in place, the handle is pulled down on the press to close it. Removing the film: When the timer goes off, the **heat** press is opened and the film is taken out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hoodies and jackets are easy add-ons to your T-shirt business. Printing these items, depending on the material, can be very similar to printing a T. One thing to keep in mind with printing thicker garments is that you need a **heat** press with proper clearance. If you are looking to print in higher volumes we recommend graduating to an automatic machine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first step in crafting with **heat** transfer vinyl is to prepare your design to cut in the cutting machine software you are using. (If you do not have an electronic cutting machine like a Silhouette or Cricut, you can cut **heat** transfer vinyl by hand. Check out this project I did completely cut by hand for more info on that.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The most practical way to produce your custom-designed t-**shirts** is to use a t-shirt **heat** press machine. Heat press equipment is great for sophisticated or complex artwork. For advanced designs, a shirt **heat** press is the way to go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Open the **heat** press by lifting the front handle of the machine. If you bought a clamshell machine, your upper platen will move upwards. If you bought a swing-away press, your upper platen will swing out to the side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you can see, my design is a little too large and the EasyPress will not cover it in one press. THAT IS OKAY! When it is done with the first press, it will beep. Then just move it over to the other portion of your design, press the button again, and repeat the **heat**ing. It is okay to overlap during this process and **heat** some areas for more time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I hope this post was helpful for you. If you have any questions on how to use **heat** transfer vinyl, go ahead and drop them in the comments below. 🙂 - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The emulsion-coated screen is then exposed to bright light to harden it, usually in an exposure unit. A screen must be made for each color and each location of the print. Check out the video below on how we burn screens for making t-**shirts**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can't just grab any t-shirt and expect to **heat** press on it. Do stay away from synthetic material as well as thin material as they can easily melt. The most popular types of fabric for t-shirt printing include cotton & polyester. But you can also use nylon, spandex and Lycra. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I like to do a little bit of time, and then check the design to see how it is going. More time under the iron is not necessarily better as too much **heat** can melt the vinyl or ruin the adhesive. It’s also good to be aware of holes on the bottom of your iron. If your iron has holes on the bottom, be sure to move it around as you press to make sure each part of the design is getting **heat** and pressure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How does a **heat** press work? The formula for applying **heat** transfer to a tee is temperature, time, and pressure. Ultimately the use and setup is pretty straightforward. The step-by-step guide below will teach you how to use a **heat** press machine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So you’ve got yourself a **heat** press, and you’ve figured out how much business you can generate by using transfers to decorate T-**shirts**. That’s fantastic! And some of you are happy to continue running your custom T-shirt business and generating income that way. Others might say, “OK, what’s next?” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
