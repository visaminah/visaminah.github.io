## 7 Reference List: Colours That Go With Teal And Mustard | Teal And Mustard Curtains
-   But lately, between buying this top, shooting this look and coming up with some fresh branding for My Style Vita, **mustard**, yellow/gold, whatever you want to call it, I am OBSESSED. I definitely lean more towards the **mustard**y gold version of yellow versus the bright sunny yellow. To me, it’s luxurious and also reminds me of brass which is a metal I am always drawn to. This hue goes with some of my other favorite colors too like navy and hunter green and also violet. It can also go traditional, boho or modern with ease. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There’s clearly a pattern you all have probably start to catch onto lately. It’s my love for **mustard**. It started a few years ago when my interior decorator brought over these **mustard** yellow pillows to round out my navy and white bedroom. I didn’t even consider the color. Ever since that day, it’s one I gravitate towards more and more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As far as your furniture is concerned, light-colored wooden furniture goes great with teal walls, and it will help to brighten up your room while still offering a modern look. In order to break up the dark walls, you could also add trinkets in white or silver for a splash of brightness. A fun color combination we enjoy for the living room is teal and **mustard**. While this is certainly a more daring duo, you can have neutral brown or gray walls and then add upholstery in these two colors to the room to finish it off. Even the most simple living rooms will look completely refreshed thanks to these two colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The final combination that is always an easy way to decorate is to go monochromatic. This is part of the reason why I love a great neutral sofa, it allows you to easily add color! When choosing monochromatic, you can totally pick all different shades and tones of a color. For **mustard**, you can go with golds, walnut, yellow and even some orange if you can get it right. This bathroom is entirely neutral with white beadboard and porcelain sink. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This combination was one of the more surprising ones that I stumbled onto for the home. But it totally works. Why? Because yellow and violet are total complementary colors! It also has a fresh spring feel to it with the muted colors. I love the touch of **mustard** in the pillow paired with muted lilac drapes and accent pieces. The brass curtain rod pulls it all together with the dark walnut wood of the furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next on the list is the bold and vibrant color combination, red and yellow. This complementary color combo is the embodiment of cheer. Reimagine this classic ketchup and **mustard** color pairing with a modern, pastel take by changing the tints from red to coral. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In stark contrast to the above-mentioned cotton candy colors are the rugged and earthy **mustard**, sage, and forest green. These three colors come together to form the ultimate earth-tone color palette. These colors are perfect for natural brands and suitable for logo design, web design, product design, and packaging. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
