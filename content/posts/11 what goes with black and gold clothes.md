-   If you’re wearing tights or stockings, make sure your tights or stockings are tucked into the hem of your skirt or dress. If you are wearing a **black** dress, you should choose a pair of **black** tights or stockings. However, if your outfit is darker than the shoes you’re wearing, choose nude tights or stockings instead; there is an exception to this rule. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "Right," says Conway. "But you're doing this very bad trick, which is projecting those patches on a white background.
