## 9 Things About Top Rated American Standard Toilet | American Standard Titan Toilet
-   Ultra-High Efficiency Toilets (UHETs) flush at rates as low as 1.0 gpf, without sacrificing performance. They are the ultimate in water-saving **toilet**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The traditional **toilet** bowl rim height is about 15-inches from the floor. The seat ring adds another ½ to 1-inch of height. Many people find a taller **toilet** bowl is more comfortable. American Standard offers Right Height **toilet**s with a rim height of 16-1/2 inches from the floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Toilet performance is graded with a MaP score, which represents the number of grams of waste that are eliminated from the bowl in a single flush. A **toilet** with a score of 1,000g – 600g is considered to have Great Flushing Performance and will remove up to 35 oz. of waste in a single flush. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   American Standard **toilet**s are fully tested to ensure superior quality and lasting performance. This includes actually flush testing each bowl at the plant before it is put into the box. Each component must comply with American Standard's industry-leading product durability **standard**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Different parts of the country have different water conservation issues. Use of a dual-flush, HET, or UHET **toilet** may qualify you for a rebate in your area. Not only will you save money, without sacrificing on performance, but you may even get paid to do it! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Cadet®3 Flushing System has a larger siphonic trapway (2-1/8" diameter) and a larger flush valve (3" diameter) for higher performance and fewer clogs. What's more, its easy-to-clean design makes it ideal for medium to high use bathrooms. A variant of this system is the LXP Flushing System, which has an industry **standard** 2" diameter siphonic trapway with a larger flush valve (3" diameter), which also offers higher performance with fewer clogs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Two-piece **toilet**s have a separate tank and bowl which are bolted together upon installation. All of the American Standard bowls have a “sanitary dam” – a raised chinaware pier at the back of the bowl – where the tank is bolted. The raised area ensures that offending materials can be cleaned off and will not accumulate and cause odors between the bowl and tank. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   High-Efficiency Toilets (HETs) flush at a rate of 1.28 gallons per flush, saving 20% more water than their 1.6 gpf counterparts. Flushing performance on our HETs is just as good as on our 1.6 gpf **toilet**s, making it an easy option to save water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   American Standard offers a wide range of **toilet**s with our unique EverClean® Surface. It is an ultra-smooth glaze with antimicrobial properties which is applied on top of the conventional glaze and fired into all glazed surfaces of the **toilet**. It gives the **toilet** a super smooth, mirror-like finish - which stays cleaner because the soil has a harder time clinging to it. The EverClean® surface also inhibits the growth of stain and odor-causing bacteria, mold, and mildew on the surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
