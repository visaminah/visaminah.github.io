## 155 Fun Facts What Is The Best Paint To Use On Aluminum Boat | 5 Best Paints for Aluminum Boats
-   It’s now time to **paint** the inside. The inside of the boat will get walked on, banged on and receive a beating from use. Choose a durable, exterior **paint**. It’s also a good idea to pick a neutral color like grey or tan that makes touch-ups easy. A textured **paint** helps hide imperfections and provides a slightly better non-slip surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can **paint** over your boat every year or every four years. The difference lies in the steps you took to **paint** over your ship. If you want the best results for your boat, follow the steps without skipping them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Today, you will find many **paint** options that can be used for an **aluminum** boat, the market offers a variety of materials from different manufacturers. But if you have decided to **paint** your boat on your own, it is always necessary to consult technical specialists. For any surface, it is vital to use high-quality and most appropriate **paint**s. We hope this review had widened your knowledge of the materials that are fine for **aluminum** boat finishing, and it will be easier for you now to make a choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The hardest part about refinishing an **aluminum** boat is having the right expectations. Our boat is intended for fishing not to display in an art museum. You are more than welcome to be a perfectionist but don’t expect to turn a rough looking derelict into a high-end bass boat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Keep in mind, you don’t have to **paint** the entire surface. If you like the look of the natural **aluminum**, you can leave it bare. Paint in Horizontal Strokes - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have a gallon of Dupont automotive zinc chromate primer that I have had for many years and it is still good can't remember when or why I got it. I just had to have a new **aluminum** 18 gallon gas tank made for my boat that fits under the floor and is subjected to getting wet (previous tank developed holes after 15 years, tank was never **paint**ed ) My question is should I **paint** the tank with the zinc chromate primer. My neighbor who welds says don't use zinc chromate as it will increase corrosion (I don't believe him) Any opinions out there - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This fast-drying primer is designed for metal, fiberglass, and wood boats. Its high-solid composition allows you to apply only one thin layer to get the boat ready for further **paint**ing. It sticks well even on top of the old **paint**, but you need to prepare the surface thoroughly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like my dad always said, "if you going to do something kid, do it right the first time, or don't do it at all!" And he's right. PATIENCE! This fish will always be biting. Happy **paint**ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After the inside **paint** dries, turn the boat upside down on a set of saw horses. You can place it on the ground but it’s easier to **paint** while standing. Also, make sure to lay down a drop cloth underneath. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now the fun part begins. The final stages of refinishing an **aluminum** boat includes making new bench seats and adding accessories. The more time you put into details, the better your end product will be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Never add a fresh coat of **paint** over an existing **paint** layer. The end result will look bumpy or worn and it will start peeling or chipping quickly. Removing the old **paint** will give you a fresh surface, which will make the new **paint** job look better and last longer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you buy a new **aluminum** boat these days, many have a baked-on enamel **paint** job that looks almost as slick as gel-coated fiberglass. But many older or less expensive **aluminum** rigs have a dull gray look that’s not very attractive. That’s because they oxidize on the exterior, as opposed to skipping right to the corrosion stage like many other metals. And while that’s certainly preferable, it’s not exactly appealing to the eye. You want to make that dull gray **aluminum** look better than it ever has before? Then it’s time to prepare for a **paint** job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also get rid of old **paint** with a **paint** stripper. All you have to do is coat the **paint** stripper over the surface of the boat with a **paint**brush then cover it in plastic to keep it from drying. It’s a good idea to work in small sections so the stripper doesn’t start to dry before you have a chance to lay the plastic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Q. I just got a 14 ft **aluminum** Jon boat and I want to **paint** it but I need to know where to find some **aluminum** oxide primer. got any suggestions? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Preparation is the number one step you cannot miss if you want to re**paint** your boat. You need to clean the surface to ensure there is no dirt or unwanted debris on the boat. Dirt or dust can cause the **paint** to peel in a matter of days. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The last step in this process is curing. Curing is the process of letting the **paint** harden. Until the **paint** is fully bonded to the **aluminum** surface of the boat, it is yet to cure. (source) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wet Edge is a great topside **paint** that can be used over the entire hull of a fiberglass Jon boat. It gives a glossy and clean finish to a well-prepared vessel. The **paint** offers an abrasive resistant surface and its formula makes it flexible enough to hold any flexing, expansion and contraction of the hull. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Either of the above mentioned **paint**s would be a good choice if you want to cut your **paint**ing labor in half as there is no need to apply any primer to the boat. These **paint**s, although marketed as topside **paint**s, can be used below the waterline of the boat as well. The one **paint** will do the entire boat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This fast-drying **paint** is an ideal solution for renovating an **aluminum** boat. The **paint** is environmentally-friendly as it does not contain chromates. It will work well both above and below the boat waterline. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light stains probably won’t affect the color of the **paint**. For darker or larger stains, though, try mixing 50% warm water with 50% distilled vinegar. Spread the solution over the stain, let it sit for a minute or two, and wipe it away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Follow up post from earlier tonight. This is on the Lowe boats website under the **aluminum** fishing boats section. This is where I learned what to use on my **aluminum** boat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One of the most important things is to keep an eye on, is the **paint**. As soon as you start to see fading, cracking and peeling, it’s time to re-**paint** the boat before it looks too terrible. Nobody wants to be seen in a hunk of junk… well I don’t anyway! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Prepare yourself, your **paint** area and your boat for **paint**ing. Clean the boat before **paint**ing it. Make any necessary repairs. Apply the primer if using one. Once the primer has dried apply the correct **paint** for your specific Jon boat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you use a good, self-etching primer, you should be able to pick almost any type of **paint** you want. That said, there are a few things you should consider before choosing the **paint**. Ingredients - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After that dries, you can **paint** it with whatever you like.I have done 4 boats this way...they turned out great! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting your boat isn’t just about colors. A fresh coat of **paint** can also give your boat an extra layer of protection against the elements (and some of the creatures underwater). We’ve put together this guide to help you learn how to **paint** an **aluminum** boat and give you a few tips that’ll help your **paint** job last as long as possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are some very good generic **paint**s on the market many of which have anti-corrosive and antifouling formulas. Marine Ablative boat bottom **paint** offers antifouling elements that effectively act as protection against weeds, algae and slime. This **paint** is versatile as it can be applied on **aluminum**, wood and fiberglass Jon boats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All of that said, there’s nothing special about applying primer to an **aluminum** surface. Prior to application you’ll want to tape off the area(s) of the boat as applicable. The primer itself can be sprayed, brushed, or rolled on. After application a second coat may be recommended, but again, the specifics of multiple coats, dry times, and sanding between coats will vary from product to product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting a boat is somewhat different from **paint**ing other products. It is a very responsible and important task. The fact is that the boat is constantly working in specific conditions. Therefore, the coating must be both stable and durable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting an **aluminum** boat seems simple enough. Yet, after a quick Google search, it became apparent that helpful information is hard to find. After reading enough conflicting advice and watching some poorly filmed Youtube videos, we soon realized that we’d be figuring this out on our own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What we’re looking for here is a shiny silver uncontaminated surface, to get the best possible **paint** adhesion. After sanding is complete, it’s helpful to wash down the **aluminum** boat with a pressure washer. Then, give it an old-fashioned scrub-down with a coarse-bristle brush and soapy water. Finally, rinse the boat down to remove all the soap and everything else left behind. After it’s been thoroughly washed down, allow the boat to dry completely before moving on to the next step. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You may have noticed that your **aluminum** boat isn’t looking as sharp as it used to. Fortunately, a little **paint** job will do just the trick and help turn things around. So how do you do **paint** over an **aluminum** boat? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In Ft.Lauderdale, a private tug named Hero still operates for over 30 years without any **paint**. She is all **aluminum** with an air-cooled diesel and no thru-hulls. Her entire hull covering exists of a wax coating on the inside and outside. Zero problems and no maintenance after the initial coat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Large vessels cannot be finished with only one type of **paint**. One **paint** goes above the waterline, and the other is applied below the waterline. But as a rule, the **aluminum** boat can be finished with one **paint** as its size is not big. The choice of **paint**s is quite large, therefore, it is recommended to study in detail the properties of the **paint**, and it is necessary to follow safety precautions when carrying out general work. You can use the following types of coating: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’ve got some extra bucks to spare, buy a can of **paint** thinner. When mixed with the primer, it will mask the small scratches I mentioned earlier. While this isn’t very important for the exterior, the interior **aluminum** boat **paint** will look significantly better with no cracks and scratches on the surface. Ok, go ahead and spray or **paint** the primer on the interior. The layer should be thin and even. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Aluminum boat **paint** jobs come out best when you use a primer that’s formulated specifically for use with **aluminum**. The primer will not only help the **paint** adhere to the boat, but will also provide an extra barrier layer that helps prevent corrosion or oxidation. Note: because oxidation begins shortly after bare **aluminum** is exposed to the air, you’ll want to apply the primer as soon as possible after the **aluminum** has been cleaned and dried. Many manufacturers recommend you do so just an hour after the boat has dried. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many wooden Jon boats have been made as a DIY project. You can actually build a wooden Jon boat by following our simple 15 step process. However, after constructing a wooden boat, you are likely to be faced by a question of what **paint** you should use to give the boat a better finish and greater protection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This oil-based **paint** is good for many surfaces including metal. It is not affected by severe weather conditions and UV light. It works well for all types of boats if you do not store them in the salty water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can choose any color for your boat. The most popular color is green, but if you want to get more creative or use your favorite shades, don’t hold back. Customizing the color will make the **paint**ing process much more enjoyable and you’ll have more fun riding your boat, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For this purpose, you can find all shades of **paint**. But this procedure requires a lot of effort. Paints do not stick well to any material. Therefore, you can fail the task without special knowledge and skills. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Warning: Never apply a coprous **paint** (any bottom **paint** including copper as the anti-fouling agent) to an **aluminum** boat. Any anti-fouling **paint** applied to an **aluminum** boat should be marked **aluminum**-safe, or it can set up a galvanic bath that will literally eat your boat alive, by causing the metal to corrode away. There are several types of anti-fouling **paint**s that can be used on **aluminum** hulls without any problems – but check and check a second time, to be sure the **paint** you apply is safe for use on **aluminum** boats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is also the time to decide if you want to use **aluminum** polish with a polishing wheel to achieve a mirror-like finish. This was a step we skipped due to the added time and cost. Wet sanding with 400 grit provided a sufficiently attractive sheen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After sanding, it’s time to clean your boat. Start by blasting debris away with a high-pressure hose, and then apply boat soap and begin washing each area. This will be quite time-consuming, but it’s absolutely essential for a high-quality **paint** job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Q. Good advise. How did you apply the oxide primer? Wagner Sprayer [affil. link to info/product on Amazon]? I am a novice at this, so be real basic please. Thanks! I just bought an **aluminum** jon boat that needs a good **paint** job to bring some life to it... - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Work in manageable sections along the boat. Avoid letting the gel dry out. Once you thoroughly coat a section of **paint**, place large pieces of plastic directly over the gel. You can either cut a plastic drop cloth or use plastic bags. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ed. note: Apologies, Nathan! Please see the entry of May 15, 2007. You are looking for a primer designed for use on **aluminum** oxide surfaces, not a primer based on **aluminum** oxide chemistry In other words, a zinc phosphate primer for amateurs and (possibly) a zinc chromate primer for professionals. Sorry for the confusion! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A. Hi, Blaine. This acid wash probably contained hydrofluoric acid. You'll see the same stuff used in some commercial truck washes for **aluminum** tankers. Hydrofluoric acid is really dangerous stuff -- leave it to somebody else! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **paint** is produced using copper-free technology. It can be used for all types of metal, fiberglass, and wood. Its most attractive quality is the ability to keep your boat clean from buildups of debris on the bottom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Aluminum boats get used and abused. At some point, it’s time to breathe new life into a boat with a fresh coat of **paint**. Not everyone gets a shiny new fishing boat and if you’re like us, you may have recently acquired a well-used **aluminum** boat that has seen better days. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Okay: now your freshly-**paint**ed **aluminum** boat looks great on the outside. If the interior and other pieces-parts now look shabby in comparison, learn how to give things like vinyl, rubber, and plastic a face-lift, too. You’ll find some great tips on how to do so in Preparing Your Used Boat for Sale, whether you plan to sell that boat or not – and you probably won’t want to part with it, now that your **aluminum** boat has a completely new look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   offers a corrosion-resistant and non-reflective finish to the boat. This **paint** is great if you are looking to improve the boat’s discreet appearance especially for hunting or fishing activities, due to its available camo color options (see our camo **paint**ing guide here). This **paint** can be directly applied as a complete coat or can be used as primer. Aluma Hawk by Sea Hawk is also a corrosion-inhibiting coating that can be applied straightforward to your Jon boat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Q. What is the fastest and easiest method to remove a water line from an **aluminum** boat hull? I have a new boat and recently put it into a lake for four days. When pulled it already had a "scum line" that I would like to remove as easily and quickly as possible. What are product choices that are effective for removal of the line? I would then like to coat the hull with some type of product/protectant that will keep scum lines from reoccurring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Priming involves the use of a primer. You can procure a primer in the same place you bought the **paint**. Sometimes, they’ll come as a set, depending on the **paint** brand. Priming sets the scene for the **paint** and makes it easier for the **paint** to lay on the boat’s surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are many difficult ways to accomplish simple tasks. That’s why we spent so much time figuring out an easy way to **paint** an **aluminum** boat. Hopefully, you find as much success as we did with your **aluminum** boat **paint**ing project! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hi, read a number of postings re. **paint**ing alu boats. with ref to the costs being high to **paint** , just wondered if you have considered using bitumen on the outside under the waterline ? We use it on boats which are on drying moorings and /or get beached. Not the prettiest finish but self heals on scratches and deadens sound a little. Only needs 1 coat and sticks to anything so lessens prep time; doesn't need etched alu. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My 91 year-old dad and I just restored, except surface finishing, a 1960 18 1/2 foot Crestliner. It was designed with visible wood strips connecting the deck to the sides of the boat (looks very distinctive). I would like to finish it without **paint** - only the **aluminum** and wood showing. I think I understand, from reading this letter thread, how to clean the **aluminum**, but how should I, or should I, treat the **aluminum** skin? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting over your **aluminum** boat is possible, though, and numerous boat owners have done it with incredible success. Today’s process is a culmination of experiences filled with failures and successes. According to multiple experts in the marine industry, this process is the correct way. (source) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How long does the curing process take? The curing process could take 7-30 days, depending on the **paint** you used. It would help if you **paint**ed over your boat during the off-season to give it time to cure before taking it out. (source) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting over an **aluminum** boat isn’t difficult if you follow the correct steps. The **paint**ing process will leave your boat with a **paint** coat that will last you at least a year or more. It would be in your best interest not to skip over the steps in an attempt to hasten the process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Clean your boat from dirt, oil, peeling **paint**, and fouling below the waterline. Do not forget to repair areas with damages if necessary. Corrosion somewhere on the vessel will force you to postpone **paint**ing until the repair is complete. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spray **paint** (rattle cans) simplified the process and cut the costs. The result was a reasonably smooth application for about $80 of **paint** for the inside and outside of the boat. It would be even cheaper if you’re only **paint**ing the outside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Perhaps you should consider soda blasting your aluminium boats to clean,strip and prepare for **paint**ing. Works great. and is fast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I also had my doubts about applying **paint** to the boat with a brush or roller without leaving unsightly brush marks. A smooth **paint** job with liquid **paint** would require a spray gun and air compressor. That adds significant costs and complexity to the project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When **paint**ing the **aluminum** boat’s hull, be very thorough. And remember: if you only apply one coat, it won’t look very good. An extra layer will make wonders happen, though! In some cases, a third coat will also be required (if the boat is really old). Oh, and I want you to give the seams the attention they deserve. The reason: most folks forget how important it is to **paint** the seams, even though they usually chip very quickly and make the boat look rather bad. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Easy maintenance. The **aluminum** boat doesn’t really need any special care. You will only have to periodically inspect it for damage and clean the bottom from build-ups if you regularly use the boat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Inevitably, the **paint** on your boat (despite the type of boat) will lighten, and your boat will require a re**paint**. If you’re in that situation where your **aluminum** boat is in dire need of a re**paint**, you’re in the right place. Here’s what you need to know to give your boat the ultimate fix-up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some **paint**s in the market work on multiple surfaces, such as fiberglass, wood, and **aluminum**. You can try these brands. There’s no harm in it, but it would help if you turned to **paint** suited for **aluminum** boats. Hopefully, you can utilize the list shared above. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just like **paint**ing fiberglass or wood, **paint**ing an **aluminum** boat begins with sanding away old **paint** and oxidation until you’re left with clean, shiny metal. This usually requires 80 or 100 grit sandpaper, which will leave behind some scuff marks. Don’t worry – this is a good thing. The tiny scratches and scuffs will help the primer and **paint** adhere to the metal. In fact, an **aluminum** surface needs to be etched so the **paint** has something to hold on to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rustoleum Protective Enamel and Krylon Color Maxx are readily available **paint**s that work well. Both have excellent spray nozzles for smooth application. We tested each brand and found that Rustoleum Enamel tends to cause an orange peel texture more readily. That was just our experience and your’s may differ. Automotive spray **paint**s are another option but we did not test them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remove old **paint**. When working on major repairs of a metal boat, first completely remove the old coating using a synthetic cord-brush or an old **paint** remover. It is better to clean the surface gradually, covering small areas with a cloth soaked in a solution and tightly covering the top with polyethylene. When scraping off old **paint**, be careful not to damage the protective layer of the metal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We’ve decided to share our trials of **paint**ing an **aluminum** boat with you. Hopefully, our experience will make your boat project easier. We share our chosen materials and lessons learned in this step by step guide with pictures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As wooden boats deserve extra attention and more maintenance work, it is important to choose a **paint** that has antifouling elements. This type of marine boat bottom antifouling **paint** is a water-based coating designed for wooden and fiberglass boats. The formula used in this **paint** can be effective in repelling most type of growths below the waterline. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The film thickness can be measured with a relatively cheap DFT meter. This tool gives you a great way to check the quality of your **paint** job. If it finds areas that are thinner than recommended you can add more **paint** to these areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once that’s out of the way, we’ll apply a coat of primer to get everything set up. Last, but not least, you’ll learn how to **paint** the **aluminum** boat to make it look brand-new. So, join me in this detailed, user-friendly guide, and let’s get to it! Follow me closely, and you’ll be done with the **paint**ing in no time! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My 1968 Duracraft 19.5' **aluminum** boat has been **paint**ed by a previous owner using Ford automotive **paint**. Although the **paint** is not peeling, cracked, or chipping I would like to change the color. My question is, do I have to strip it down to bare metal or can I just sand, prime, and re**paint** over the existing **paint**? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Q. I have a question about spot priming to repair and re**paint** an **aluminum** boat. Boat previously **paint**ed with one part polyurethane marine **paint**. Holding up very well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A. If you want to **paint** an **aluminum** boat you first have to use a **aluminum** oxide primer. Make sure the boat is totally clean before priming (lightly sand the boat) then use a tack cloth [affil. link to info/product on Amazon] and rub the boat down. Then prime it with the **aluminum** oxide primer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Generic **paint**s that can be used on any fabrication materials have their advantages. These **paint**s commonly consist of an anti-corrosion formula. Generic **paint**s tend to be advertised as an all-around coating that can act as a primer and finisher at the same time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Modern boats are made from a variety of materials. It is plywood, wood, and plastic. But most often manufacturers choose **aluminum** to construct a boat. Such a boat has less fuel consumption, can develop good speed, does not require special conditions for winter storage, and is easy for transportation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A Jon boat’s can benefit more from using a topside **paint** on the entire hull of the boat due to its cheaper cost. In addition, the need for antifouling **paint** is usually only required for larger boats that get extensive saltwater exposure. Since Jon boats are mainly used in inland waterways, an antifouling **paint** is not really necessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you apply the **paint** to your boat, make sure you read the instructions so you know how many layers you’ll need, how long it will take to dry, etc. Then make sure you follow these tips. Think About the Design - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Buy yourself their **aluminum** boat primer in the quart size - $15.99 (should be salmon red color) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I am the proud owner of a 12 ft V-Hull **aluminum** boat. Great little boat but in dire need of being spruced up. My problem is that I would like to **paint** and I'm not sure what steps I need to follow nor which products I should use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Q. I am getting ready to **paint** my 12 ft **aluminum** boat and I understand that I need to use a Self-Etching Primer [affil. link to info/product on Amazon] but my question is do I need to get all of the old **paint** off or just get off what I can and use the primer over the bare metal as well as the sanded down old **paint**. Sanding all of the **paint** off is a hell of a job. Any suggestions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A. To **paint** Aluminum is labor intensive. The environmental effects of zinc chromate (**aluminum** primer) is deadly to the human body. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ed. note: See the entry of May 15, 2007, Billy. You are looking for a primer designed for **aluminum** oxide surfaces, i.e., **aluminum** boats, not a primer based on **aluminum** oxide chemistry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   3. Buy yourself any of their number of beautiful "Duck Boat Paints" They come in marsh green, dead grass green, hunter green, sand tan, etc. You can find these online by search "duck boat **paint**." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do your best to use horizontal brush strokes over the entire boat. This will keep the **paint** job even and give it a smooth finish. Add Another Coat (Or Two) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After sanding is complete, wash the boat to wash away any dust. If any oil or grease is left, it will mean the **paint** won’t stick properly to the **aluminum** and will create small little spots on your surface called fish eyes. Make sure you wipe the entire hull down in a well-ventilated area and use rubber gloves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With the **paint**ing done the boat was left to dry over night. Once you are happy with how it looks, slowly peel off the tape and admire your handy work. Good **paint**ers tape leaves clean lines as you can see below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After removing the **paint**, thoroughly wash the boat from the acid and paraffin that are usually available in the **paint** remover. Wash the boat 2-3 times using the appropriate cleanser. Even a small handful of dust can cause big trouble while **paint**ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When the surface is primed and ready, it’s time to **paint** the **aluminum**. This is actually the easy part –it’s really no different than **paint**ing any other surface. Almost all **paint**s will recommend at least two coats, however, and often (but not always) with a light sanding between them. In most cases you’ll want to use both a roller (for longer, broader surfaces) and brushes (for tougher areas with lots of angles, like chines and transoms). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My dad works on a drilling rig, and the company lets him use some **paint** if he buys it from them. I was wondering if you could use it. the **paint** is called safety yellow and looks pretty cool on my **aluminum** boat (I just dabbed it on a small place). please help I'm in the 10th grade and bought the boat that had chipping **paint** from my uncle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's always best if possible to strip the old **paint** off if possible. Use a good stripper, an automotive **paint** store, not shop, carries some nice choices, or, like I did. A wire wheel that attaches to a drill. If you have many coats, the main focus is to remove anything that is loose. New **paint** won't stay on over areas that are not already bonded and your **paint** job will only be as good as the bond it is adhered to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A. Self etching primer must be OK. You can test it on piece of **aluminum** scrap. Hope it helps and good luck! Goran Budija - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rust-Oleum’s Antifouling **paint** also gives the boat’s bottom better protection due to its antifouling elements. As mentioned previously, this coating is specifically designed to prevent damage to areas that are below the waterline of the vessel but it can be used all over the boat. However, you may want to use this **paint** only on the bottom of the Jon and use a cheaper topside **paint** for the rest of the boat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Citristrip is worth its weight in gold but it can only do so much. On some areas of the boat we re-coated stubborn **paint** with a second layer of stripping gel. For difficult to reach areas and seams, a wire wheel on an electric drill was the fastest solution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I recommend whenever **paint**ing an old boat, that if you know the **paint** types and there are no conflicts, that you sand the hull prior to **paint**ing. This way any loose **paint** will flake off and you will know for sure. Whenever I **paint** a boat, I like to ensure that I’m working with a fresh surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To **paint** a metal boat, you need to follow a certain technology. Only then the **paint** will last a long time. Correctly chosen **paint** will create a protective oxide film on top of the **aluminum** product. Therefore, this cover will perform both a protective and decorative function. In this review, we will discuss the 5 best finish options for **aluminum** boats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After applying primer, you will begin **paint**ing your vessel. Take it one section at a time. If you’re using rollers or brushes, make sure to keep using even, unidirectional strokes to ensure a good finish, and avoid overloading the rollers or brushes – this can lead to drips. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next up is the step we’ve all been waiting for: **paint**ing. Painting your **aluminum** boat requires you to use special **paint** manufactured solely for **paint**ing boats. In the case of **aluminum** boats, here are some boat **paint**s you should check out: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The overall cost depends greatly on the materials and tools you already have. It also depends on the **paint** you choose. We went with spray **paint** cans for convenience, ease of use and the low cost. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Handy Hint: Spend a lot of time doing this part. The more of the old **paint** you can remove the better as the best result is achieved if the surface is bare **aluminum**. Areas that are not completely cleaned will result in **paint** peeling after **paint**ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   PS - This stuff isn't gonna resist every scratch or bump or rock you might run into, but it cures hard, holds up nice and flat for a good long while. And what's best? It's dirt cheap. I **paint**ed a 14 ft Jon boat inside and out with a quart of the primer, quart of green **paint**, and quart of their no slip rubber boat deck **paint**. Total cost was 50 dollars for all 3 cans. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   type in "marine **paint** specialist" they will have any materials needed for the **paint** and preparation.**paint** on "any" surface can be treated using the right preparation method, therefore allowing you to **paint** over an existing finish. In regards to using an automotive **paint** after you have applied the correct primer"I WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE USING MARINE PAINT" as this is designed for that purpose, it may be more expensive, but it will be a lot more durable than a standard automotive **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The special due-biocide formula will allow you to protect your boat from fouling for the whole season. And at the same time, the **paint** will not bring any harm to the ecosystem. It will also protect the vessel from corrosion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are plenty of **aluminum** boat specific **paint**s on the market like Aluma Hawk, Total Boat and Duralux Marine **paint**. We did not like the limited color choices and the cost of these **paint**s. A single gallon of **paint** costs about $40 to $80. It adds up fast with a primer and two or more colors of **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tape off any **aluminum** that you don’t want **paint**ed with a high quality **paint**ers tape like Frog Tape. We taped off the entire gunwale and **paint**ed everything else on the inside of the boat. Tape off any other parts as needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most hardware stores sell wire wheels for a few bucks and one will last the duration of the project. Just be aware that using it aggressively on **aluminum** can cause minor pitting. Use just enough pressure to remove the **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This **paint** will look great on any boat, but it does not have enough properties the underwater part needs. Though its winning feature is that you may apply one thin layer of primer to achieve the desired effect. It also dries fast enough. The main idea to avoid thick coating as it will not dry properly. If you still see some drawbacks after drying, you can remove them with careful sanding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Traditionally, the **paint** you use on your Jon boat will be dependent on the type of fabrication material it is constructed of. Nowadays, **paint** manufacturers have developed versatile generic **paint**s that can be used on most types of boats though the **paint**s used for specific construction materials have some major advantages over generic **paint**s. Paints that have antifouling, anti-corrosion, and anti-abrasion elements are the most recommended **paint**s for specific types of Jon boats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A. You want to remove any non-adherent **paint** (because it does no good for your fresh **paint** to stick to non-adherent **paint**), and you want to scuff the surface of the remaining **paint**, Christopher. But there is little benefit in sanding away adherent factory **paint**. (Readers please note that this advise is for the owner of a 12-foot **aluminum** boat, not for a boat manufacturer). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I'm 17 a senior in high school and I recently purchased a boat in need of new **paint**. Guys have been saying that I need to clean the hull after sanding/stripping with a household cleaner or dewaxing solvent to make sure the **paint** adheres. I was wondering if it is important that all of the cleaner/dewaxing solvent is washed or wiped off before the primer goes on. thanks - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For areas of the boat that you want to stay polished **aluminum**, wet sand with fine grit paper or sanding sponges. Start with 220 grit and work your way up to the desired level of polish. Sand in one direction. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I learnt how to **paint** an **aluminum** boat over 20 years ago with my late father. I am going now show you my straight forward process to doing so which has served me well multiple times. Just don’t miss any steps as you will end up wasting a lot of time, money and energy if you skip things. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I think Marshall was suggesting that you need to use a primer designed for use on **aluminum** oxide surfaces (whether that be zinc chromate, zinc phosphate, or otherwise). While some readers understood that, other readers misread this to mean a primer based upon **aluminum** oxide chemistry -- and unfortunately the error went uncorrected. Sorry. We thank you for the clarification and recommendation, Michael! But the reason the site and this thread have survived so long is that we don't print flames. Smug posts lead to flaming posts, so they're best avoided as well :-) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In my earlier post, existing **paint** is best removed if possible but if it is in good condition, then break down the top gloss by lightly sanding. Also, you can use the Galv-alum **aluminum** primer instead of the Zinc Chromate primer. I don't have a heat oven so the sun did just fine, and then of course as Lowe boats say themselves, a coat of high grade polyurethane enamel **paint**. There it is straight from one of the leading horse's mouth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A topside **paint** is applied on the upper waterline of a boat to protect the hull from corrosion and exposure damage. A below waterline **paint** is applied to the bottom of the boat to prevent the build-up of micro-organisms that can harm the vessel. A below waterline **paint** is usually advertised as having an antifouling formula. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your post is much appreciated, Travis, but the idea that all West Marine employees are idiots while Cabela's employees are wizards is ridiculous, and the kind of thing that starts a race to the bottom. I suspect there was a communication problem where you use your boat only in fresh water, or your boat is small enough that you always pull it out, and that wasn't clear to them. In that case the anti-fouling **paint** they may have recommended is an extravagance. However, if a boat ever stays in salt water overnight, anti-fouling **paint** is absolutely required; it is not an option. Without it, it will become totally covered in very hard to remove barnacles in just a few days. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At this point, it becomes impossible to make blanket statements about the application of the primer and **paint**, because different types of products have different requirements. And you need to know this prior to applying the primer, because some primers should be **paint**ed over just an hour or two after application. Others need up to 48 hours to cure. Some should be sanded before the **paint** goes on, and others should not be sanded. The bottom line: you’ll need to read the instructions and follow them for each individual product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have a 40' **aluminum** cruiser boat that was stripped to bare **aluminum** about ten years ago, at the time it had epoxy **paint** on it. now its time to re**paint** it and I would like to know what is the best way to prep it and and if epoxy is the best way to go. thanks - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If there is one step you should not skip, it’s this one. Paint stripper saved us so much time and made removing the old **paint** so much easier. After several recommendations, we found that Citristrip stripping gel was an affordable and powerful product for removing old **paint** from **aluminum**. It also doesn’t produce noxious fumes. As the name implies, it smells nicely like oranges. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We use Aluma-wash then Alumiprep 33 [affil. link to info/product on Amazon] before the primer is applied. Awl-Grip is the preferred color **paint** involving a two part process that is expensive. All Aluminum starts corroding (rusting) once it hits the air while some have anodizing applied but if scratched or welded the erosion continues. Our boats range from 40 to 200 feet and few **paint** jobs last more than ten years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can **paint** an **aluminum** boat yourself by first sanding it down, using a mix of soap and water to then clean it up. You will then need to apply a primer before either **paint**ing with a roller, brush, or by spraying. You finish the **paint** job off with a clear coat of protectant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you grab your favorite can of **paint** and get to work, it’s very important to prep it. Otherwise, the end result will be average at best, and the new **paint** will come off in a year or two. The first step is “parking” the boat. Ideally, find a smooth, even spot outdoors and cover it with some paper to absorb all the stains. A couple of layers of that paper will do (or, use plastic instead). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In our case, color was the deciding factor since not all brands have the same color palette. From our research, most quality exterior spray **paint**s provide equally good protection for a fishing boat with standard use. It all depends on what the intended use is. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This latex **aluminum** primer is designed primarily for metal surfaces. Its main and foremost task is to stop rust appearance and spread on the metal surfaces. This cover can be applied over any finish, but be careful when using it over the epoxied **paint**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The plastic prevents the gel from drying out which allows it to penetrate through every layer of **paint** to bare **aluminum**. Paint the gel in small sections and cover with plastic until the entire area of the boat is complete. The longer you let it sit, the better it works. Wait at least 2 to 4 hours before scraping. However, don’t wait too long to scrape as it’s easier when the gel is still wet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The goal was simple. Turn an ugly, neglected, **aluminum** boat into a nice looking fishing boat that will last for many years. Most importantly, we wanted to accomplish the task easily and without spending a fortune. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you had an older layer of **paint** on your vessel, choose an 80-grit sandpaper. You can sand by hand, but for larger vessels we highly recommend an electric sander. After you have sanded off the old **paint**, you can switch to a 40-grit sandpaper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   TextNext, lift the boat a bit. In my experience, sawhorses will be great for this. Plus, make sure there’s enough space around the boat for you to **paint** it from all four sides. You will need some equipment and tools, of course, but it won’t cost you a pretty penny. When **paint**ing an **aluminum** boat, get the following stuff: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Q. I have a old V hull **aluminum** boat that I want to refinish with my son, I have all the old **paint** off and am ready to do all the patching that will be needed to make the hull water tight. What is the best product to seal the hull? Glass.......or what. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1 gallon of the **paint** is enough for processing of 500 square feet. For the best results, it is recommended to apply 2 coats of the product to your boat, and do not forget to allow each layer to dry out for 24 hours. The manufacturer specifies the antifouling property will be effective for a year, but the users say that it will be fine for a few years if a boat is used in freshwater. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We thank Marshall for this information -- but please note that he is suggesting a primer designed for **aluminum** oxide (oxidized **aluminum**) surfaces -- not a primer comprised of **aluminum** oxide. You will see the confusion running through this thread until the entry for May 15, 2007 which clarifies what James is speaking of. Sorry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Q. I was fishing in Oregon last year near the Pacific Ocean where I met a mobile boat cleaning service. The owner sprayed a chemical compound on my **aluminum** boat, brushed it and washed it off leaving the boat looking like new. What type of compounds would he have used? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These main benefits made boats made of **aluminum** very popular. This versatile material will not need much of your attention. Aluminum alloy is not afraid of constant contact with water. But in order to extend the service life of boats, you need to further protect them from corrosion. And **paint** can help you a lot with this task. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We live in Phoenix Az. and want to go boating during hot summer months.We cannot touch the interior so we want to **paint** the interior white. This boat has never been in the water and is brand new. what kind of **paint** and where I can purchase the **paint**? Thank You. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You’ll need to start by spraying on a layer of primer. Don’t skip this step. Otherwise, the **paint** will have a hard time “gripping” the **aluminum**, and it will peel or chip off much sooner than expected. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Applying a clear coat after you **paint** the **aluminum** will go a long way in protecting the **paint** and adding a glossy shine. It prevents damage from UV rays, corrosion, staining, and numerous other problems. Many clear coats can be sprayed on, and some should be applied with a brush; in those cases, foam brushes often work better than bristle brushes. Again, multiple coats are usually recommended and we’d always suggest following the manufacturer’s specific instructions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An easy way to reach every surface while **paint**ing the interior of your **aluminum** boat is to lean it on its side. Use a fence or side of a garage to support it. Find someone to help stand it up so you don’t get hurt or drop the boat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Q. I'm currently building an **aluminum** boat and I would like to **paint** this boat once it is complete. I've talked to a few different people about the method used to **paint** **aluminum** but I don't quite know what the correct method would be for **paint**ing **aluminum**? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Be warned though, it takes some practice to apply this **paint**. Use slow even coats to protect against drips and get the **paint**’s texture reaction to occur. Apply 2 or 3 coats and wait about 30 minutes between coats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let’s face it: no matter how big and spacious your boat is, if the **paint** isn’t nice and fresh, that boat isn’t going to look like much. That’s why today, we’ll learn how to properly **paint** a boat with an **aluminum** surface. First, we’ll prep the “sea vessel”. Next, we’ll get rid of the old **paint** and all the dirt along with it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Needs spot repair. After sanding and necessary prep, is Rustoleum self etch primer adequate for bare **aluminum**? Is it compatible with sanded and scuffed surrounding existing polyurethane **paint**. Can it be sprayed over existing **paint**? Does self-etching primer need a top coat before re**paint**ing? Boat to be re**paint**ed afterward with one part marine polyurethane. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   TotalBoat Aluminum Boat Paint offers a corrosion-resistant and non-reflective finish to the boat. This **paint** is great if you are looking to improve the boat’s discreet appearance especially for hunting or fishing activities, due to its available camo color options (see our camo **paint**ing guide here). This **paint** can be directly applied as a complete coat or can be used as primer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The primer works perfectly for all types of metals and is especially good for **aluminum** boats. You will have to roll it on or use a brush as it is a bit too thick for a sprayer. But some users managed to thin it out with water and still apply it by spraying. Make sure you remove all the debris from the surface and sand the metal well to allow the **paint** to grip better. This primer will effectively prolong the service life of your **aluminum** boat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your boat spends a lot of time in the water, so it’s getting a lot of direct sunlight as well as reflections of the sun’s rays. UV rays can be harmful to your boat, especially the **paint**, so finding a **paint** with added UV protection will help it last longer. Color - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hi. I want to **paint** the inside of my 16 foot Aluminum boat. I know about the Aluminum Oxide Primer and the tack cloth. Now I can't find the Scuff coat gray **paint** (or non skid Paint) to **paint** over the primer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To start, find a dry location where you can work on the boat without fighting the weather. Most of the work can be done in a garage. Because of temperature requirements for **paint**ing with rattle cans (50° – 90°), we recommend you avoid starting in winter. Nothing puts a damper on a **paint**ing project like waiting for temperatures to warm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you decide to re**paint** your boat, you must know what **paint** was originally used for it. Old and new **paint**s must be compatible. It is easy to find out if you carry the following experiment: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   4. Take a wire wheel and a drill and clean up any patch work, burrs, chipping and cracking **paint**. Go over it with some of that synthetic steel wool stuff (coarse, the kind that's not actually steel) Go over it with a light sandpaper. You do not have to knock it down to bare metal, just get it nice and coarse. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Naturally, some safety precautions are in order when you sand **aluminum**, which can release oxide dust into the air. Safety goggles are a must, as well as a dust mask or respirator. You should also wear gloves and clothing which can be washed immediately after you complete the sanding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Q. Can anybody help with information re process and materials to be utilized in **paint**ing and protecting of new aluminium 5.6 m recreational vessel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should still spend some time sanding the surface. This will get rid of any rust or other debris it’s picked up while in the water. However, without the **paint**, this step will be a lot faster and easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   5052 H-34 marine **aluminum** and are first hand sanded to create a proper base. The hull is then cleaned and acid etched, coated with a zinc chromate primer and baked at 250°. Following a coat of high grade polyurethane enamel, the hull is again baked at 250°. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
