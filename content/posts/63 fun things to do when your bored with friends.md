-   This is a **fun** game to play to help with your child’s sensory development. Just like the name suggests, you take turns closing your eyes for this game. Brush a mystery object on your child’s hand and let them describe how the object feels and then guess what it might be. Try a feather, piece of fruit, or book. This game makes children use their sense of touch in place of vision relying on sensory integration skills to do so. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   1. Check up on an Old Friend: Most times, our excuse for not checking up on old friends is that we do not have the time.

They would appreciate the visit or call, and catching up on old times would help you forget your **bored**om. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   30. Sing karaoke. Traditional karaoke is **fun** enough, but if you’re looking for a good laugh, try Cowboy Karaoke.

-   48. Start a garden club. One of the best parts about a garden club is that you can make it whatever you want it to be. Want to share gardening tips with friends? Go for it! Just craving some gossip-time with friends instead? A garden club is perfect for that, too. Get some friends on board, send out a **fun** paper (or virtual) invitation, and you’ve got time set aside for working on that green thumb. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Candle-making is fairly simple. You can buy essential supplies in most craft stores, and there are lots of online tutorials to help you get started. Have **fun** customizing your candles with dried flowers, essential oils, and dyes. ProFlowers has a step-by-step guide for beginners. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Set a timer for 5 minutes and sketch each others’ portraits. They don’t have to be realistic drawings. Caricatures and cartoons are **fun** too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Who says scavenger hunts are just an outdoor activity? You can set up a scavenger hunt indoors by placing clues around the house and having your little one look for household products for the next clue (they can be simple objects, such as a toilet paper roll, a paper plate, a blue sock, etc.). Once they have found everything on the hunt, there can be a **fun** game or prize at the end; possibly some ice cream, or a **fun** craft to make. And hey, if the clouds part, then turn it into a nature scavenger hunt! There are many developmental benefits of outdoor activities for kids and playing in nature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While the days of quarantine may feel long behind us, I still remember dying to spend time with friends. And sure, I’ve gotten back into the swing of things when it comes to socializing, but just “hanging out” doesn’t seem to cut it anymore. So if you’re tempted to scroll your social media or resort to the same old coffee shop/water hole that you frequent, keep reading. To help inspire my own creative hangouts, I put together this list of things to do with friends when **bored**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The doldrums hit us all eventually. When you've run through all the best movies on Netflix, you find yourself pacing between the fridge and the couch and the walls start to feel a little closer together than they've ever been before, you know the dreaded **bored**om monster has come knocking. But don't worry — you're not alone! Boredom comes for us all eventually, and it can feel impossible to find creative ways to entertain yourself once you've gotten into that rut. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Make a list of things to find in the local area. For example, if you live in a large town, your list could include “a napkin from a restaurant,” “a squirrel in a tree,” “a **fun**ny sign”, “a convertible car,” “a statue,” and “a piece of jewelry worth over $1,000.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let your child invent an imaginary pet. It can be a pet they wish they had or it doesn’t even have to be a real animal. Sometimes the mythical, made-up animals are more **fun**. Does it have the body of an eagle and the tusks of an elephant? Can it fly? Can it swim, but only in pools? Have your child come up with a name and story for their creature. Your child can draw pictures to tell the story of how their creature came to be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Find karaoke tracks on Spotify or YouTube and sing along. It doesn’t matter if you can’t sing very well. Just have **fun**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Buy some cheap colored chalks and create some original artwork on your driveway. Have **fun** working together on a huge drawing. At the end of the day, simply wash it away with a hose or pressure washer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Start a costume bin in your house. Fill it with your clothes from past decades, old Halloween costumes, and goofy finds from thrift stores. Whenever your little one is looking for something **fun** to do, pull out the costume bin and let them step into character! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Instead of sitting around on your phone getting lost in the news and social media (ahem, doomscrolling), pivot to some **fun** things you can do at home or in your own backyard. We’ve rounded up the best things to when you’re **bored**, many of which require little to no money or extra materials. From board games and self-care to getting into gardening (or indoor houseplants!) and organizing or optimizing your space, these unique activities will keep your brain stimulated and your body busy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   End your weekend with a blast while bringing up your childhood memories. Plan a trip to an amusement park to take some adventurous, **fun** rides. Indulge in spicy, finger-licking street food like hotdogs and noodles, and end your day with a chocolaty dessert or an ice cream. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   16. Try a new recipe. Because trial and error is more **fun** to laugh at with a friend. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let the **fun** never end with a **fun**-filled pajama party. Call your friends and bounce at someone’s place for a slumber party.

Such parties are an excellent platform to strengthen your friendship and give it a new turn by sharing secrets and discussing peppy things. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   But the thing about eating at the buzziest restaurant in town and jetting off to a tropical destination for a bachelorette trip is that it gets kinda costly—and fast. One night at the bar everyone’s talking about can easily set you back a nice chunk of change (and maybe you're looking for **fun** things to do with friends at home anyway). When you need to be budget-conscious because you’re saving up for something big or you’re just trying to stack some cash, it often feels like you have very limited affordable options for bonding with your friends. Are all the **fun** activities really this expensive?! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One creative parent told us she made a “**bored**om” jar for her house. She cuts scraps of paper and writes a different activity for kids on each one. Each scrap contains suggestions like: “make paper boats”; “make friendship bracelets”, “play a ball toss game”, and other crafts and activities. Whenever her kids say they’re **bored**, instead of watching TV, she lets them choose three papers from the **bored**om jar and they can choose an activity to complete.
