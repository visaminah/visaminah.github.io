This time, we're going to talk about Paint To Use On Aluminum Boat. There is a lot of information about Aluminum Boat Primer on the internet, of course. Social media are getting better and better quickly, which makes it easier for us to learn new things.

How to Paint an Aluminum Boat Yourself: Jon Boat Painting Tips and Duralux Aluminum Boat Paint are also linked to information about what paint to use on aluminum boat hull. As for other things that need to be looked up, they are about How to Paint an Aluminum Boat and have something to do with Bottom Paint For Aluminum Boats In Saltwater.

## 119 Fun Facts Paint To Use On Aluminum Boat | Best Spray Paint For Aluminum Boat
-   A fresh layer of **paint** will help protect the exterior of your boat— but this is not the only way to protect it. Another component of caring for your boat is having boat insurance. Find out if you need boat insurance before you put your boat in the water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   TextNext, lift the boat a bit. In my experience, sawhorses will be great for this. Plus, make sure there’s enough space around the boat for you to **paint** it from all four sides. You will need some equipment and tools, of course, but it won’t cost you a pretty penny. When **paint**ing an **aluminum** boat, get the following stuff: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Painting your boat isn’t just about colors. A fresh coat of **paint** can also give your boat an extra layer of protection against the elements (and some of the creatures underwater). We’ve put together this guide to help you learn how to **paint** an **aluminum** boat and give you a few tips that’ll help your **paint** job last as long as possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once **paint**ing is finished, apply a clear protective coat. This layer helps keep the **paint** intact and prevents scratches. Check the product label to determine how long this coat may need to cure before you put the boat in the water again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Carefully follow the instructions provided by the **paint** manufacturer when removing an existing anti-fouling coat. Never dry-sand old anti-fouling **paint**, as the **paint** dust is toxic. It is also important to collect all **paint** waste afterwards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We thank Marshall for this information -- but please note that he is suggesting a primer designed for **aluminum** oxide (oxidized **aluminum**) surfaces -- not a primer comprised of **aluminum** oxide. You will see the confusion running through this thread until the entry for May 15, 2007 which clarifies what James is speaking of. Sorry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Applying a clear coat after you **paint** the **aluminum** will go a long way in protecting the **paint** and adding a glossy shine. It prevents damage from UV rays, corrosion, staining, and numerous other problems. Many clear coats can be sprayed on, and some should be applied with a brush; in those cases, foam brushes often work better than bristle brushes. Again, multiple coats are usually recommended and we’d always suggest following the manufacturer’s specific instructions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Okay: now your freshly-**paint**ed **aluminum** boat looks great on the outside. If the interior and other pieces-parts now look shabby in comparison, learn how to give things like vinyl, rubber, and plastic a face-lift, too. You’ll find some great tips on how to do so in Preparing Your Used Boat for Sale, whether you plan to sell that boat or not – and you probably won’t want to part with it, now that your **aluminum** boat has a completely new look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After that dries, you can **paint** it with whatever you like.I have done 4 boats this way...they turned out great! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A few days later, we took her for a spin and dragged her up and down some sandy shores and the **paint** held up perfectly! But boats see a lot of wear and tear, getting dragged up on rocks and trailers and, as one neighbour put it, “trading **paint** with other boats.” That's why my all-turquoise **paint** job is perfect: I can easily touch up any chips or dents without worrying about overspray. In the end, I needed approximately 12 cans of primer and 18 cans of lacquer, but this is partly because it's super windy where I live (on Lake Superior). The number of cans you need will also depend on how big your boat is! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My 91 year-old dad and I just restored, except surface finishing, a 1960 18 1/2 foot Crestliner. It was designed with visible wood strips connecting the deck to the sides of the boat (looks very distinctive). I would like to finish it without **paint** - only the **aluminum** and wood showing. I think I understand, from reading this letter thread, how to clean the **aluminum**, but how should I, or should I, treat the **aluminum** skin? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In coastal areas, anti-fouling **paint** can be used to prevent the hull from becoming covered by marine bio. Fouling on the hull significantly increases fuel consumption. An alternative to using anti-fouling **paint** is to mechanically clean the hull during the boating season. Barnacle larvae, which can be hard to remove after the boating season, are easy to remove soon after they attach themselves to the hull in late July and early August. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When **paint**ing the **aluminum** boat’s hull, be very thorough. And remember: if you only apply one coat, it won’t look very good. An extra layer will make wonders happen, though! In some cases, a third coat will also be required (if the boat is really old). Oh, and I want you to give the seams the attention they deserve. The reason: most folks forget how important it is to **paint** the seams, even though they usually chip very quickly and make the boat look rather bad. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All of that said, there’s nothing special about applying primer to an **aluminum** surface. Prior to application you’ll want to tape off the area(s) of the boat as applicable. The primer itself can be sprayed, brushed, or rolled on. After application a second coat may be recommended, but again, the specifics of multiple coats, dry times, and sanding between coats will vary from product to product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Try to start this project when the weather forecast says there will be a few days of rain-free weather. Pick a work area that’s outside and away from cars and buildings. Put a piece of plastic down to catch dripping **paint**. Elevate the boat so you have access to all areas of the hull. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I'm 17 a senior in high school and I recently purchased a boat in need of new **paint**. Guys have been saying that I need to clean the hull after sanding/stripping with a household cleaner or dewaxing solvent to make sure the **paint** adheres. I was wondering if it is important that all of the cleaner/dewaxing solvent is washed or wiped off before the primer goes on. thanks - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’ve got some extra bucks to spare, buy a can of **paint** thinner. When mixed with the primer, it will mask the small scratches I mentioned earlier. While this isn’t very important for the exterior, the interior **aluminum** boat **paint** will look significantly better with no cracks and scratches on the surface. Ok, go ahead and spray or **paint** the primer on the interior. The layer should be thin and even. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To make it easy to prep and apply **paint**, elevate your boat for better access. If your boat is trailered, the TotalBoat Trailer-Mounted Boat Lift lets you raise your boat off the trailer by yourself for **paint**ing and maintenance. It’s adjustable to accommodate a wide range of boat sizes and shapes. If your boat has any leaking rivets, cracks, or seams, use our 2-part epoxy adhesive sealer to make quick repairs before **paint**ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At this point, it becomes impossible to make blanket statements about the application of the primer and **paint**, because different types of products have different requirements. And you need to know this prior to applying the primer, because some primers should be **paint**ed over just an hour or two after application. Others need up to 48 hours to cure. Some should be sanded before the **paint** goes on, and others should not be sanded. The bottom line: you’ll need to read the instructions and follow them for each individual product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We use Aluma-wash then Alumiprep 33 [affil. link to info/product on Amazon] before the primer is applied. Awl-Grip is the preferred color **paint** involving a two part process that is expensive. All Aluminum starts corroding (rusting) once it hits the air while some have anodizing applied but if scratched or welded the erosion continues. Our boats range from 40 to 200 feet and few **paint** jobs last more than ten years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Light stains probably won’t affect the color of the **paint**. For darker or larger stains, though, try mixing 50% warm water with 50% distilled vinegar. Spread the solution over the stain, let it sit for a minute or two, and wipe it away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of the commercial products are just naoh with a brand. The primer can be top coated in half an hour, so the boat exterior can be completely **paint**ed in a single sunny day. The process is similar to **paint**ing any other type of boat, but there are a few things to keep in mind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After sanding is complete, wash the boat to wash away any dust. If any oil or grease is left, it will mean the **paint** won’t stick properly to the **aluminum** and will create small little spots on your surface called fish eyes. Make sure you wipe the entire hull down in a well-ventilated area and use rubber gloves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To start, rub or **paint** the polish on the boat. You can choose to do this by hand or with a power buffer. Polishing by hand can be rewarding, but it’s labor-intensive and can be more time-consuming. A power buffer can get the job done efficiently and quickly. However, you still may need to hand-buff nooks and crannies. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With TotalBoat Aluminum Boat Paint, you can start **paint**ing sooner and finish faster because it bonds strongly to properly prepared substrates without requiring etching or priming. It also dries extremely fast, so you can recoat without sanding in just 1 hour (@ 72°F). Apply 2-3 coats, wait 12 hours, sand before the final coat. That’s it. This low-odor, eco-friendly solution is also easy to clean up with soap and water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also get rid of old **paint** with a **paint** stripper. All you have to do is coat the **paint** stripper over the surface of the boat with a **paint**brush then cover it in plastic to keep it from drying. It’s a good idea to work in small sections so the stripper doesn’t start to dry before you have a chance to lay the plastic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have a gallon of Dupont automotive zinc chromate primer that I have had for many years and it is still good can't remember when or why I got it. I just had to have a new **aluminum** 18 gallon gas tank made for my boat that fits under the floor and is subjected to getting wet (previous tank developed holes after 15 years, tank was never **paint**ed ) My question is should I **paint** the tank with the zinc chromate primer. My neighbor who welds says don't use zinc chromate as it will increase corrosion (I don't believe him) Any opinions out there - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Can I **paint** my **aluminum** boat with Rustoleum? This Old Boat Lake - image credit : www.lakeontariounited.com - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Aluminum Boat Paint can be applied by brush, roller, or spray equipment. We recommend applying thebetween 50-90°F when weather and conditions will not affect the **paint** finish or proper drying. Prior to the final coat, wait at least 12 hours after applying, sand lightly with 320-grit sandpaper to remove any imperfections, and remove any sanding residue before applying the final coat. For more information, refer to our step-by-step instructions here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   What we’re looking for here is a shiny silver uncontaminated surface, to get the best possible **paint** adhesion. After sanding is complete, it’s helpful to wash down the **aluminum** boat with a pressure washer. Then, give it an old-fashioned scrub-down with a coarse-bristle brush and soapy water. Finally, rinse the boat down to remove all the soap and everything else left behind. After it’s been thoroughly washed down, allow the boat to dry completely before moving on to the next step. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes. A large spray tip works best. This **paint** may be thinned up to 20% with water for spray application. A large foam roller also yields a finish similar to spraying. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hi, read a number of postings re. **paint**ing alu boats. with ref to the costs being high to **paint** , just wondered if you have considered using bitumen on the outside under the waterline ? We use it on boats which are on drying moorings and /or get beached. Not the prettiest finish but self heals on scratches and deadens sound a little. Only needs 1 coat and sticks to anything so lessens prep time; doesn't need etched alu. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Q. I'm currently building an **aluminum** boat and I would like to **paint** this boat once it is complete. I've talked to a few different people about the method used to **paint** **aluminum** but I don't quite know what the correct method would be for **paint**ing **aluminum**? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ed. note: Apologies, Nathan! Please see the entry of May 15, 2007. You are looking for a primer designed for use on **aluminum** oxide surfaces, not a primer based on **aluminum** oxide chemistry In other words, a zinc phosphate primer for amateurs and (possibly) a zinc chromate primer for professionals. Sorry for the confusion! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   type in "marine **paint** specialist" they will have any materials needed for the **paint** and preparation.**paint** on "any" surface can be treated using the right preparation method, therefore allowing you to **paint** over an existing finish. In regards to using an automotive **paint** after you have applied the correct primer"I WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE USING MARINE PAINT" as this is designed for that purpose, it may be more expensive, but it will be a lot more durable than a standard automotive **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here's something to think about: latex **paint**s last for 10 years or more in rain, snow and sunlight. The simple explanation is that the water base makes it easy for you to spread the colored chemicals -- the **paint**'s tint -- onto the surface of your boat. When the water evaporates as the **paint** dries, the molecules of the tint have bonded chemically to the primer you applied. Latex **paint**s offer the same simplicity of application to the **aluminum**-boat owner as they do the home owner since you can apply them by brush or roller or, if thinned properly with water, by spraying them onto an **aluminum** boat with an airless sprayer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Left to the elements, **aluminum** boats form a tough oxide film that resists corrosion—but that protection isn’t pretty. Some duck hunters and anglers see oxidation as a thing of beauty, but if you’re wanting to ditch that dull, dusty, gritty, gray look in favor of an attractive, non-reflective finish, apply a few coats of TotalBoat Aluminum Boat Paint. Fast-drying formula does not require priming, and provides a smooth finish that doesn’t just look good, it helps reduce drag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Q. I have a question about spot priming to repair and re**paint** an **aluminum** boat. Boat previously **paint**ed with one part polyurethane marine **paint**. Holding up very well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can **paint** an **aluminum** boat yourself by first sanding it down, using a mix of soap and water to then clean it up. You will then need to apply a primer before either **paint**ing with a roller, brush, or by spraying. You finish the **paint** job off with a clear coat of protectant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Steel should be sanded or ground to bare, shiny metal. For best results, sand the surface with 220-grit sandpaper, and remove all sanding residue. Wipe the surface clean with denatured alcohol or acetone using a clean, lint-free, cotton rag. Allow the surface to dry completely before **paint**ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should still spend some time sanding the surface. This will get rid of any rust or other debris it’s picked up while in the water. However, without the **paint**, this step will be a lot faster and easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For anglers, in case it matters to the fish—or at least you think it might—you can **paint** the bottom of your boat in fish-friendly colors like White, Light Gray, or Black, so they’ll think you’re nothing more than a harmless cloud drifting overhead. For duck hunters, it’s easy to **paint** a custom camo pattern using any combination of Khaki, Earth Brown, Flat Dark Earth, Olive Green and Army Green with stencils you create yourself or buy online. For maximum concealment, choose stencil patterns that mimic the foliage in your lake, creek mouth, or ocean setting. Just prep the boat as directed, then apply **paint** for one camo layer at a time. It’s also great for blinds, trailers, and other things you might want to hide with a non-reflective finish that blends into natural settings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   PS - This stuff isn't gonna resist every scratch or bump or rock you might run into, but it cures hard, holds up nice and flat for a good long while. And what's best? It's dirt cheap. I **paint**ed a 14 ft Jon boat inside and out with a quart of the primer, quart of green **paint**, and quart of their no slip rubber boat deck **paint**. Total cost was 50 dollars for all 3 cans. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before **paint**ing, remove rust, dirt, chipping **paint** and old wax or polish. Depending on the amount of rust present, you may need a power sander to create a smooth surface. Once you’ve removed rust, clean the boat by following the cleaning steps above. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   5052 H-34 marine **aluminum** and are first hand sanded to create a proper base. The hull is then cleaned and acid etched, coated with a zinc chromate primer and baked at 250°. Following a coat of high grade polyurethane enamel, the hull is again baked at 250°. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you finish spraying, let the boat cure a few days before carefully flipping it over on its trailer. Use a shop vac to remove all of the debris that had settled inside (like leaves and sand). The inside needed a lot of scrubbing and some sanding also, to remove loose **paint**. I vacuumed, sanded with my drill attachment, and washed it in one afternoon. I didn't use a pressure washer for the inside, because a pressure washer can push too much water into wood (and my seats are wood), delaying dry time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A. You want to remove any non-adherent **paint** (because it does no good for your fresh **paint** to stick to non-adherent **paint**), and you want to scuff the surface of the remaining **paint**, Christopher. But there is little benefit in sanding away adherent factory **paint**. (Readers please note that this advise is for the owner of a 12-foot **aluminum** boat, not for a boat manufacturer). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We live in Phoenix Az. and want to go boating during hot summer months.We cannot touch the interior so we want to **paint** the interior white. This boat has never been in the water and is brand new. what kind of **paint** and where I can purchase the **paint**? Thank You. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Handy Hint: Spend a lot of time doing this part. The more of the old **paint** you can remove the better as the best result is achieved if the surface is bare **aluminum**. Areas that are not completely cleaned will result in **paint** peeling after **paint**ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Follow up post from earlier tonight. This is on the Lowe boats website under the **aluminum** fishing boats section. This is where I learned what to use on my **aluminum** boat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have an **aluminum** bateau that I have thought about **paint**ing for a few years and I finally made up my mind to do it. The only problem is that the boat is a kind of bright green color, not the olive drab that most bateaus are. I don't really know what I need to do in order to **paint** it, such as priming the hull, and things like that. I was hoping that someone might be able to give me some guidance on what I need to do to **paint** the hull camoflauge, and what to do with the bright green color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   4. Take a wire wheel and a drill and clean up any patch work, burrs, chipping and cracking **paint**. Go over it with some of that synthetic steel wool stuff (coarse, the kind that's not actually steel) Go over it with a light sandpaper. You do not have to knock it down to bare metal, just get it nice and coarse. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can choose any color for your boat. The most popular color is green, but if you want to get more creative or use your favorite shades, don’t hold back. Customizing the color will make the **paint**ing process much more enjoyable and you’ll have more fun riding your boat, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Apply a self-etching, oil-based primer that sticks to **aluminum** surfaces[vi]. Using a brush or a sprayer, apply a thin layer of primer inside the boat. Let it dry and then **paint** the outside. Let the primer dry overnight, or at least 12 hours, before moving on to the **paint**ing process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Obviously the first step here will be to remove the old faded and/or flaking **paint** from the aluminium surface. Dodgy **paint** can’t be **paint**ed over or the end result will not be up to scratch. A chemical **paint** stripper could be used to soften up the **paint**, then scraped away with a scraper. This is a slow and tedious process though, not to mention a smelly one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because aluminium is affected by the elements so rapidly, the preparation and the application of a primer should be done in the one session. A 2 pack primer is best. Once you’ve got that surface clean and shiny, it will be ruined if left too long before sealing with the primer. Once dry, the primer can be sanded and the boat finished of with the spray **paint**ing application of a 2 pack top coat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After your boat’s surface has been cleaned and polished it is ready to be **paint**ed. Plan for this project to take a few days. Here’s how to **paint** an **aluminum** boat[v]: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When the surface is primed and ready, it’s time to **paint** the **aluminum**. This is actually the easy part –it’s really no different than **paint**ing any other surface. Almost all **paint**s will recommend at least two coats, however, and often (but not always) with a light sanding between them. In most cases you’ll want to use both a roller (for longer, broader surfaces) and brushes (for tougher areas with lots of angles, like chines and transoms). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s formulated for use inside and out on **aluminum** duck boats, jon boats, bass boats, pontoon boats, fishing boats, and canoes. It can also be used on masts, booms, and spreaders. This **paint** will also work on steel, fiberglass, and wood, with proper surface preparation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Buy yourself their **aluminum** boat primer in the quart size - $15.99 (should be salmon red color) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   My dad works on a drilling rig, and the company lets him use some **paint** if he buys it from them. I was wondering if you could use it. the **paint** is called safety yellow and looks pretty cool on my **aluminum** boat (I just dabbed it on a small place). please help I'm in the 10th grade and bought the boat that had chipping **paint** from my uncle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I am the proud owner of a 12 ft V-Hull **aluminum** boat. Great little boat but in dire need of being spruced up. My problem is that I would like to **paint** and I'm not sure what steps I need to follow nor which products I should use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have a 40' **aluminum** cruiser boat that was stripped to bare **aluminum** about ten years ago, at the time it had epoxy **paint** on it. now its time to re**paint** it and I would like to know what is the best way to prep it and and if epoxy is the best way to go. thanks - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To prepare the area around you, you’ll want to lay some paper or plastic down on the ground of your work area. If there are items that could be damaged by the **paint**, remove them from your surroundings as well or cover them completely. If you are inside, open the windows and use an electric fan to provide you with ventilation. Always be sure to use the proper respirator when working with **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Warning: Never apply a coprous **paint** (any bottom **paint** including copper as the anti-fouling agent) to an **aluminum** boat. Any anti-fouling **paint** applied to an **aluminum** boat should be marked **aluminum**-safe, or it can set up a galvanic bath that will literally eat your boat alive, by causing the metal to corrode away. There are several types of anti-fouling **paint**s that can be used on **aluminum** hulls without any problems – but check and check a second time, to be sure the **paint** you apply is safe for use on **aluminum** boats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Aluminum fishing boats and pontoon boats provide an affordable, fun way to explore the water. Records show 118,433 **aluminum** boats were registered in 2017 alone, and sales of **aluminum** boats have grown steadily since 2015, according to boating-industry publication “Trade Only Today.”[i] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Old **paint** can also be removed by sandblasting, using fine-grade abrasive media. Remove all oil and grease from the surface before sandblasting using a cleaning agent such as acetone. Exercise care when sandblasting the sides of the boat and make sure that the aluminium does not stretch. Complete the cleaning by rinsing the hull with fresh water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your post is much appreciated, Travis, but the idea that all West Marine employees are idiots while Cabela's employees are wizards is ridiculous, and the kind of thing that starts a race to the bottom. I suspect there was a communication problem where you use your boat only in fresh water, or your boat is small enough that you always pull it out, and that wasn't clear to them. In that case the anti-fouling **paint** they may have recommended is an extravagance. However, if a boat ever stays in salt water overnight, anti-fouling **paint** is absolutely required; it is not an option. Without it, it will become totally covered in very hard to remove barnacles in just a few days. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A. Hi, Blaine. This acid wash probably contained hydrofluoric acid. You'll see the same stuff used in some commercial truck washes for **aluminum** tankers. Hydrofluoric acid is really dangerous stuff -- leave it to somebody else! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you apply the **paint** to your boat, make sure you read the instructions so you know how many layers you’ll need, how long it will take to dry, etc. Then make sure you follow these tips. Think About the Design - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your next step in learning how to **paint** an **aluminum** boat is to apply primer. When you aren’t using Durabak, you can use an oil-based primer and a **paint** thinner. By mixing a pint of **paint** thinner into a gallon of primer, you will make it easier to work into the small cracks of the boat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In Ft.Lauderdale, a private tug named Hero still operates for over 30 years without any **paint**. She is all **aluminum** with an air-cooled diesel and no thru-hulls. Her entire hull covering exists of a wax coating on the inside and outside. Zero problems and no maintenance after the initial coat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Q. What is the fastest and easiest method to remove a water line from an **aluminum** boat hull? I have a new boat and recently put it into a lake for four days. When pulled it already had a "scum line" that I would like to remove as easily and quickly as possible. What are product choices that are effective for removal of the line? I would then like to coat the hull with some type of product/protectant that will keep scum lines from reoccurring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ed. note: See the entry of May 15, 2007, Billy. You are looking for a primer designed for **aluminum** oxide surfaces, i.e., **aluminum** boats, not a primer based on **aluminum** oxide chemistry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tips: TotalBoat Aluminum Boat Paint will adhere strongly when applied directly to properly prepared bare metal and previously **paint**ed **aluminum** or galvanized metal surfaces in good condition. For maximum adhesion on bare **aluminum**, we recommend applying TotalBoat Aluminum Boat Etch Wash prior **paint**ing. For superior antifouling protection below the waterline, we recommend TotalBoat AlumiPaint AF, a bottom **paint** specifically formulated for **aluminum** boats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It's always best if possible to strip the old **paint** off if possible. Use a good stripper, an automotive **paint** store, not shop, carries some nice choices, or, like I did. A wire wheel that attaches to a drill. If you have many coats, the main focus is to remove anything that is loose. New **paint** won't stay on over areas that are not already bonded and your **paint** job will only be as good as the bond it is adhered to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Aluminum boat **paint** jobs come out best when you use a primer that’s formulated specifically for use with **aluminum**. The primer will not only help the **paint** adhere to the boat, but will also provide an extra barrier layer that helps prevent corrosion or oxidation. Note: because oxidation begins shortly after bare **aluminum** is exposed to the air, you’ll want to apply the primer as soon as possible after the **aluminum** has been cleaned and dried. Many manufacturers recommend you do so just an hour after the boat has dried. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

But many older or less expensive **aluminum** rigs have a dull gray look that’s not very attractive.

-   I think Marshall was suggesting that you need to use a primer designed for use on **aluminum** oxide surfaces (whether that be zinc chromate, zinc phosphate, or otherwise).

-   Give the exterior a really good scrub, beginning with a sanding pad that can attach to a drill (I found it in the automotive section and it's designed to sand **paint** from vehicles) to remove loose **paint** and dried-on algae, and then follow up with a thorough wash.
