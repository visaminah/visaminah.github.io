That being said, there are a few things to keep in mind when finalizing your colo palette. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Each color on the visible light spectrum has unique wavelengths. On one end of the spectrum, red has long, stretched-out wavelengths, while the other end is violet, which has short wavelengths that occur more frequently. So, if we look at a red apple, all the colors with shorter wavelengths, such as violet, **blue**, and green, will be absorbed while red, which has the longest wavelengths, will reflect off the object. Thus, the apple will appear red to us. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To create peaceful spaces, look outside for calming colors and earthen textures that complement navy **blue**. Nature-inspired elements such as rich wood furniture, straw-hued wicker and rattan accents, leather upholstery, warm neutral paint colors, and concrete-gray accents partner perfectly with navy **blue** hues. Pick neutral accessories and materials that are lighter or much darker than a room's navy **blue** finishes and furniture to emphasize color differences and lend distinction to each element. No matter which colors you pair with navy, use contrast to avoid a muddied-up palette and supply resting places for the eye. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Jeans come in all colors these days, but classically they belong to the **blue** family, and as explained above, **blue** is a perfect match for grey.

Jeans paired with a grey top can make up an outfit for any occasion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Choose a color that contrasts with the navy **blue** shade of your pants. For example, if you’re wearing dark or black dress pants then a light or white colored shirt is ideal for creating an effective contrast. Make sure your shirt isn’t too flashy- otherwise it will dominate and take all the attention away from your outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Similar to yellow, gold makes a brilliant complement to navy **blue**. Incorporate the color into your navy **blue** room with metallic gold accents or gold-toned wood finishes on floors, furniture, or trim. This radiant hue is especially helpful for lightening up dark navy **blue** colors to ward off a gloomy look. A large gold mirror on a navy **blue** wall, for example, will reflect light around the space to create an expansive effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To sum it up, a **blue**-gray paint color is gray with **blue** added to it. Some of these livid colors are more **blue** than gray and others are more gray than **blue**. These cool toned colors can also be considered slate colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The color ochre is an earthy, deep yellow tone that goes well with navy **blue** because of its warmth. While it almost looks similar to yellow, ochre brings about the richness and depth of a room. Since ochre is close to yellow hues, it contrasts well with navy **blue**, but it looks richer and a little more glamorous to look at when used in your space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   People often confuse the CMYK color model for being similar to RGB. CMYK is a form of subtractive mixing that’s used for printer ink. The primary colors on the CMYK color model are cyan, magenta, and yellow, while the secondary colors are red, green, and **blue**. Even though those are the same but opposite colors of RGB, the two models are very different. Colors like black, gray, and brown exist in CMYK even though they don’t exist in RGB. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Choosing lighter shades of grey to go with the blackest of blacks will give you a classic look.

A colourful or patterned scarf, tie, or shoes are just a few options to complete and balance a darker outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A navy **blue** shirt can go with a variety of different colors and styles of clothing. Some common choices include white, black, or gray pants or skirts; denim jeans; and khaki shorts or trousers.

-   If you know me, you know I’m a fan of **blue**. I gravitate towards the color all the time. Whether it involves shopping for clothes or furniture, my eyes are almost always drawn to **blue** colors first. The same goes for paint colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Owen Wilson, Mahershala Ali, and Ed Sheeran. What to consider: Muted hues such as light **blue**s and greys work particularly well on those on the lighter side of the spectrum, whereas those with a richer skin tone will find it easier to experiment with bold colours. Every colour you wear should help create a contrast that lacks in your complexion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue-gray doesn’t have many meanings on its own, but the color does define “livid,” which is a synonym for anger. It’s used to describe bruising since that’s the color that skin sometimes turns. In addition to these meanings, **blue**-gray also shares some similar symbolism to **blue** and gray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Right now, certain colors seem more popular than others (we're looking at you, hot pink), but one shade that never goes out of style is navy **blue**. It continues to be a mainstay in our wardrobe year-round, whether we're rocking a striped navy and white swimsuit by the beach or bundling up in a knit navy sweater. However, despite this neutral being such a classic, deciding what colors go with navy **blue** can sometimes feel tricky. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In my opinion, the bedroom is the optimal place to use these colors. Since **blue** promotes calmness and relaxation, it’s perfect for a bedroom. Blue grays are great because they have a bit of color to them while being on the neutral side. And that makes sense for a bedroom paint color since you don’t want your paint to be overly colorful or vibrant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another classic, the combination of navy **blue** and red, is very reminiscent of nautical-themed spaces. However, different shades of red can be used and depending on how light or dark this red is, the feel of the room will drastically change. Darker, heavier red hues are more elegant, while brighter, striking firehouse reds are sure to bring in the heat to the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When **blue** and gray are used together, they provide a calming and soothing effect. They might be used together in a somber painting or a relaxing office space.

-   The color wheel can be a helpful tool for determining what colors go with navy **blue**. For a complementary color scheme, look to **blue**'s opposite on the wheel: orange.

-   In CMYK, the K stands for “key color,” which is black. That’s why printer ink comes with black in addition to the primary colors. Gray can be made in CMYK by using a little black.

The matte gray paint color on the walls provides a quiet backdrop for the much bolder, rust-colored headboard. A pale **blue** blanket on top of white linens tempers the warm shade and complements the gray walls. Colorful accent pillows echo the headboard and act as the perfect finishing touches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   According to the color wheel, the complementary color of **blue** is orange. This is because **blue** and orange are opposite each other on the wheel. Blue is a cool color, while orange is a warm color. Together, they create a. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But, as we all know, there isn’t just one shade of red. Women are typically more in-tune with their ‘colour profile’ because of hours spent finding the right shade of foundation or right shade of red lipstick for their complexion. There are dusty reds, maroons, wine-reds, true reds, pinky-reds, orangey-reds… and just as a **blue** undertone separates the colour from true red, so too does our undertone or level of contrast dictate what type of red looks best on us. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Herringbone wood floors, decorative ceiling trim, and swanky lighting complete the scene. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Pro tip: for a **blue** and grey outfit, choose a warm-toned brown shoe to complete the look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With yellow being a natural contrasting color to **blue**, it comes as no surprise that it does well to combine this color with navy **blue**.

The color yellow can be added as an accent or as a striking piece of color that draws visitors to the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

It is also stunning as upholstered furniture or rugs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you consider yourself to have fair or light skin (cold/**blue** undertone), you will most likely fit into a few other categories as well.

According to that color model, you can create **blue** by mixing magenta and cyan. However, those aren’t common paint colors, so you’d be better off buying more **blue** paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Due to its neutral profile, navy **blue** goes well with different colors of wood, depending on the feel you'd like to have in your space. If you are looking to add hardwood floors to your navy-colored room, you're in luck.

-   If you're looking to add a pop of color to any room, you can't go wrong with a vibrant shade of orange. And bonus: The hue will work especially well with **blue** palettes since orange is a complementary color (meaning it's on the opposite side of the color wheel). Keep in mind that a little goes a long way, as proven by this bedroom design. Here, a citrus-hued throw and patterned accent pillow warm up the cooler **charcoal** gray walls and light **blue** headboard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are looking to do a monochromatic theme for your space, navy **blue** works beautifully with other shades from its family. Colors can range anywhere from the light **blue** shades to the more classic **blue**s, and it will create a beautiful gradient of calming **blue** colors.

-   Instead of reaching for harsh colour pairings, opt for more neutral bases and then add a warm version of your favourite colour such as a pine green or a warm **blue** to keep it interesting. When donning bright colours, such as a bright red, add it in through your tie or pocket square, alongside a muted **blue** button-up and navy suit. Tip: Stay away from clear colours such as icy **blue**s and stark white. Opt for a warmer alternative to bring out the warmth in your complexion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remember to consider the available lighting (both artificial and natural) in your space — if your room is already pretty dark, and you want to brighten it up, this might affect your color choice.
