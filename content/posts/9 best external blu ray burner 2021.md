## 9 Shocking Facts About Best External Blu Ray Burner 2021 | Blu-Ray Ripping
-   Quite simply, burn speed indicates the maximum speed at which data can be written to a disc. In general, most Blu-ray **burner**s have about the same speed for older media types like DVD and CDs, so really look at Blu-ray write speed. At the very least you should pick a model with a maximum speed of 12X (especially for an external device) but a speed of 16X is preferable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It offers long-term data protection with M-DISC (Millennial Disc). This DVD drive can be used on Windows and Mac OS. This external Blu-ray **burner** includes free CyberLink Power2Go 8 Software for burning discs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The cache size, or cache memory, represents physical memory in the Blu-ray **burner** used to temporarily store data before transferring it to a computer or writing it to a disc. This is a pretty simple specification and more memory/larger cache size is better. You should look for a **burner** with at least a full 1MB of memory, but 4MB or more is definitely preferable. This helps ensure fast, smooth burning and minimizes opportunities for data corruption. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like any other device or computer peripheral, you want to make sure you choose a reliable manufacturer that stands by their product and covers it with a solid warranty. Companies like LG, ASUS, and Pioneer all make excellent Blu-ray **burner**s. You can also look for manufacturers of general Blu-ray players such as Samsung and Sony. A one-year warranty is pretty standard for Blu-ray **burner**s, but you should definitely not pick a model with a shorter period of protection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   External devices are a bit more varied, and you can find both USB and SATA connections, meant to plug into an eSATA port on your system. As long as you have a SATA connection available, choose that option for an internal device. The physical connection on an external **burner** can introduce some bottlenecking, so look for either an eSATA connection or USB 3.0 to ensure optimal speed and performance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While picking out the right Blu-Ray **burner** might not take as much time and energy as shopping for a new video card or motherboard, there are still some important decisions to consider. You’ll want to decide on either an internal or external drive and look at technical specifications like cache size, burn speed, and access time. Make sure you pick a model with an interface type that matches what you have available and consider what load type— slot or tray loading— is better for your setup. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   M-DISC is a storage solution that preserves videos, documents, and photos for numerous years. It is designed specifically to protect your data from loss and degradation. M-DISC technology is compatible with all types of DVD drives. However, it can only be written with compatible **burner** software. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As you consider different Blu-ray **burner**s, keep in mind any extra features and options provided by various models. The software included with a **burner** can be very important, including both burning programs as well as software for reading data. If you want to play Blu-ray movies through your computer, then you should definitely look for a **burner** that includes software for playing media. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   LG Electronics 8X USB 2.0 DVD Writer uses silent play technology that helps you to reduce noise during playback. It automatically adjusts the disc speed for optimal performance. This is a good portable DVD **burner** that supports M-DISC for the secure storage of your data. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
