## 92 Tips to Which Humidifier Is Best For Asthma | Best Humidifier For Asthma And Allergies
-   Reviewers rave about how easy this ultrasonic **humidifier** is to clean, thanks to its filterless design: “The tank has round edges with a large filling hole, big enough to get my hand and sponge in,” says one, who goes on to praise its high output and quiet operation. To keep your home from getting too humid, you can also use its auto shut-off. Plus, its nozzle and output knob are beyond simple to adjust. The 1.2-gallon tank can give up to 30 hours of mist and we love the option to use for soothing scents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Allergy Be Gone carries a full complement of cool mist **humidifier**s. Cool mist **humidifier**s trap airborne allergens while emitting a cool, invisible mist. There are ultrasonic, evaporative and impeller cool mist **humidifier**s. Allergy Be Gone carries all types. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another important benefit of a **humidifier** for **asthma** is that it can provide relief from symptoms associated with **asthma**. People with **asthma** can feel the effects of low humidity by experiencing dry skin, chapped lips, and difficulty breathing. In addition, the humidity level in your home should be 30% to 50%. This can be affected by extreme temperatures, so a **humidifier** for this condition can be a lifesaver. If you are concerned that your home may have too much moisture in the air, a **humidifier** can help you reduce your anxiety and increase your mood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to **humidifier**s, AllergyBeGone.com has a full line of both cool mist and warm mist **humidifier**s. Is a warm mist or a cool mist **humidifier**, more beneficial? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Increased humidity can make breathing easier. It would also help with dry, scratchy throats to reduce coughing. Generally, both hot and cold mist **humidifier**s can ease coughing and other issues that may trigger **asthma**. But one may be more suitable than the other. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By using **humidifier**s, these symptoms of **asthma** can be kept in check, and may help limit the number of **asthma** attacks within the home. By easing the discomfort of a dry throat, nose, and mouth through humidity, the **asthma**tic individual’s mind is put to ease, and thoughts of a flare-up can be pushed to the back of the mind. With **humidifier**s, a more comfortable level of breathing may be possible for those with chronic breathing issues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The only way that a **humidifier** can benefit an **asthma**tic individual is if it is properly maintained. Humidifiers that are not properly cared for can become a breeding ground for mold, viruses, and other bacteria; and for those already susceptible to breathing problems like the **asthma**tic, these things can become downright dangerous. Here are some important guidelines for **asthma** suffering individuals to remember. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The type you choose is ultimately up to you, but in general, cool mist **humidifier**s are the safest option (especially if you have children or pets around), according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Warm mist **humidifier**s, meanwhile, run hot and have the potential to cause burns if you get too close. Also, evaporative **humidifier**s often spit out invisible mist, so don’t be alarmed if they don’t appear to be working. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you really don’t want to deal with filling your **humidifier** every day, consider this option, which is powerful enough for large rooms and boasts the ability to provide both warm and cool mist. Plus it has a tray for diffusing essential oils. On its lowest setting, the 2-gallon tank spits out a continuous mist for up to 120 hours—that’s five entire days! Reviewers love that it has a mold-resistant tank and a relatively quiet design, too. It’s “as good as you’re going to get,” one reviewer summarizes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best way to reduce smoke is just given up smoking and not allow anyone to smoke indoor. But unfortunately, even the smell of it on clothing can trigger an attack. If you purchase a good **humidifier**, it can reduce the effects of second-hand and third-hand smoke. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An ultrasonic **humidifier** is one that uses high-frequency sound vibrations to produce an extra fine water mist that is then expelled to add moisture to the room. It is often considered the quieter of both types of **humidifier**s. The ultrasonic generally has no filter factored into its design. That does save operation costs, but it does come with a trade-off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When an **asthma** sufferer breathes dry air, the nerves in their lungs become inflamed. Whole room **humidifier**s will disperse moisture into the air, allowing the lungs to be moisturized in order to breathe easier, which means they’ll be less likely to have an **asthma** attack. Air Innovations offers a wide variety of whole room **humidifier**s for those who have **asthma**, as well as for those who suffer from nasal infections, allergies or just want to have a room **humidifier** in their home to make it more comfortable. There are many benefits to owning whole room **humidifier**s, which is why many choose Air Innovations to find the perfect one! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cool mist models are great for year-round uses. When it’s hot, they also work as mini ACs. And when it’s cold while you have heaters blasting indoors, having a cool mist **humidifier** would reduce dryness caused by the heating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But be cautious: Although useful, **humidifier**s can make you sick if they aren't maintained properly or if humidity levels stay too high. If you use a **humidifier**, be sure to check the humidity levels and keep your **humidifier** clean. Dirty **humidifier**s can breed mold or bacteria. If you have allergies or **asthma**, talk to your doctor before using a **humidifier**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cool mist **humidifier**s work quite well in large spaces. For the most part, the units are simple to clean. However, the wicks in evaporating **humidifier**s can be prone to mold growth. Therefore, they must be cleaned frequently. If the tanks are not emptied with regular frequency, algae can grow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Always read the instructions. After you install and run your **humidifier**, make sure you’re using it correctly, too. Ideally, indoor humidity should not exceed 50% , per the Environmental Protection Agency. Avoid running your **humidifier** for long periods of time and make sure to set a humidity level, if your machine has that feature. When the air is too damp, mold and mildew can grow and cause breathing problems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unplug the **humidifier** before you clean it. Remove any mineral deposits or film from the tank or other parts of the **humidifier** with a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, which is available at pharmacies. Some manufacturers recommend using chlorine bleach or other disinfectants. Always rinse the tank after cleaning. This can keep harmful chemicals from becoming airborne — and then inhaled. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All in all, **humidifier**s are good for **asthma**tics. They help relieve symptoms and may prevent future episodes. However, be careful not to overrun your **humidifier**. Also, check for mold and indoor air quality regularly, so the high moisture doesn’t lead to other issues. Finally, we recommend using purified water over tap water in your **humidifier** for safer, healthier results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just as is the case with smoking, an air purifier or **humidifier** can help to reduce the impact of fragrances on the respiratory system. It will help to breathe easily without cough and sneeze. It will be beneficial for **asthma**tics and people who suffer from allergies. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   — Humidifiers for **asthma** should not contain standing water when not in use. Empty and thoroughly rinse the **humidifier** every day, and if storing your **humidifier**s, make sure to fully dry out the unit, by hand where possible. This way, you will not need to clean the unit with any harsh chemicals, which can sometimes trigger **asthma** attacks. Go to the Light — Some higher-end **humidifier**s for **asthma** feature ultraviolet (UV) lights in the unit to prevent the growth or spreading of mold and fungi. This can be especially useful if the **humidifier** is left on for extended periods; the longer the water is heated, the more likely it is to become contaminated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finding the perfect balance of humidity in the air inside your home is only half the battle. If you let your **humidifier** get dirty, it can worsen your allergy and **asthma** symptoms. Below are some simple cleaning guidelines: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Had a long day? No worries. The MYST comes with an essential oil diffuser that will slowly wash away your stress and anxieties. Furthermore, the MYST **humidifier** carry is also perfect for allergies and sinusitis. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Asthma sufferers can use a **humidifier** to treat their condition. It will provide moisture to the air in your home for up to 16 hours. It’s important to remember that a **humidifier** should be used in limited hours. For example, if you have a **humidifier** that only runs overnight, you’ll have to run it 24 hours a day. A **humidifier** that is not on 24/7 will not work as effectively as a **humidifier** that runs every day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Much of the choice between cool mist and warm mist **humidifier**s comes down to personal preference and location. Before buying, think about what type of climate you live in, where your home is situated, how air circulates in your home, and what kind of personal environment you wish to create for yourself. Some allergists and other doctors might also prescribe a certain type of **humidifier** for allergies, **asthma**, or sinus problems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once the most dominant style of **humidifier** on the market, this model heats the water within until it boils, and the steam is vented into the room. These can be effective **humidifier**s if the **asthma**tic individual prefers a warmer humid environment, but due to the heated tank, they are also the model one must be most attentive with keeping clean. Warm Mist Vaporizer: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This can keep harmful chemicals from becoming airborne — and then inhaled. Change **humidifier** filters regularly. If the **humidifier** has a filter, change it at least as often as the manufacturer recommends — and more often if it's dirty. Also, regularly change the filter in your central air conditioning and heating system. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drain and clean **humidifier**s before storing them. And then clean them again when you take them out of storage for use. Throw away all used cartridges, cassettes or filters. Follow instructions for central **humidifier**s. If you have a **humidifier** built into your central heating and cooling system, read the instruction manual or ask your heating and cooling specialist about proper maintenance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are two main categories of **humidifier**s: warm mist and cool mist. They essentially do the same thing but in different ways. When comparing cool mist **humidifier**s vs. warm mist **humidifier**s, you'll find that each has pros and cons to consider. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Humidifiers provide moist air at the precise desired temperature, which is not only one of the most effective ways to keep airways free, but is one of the most natural ways as well. Nasal sprays and over-the-counter medications can open anyone’s airways, but they also provide a wide range of additional effects not found in clean, pleasantly humid air. If you are suffering from **asthma** and want to breathe easy without worrying about dosages, then **humidifier**s may be able to help. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let Allergy Be Gone answer all of your questions about cool and warm mist **humidifier**s as well as other allergy and **asthma** questions. We can help you do more than manage your symptoms. With Allergy Be Gone, you can start breathing easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the **humidifier** has a filter, change it at least as often as the manufacturer recommends — and more often if it's dirty. Also, regularly change the filter in your central air conditioning and heating system. Keep the area around **humidifier**s dry. If the area around a **humidifier** becomes damp or wet — including windows, carpeting, drapes or tablecloths — turn the **humidifier** down or reduce how often you use it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dirty reservoirs and filters in **humidifier**s can quickly breed bacteria and mold. Dirty **humidifier**s can especially cause problems for people with **asthma** and allergies. But even in healthy people, dirty **humidifier**s have the potential to trigger flu-like symptoms or even lung infections when the contaminated mist or steam is released into the air. Evaporators and steam vaporizers may be less likely to release airborne allergens than may cool-mist **humidifier**s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   — Some higher-end **humidifier**s for **asthma** feature ultraviolet (UV) lights in the unit to prevent the growth or spreading of mold and fungi. This can be especially useful if the **humidifier** is left on for extended periods; the longer the water is heated, the more likely it is to become contaminated. Don’t Overdo It — While the benefits of a newly-acquired **humidifier** can sometimes lead some **asthma**tic individuals to crank up the unit until the room is like an indoor tropical zone, too much humidity can be as bad for one’s breathing as overly dry air. Rely on a hygrometer or humidistat to determine the humidity levels of each room. Anything above 45 percent is considered too high, and is not effectively safe, as these levels will lead to rampant mold and fungi growth if left unchecked. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dust, pollen, mold, and other airborne allergens can trigger **asthma** attacks. Unfortunately, if not properly cared for and cleaned, most **humidifier**s can build up mold, bacteria, or white dust and release this into the air. This is bad news for **asthma**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **humidifier** is an appliance designed specifically to release warm or cool mist to increase the amount of water vapor in the air. Humidifiers are available at Discount Appliance Outlet and large big box retailers. There are many different types of **humidifier**s on the market to meet a variety of needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A warm mist is more efficient in killing bacteria. It is also more suitable for those with chronic headaches or migraines. However, they consume more energy and can be a safety hazard to children and animals. It also wouldn’t be realistic running a warm **humidifier** during summertime. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you suffer from **asthma**, you might be wondering if a **humidifier** is the best choice for your home. Some people with the disease claim that their symptoms are worse in the winter, but that doesn’t mean that a **humidifier** will help you. Some people with **asthma**, however, experience it as worsening, and it is important to be aware of the symptoms so you can take steps to relieve them. But for many, a **humidifier** is an essential part of their life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Overall benefits: Humidifiers are a part of many households. There are many different versions of **humidifier**s, but they all add moisture to the air. The moisture in turn increases the level of humidity in the living space, which helps alleviate common cold-weather conditions. Below are a few common benefits of **humidifier**s: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cool mist **humidifier**s function in a number of ways: evaporative, impeller, and ultrasonic. The evaporative style uses a fan and wick system. Impellers work with the help of a rotating disc, while ultrasonics use frequencies to vibrate the water. The ultrasonic system is the most energy-efficient and the most expensive of the standalone options. It will help successfully to reduce triggers, ease your **asthma**, and any respiratory problems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **humidifier**s produce a cool mist with a rotating disk. Evaporators. Evaporators use a fan to blow air through a wet wick, filter or belt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Compare mist options. Humidifiers either use warm mist (including steam vaporizing methods) or cool mist (including evaporative options) to add moisture to the air. Ultrasonic **humidifier**s can be either warm mist or cool mist, and some units include the option for both. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Asthma is a disorder that affects multiple aspects of the breathing system. This is why it is so dangerous to suffer a sudden flare-up. Not only is there a constriction of the breathing muscles, but the suddenly-inflamed airways and an increased amount of thickened phlegm all striking at once can cause the **asthma**tic individual to feel as if they cannot breathe; in severe attacks the individual may literally become unable to breathe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pick an easy-to-clean option. It’s best to regularly change the filter or clean your **humidifier** , preferably daily, but at least every two to three days, so pick an option with cheap (or no) filters, plus parts that are easy to wash. Otherwise, mold could grow inside the device due to standing water and get blown through your home, making life pretty awful for those with mold allergies—or anyone, really. Better yet, use distilled water in your chosen machine if possible, since tap water contains minerals that can breed bacteria and irritate your sinuses. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Use Pure Water — The quickest way to introduce pollutants to your **humidifier** – and one way that many users overlook – is to directly pour the water tainted with mold or bacteria into the **humidifier**’s input. When adding water to the unit, make sure it is either distilled or purified water. Keeping pollutants out of the tank is the most effective way to prevent your **humidifier** from being damaged. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These are built into home heating and air conditioning systems. They are designed to humidify the whole house. Ultrasonic **humidifier**s. These produce a cool mist with ultrasonic vibration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These produce a cool mist with ultrasonic vibration. Impeller **humidifier**s. These **humidifier**s produce a cool mist with a rotating disk. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Keeping a **humidifier** clean is important for **asthma**, allergy, and other respiratory sufferers. Mold spores, bacteria, or other allergens released into the air along with the moisture can trigger an **asthma** attack. In addition to regular and thorough cleaning, it’s important not to allow stagnant water to sit in the tank for an extended time. Do you have pets at home or little kids? Is the climate at your home is too dry? Are you using hard water to fill the **humidifier**? If you answer ‘yes’ at least for one question, it would be better to clean your **humidifier** every day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes. Humidifiers can increase oxygen levels in your room and therefore may ease those with breathing difficulties, such as **asthma**tics or pneumonia patients. The increased oxygen level can also reducce headache, improve sleep quality, and overall, make you feel more energetic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Essentially, HP07 combines a **humidifier** and a purifier and prides itself on making your air 50% cleaner. It’s also delightfully quiet for something with such a high capacity. So you won’t have to worry about being distracted by the fans or vents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **humidifier**s have filters built into the machine. Because of this, the device is easily filtering out some allergens that cause an **asthma** attack. It will help **asthma**tic people breathe without any problem and feel great. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another benefit of a **humidifier** for **asthma** is that it can reduce the chances of a flare-up. It can also help control **asthma** symptoms, including dry skin and chapped lips. It is important to remember that the humidity level in your home should be between 30 and 50%. This can fluctuate depending on the weather. Asthma is a chronic condition, but a **humidifier** can be an effective tool for combating symptoms and keeping your home at an optimal humidity level. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Heat and humidity increase the demand for oxygen and the change in environmental conditions like the increased mold growth, altogether trigger the **asthma** attack. Humid air with more water content is heavier making it hard for the **asthma** patients to breathe.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a **humidifier** built into your central heating and cooling system, read the instruction manual or ask your heating and cooling specialist about proper maintenance. Consider replacing old **humidifier**s. Over time, **humidifier**s can build up deposits that are difficult or impossible to remove and encourage the growth of bacteria. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, since they emit steam, they can be more dangerous, especially if they are used in a child's room. The Mayo Clinic does not recommend the use of warm mist **humidifier**s with children since the steam or warm mist may burn children if they get to close. If there is a spill, of course, the warm water may cause burns as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We don’t blame you for being too cautious. As you already know, **asthma** triggers include sinus infections, allergies, pollens, chemical pollutants, and mold. Some of these can worsen in a high-humidity environment, others the opposite. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You have a variety of options for boosting your home’s humidity. They range from portable and inexpensive to permanent and pricier. What you choose depends on how severe the problem is, what degree of maintenance you’re willing to uphold, and what your budget is. Let’s talk about a good **humidifier** for **asthma** sufferers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best **humidifier** for you and your home will depend on your needs. When you’re comparing cool mist **humidifier**s vs. warm mist **humidifier**s, you’ll find that while they have similar functions, each one offers its own benefits for managing certain health conditions or symptoms. No matter which **humidifier** you choose, make sure to read the directions and follow the instructions for safe use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The changing of the seasons is beautiful, but certain times of the year also bring an unwelcome guest: dry air. Whether you’re looking out for your skin’s health or battling a bad case of allergies or a cold , dry air can exacerbate your symptoms. Luckily, the best **humidifier**s can help. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Measure your space. The best size for your **humidifier** depends on the size of the room in which you plan to use it. Personal or travel-sized **humidifier**s typically only reach 25 to 100 square feet. Check the square footage your machine can reach (which is determined by its gallon size) on its packaging before you invest in one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The main distinction between types of **humidifier**s is whether they release warm or cool mist. Warm mist **humidifier**s release steam vapor into the air that you can both see and feel. They are ideal for smaller areas, like a bedroom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The effectiveness of each model does not only depend on the desired temperature of the humidity. The size of the room or rooms to be humidified will also affect the style you need. Cool mist **humidifier**s tend to affect a wider area than steam **humidifier**s, but those suffering from **asthma** should consult the packaging of each individual model to achieve the desired effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A standard approach to **humidifier** care goes as follows: spend 20-30 minutes per day to take care of your **humidifier**; once in a week, it’s time for a thorough cleaning: aside from using only water, you can clean a device with vinegar for a lasting effect. Change water daily, especially if you’re using a cool-mist or ultrasonic **humidifier**. Use distilled water or water with low mineral content to prevent mineral buildup, which can promote bacterial growth. Clean **humidifier**s every three days using a 3-percent hydrogen-peroxide solution. Be sure to thoroughly rinse the tank after cleaning to keep harmful chemicals from becoming airborne when the **humidifier** is in use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best way to test humidity levels in your house is with a hygrometer. This device looks like a thermometer. It measures the amount of moisture in the air. Hygrometers can be purchased at hardware stores and department stores. When buying a **humidifier**, consider purchasing one with a built-in hygrometer that keeps humidity within a healthy range (humidistat). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Steam vaporizers and warm mist **humidifier**s both heat water and then release it into the air. Warm mist **humidifier**s and steam vaporizers are effective ways to relieve congestion but should be used with care. Both have heating elements that can cause burns and can even be a fire hazard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A common concern with using a **humidifier** is it might trigger coughing. Fortunately, that is a misunderstanding. If you ever felt a **humidifier** triggered your cough, usually, it was not because of the device but one of the following reasons: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These are the most widely used stand-alone **humidifier**s. How do they work? These machines boil water and release the steam produced through vents. This style works well for those who prefer warmer humidity. The heated tank requires more monitoring and maintenance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Similar to the steam vaporizer, a warm mist **humidifier** creates steam, but then cools it to the point that its output is slightly heavier and not as hot – hence, a “warm mist.” These are useful **humidifier**s for **asthma** if the temperature of the humidity needs to be as exact as possible, especially when paired with central air or heating. Cool Mist Humidifier: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Central or window-mounted air conditioning units dry the air, keeping indoor humidity at a comfortable and healthy level. Using a de**humidifier**. These devices collect excess moisture from the air, lowering humidity levels. De**humidifier**s work like air conditioners, without the "cooling" effect. They're often used to help dry out damp basements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you feel more comfortable and secure, your emotions tend to be more stable. While a **humidifier** does not inherently stabilize emotions, the comfort it brings can help. While owning a **humidifier** is not a cure for **asthma**, it does help. And when you suffer from **asthma**, you take any help you can get. Of course, before you can enjoy the benefits a **humidifier** can offer you, you need to make sure you are purchasing the right one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the area around a **humidifier** becomes damp or wet — including windows, carpeting, drapes or tablecloths — turn the **humidifier** down or reduce how often you use it. Prepare **humidifier**s for storage. Drain and clean **humidifier**s before storing them. And then clean them again when you take them out of storage for use. Throw away all used cartridges, cassettes or filters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Warm mist **humidifier**s emit the steam from boiling water to humidify a room. The steam is cooled as it’s released so that the output is slightly heavier and not as hot. These machines are well-suited to those who require an exact temperature setting for aid in their **asthma** regulation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **humidifier** for **asthma** is the very best option to prevent attacks and ensure you get a good night’s sleep. It’s worth mentioning that a **humidifier** releases moist air. This is highly efficient in the sense that it keeps the airways free – in a natural way. While many **asthma**tics turn to over-the-counter medications and nasal sprays, which can open the airways, these are linked with a bunch of side effects, as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The central **humidifier**s require fewer maintenance steps and considered to be a good variant for small houses. This is the most precise way to control temperature and humidity. The initial installation is more expensive than the other options but can save you time, money, and energy in the long run. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cool mist **humidifier**s and warm mist **humidifier**s both add moisture to the air which moistens your skin (including your nasal passages) and thin mucus in your sinuses. The National Institutes of Health recommends the use of **humidifier**s to help relieve congestion from the common cold, flu, and sinus infections. Using a **humidifier** makes it easier for you to breathe and makes it easier for the mucus to drain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “Dirty reservoirs and filters in **humidifier**s can quickly breed bacteria and mold. Dirty **humidifier**s can be especially problematic for people with **asthma** and allergies.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These electric devices can function in a few different ways. Some models have a rotating disk, or a fan and wick system, that disperses mist into the air. Other top of the line models use ultrasonic frequencies to vibrate the water into smaller molecules. Whatever method, cool mist **humidifier**s produce a cool mist, and therefore makes the air feel cooler. Since there is no heating element, they use significantly less energy, the ultrasonic variety using the very least. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That precise control will ensure that you have just the right humidity level in your home, helping those with **asthma** stay comfortable around the entire home. Of course, the cost of a whole-home **humidifier** is much more than a single portable **humidifier**. But considering that it can affect your entire home, it’s a more cost-effective solution than placing several portable **humidifier**s around your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Some **humidifier** models are designed to kill germs. Which can make it less likely that you will catch a potentially devastating infection. If someone at your home has an allergy or suffer from **asthma**, it will be really beneficial to buy a good **humidifier**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
