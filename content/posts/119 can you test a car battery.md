## 119 Interesting Facts Can You Test A Car Battery | How to use a Multimeter to Test a Car Battery
-   Most vehicles draw some **battery** current when the key is off, thanks to the clock and the internal memory of engine computers, body-control modules, and radio presets. Altogether, they draw a very small amount of current. Fifty milliamps would be a safe upper limit for this, though many vehicles will draw less. If you're not sure, look up the correct rating in the service manual. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It can be difficult sometimes to pinpoint the nature of an electrical problem in your car. The first step is to **test** a car **battery**. Most importantly, this is the best way to figure out if it is the problem or whether you should be focusing perhaps on the alternator. If you’re not comfortable you can go to a mechanic to get this job done. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Of course, a repeatedly low charge doesn’t mean your **battery** is dead. It could be good and several scenarios might lead it to lose its charge: such as lights being left on, undriven for long periods, dodgy alternator, or even parasitic draw through any number of electrical circuits in the car going awry. Even an errant radio or internal light connection can repeatedly flatten a good one. But a positive outcome of the **test**s outlined above should prove the **battery** itself can hold a charge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is often the first sign people get when there is a problem with their **battery**. Without the charge, your starter motor isn’t going to come on right away to get your engine to turn over. If this is a constant issue every time you try to start your car, chances are you are having a **battery** issue. This is good to watch out for before you need a jump start. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Here, we check the charge, or voltage, of your car **battery**. This is achieved by measuring the DC voltage of the **battery** in parallel with the multimeter. If you are looking to **test** for amperage draw (parasitic draw) – **test**ing amps in series – we cover that process in this guide. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it is clear you need a new **battery**, then luckily there are many places you can pick up a new one. As with most parts of a car, a new **battery** for your vehicle comes with a range of prices and **battery** brands. You can pick up a brand new **battery** for anywhere between $50 and $150. There are also some premium batteries that may cost you as much as $300 or more. This is not necessarily something you need for your car and certainly not standard or required by any means. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take the **battery** reading. The voltage reading should read between 12.4 and 12.6 volts. If it’s below this, you could have a bad **battery** - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When your car won’t start, the first thing to do is check the **battery**. The vast majority of the time when a vehicle refuses to start up, the cause is a **battery** with little or no juice. However, sometimes it isn’t that easy. If the **battery** terminals are clean and properly connected, and a **battery** **test**er shows that it’s in good shape, you’ll need to keep troubleshooting to find the problem. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s hard to place this **test** using our hierarchy of ease, expense, and the likelihood of a problem. If you’ve left a light on, that should be easy and free to fix. If you’ve got a short in a hidden wire because a mouse chewed through it, that could be difficult and expensive to diagnose and fix. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Luckily, checking the state of your **battery** requires a few steps. You can even take up this mini- project in your home. But if you don’t know how to **test** a car **battery**, you follow the step provided below to become an expert at handling this job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you’ve correctly identified the negative and positive terminals, you can disconnect your car **battery** to **test** your alternator. While the engine is running, remove the cable to disconnect the negative **battery** terminal . Make sure you do not disconnect the positive **battery** terminal which will cause a spark and irreparable damage to your computer system. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Testing a car **battery** with a multimeter is quite easy with the necessary guidance. A multimeter is a tool that we would recommend in every house and it can measure electrical quantities like current, voltage and even resistance. The ideal voltage for a car **battery** would be around 12.5 volts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you are **test**ing your **battery** in the first place, you are already wondering if there is a problem. And it is true there are several signs you can be on the lookout for what will indicate you are having an issue with your **battery**. We have already touched on corrosion. In the same vein, let us take a look at what else can tip you off it might be time to **test** your **battery** to see if it’s working okay. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, you’ll have to need to be able to identify the signs that your **battery** is in bad shape. Then you’ll have to **test** it. Below, I outline the signals that your **battery** might be bad. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This guide on how to **test** a car **battery** using a hydrometer will require a model that features an inbuilt thermometer. This will enable you to detect the temperature of the **battery** liquid. Now use the following steps to **test** the cell with Hydrometer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The second **test** you can perform on your **battery** is to measure its level of sulphuric acid with a hydrometer. This is only necessary if your **battery** is non-sealed. If you buy a hydrometer, it will come with exact instructions as to how to measure the concentration of the acid and what the readings mean. Some newer cars will have an in-built hydrometer on the **battery** itself which uses colours to indicate the acid level. Green is for good condition, yellow is if the **battery** needs charging or maintenance and red for when the **battery** should be replaced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Testing a car **battery** is a valuable skill that one save their time and money. You can **test** it with or without the use of a multimeter- A simple **battery** **test**er that measures the Volts, Amps and resistance from an electrical source. It simply **test**s the strength of the car **battery**. Here are few steps on how to measure a car **battery**’s life with or without a multimeter: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you go to **test** the alternator with the multimeter, you will do it the same way as you did the **battery** **test**. Be sure to keep your engine running this time as you do the **test**. Your alternator will be good if you get a reading of at least 13.8 volts, but preferably up to 14.4 volts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With the engine turned off, you need to connect your charger up in the same way as a **battery** **test**er. You then plug the charger into the wall and it will automatically recharge the **battery** for you. The process will take several hours. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With your **battery** still being new (car batteries have a lifespan of approximately six years), a jumpstart should be all you need to get going. This solution assumes you have jumper cables or a standalone jump started stashed away in the truck. Since the **battery** is healthy, it’ll receive power from the other **battery**, and then charge up properly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A multimeter is one of the common ways that people **test** their car **battery**. There are many **test**ers such as Voltmeter or power probe. However, a multimeter is best since a voltmeter or power probe has its limitations. Before **test**ing your car **battery** with the multimeter here are few things to keep in mind: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Indicator lights on your dashboard can often be vague. However, when your **battery** is failing to hold a charge, you will likely get a warning light that pops up on your dashboard. Some cars may just throw up a check engine light first, while others will give you the **battery** light to let you know there is a problem. If you get these along with other symptoms, it is a good bet your **battery** has a problem, and you may need to replace it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Load **test**: a load is applied to the **battery** while its voltage is monitored. You can do this by starting the engine and monitoring the voltage with a multimeter that has a Min/Max mode. This will automatically store the high and low voltages it picks up. The high voltage will likely be in the 14V area and is perfectly normal, while a drop under 9.6V during the process would indicate it can no longer effectively hold charge and needs changing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Place the positive lead of the tool on the positive terminal on the **battery**. Then repeat the process with the negative ends of the probe and **battery**. Finally, fix the tip of the power probe to the positive end of the car **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The coldest days of winter are one of your car **battery**’s worst enemies. In general, extreme temperatures of any kind are not good for batteries. One of the worst winter weather experiences for vehicle owners is when you head out to commute to work or run an errand and your car won’t start. Is it because of a dead **battery**? There is a way to **test** a car **battery** and access if it is having problems before this happens. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now, connect one end of the red (positive) jumper cable to the red post of the dead **battery**. And then connect the other end of the red cable to the red post of the charged **battery**. Next, connect one end of the black (negative) jumper cable to the black post of the charged **battery**. And the other end to an unpainted metal part in the dead car away from the **battery**. This grounds the circuit to prevent sparking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A car **battery** performs an essential function as it helps to power up the vehicle. For this reason, it is important you keep it in perfect condition to avoid setbacks. To keep it in good working order at times, most experts recommend that you **test** the **battery** as often as needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The alternator provides your car with electricity and recharges the **battery** by turning mechanical energy into electrical energy. Think of it as your car’s personal charging system. But a failing alternator won’t have enough power to properly charge the **battery** while the car engine is running. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even if it’s new, you need to understand what’s going on with the **battery**. Attach the **test**er to the **battery**. If the needle’s not moving at all, then you’ve got a dead **battery**. What’s more important is its condition under load. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tip: if you are a beginner looking how to use a multimeter to **test** a car **battery** to ascertain its voltage, consider getting one that has a dedicated **battery** **test**er range on it.

-   You can check for voltage drop between the **battery** terminals and cables by first **test**ing on the terminal and then on the wire crimps going out. Anything over around 0.1V less than what is coming out of the terminals suggests high resistance/bad connection. Clean the terminals/connections with sandpaper and tighten them up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Testing your car **battery** on a regular basis couldn’t be easier with the help of a car **battery** **test**er. The first **test** you will need to carry out on your **battery** is to determine how much charge it has. To get the most accurate results of your **battery**’s performance you should wait 12 hours after having switched off your engine to **test** the charge level. This will allow enough time for any surface charge to run down and if your **battery** has problems retaining charge then it will be easier to spot if you wait a bit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Changing your car **battery** is not an overly complicated procedure. It is perfectly possible to do it yourself, but you will need to be very careful if the old **battery** is damaged in any way. The acid inside the **battery** is highly corrosive and it can be extremely dangerous if not handled correctly; so you should wear gloves at all times to protect your skin. It is also much easier than you might think to connect the wires to the wrong terminals and short circuit the electrical system of the whole car. If you have any doubts whatsoever about the process of replacing the car **battery** then you should leave it to a professional. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To perform a voltage drop **test** of the cables and terminals, touch one probe to the **battery** post, and then the other to the terminal. It should read at or near zero. If it’s reading any lower (the numbers will be represented as negative decimals: -0.07, for example), then you’re losing voltage in your cables. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Other than trying to start the engine to see if there’s charge, the best way to decipher a car **battery**’s status is to **test** it using a multimeter. Digital multimeters are the best option for this since they give a more accurate reading, although you could also use an analog one. And even a cheap, category I (CAT-I) multimeter is fine as you are merely **test**ing voltage, not amperage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Usually, a car **battery** comes with a warranty period of 4 years. However, not all of them make it past the time period. Anything above 4 should be considered a bonus. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a reading of fewer than 13.8 volts, this means that the vehicle has an undercharged **battery**. But if it exceeds 14.4 volts, the **battery** is overcharged. Since both readings discovered can damage the **battery**, you will need to call a professional to have a look at the alternator. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re wondering how to **test** a car **battery**, the simplest method is to borrow a multimeter. Since this device is a wonderful piece of equipment to have in your toolkit and can be used for a myriad of purposes around your home, why not buy one? You can find them cheaply, from $20 onwards. Set the multimeter to its voltage measuring mode, typically 20 or 50 volts, touch the red probe to the positive terminal on your car **battery**, and the black probe to the negative terminal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The software component of Carly is the Carly app which lives right on your smartphone, making it a great solution in how to **test** a car **battery**! Using wireless communication, it liaises with the Carly Universal OBD Scanner and unlocks a world of possibilities for you. The Carly app is available for Apple and Android devices from the official app stores, and there’s even a Carly lite app that allows you to check what’s supported on your car before spending any money. Talking about money, Carly costs under $100 for the app and adaptor, which is tremendous value, especially as regular software updates are provided too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are a few common signs of a bad **battery**. One obvious sign would be the complete absence of any lights or cranking when you try to turn on the car. Another would be the engine cranking laboriously but not actually starting. This one is less clear, but more times than not, it’s the **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your multimeter is showing a reading of around 12.2 volts or more when the car is switched off, the **battery** is good. If this value is closer to 12.0 volts or below, the **battery** needs to be replaced, although this may also be the case if your car has been parked for a few weeks without being started. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Start your vehicle and check the reading. Press the probes to the **battery** terminals and the multimeter should read 14 to 14.5 volts. If the voltage is lower than your initial reading, then the charger is not working - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you don’t know how to use it, look up the steps in the how-to **test** a car **battery** with a digital multimeter above. During the **test**, leave the engine at idle speed and look for a 13.8V – 14.4V reading on the instrument. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most meters today are auto ranging, meaning after setting it to DC voltage, you won’t need to do anything else. The other, older type is a manual ranging multimeter, where you need to select the correct range regards the projected value of the circuit you are going to **test**. Most of the manual ranging meters have a 20V range, which is what you need to **test** a car **battery**. The 20V range means it will measure between 0V and 20V. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since you've never had to plug in your car to an outlet before, how does the **battery** stay topped up? It isn't by means of magic, rather, your engine has a component called the alternator that does all the hard work. When the motor is on, a belt spins a pulley on the alternator, which creates an electrical charge. This power feeds back into your **battery**, keeping it brimmed up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Charge may also be lost in the circuit through bad **battery** connections. As car batteries are low voltage, the connection needs to be that much better. As is the case with many cars, over time connections are prone to becoming loose, dirty and open to corrosion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Switch off the lights and ignition of the car, and then bring out the multimeter needed. Take the black lead of the multimeter and place it on the negative cable of the **battery**. Afterward, place the red point on the positive wire of the cell. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you identify the corrosion you need to clean that off with a **battery** cleaning solution such as sandpaper, baking soda and water etc. while you are checking the **battery** then double-check the **battery** cable are correctly fastened. If the whole **battery** is corroded, then it is better to replace the car **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turn the headlights on for five to 10 minutes without turning the car on. Turn the car on. If you notice your lights significantly dim down when the car is turned on, your **battery** doesn’t have the right charge and might be on the way out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take out the hydrometer and return the cap of the **battery**. Take out a piece of paper and write down the particular gravity recorded. Repeat the process on all cells of the **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you **test** your car **battery** with a gauge, a good reading would be around 12.6 volts. The best way to get an accurate reading is to leave your car **battery** off for over an hour, or just **test** it in the morning after it’s been idle all-night long. Then you will get what is known as the “resting voltage,” which will truly tell you whether your **battery** is still good or not. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Car batteries can’t be taken to landfill sites without having undergone a rigorous treatment process first. If you do decide to change the **battery** yourself then you will be left with the problem of what to do with the old **battery**. Most garages will know where you can take the car **battery** but may be unwilling to take it off your hands if they have not been the ones to replace it for you. Alternatively, many large chain stores that specialise in selling car parts and accessories will have facilities to properly dispose of car batteries safely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is worth keeping on top of a **battery** that continually loses its charge as one that keeps dropping below 75 percent will eventually lead to damage. Most automotive batteries can last four or five years, but one under constant strain from a defective alternator or parasitic draw may fail earlier. On the other hand, if it is four years old and starting to flatten, it may need changing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In humans, the heart circulates the blood all over the body, just like that **battery** circulates electrical power to drive your car. On the average, the car **battery** lasts up to 3 to 5 years. Your driving habits can affect a lot of your car **battery**. Several factors can affect the car **battery**’s life such as excessive cold, vibrations, the alternator etc. before starting a car it is better to **test** the **battery** first. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The car **battery** is probably one of the most understated pieces of critical equipment in a car, regardless of its vintage, classic, or modern. The **battery** typically sits there, doing its job admirably and silently, deteriorating over time, until it finally fails. As Murphy’s Law dictates, if anything can wrong, it will go wrong, and in terms of the car **battery** failing, this ‘going wrong’ can occur at the most inopportune of moments, such as when you are leaving home for work and are already late, about to embark on a long trip, or need to rush for an emergency. How can you mitigate this unpleasant surprise? Let us take you through how to **test** a car **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you use your multimeter to conduct the first **test**, you will be measuring the direct current voltage. Where you see the letter “V,” look above it and you will notice dashed and solid lines that indicate the voltage. Turn the dial so that it is set to 20. This will give you the ability to measure from 0 to 20 volts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A **battery** at 27°C or 80°C will show the above values. For every 10 degrees change in the temperature, the voltage on the car **battery** will change by .01 volts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of the manual ranging meters have a 20V range, which is what you would need to **test** a car **battery**. The 20V range means it will measure between 0V and 20V. See below: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Begin by parking and turning off the car with the charged **battery** next to the dead one. Pop both car’s hoods and get the jumper cables out. You should also protect your hands and eyes in case something goes wrong. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This might be an issue if you leave the car parked for many weeks without starting it. Imagine the confusion of a car parked near the elevator door in a busy parking structure. Every proximity key that walks past makes it sit up and beg, draining your **battery** for a few minutes. Soon, dead **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are different types of automotive **battery** chargers, from basic 2A trickle chargers to more expensive 10A general purpose devices. So-called smart chargers adjust their voltage output depending on the status of the **battery** and can charge faster and more efficiently. There is also less chance of overcharging and they can detect whether the batter is 6V or 12V, as well as the type (such as wet or gel cell) and adjust the output accordingly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A car **battery** doesn’t just go bad completely. There will likely be one or more **battery** cells which are bad in it. You will know if this is the case when you start your car because it will take more time to crank up the engine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The car **battery** is a critical part of your vehicle. It stores the not inconsiderable amount of energy that starts your engine. It is also where the electrical power comes from to operate your radio, A/C fans and fancy accessories like parking sensors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Select the DC volts position on your multimeter (or the 12V setting if you have a dedicated car **battery** **test** range). DC voltage is usually marked as a V followed by a short line with a dotted line beneath it. The wavy line after a V is AC (alternating current) voltage and is for checking the mains voltage in your house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A multimeter is a **test**ing device that can measure Inductance, Temperature, Frequency, Resistance, Current, Capacitance, and much more. They have both digital multimeter and analog versions. Moreover, additional accessories can be used with a multimeter to obtain properties like Acidity, Alkalinity, Wind Speed, etc. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A voltage drop **test** can tell you if your **battery** cable is the problem. Using the Voltage setting on the multimeter, first, touch the probes to the **battery** terminals to determine the voltage of the **battery**. A fully charged **battery** should have about 12 volts ready to go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The alternator serves as the brain of your car making it one of the most important electrical components of your car. If your alternator breaks down, your car won’t start. That’s why it's crucial to keep up with maintenance and **test** the health of your alternator every now and then. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, care must be ensured that the **battery** should be sufficiently rested before measuring the voltage. We recommend measuring after leaving the car unused for a few hours. If you find the multimeter readings a bit too complex to make sense of, it is nothing to worry about. In this article, we will be providing you with everything you need to know while **test**ing a **battery** with a multimeter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should also check the Reserve Capacity rating (RC), which is the time (in minutes) a **battery** will deliver 25A and maintain 10.5V. You are looking for a higher reserve capacity should the charging system fail. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Every garage should have a multimeter. Anybody can pick up a decent one for less than $40, and it can be used to **test** all types of electrical connections on your car. Battery? Test it. Relay? Test it. Alternator? Test it! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By pressing the “Load Test” button, you’re simulating a start cycle. The **battery** should be able to hold 8.5 volts for 15 seconds at 0 degrees Fahrenheit. If it doesn’t, then you know the **battery** is at least part of the problem. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The other thing every garage needs is a **battery** charger. Trickle chargers have gotten smaller, cheaper, and more sophisticated over the years. You can pick up a Black+Decker charger that you simply plug in and not think about for around $30. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   At this point you’re ready to start the car with the charged **battery**. Let it run for 5-10 minutes. After waiting, go ahead and try to start the car with the previously dead **battery**. If it starts, let it idle for at least 20 minutes if you don’t plan on immediately driving. If you do take off right away, drive for at least 5-10 miles to completely charge the **battery** back up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You should be aware that at colder temperatures, the readings will be lower. All of the figures given below are for batteries **test**ed at 21°c. If it is colder than this when you **test** your **battery** then you can expect slightly lower readings, which will not be a reflection on the performance of your **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   CAUTION: car batteries should never be overcharged. Once they reach full charge, it is time to unplug the charger. This is where smart units are advantageous, preventing damage and thus extra cost. Also, avoid running a known bad **battery** as you could end up ruining the alternator. They are built to maintain charge as opposed to keeping dead ones alive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dimming lights is a potentially good indicator of the strength of your **battery**. Not just your headlights but the interior lights of your vehicle as well. You will notice issues with your other electrical mechanisms such as power windows or anything you plug in, like a phone charger. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Does the car **battery** read more than 12.45 volts? If it does, then it has a proper charge. But if you record lesser values, recharge the cell and take to an auto shop for **test**ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is nothing more annoying than going out to your car in the morning and finding that the **battery** has gone flat and the car won’t start. It can ruin your plans for days whilst you work out alternative transport arrangements and get any potential maintenance problems fixed. Keeping an eye on your **battery** and regularly checking its performance is the best way to avoid this from happening. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To measure the car-off current draw, you'll need a multimeter capable of reading current, preferably one with a 10- or 20-amp capacity, but a 200 milliamp lower scale. Start with a fully charged **battery**. Either make sure the doors are closed or wedge the door switch shut. Turning off the dome light isn't good enough—on many cars, an open door will activate several circuits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   How to **test** a car **battery** is simple with Carly. Simply plug in the Carly Universal OBD Scanner to your car’s OBD2 port, fire up the Carly app on your smartphone, wait for the two to establish a connection and you’re up and running. If you’ve got a BMW, there’s an additional benefit as you can register your **battery** with Carly and obtain a deep analysis of its health condition. If your vehicle is of another make, you can still view standard **battery** errors under the Health Diagnostic section of the Carly app. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The results of a charge **test** do not show if you have a bad or good **battery**. Instead, it signifies the present condition of the charge. So if the cell has low power, a quick top-up can make it work. Overall, good batteries store energy better than weak ones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you prefer using the alternator, start by charging the engine with a pair of jumper cables. Next, drive the vehicle for less than 30 minutes. You can even charge the **battery** by removing it from the vehicle, and taking it to an auto parts store. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The multimeter will highlight your car **battery**’s voltage as being between 12.5V to 12.6V, the outside temperature and the type of **battery** will affect the **battery** voltage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Note that you’ll most likely be able to jump a dying **battery** to get somewhere, but there’s a good chance it won’t start under its own power if you try it again with the same bad **battery** (i.e. don’t strand yourself somewhere). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do you remember how your car’s clock resets, and you lose your radio presets when the **battery** goes flat and has to be replaced? This is only the tip of the iceberg; the computer systems themselves will reset under a dead **battery**. In fact, on older and simpler EFI cars, disconnecting the **battery** is one way of resetting the ECU or Engine Control Unit. However, on newer cars with complex computer systems, you do not want to do this — no matter which way you decide how to **test** a car **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The newer batteries in cars don’t give you access to the cells because they are meant to be “maintenance free.” But if you have an older **battery**, you will be able to view each cell. There may be a plastic cover over the cells or a separate cap for each one. Be careful if you decide to investigate the **battery** cells because they contain sulfuric acid mixed with water. If you were to get this mixture onto your skin, it could become very painful and lead to an injury. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You have to put a heavy load on a **battery** to **test** its capacity. Some garages use a heavy discharge **test**er; a similar **test**, though less conclusive, can be made with a standard voltmeter. Remove the high-tension lead from the coil so that the engine turns but will not start. Connect the voltmeter across the **battery** terminals. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Why should you **test** your car **battery**? The car **battery** deteriorates over time, much like the other components on your car. However, it gives precious little warning before completely failing, and can cause a serious issue if you are pressed for time or faced with a transportation urgency. Thankfully, there are ways you can periodically **test** your car **battery**, and utilize diagnostic solutions such as Carly to monitor and maintain it in good condition throughout its lifespan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A good **battery** should measure between 12.2V and 12.9V. If you want to **test** a **battery** in cold areas, the power probe method comes as an ideal solution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you have determined that the current drain you're reading is safe, gradually reduce the meter's scale to the appropriate low range, probably 2 amps or 200 mA. You are now reading the parasitic drain on the **battery**. Some vehicles will show as little as 10 mA residual drain. Others, probably high-end cars with lots of high-end gadgets, will draw more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We hope you enjoyed this read on measuring the voltage of the **battery** using a multimeter. You might find the procedure a bit tricky at first, but it is rather easy once you learn how to read the multimeter. For any queries, do contact us. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to keep a car **battery** in perfect condition, you will have to **test** its ability to maintain a charge. You can perform this task in your home by using a multimeter, hydrometer, or power probe. But if you prefer professional help, take the **battery** to an auto spare part store. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After charging, perform the same **test** as above to see if the **battery** now registers in the 12.6V range. If not, consider getting it checked out fully prior to a replacement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another thing to remember with newer cars is that if an electrical source causes the power to be drained from the **battery**, this is called “parasitic loss.” This can happen when your engine and all the vehicle’s lights are turned off too. Why? Because there are certain electronic systems and features in your car which are still consuming power after your car is turned off, such as the clock and computer. These things won’t normally drain too much power from your **battery** but if you suspect they are, then either remove the **battery** completely or simply disconnect it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Start hunting by putting your ammeter in series with the **battery**'s ground circuit. Disconnect the **battery**'s ground cable and wire the ammeter in series between the **battery** terminal and the cable. Start with the meter on the highest range, probably 10 or 20 amps. Warning! Doing something silly, like trying to start the car or turn on the headlights—anything that draws more than the meter's rated capacity—can blow the meter's fuse. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **battery** is a vulnerable component because it can be weakened by age, temperature, and even vibration. But it’s not the only component that needs to be inspected and replaced, and as the years have gone by, it’s become one of the more expensive components in the charging system. There was a time when $75 would buy the best **battery** on the shelf. These days, you’re looking at $140 to $200. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Disconnecting the car **battery** is one of the most popular DIYalternator **test**s, but it’s not always a good idea because it can kill your voltage regulator or cause a massive spark that damages your vehicle’s computer system. That’s where Jerry , the super app and car insurance expert comes in. We’ll walk you through how to safely **test** your alternator by disconnecting your car **battery** cables in this step-by-step guide. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have less than 13.8 volts or higher than 14.4 volts, then your alternator is undercharging or overcharging. Either one of these situations could mean that your **battery** life is running short and that you need to investigate the problem further. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The car **battery** is continually charging and discharging throughout its life. It is charged while the engine is running, slowly discharges when the car is parked and faces an abrupt discharge when the starter motor is activated. That is why it’s recommended to connect a trickle charger to the **battery** if a car is going to be parked for the winter, for example. Temperature extremes can also accelerate the deterioration of the **battery**. The average lifespan of a car **battery** is around three to five years, but if you’re using cheaper batteries in temperature extremes, two years of life is not uncommon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Load **test**er: The **test** involves applying a load to the cell while the checker checks the voltage on it. If you have a reading of 9.6 volts, consider replacing the **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A hydrometer comes as an alternative way to confirm the state of a traditional car **battery**. Since this cell has caps, you can reach its interior cells (with the tool). However, avoid any contact with the liquids as they can damage your skin, apparatus, or the **battery** itself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sometimes the **battery** will be so damaged that it’s unable to take a charge for a jumpstart, too. The best way to find out for sure is by taking your **battery** somewhere that does free **battery** **test**ing. Auto parts stores like O’Reilly, Autozone, and Advance Auto Parts will all do this—then you can buy a new one right there if need be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pop open the hood of your car and hook it into place so you can identify the positive and negative **battery** terminals. Don’t worry, the car **battery** terminals are color-coded and marked so they can be easily identified. The positive **battery** terminal is red with a plus (+) sign and the negative **battery** terminal will be black and have a minus (–) sign. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Usually, you can find the **battery** in the hood of the vehicle. But some car companies install batteries in hard to find spots like the back seat or trunk. Others place it inside the wheels of the cars. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Check the **battery**'s state of charge with a hydrometer , which measures the strength of the acid in the electrolyte , or **battery** fluid. This gives no clue, however, to the **battery**'s capacity - its ability to sustain a charge well enough to perform its tasks. Battery capacity depends on the size and number of the plates in each cell . If any plates are damaged, that cell's capacity is reduced. The electrolyte in a sealed-for-life **battery** cannot be checked readily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While the engine is running, the voltmeter should measure between 13.6 and 14.7 volts. For a rested **battery**, this should be around 12.6 volts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Look at the readings from all the cells and look for differences. If you notice a difference of 0.0025 to 0.05, you should swap your current **battery** for a new one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A. Assuming there is nothing wrong with the **battery**, it should start. However, during a time when a **battery** is not used, there are all sorts of issues that could arise, including corrosion that could damage the **battery** and cause it to short. If you have a bad **battery**, you wont be able to jump it, but if it’s just low on charge, it should work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can confirm that your alternator is failing by disconnecting the **battery** and performing a simple **test**. However, just because it’s a simple **test** doesn’t mean it is a safe **test** for you or your vehicle. That’s why it’s important to pay attention to the steps below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Anything under the 75% charge rate, or about 12.45V, generally indicates the **battery** is undercharged and will need recharging. It does not, however, indicate that it is bad. If after recharging it doesn’t hold the charge, then it is probably on its way out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the **battery** is not working properly, then it might be time to check the Alternator. The alternator charges the **battery**. First of all, turn on all the headlights, and other electrical appliances in the car. If the multimeter reading is less than 13.15, then the alternator is faulty and ought to be replaced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the left is a **battery** load **test**er. On the right is an old-school analog multimeter., Amazon / Depositphotos - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your car uses a 12-volt **battery**, and a multimeter should read between 12.5 and 12.8 for a healthy **battery**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Take off the **battery** caps and dip in the tip of the hydrometer. After covering the tool with **battery** liquid, press the bulb on the hydrometer to push out the air. Collect some of the fluid into the machine by releasing the bulb and measure the specific gravity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to **test** the cells individually, then a hydrometer-type of **battery** **test**er is needed because it can measure the **battery** acid’s gravity. You will know if the cell is bad or good based on how many balls are floating. Even if you know that you have dead cells, it would be like knowing that your **battery** can’t hold a charge that is 12.6 volts. Therefore, you might as well do the resting voltage **test** because it is faster, easier, and just as effective. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The specific gravity of a good **battery** should fall between 1.265 to 1.299. If it goes lower than this range, then you have an undercharged cell. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You've determined you have excessive current draw from the **battery**. Now you have to figure out where. If it's not obvious, like the trunk light not going off, you have to get methodical. You can throw caution to the wind and start pulling fuses one at a time, until you see the excess drain drop off. Just be careful to get them back into the right socket. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But if you know what to do next, jumping or replacing a **battery** doesn’t seem like such a daunting challenge. Although jumping will usually do the trick, older and less healthy batteries could end up causing all sorts of issues. Here what to do if you have a lifeless car on your hands. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
