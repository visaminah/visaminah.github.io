-   Once you have your **container**s, you are going to want to modify them to make them habitable. This means cutting holes for doors and windows and reinforcing these areas.

Insulating your shipping **container** is important in order to prevent condensation and maintain your desired temperature when you are converting a shipping **container** into a home, office, or any other type of conversion! Shipping **container**s are made from ‘Corten Steel’ or known as ‘Weathering Steel’; these steel compounds enable **container**s to be weatherproof and sturdy for spending many months out at sea. Your shipping **container** home will need to be insulated properly as steel is a conductor of heat, meaning that your **container** home may get really hot, or really cold if you do not use insulation. So, what insulation is the best and how much will it **cost**? For your **container** home, you will need to add insulation such as Rockwool, Kingspan, Spray-foam and cover with ply-lining. However, the type of insulation you will need will depend on the weather conditions the **container** will be located in as this will impact the type of insulation and how much insulation you will require. Overall, there is no definitive price that we can provide as the **cost** of the insulation will vary rapidly depending on what type of weather conditions you live in, and how big your **container** home will be and what type of insulation you will need. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Of course, there are also disadvantages to new shipping **container**s. For starters, they’re not an eco-friendly option. Because these are new **container**s, they’ll need to be manufactured. Used **container**s recycle old **container**s, which prevents waste. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   : The most inspired of shipping **container** architecture solves the inherent size constraints of building with these narrow modules by bridging multiple shipping **container**s together in unique configurations that maximize space and adding balconies and wrap-around porches that seamlessly blend indoor and outdoor living. While certainly inspiring, accomplishing these novel architectural feats naturally come with expensive steel reinforcing beams. Prospective clients selecting shipping **container**s purely as an “affordable alternative” to traditional building should thus be made aware of the limited space and architectural customization of a shipping **container** build.

-   You also don’t know what the **container** was shipping when it was in use. You never really know what you’re going to get when you buy a used **container**.

-   Possible structural problems : Shipping **container**s are structurally sound in their existing state. But when cuts are made—to add doors, windows, roof openings and skylights, large hollows to conjoin multiple **container**s, etc.—the original strength of the shipping **container** becomes compromised. Clients seeking a **container** build, thus, should be made aware that reinforcements with metal or wood will need to be made, and necessary framing with traditional drywall will significantly cut into the overall living space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   One **cost** that isn’t on the list is land. You’ll need to purchase your own land, and there’s no way to estimate this **cost**.
