-   We're well-documented fans of designing in a **blue** color scheme. As much as we're partial to a bold pop of purple or a wash of muted green, there's something about the color **blue** that just has astounding versatility. And if we were to play favorites, we'd have to say that navy **blue**—one of the most iconic shades ever—is the epitome of everything we love about this part of the color wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Right now, certain colors seem more popular than others (we're looking at you, hot pink), but one shade that never goes out of style is navy **blue**. It continues to be a mainstay in our wardrobe year-round, whether we're rocking a striped navy and white swimsuit by the beach or bundling up in a knit navy sweater. However, despite this neutral being such a classic, deciding what colors go with navy **blue** can sometimes feel tricky. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This was one of the most common and popular color combinations out there. Pinterest is full of **blue** and green outfit ideas and we've also written an article before about wearing these two together...you can check it out in the link below. It seems that a limey pastely green is really popular with **blue** and so is mint green. They look so beautiful together and you can always balance it out with white or even some grey. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Blue and grey are the greatest of friends - they can complement each other in a colour scheme, and even blend into one another so seamlessly that you can barely tell where the boundary is. Dark greys and **blue**s can create a moody, storm-cloud atmosphere, while lighter duck egg shades are effortlessly elegant and soothing. Our favourite might have to be the middle ground of slate and petrol tones, where small changes in lighting can make the difference between perceiving the colour as grey or as **blue**. There's something for all tastes in this colour combination, so scroll down for our best-loved ways to pull it off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Opting for dark **blue**s and greys can create a scheme with drama and impact as well as a cozy and inviting feeling. Alternatively, if bold and dark isn't for you, then combining light and airy **blue**s and greys also works effectively, creating an elegant and sophisticated look that is soothing, explains Emma Detering. 'The brighter shades and muted hues help create a calming space that can be updated time and time again with more affordable accessories to refresh the look. You can really add texture and dimension to this by layering light and airy linens and natural textures that pay homage to the coastal look.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another neutral option that can be combined with almost any palette, but you need to consider some of the nuances. White looks more attractive with cold shades—think **blue**, light **blue**, black, graphite. However, beige and sand will work too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When choosing a specific gray shade for your room's color palette, you should start by choosing a tone of color. Warm grays are slightly tinted with either orange, yellow, or red, making them appear a bit cozier—they may even look almost beige. Cooler-toned grays have been cut with shades of **blue**, green, or purple. The resulting gray hue feels clean, crisp, and modern. True to its "neutral" title, gray really goes with almost every other color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Glamorous yet relaxed, a grey-on-white scheme can make a surprisingly bold style statement. The first thing to bare in mind, however, is that not all greys and whites **match**, so it's often best to stick with a pure white that will complement everything from 'greige' to silver. Consider the best white paint for walls, because choosing the right shade will make or break the overall look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Grey is essential in any wardrobe – its versatility in pairing with other colours and textures is un**match**ed. Grey can handle the brightest brights and loudest prints and still create a well-put-together look. Even outfits in varying shades of grey will be sophisticated and well-balanced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After taking a peek at some street style inspiration, we've realized it doesn't matter. Red, pink, beige, black — mysteriously, all the colors go with navy **blue**. Don't believe us? Here are a few great navy outfit ideas to prove it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Define **blue**-greys with an indigo **blue** accent. The darkness of the indigo will highlight the **blue** undertones in the grey, if you want a cooler shade. When used in a bedroom you can always layer linen throws, wool blankets, wicker baskets and felt cushions to cosy up the look. A **blue** patterned wallpaper helps to add personality to the scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

Ahead, see 11 chic ways the fashion set wears navy **blue** and shop pieces inspired by their looks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Jeans come in all colors these days, but classically they belong to the **blue** family, and as explained above, **blue** is a perfect **match** for grey. Jeans come in all sorts of washes, from very dark – navy to acid washed – basically white, all hues complemented beautifully with a grey tank, blouse, or sweater. Jeans paired with a grey top can make up an outfit for any occasion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A well-put-together wardrobe should be centered around a few staple pieces. These garments should include various items that can be mixed and **match**ed easily with many other options. One of the most important things about these base items is that they should come in neutral tones – making them the most versatile and reliable options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   "We get this question all the time, and guys often find it hard to believe that **blue** and black can look great in the same outfit," says Thread stylist Millie Rich. "Dark shades naturally work well together, so there's no danger of clashing, and the combination of **blue** and black looks particularly sophisticated." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By reds, we mean all the different tones of red, especially because this is a tricky color pairing and so you need to find the perfect shade of **blue** with the perfect shade of red or even burgundy. We found that a really bright red with a royal **blue** go beautifully together, but is definitely a statement. For a more subtle look, you can go for more muted raspberry reds or the ones that are borderline burgundy.

-   'Lemon yellow and soft smoke **blue** complement each other so perfectly. The tone of each of these colors is gentle which draws you into a room.

-   Decorating with white is guaranteed to make spaces feel brighter and lighter but they can feel cold. Adding in a variety of delicate tones of grey and **blue** through textiles and furniture can help to gently lift the space preventing it from feeling stark and austere. Here, a patterned light **blue** rug, textured grey sofa and armchairs, a pastel **blue** table frame and dusky **blue** velvet cushions are all layered to bring softness and interest to the scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   'Grey can be surprisingly versatile and will happily layer with many colours such as inky **blue**s, smoky greens and rose pinks,' explains Patrick O’Donnell on behalf of Farrow & Ball. Giving Sulking Room Pink, Inchyra Blue and Green Smoke as examples. 'However, if you want to keep the palette more monochromatic, layer tones of grey like Ammonite with Mole’s Breath.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many guys don’t really like this color, as it can come off as too feminine. However, if you’ve bought a light pink shirt or sweater, it’s relatively easy to combine with other colors. Keep in mind that bright shades require accuracy. Soft shades of the palette can be safely worn with **blue**, grey, white, beige, brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Street casual style isn’t too strict, but minimalism prevails, so muted shades are preferable to bright ones. You can safely combine neutral and more expressive colors, for example, grey and burgundy. The most popular here will be **blue**, black, brown, and white to refresh the outfit as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A lot of people fear wearing **blue** and navy with black...a fashion rule i've broken way too many times and enjoyed doing so. Blues can actually look really beautiful with black, especially a bright royal **blue**, a teal or cerulean. There's also something really beautiful about the contrast between black and a baby **blue**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ’When introducing colour accents to lighter greys, think about the undertones of the pairing first and then the contrast you wish to achieve. Ammonite a soft stony grey will team beautifully with **blue**s and greens such as Inchyra Blue or Hague Blue as both have the gentle undertones of nature, such as the delicate brown note found in Ammonite and the green in Inchyra Blue.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However it isn't just accent colors that work with **blue** and grey, they also pair beautifully with a range of materials. David Harris, design director at Andrew Martin, says that, 'dark **blue**s, greens and greys work really well with marble, brass and walnut.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you're thinking of pairing grey and **blue** with other colors then, 'go for something well balanced like our ‘French Grey’ family,' says Ruth Mottershead, creative director of Little Greene (opens in new tab). 'These greys can be paired with other shades with ease, combining well with **blue**s, greens and pinks. Accent colors should be used to highlight and work in tandem with the base shade rather than against it.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With browns the shade is also essential. Light brown tones look good paired with a cream shade, **blue**, and white. Dark ones will make an exciting contrast with **blue**, black, burgundy, dark greens. All brown options look gorgeous with white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   ‘Our clients were moving from a coastal location. I knew we were going to use many tones of **blue** in the house, so I needed a clean backdrop that would bring out the **blue** tones – Benjamin Moore (opens in new tab)’s Revere Pewter was the perfect complement! This warm paint balanced the cool tones in the fabrics and rugs creating the perfect backdrop for this home.' - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Orange is really scary for a lot of people, but when done right it can be a masterpiece. I feel like when it comes to wearing orange and **blue** together it's go big or go home. Their brightness is their beauty and when embraced can be really powerful. However, for those looking for subtler options, you can wear a cerulean **blue** with a tangerine or go for a deep or navy **blue** to tone down the brightness of the orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This combination might be the most difficult but, at the same time, the most effective. Combining these colors in men’s clothing, you need to tread subtly. The same rule applies here as for the combination of red and **blue**, and you can limit yellow or red to small accent pieces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want your grey to remain cool and tranquil, watery shades of **blue** are the ideal colour to introduce. The grey retains an air of sophistication to stop the **blue**s becoming too coastal when layered together. Painted furniture, statement artwork and soft furnishings are a great way to add this deep **blue** without it overpowering. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Together **blue** and grey work well with lots of other colors, so it's not a wonder the palette is popular for decorating. 'Blues work well on their own or can really come to life when combined with other shades within the palette for a harmonious interior; off-white, greens and greys are classic combinations but contrasting pinks and reds are increasing in popularity for a layered look.' says Dominic Myland, director of Mylands Paints. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can position yourself as a calm, strong-willed, reliable man with intelligence using **blue** clothes, as well as its relevant shades, ranging from **blue** to indigo **blue**.
