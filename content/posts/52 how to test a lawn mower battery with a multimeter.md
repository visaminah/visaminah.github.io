## 52 Tips to How To Test A Lawn Mower Battery With A Multimeter | Thread: Is my Lawn Mower Battery Bad?
-   While corrosion is normal and pretty easy to clean up, swelling and structural damage to a battery is a more serious issue. You don’t want to end up with a battery that leaks all over or ends up exploding from excess pressure. If you’re worried about the integrity of your lawn **mower**’s battery, swap it out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best way to help the battery last longer is to keep everything clean and dry and protect the battery terminals from corrosion during the mowing season. When wintering over your lawn **mower**, disconnect the battery and store it in a clean, dry spot, preferably where it won’t freeze. Consider using a 12V float charger to keep it in optimum condition for the next season. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The service life of your **mower** battery is normally two to three years. But a well-maintained battery will serve up to four years. If you notice some abnormalities in your **mower**’s battery like cracks, leaks, and broken post terminals, then your battery may have reached the end of its useful lifespan. It is preferable to replace it as it will no longer work properly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In the case of your lawn**mower**, you know that the voltage should be around 12 Volt. Use the setting that can handle this voltage a best as possible. In the case of the example, it would be the 0 to 20 Volt setting. Always make sure that the maximum voltage is larger than the voltage you expect to measure. If you do not know the voltage you are going to measure, start with the biggest setting and move downwards until you found the best one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have my first riding **mower** (a not recent Craftsman/Briggs). Always been finicky to start but now it just clicks and rotates a few inches. So I need to get my first **multimeter** as I begin to learn to troubleshoot it. I’m certain if I went by reviews and then bought one based on general internet research it would be missing a critical function for this, since I’m a total noob here, but looking forward to doing the stuff owners can do. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I tested it with a **multimeter** and it said 12.5 volts. So I guessed it's not the battery, I checked the oil and that was fine, could be a fuel line issue that's above what I can fix on my own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’ve confirmed with your DMM that the battery and connections are weak, then it’s likely time for a new lawn **mower** battery. You might be able to revive it with a charger, but the damage might already be irreversible if the voltage is less than 7.5 volts. If it still won’t hold a charge after a few hours on a slow charge, replace it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To take a voltage reading for a 12-volt battery just set the **multimeter** to the DC or A setting at 13 volts, put the red lead on the positive battery terminal, and the black lead on the negative terminal. Your **multimeter** should then display the voltage of your battery. If you get a reading of less than 12.6 volts, go on to step two. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Any reading higher than 1 Ohm or the **multimeter** showing “O.L” means the cable is faulty and you should replace it. Nonetheless, you may proceed to the next step. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If all is well with the solenoid, turning the power supply on should result in a clicking sound from the solenoid. Connect your **multimeter** to the solenoid posts and set it to voltage to ensure that the reading matches the 12 V of the power supply. If you get a lower reading, then not all of the power from the power supply is reaching the solenoid which indicates damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Starter solenoids draw about 8 amps to 10 amps from the lawn **mower** battery to power the starter motor. For comparison, a current of 0.01 amps is enough to cause you severe pains, and a current of more than 0.1 amps is enough to be fatal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A family member took a look, insisted on trying to jumpstart the battery despite me showing him the **multimeter** showing the battery is fine. He jumped it... and the lawn**mower** started right up, so that was the problem after all. But then how was it showing that the battery is fine with the **multimeter**? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Maybe the culprit is your lawn **mower** battery — or maybe it’s not. Before you condemn the battery, take a voltage reading with a quality digital **multimeter** (DMM). A fully charged 12V battery should read at least 12.6 volts, while a moderately discharged battery might only read 10.5 volts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The process is the same as above. You would need to connect the probes to the battery terminals. Then proceed to check the reading on the **multimeter** display. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This article contains information on how different forms of battery drainage occur in lawn**mower**s. We’ll cover some testing procedures to help you diagnose the issue, as well as a chart showing the pros and cons of different battery choices if a replacement is needed. Proper maintenance can also extend your battery’s lifespan, so we’ll cover that as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The first way to test the voltage regulator is thru the battery. The only tool you will need is a **multimeter** or voltmeter. Then follow the simple steps below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Ampere setting is to measure the current. Some devices can only measure the DC current, and some can also measure the AC current. The last main type is Resistance. This is used to measure the Resistance of something. In your lawn**mower** case, you can use this to check if a cable is ok or if it is broken. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If we focus on the DC Voltage, there are two types of Digital Multimeters. One type of **multimeter** has only one setting for DV Voltage. The other has many different settings for it. If you have different settings for it, you can see that they are meant for a certain DC voltage range. For example, 0 to 200V, 0 to 20V, and depending on the device, many different ones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the **multimeter** reading was close to 12.6 Volts, it means that the battery was charged and looks fine. But we have only checked it with no load. It is still possible that the reading is fine, but the battery is not in good shape. This is why we are going to test it again while it is being used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lawn **mower**s have a lot of parts and in the big picture work very similarly to cars. One of those parts is the voltage regulator. This part is similar to the alternator in a vehicle. The voltage regulator helps make sure the proper amount of charge is going back into the battery while the **mower** is running. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Firstly take a **multimeter** and place it on the table. Also, bring in the battery you want to test. We will explain the process with a 9-volt battery for this guide. To correctly measure the voltage, turn your switch dial to DC voltage measurement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, remove the flywheel housing located at the top of the lawn **mower**’s engine. Then unscrew the bolts from the top of the engine from the governor flap. Unhook the springs from the flap that connects to the carburetor and replace the flywheel on top of the engine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can test whether your lawn **mower**’s battery is fully charged by checking the voltage on each terminal with an auto-voltmeter set on DC scale. A good battery should read 12.6 volts; if it reads between 10 and 11 volts, then the battery needs to be replaced. You can also perform this test by seeing if there are any lights that come on when you try starting your **mower**—if none do and no power flows out of its terminals, then your electrical system is probably bad or shorted out somehow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A digital variant is easier to use and will always be the preferred choice, but again, it is not the only way to get the job done. There are a number of **multimeter**s available in the market today that simulate a load to test the battery. These devices can be great additions to your tool collection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’ve run through the symptoms of a bad lawn **mower** battery that I listed in the previous section, you’ve probably already done this step. But, if not, go ahead and make sure that the fluid in each cell is filled to the fill line. Then, check the exterior of the battery for damage or corrosion before using your **multimeter** to read the voltage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to change the battery on your lawn **mower**, first check to make sure it’s dead. You can do this by giving it a quick charge session, which should take about 12 hours. If the battery doesn’t click or buzz when you try to start it up after charging, it’s time for a new one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your **multimeter** has only one DC Voltage setting, your **multimeter** has a built-in feature that will find the best internal setting. It will automatically start with a high setting and then go down until it finds the best one. This goes so fast that you almost do not notice this. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The amount of horsepower in small engines for lawn **mower**s should on average have a horsepower of 550 ft pounds per second. In wattage that is about 745.7. When purchasing the lawn**mower** you should note the torque ratings to calculate how much power your lawn**mower** will produce under normal circumstances. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To test this theory: remove the spark plug from your gas-powered lawn **mower** engine. Start up the engine by turning on its fuel line and pushing down on its throttle lever until all of the air has been replaced by fuel in each cylinder of the engine (this will take about two seconds). With one hand holding onto an electrical wire connected to said spark plug (to ensure that no sparks fly), use your other hand to hold onto another electrical wire connected at points along one side of an empty glass bottle with water in it (do not touch any metal parts). Take care not to spill anything as this could cause injury! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The telltale sign of a lawn **mower** battery that’s dead is failure to charge fully or hold a charge. Usually, small engine battery problems reveal themselves when you try to turn the key and get the motor started. If the engine is having a hard time turning over or is clicking, your battery probably doesn’t have enough of a charge, and might be dead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The easiest way is to turn on the lights of the lawn**mower**. If your lawn**mower** does not have lights or another electrical attachment that you can use, you can use it to start the engine. If you can start the engine with no problems, the battery should be fine. If you notice that it has problems and is dead quickly, it means that the battery needs to be replaced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most starter interlock switches on lawn **mower**s are located under the seat or in the handle. If the contacts are bent, broken or corroded, or if mice have chewed through the wiring, the interlock won’t enable the starter motor — no matter how good the battery is. Use your DMM to trace the interlock circuit for repair or adjustment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I’ve battled draining lawn**mower** batteries off and on for years. Sometimes it’s a simple issue while other times the cause is more complex. If you are having this issue I want to help you understand what’s happening and how to prevent it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Turn the **multimeter** setting dial to voltage (∆V symbol represents voltage). See if the battery voltage reads 12 volts by taking the red lead and fastening it to the battery’s positive terminal. The black lead will then be placed on the negative. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before we continue, you have to make sure that the **mower** is off and that all electrical attachments are off. So the lights should be off, the ignition key should be off. If you are not sure if this is the case, you can always disconnect the battery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   All you need is a **multimeter** or voltmeter and to make sure you follow the steps provided. The key is to make sure you connect the meter right. Make sure the positive is connected to positive and negative to negative. Then start the **mower** and see if the voltage jumps or you get a reading. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Checking your lawn**mower** battery with a digital **multimeter** is a good method to know your battery’s health. A **multimeter** is a cheap and readily available device to perform the task. By following the instructions from the above article, you will be able to do the job at home with ease. Take necessary precautions as mentioned for a safe job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By using an alternator, it gives voltage to a running engine while also recharging the battery. If this doesn’t work, try a **multimeter** to check the voltage output in the alternator. This is done by using a wiring diagram that should come with the package. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Check the voltage regulator to see if the lawn**mower** engine is getting the amount of electricity needed to run. This can be done while the engine is running. This causes small engine batteries to run out if the voltage regulator isn’t functioning properly. Source - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But if you are confused about buying a **multimeter** because you do not know how to use it, here’s a guide that will provide the details. Read on to learn how to measure voltage levels for different types of cells. Also, we will tell you how to understand when to buy new batteries because they are running out of juice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another obvious one is if your lawn **mower** simply does not respond to attempts to start it. If your **mower** works using an ignition key or switch, never press or turn it for longer than 10 seconds as this could damage the solenoid. If your **mower** doesn’t start after a short try, turn it back off and try again several times rather than holding the ignition for too long. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have a removable water reservoir, remove it and check the fluid level. If the level is low, you’ll need to add some more. This should be done every month or so if you use your lawn **mower** regularly. You can use distilled water instead of tap water to avoid corrosion and mineral buildup in your battery over time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To begin the test, move the lawn**mower** onto your driveway and put it in park for a proper working space. Then turn on the engine and headlights. With work gloves, look at the voltage regulator (as referenced in the machine’s manual) where the recharge battery station is. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is where knowing how to restore a lawn **mower** battery comes in handy. In some cases, you can add more distilled water to your battery and get it working as it should again. If you’ve got low fluid levels and some free time, get a pair of gloves and some distilled water and give this a shot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lawn**mower**s built before 1980 will have a 6-volt battery and can easily be damaged when it is left to overcharge. If the battery has 10amps or more it will not function properly if overcharged. To avoid this, set a timer so you know when to unplug the charger from the lawn**mower** or buy a different charger that monitors the battery. Both options help to prevent overcharging which can cause the battery to stop working. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the battery is losing power quickly, there are a few things to consider. It could be that the battery is too old to hold a charge for longer periods of time. It could also be that the battery has become too hot and cannot supply enough power to keep your **mower** running smoothly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most of the lawn**mower**s are equipped with a rechargeable battery, so keep it charging for an additional hour and retest if your DMM reveals a reading of less than the battery’s voltage. Replace it on a priority basis. Water level: You should check the water level in the liquid Lead batteries. Your battery should be filled to the optimum level. If the water level is low, that may cause damage to the cells. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If your lawn **mower** battery does charge fully, the charge should not drain if it is not in use. Troubleshoot continued problems by using a **multimeter** (service part number 19602) to see if your battery drains power while not in use. If it holds the charge through testing, you may have an issue with the alternator. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This sound can be heard as soon as you turn on the ignition key. It’s not uncommon for this clicking sound to continue for a few seconds before it stops. This indicates that enough power has been supplied through an alternator (which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy) located in close proximity to your lawn **mower**’s engine compartment so that it can engage with its starter relay and turn over its engine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   After connecting the wires with the **multimeter**, the next step is to check the terminals’ locations on the battery. Hold the free ends of the **multimeter** probes in your hand. You can have probes with a needlepoint or ones that have a crocodile end. The last ones are handy as you can clamp them on the battery terminals. The needle ones need to be held against the battery terminals. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The rotten smell of battery after some usage is a symptom that the battery is overheating. You should check your lawn **mower**’s instructions to ensure that you are not overcharging or running it on an uneven surface. If none of these things apply and you still smell a rotten odor coming from the battery, it may be time for a replacement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A standard lawn**mower** engine should show that it has 6 or 12 electric volts. There is a specific kind of electrical drainage in lawn **mower** engines called parasitic electrical drainage. This is when the lawn**mower** engine is off and yet the electrical system drains the battery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
