## 34 Things About What Is 2 Ply Modified Bitumen Roofing | 2 ply modified bitumen roofing details
-   "In general, shingles are recommended for 3:12 pitch or more," says Ami Feller, Expert Review Board member and owner of Roofer Chicks in New Braunfels, Texas. "You can install them with a pitch of 2:12, but I recommend putting ice and water shield under the shingles at that low of a pitch. Modified **bitumen** is recommended for 5:12 to 3:12 pitch roofs. Mod bit is not made to handle ponding water, so you have to have a slope for it to work properly, even if it's just a small slope." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Modified Bitumen Systems are typically seen as the next generation of asphaltic or pitch based Built Up Roofs (BUR). It carries many of the same strengths as a traditional BUR roof system, while the modified **bitumen** installation can be completed in a much safer and less expensive method. At Chaffee Roofing, we typically install self adhered modified **bitumen** roof systems due to their safe and effective installation technique. Self adhered modified **bitumen** roof systems are similar to fully adhered single ply roofs, in that the entire system is adhered to the - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you need to install new **roofing**, there are a number of different elements to consider. Your local **roofing** contractor can advise you on the best option for your specific situation, but let's take a look at which roof covering wins in these key categories. Ask your **roofing** contractor what they recommend to find out if asphalt shingles are right for your roof . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Over the past 50 years or so, modified **bitumen** **roofing** has evolved from being an experimental innovation to one of the most common commercial **roofing** systems in the industry. Its tensile strength, durability, and relative ease of installation have made it the **roofing** material of choice for millions of projects worldwide. But what, exactly, is modified **bitumen** **roofing**, and what makes it superior to other **roofing** types? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Overall, the efforts were successful. Modified **bitumen** proved to be easier to install while providing enhanced protection compared to BUR systems, even in very cold temperatures. By 1975, modified **bitumen** was in wide use here in the United States, and today, it has all but replaced BUR as one of the most reliable **roofing** materials on the market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thickness – A modified **bitumen** **roofing** system is one of the most trusted roof systems because of its inherent thickness. A 2-ply mod-bit system with a granulated cap sheet is typically 240 MILS thick or more. On the other hand, a typical single-ply thermoplastic roof membrane is often 60 MILs. Where membrane thickness is a concern, modified **bitumen** is the winner because of its inherent thickness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No matter how big or small the problem is, Garland can help. We are a true building envelope solutions provider with commercial **roofing** products and services designed for the whole building, from the foundation to the roof and everything in between. Let us connect you with your local Garland rep who can offer a roof inspection. Then together, we can work toward identifying your **roofing** system's problems and solving the issues with the right **roofing** material. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pro: EPDM can be installed in a variety of ways, again depending on your building’s needs. Locally the most common method has been by loose laying the field area and then ballasting the membrane with 2” river rocks. Other methods of installing can be using low VOC adhesives or mechanical attachment, either way, **roofing** contractors don’t have to use open flame torches or extremely hot industrial heat guns to apply EPDM. This greatly reduces the fire risk to the building during installation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Compared with single-ply membranes, which are applied in one layer of 40–80 mils thickness, Fireguard SBS systems are applied in 2–3 ply applications ranging in thickness from 220 mils to 300 mils. The redundancy of multiple layers reduces chances of workmanship error and increases the ability of the **roofing** system to withstand traffic and numerous penetrations. Fireguard SBS systems consist of a base, ply, and cap membrane (over wood and lightweight concrete), and a 2-ply over-insulated substrate. The system weighs 200–240 lbs/100 square feet, depending on the warranty duration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Fireguard SBS **roofing** system is manufactured with fire-retardant chemicals, qualifying the assembly for the UL Class A/B fire rating over combustible and noncombustible deck. The system is also listed with F.M. (Factory Mutual) to meet I-90 wind uplift. It also meets ASTM D 6162, 6163 standards for SBS-modified **bitumen** membranes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This re**roofing** project for a low-income apartment complex in downtown Vancouver is helping reduce atmospheric pollution. The roof is a two-ply Siplast SBS-modified **bitumen** system featuring a cap sheet surfaced with Eco-Activ depolluting Noxite® granules. As well as meeting the city's initiative to reduce environmental impacts, the use of torch-grade material to avoid hot asphalt fumes minimized disruption to tenants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   SBS (Styrene-Butadiene Styrene) – The addition of styrene-butadiene styrene to **bitumen** gives it a synthetic rubber modification. When heated, SBS becomes sticky and fundamentally different, lacking the liquid flow of heated APP. Since SBS doesn’t melt the way APP does, it requires less heat, which makes it faster to install. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Modified Bitumen has been around since the late 1800’s. Originally, it was primarily used against a building’s foundation however it eventually made its way up on to the roof. The most popular version of this was the old “Tar and Gravel” **roofing** membrane. During the 1950’s SBS modified **bitumen**, also known as “torch-on **roofing**” was developed. SBS torch-on has traditionally been the most popular flat **roofing** system in Metro Vancouver over the past 35 years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yes. Well-installed MB **roofing** is designed to withstand foot traffic. For areas that support building equipment or heavier foot traffic, the roof can be appropriately reinforced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   We frequently see building owner’s switching over from mod-bit to TPO or a coating before they remove & replace a mod-bit roof. Where building code allows, you will more often see owner’s do a TPO layover, or a silicone or acrylic coating, in order to extend the life of the existing roof and enjoy massive cost savings. Check out our short video to get a better idea of what re-**roofing** options are the best fit for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Fireguard SBS **roofing** systems are lightweight, multi-ply **roofing** systems with exceptional elasticity, puncture-resistance, and low-temperature flexibility. The components consist of a high-grade SBS-modified **bitumen** blend. The top layer (cap sheet FG(FT)160CWH) has two reinforcements consisting of a fiberglass and polyester mat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   SBS stands for styrene-butadiene-styrene, but it helps to think of SBS **roofing** as “elastic” or “rubberized” asphalt. This membrane combines asphalt with polymerized rubber for natural flexibility and elasticity. SBS is a good choice for buildings whose roofs expand and contract with extreme temperature changes, as well as roofs subject to higher winds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   EPDM is an extremely durable synthetic rubber **roofing** membrane that is widely used on flat and low-slope roofs. Its two primary ingredients, ethylene and propylene, are derived from oil and natural gas. First Introduced in the 1960’s, it became increasingly popular through the 1970’s and 1980’s in North America. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Contractor’s Warranty – This warranty covers the workmanship and installation of your **roofing** system by the contractor. The contractor can guarantee their work for a set time period (3, 5, 10-year period, etc.), or for the lifetime of the **roofing** system. A contractor’s warranty should contain the following: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using such thin materials has a significant drawback, all single-ply roof membranes are extremely easy to puncture. This means that they cannot withstand foot traffic and seriously inhibits maintenance access. Having only one level of adhesion, being directly installed onto the **roofing** substrate, and combined with their light weight makes them very susceptible to wind uplift, particularly on poorly sealed seams. If the system is chemically adhered to the **roofing** substrate then, due again to the thin construction, the adhesives used can degenerate quickly due to UV and thermal heating. As a result of these issues, the lifespan of single-ply roofs can be surprisingly short. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   By only using a single layer of waterp**roofing** all single-ply systems use fewer materials, making them comparatively cheap. The single-layer also allows for a faster installation time. Installation is relatively easy, requiring less training for contractors and fewer specialist tools. The single layer of thin material also minimises the thickness of the roof construction and the materials themselves are lightweight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Con: SBS is typically applied using an open-flame torch. This can, of course, increase the fire hazard to the building during construction. It’s essential that you hire a **roofing** contractor with a proven track record in following the proper fire safety protocols. Furthermore, one that has the proper insurance coverage for your project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Which one you choose depends on a number of factors including what you're **roofing**, the type of roof you have, and your budget. Aside from budget, the biggest deciding factor is the type of roof you're covering. If you're covering a shed or garage roof, you may not be too bothered about appearance or longevity, in which case, **bitumen** roll is a smart, cost-effective choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Repairability – No roof lasts forever, at some point in time you will have to get your roof serviced or even repaired. Unfortunately, your average handyman doesn’t know which repair products are compatible with every roof system. They will typically reach for “wet patch” or “**roofing** cement” to slap some tar in an effort to patch that emergency leak. Those products are often not compatible with single-ply systems, but they are often formulated for asphalt-based systems like modified **bitumen**. It may sound simple, but your typical off-the-shelf roof repair products work well with the modified **bitumen** roof system. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   EPDM and modified **bitumen** for flat **roofing** systems are some of the most common commercial **roofing** materials and are often compared against one and other. All buildings and roof assemblies are not the same. Depending on your building’s design, there will be pros and cons to each option available for your building. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Modified Bitumen Roof Systems have been installed since the mid 1970’s. A Modified Bitumen Roof System is typically installed with 1-3 ply’s, and comes in a wide variety of colors. There are many ways to install a modified **bitumen** roof, but the four most common methods are cold applied (liquid adhesives), torch applied (torch with open flame), hot applied (hot asphalt) and self adhered (adhesives built into the sheet). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   No matter which option works best for you and your budget, what’s most important is that you hire the right **roofing** company. A qualified and experienced company like Penfolds will ensure the proper materials and the best practices are utilized during installation of your flat roof. Ask about our financing options when you request your Free Estimate! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bitumen is the easiest to install when compared to asphalt shingles. Bitumen is installed in rolls 3 feet wide and 33 feet long, with nails placed at regular intervals along the length. Each course or strip should overlap the previous one by about 4 inches and each strip should be sealed with **roofing** cement. When installing shingles, each has to be nailed into place individually, which is a more time-consuming process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A leaky roof is a headache for any homeowner and it needs to be addressed, pronto. If you find yourself needing to re-roof part of your home, then you'll need to choose the right **roofing** material. Bitumen rolls and asphalt shingles are among the most common types, so let's take a closer look at how they differ, and which one works best in different categories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   SOPREMA combines a comprehensive line of commercial **roofing** solutions with decades of proven performance. We manufacture **roofing** products such as industry-leading SBS-modified **bitumen** **roofing** membranes, polymeric PMMA/PMA liquid-applied membranes and synthetic single-ply PVC membranes. We’re also a leading provider of **roofing** adhesive, **roofing** coatings such as mastics and primers, and various **roofing** fasteners. For superior adhesion on a variety of substrates, find out more about SOPREMA **roofing** applications. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tear-Resistant – The principal advantage that MB **roofing** has over other commercial **roofing** systems is its tear resistance. This is due to the combination of fiberglass and/or polyester reinforcement layers under its surface. This trait makes modified **bitumen** **roofing** an ideal choice for low-slope **roofing** with high foot traffic or rooftop equipment . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Compared with single-ply membranes that are applied in one layer of 40–80 mils thickness, Metalflex SBS systems are applied in 2–3-ply applications, ranging in thickness from 220 mils to 300 mils. The redundancy of multiple layers reduces the chance of workmanship error and increases the ability of the **roofing** system to withstand traffic and numerous penetrations. The Metalflex SBS system consists of a base, ply, and cap membrane (over wood and light weight concrete), and 2-ply over insulated substrate. The system weighs 175–225 lbs/100 square feet, depending on the warranty duration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A modified **bitumen** **roofing** system can be installed using the torch method, asphalts, or cold adhesives. A standard SBS modified **bitumen** roof system is a two-ply system applied in rolls overlapping the edge of the previous roll. The following can influence the end result of the **roofing** system’s installation: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Repair And Maintenance – Repair on an MB **roofing** system can be done quickly and efficiently using **bitumen** patches. Low-slope **roofing** failures usually occur on seals and flashing. However, with proper installation and a **roofing** maintenance program, such issues should be minimized. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
