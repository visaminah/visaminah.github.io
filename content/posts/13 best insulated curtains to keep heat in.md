-   Deconovo Silver Star Foil Printed Thermal Insulated Blackout Curtains for kids rooms £19.99 Buy now Buy now Pros: Silver foil printed stars provide a nighttime theme Cons: Lets in some daylight Get the kids ready for bed by adding some extra snuggly warmth and darkness by installing thermally **insulated** blackout **curtains**. Deconovo’s triple weave technology uses high density black yarn between two layers of fabric – although for these **curtains** you won’t achieve 100% blackout during daylight. This design has inward facing fabric printed with silver foil stars, which should induce a little extra night-time sleepiness as you tuck the kids into bed. We think the theme works best with the dark grey and black fabrics, but if your kids insist on something more colourful then there are plenty of green, blue and pink alternatives to choose from. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For the most effective curtinas, a middle layer will be constructed from thermally **insulated** material such as foam, felt or flannel. The layer that faces the window not only adds extra insulation, but it also helps to protect the **curtains** from sunlight. If this sounds like your choices are restricted to expensive heavy **curtains**, then some manage to weave the three layers together, making thinner options that are often lower in price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sleepdown Linen Look Eyelet Blackout Lined Thermal Curtains value £52.99 Buy now Buy now Pros: Decent quality for the price Cons: Creases take a while to drop out These cream bedroom and living room **curtains** are made from the thermally popular polyester but have a woven linen look that makes them appear more natural. The manufacturers boast of ‘triple weave technology’ and an ‘Eco film’ that does a good job of blocking out light (despite their light colour) and protects against UV, besides providing that much sought after thermal insulation. They’re a little thicker than other **curtains** in their price range and certainly have a look of quality, although you may hear the occasional grumble of creases taking a while to drop out. A good value choice that should suit most rooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Isla Thermal Blackout Ultra Midnight Blue Eyelet Curtains blackout £45.00 Buy now Buy now Pros: Three layers of blackout coating Cons: Can get quite creased It’s often the case that the extra layers added to thermal **curtains** help restrict light coming into a room, but for a total blackout you’ll need proper blackout **curtains**. They’re made of thick polyester with a velvety finish (which can get a bit creased) and have three layers of blackout coating which, it is claimed, also has thermal properties. They come with a further blackout lined panel that folds down behind the curtain pole to prevent light and draughts sneaking in through the eyelets. Hang them so the edges of your windows are sealed and you’ll be rewarded with darker (and warmer) days and nights. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another heavy fabric, suede **curtains** is another material that is also used in insulating **curtains**. As it also blocks lights and noise, this fabric can also be accountable during cold conditions. With these features, suede can help conserve every household to conserve energy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thermal **curtains** are constructed from multiple layers of material. The material that faces in towards the room is designed to look good, showing off a single colour or pattern, and is made from the kind of fabrics you would find in regular **curtains**, with polyester often preferred for its thermal properties. Behind this decorative fabric you will either get an additional lining or, in many cases, two or even three more layers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   H.Versailtex Thermal Blackout Curtain Drapes 52in x 84in funky design £67.00 Buy now Buy now Pros: Funky design on a triple layer fabric Cons: Not as thick or heavy as some thermal **curtains** If you favour a modern look to your soft furnishings, but don’t want to shell out the high prices fancy designers tend to charge, then we think your eye might be drawn (pun intended) to these **curtains**. The design is described as a ‘taupe and brown geo pattern’ which, to us, looks like a modern twist on 1970s home fashions (less brown colour variants are also available). It’s made of triple layer fabric that is finished with a silky feel that makes them seem a little more luxurious, and they’re durable and machine washable, although they lack the thickness and weight of some other thermal **curtains**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   John Lewis Textured Weave Recycled Polyester Blackout Lined Pencil Pleat Curtains pencil pleat **curtains** £45.00 Buy now Buy now Pros: Stylish look from recycled polyester Cons: Just two layers of fabric These pencil pleat **curtains** are made from recycled polyester and are dispatched in recycled packaging, so you can feel a little better about insulating your room with unnatural materials. At the top you’ll find three hook positions which give you hanging flexibility – go high if you want the **curtains** to hang beneath a pole, or low if you want to cover a track (hooks are not provided). They’re fitted with a blackout lining which, while not affording the full range of benefits some triple layer **curtains** provide, significantly improves the thermal insulation of your room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Habitat Plain Chenille Blackout Lined Thermal Curtain feel £40.00 Buy now Buy now Pros: Polyester chenille is warm and soft to touch Cons: Only comes in three colours 4.5/5 Did you know that ‘Chenille’ is French for caterpillar, and the fabric is named after it because it is said to resemble the little creatures’ fur? Now imagine gently stroking the furriest caterpillar you can find, and that might just be how these **curtains** feel. This chenille is made from polyester and, besides its exterior soft touch, it also has a thick firmness (and lining) that demands of the window not to let cold air or sunlight in. It only comes in three colours but we love the red ‘berry’, which has a rich intensity that suits the luxurious feel (although we don’t recall seeing any caterpillars showing off this particular hue). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Velvet is a fabric type that is known for its heavy and thickness features. This wideness provides privacy to particular areas in the home. Furthermore its heaviness can keep out the cold, making it an excellent material in thermal **curtains**. Crushed or full velvet **curtains** are excellent choices to provide instant warmth to the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ebern Designs Boler Leaf Pencil Pleat Room Darkening Thermal Curtains cotton **curtains** £124.99 Buy now Buy now Pros: Good quality cotton with attractive design Cons: Cotton is less insulating than polyester If you want some extra insulation from cotton **curtains** then make sure they’re of a good, thick quality and they have a lining – particularly if hung in a bright window, as cotton has a habit of fading in sunlight. Cotton may not be totally efficient at blocking light and retaining heat, but invest in good quality **curtains** and hang them right and you’ll certainly reap the benefits. Being cotton also means you can machine wash them (with care). These **curtains** have a lining already attached and we like the leaf print design which would suit all seasons – the patterns come in bright ‘forest green’ or, for those who prefer a subtler look, ‘soft grey’. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once hung, you can create an even tighter seal by fixing the edges of the **curtains** to the window frames or walls. This needs to be done with something that you can quickly and easily open and refasten, such as velcro, curtain hooks or magnetic strips. The addition of a window cornice (a hard structured frame that sits over the top of the **curtains**) or a valance (a fabric alternative) will add further insulation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
