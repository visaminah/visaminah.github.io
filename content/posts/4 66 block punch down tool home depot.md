## 4 Interesting Facts 66 Block Punch Down Tool Home Depot | Klein 110/66 Block Cushion Grip Impact Punchdown Tool
-   Do you have a **punch**down tool with a 66 blade? RE: Help asap connecting line 1 back on a 66 block 2 OneSourceTelecom (Vendor) 18 Jan 11 18:03 may the lowest bidder win... RE: Help asap connecting line 1 back on a 66 block wires (TechnicalUser) 19 Jan 11 14:53 "you're an electrician trying to do phone work, aren't you." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While I hope Berrios got the phone back up but there is a part of me that wishes the business where he was working had called a telecom professional in the first place. RE: Help asap connecting line 1 back on a 66 block PBXTech (TechnicalUser) 3 Feb 11 10:26 not so sure about a telecom professional needed. even my ten year old son knows how to use a tone-set, a **punch** down tool and a length of cross-wire. RE: Help asap connecting line 1 back on a 66 block LkEErie (Vendor) 7 Feb 11 14:31 Wow, PBXTech, then if your 10-year old can do it, the electrician ought to be able to do the same work LOL - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I have Snap-On Roll Pin and Pilot **punch**es, both are excellent. I bent a 1/8 taking out a bearing race on a hydraulic motor once (1/8 **punch** is the only way to replace that particular race), and it only failed after doing the same on seven or eight other motors. Every other **punch** I used failed really quickly because they are really stubborn. I havent used the starett, but judging by many other products I have by them, they would probably be excellent as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In my opinion having a nicer one comes in handy if youre going to be doing this sort of work often. ive only used the more expensive kind and found having the ease of changing the end pieces around to be very helpful... especially when im already really p!ssed off from **punch**ing down 100 wires in a 100yr old wiring cabinet thats 100+ degrees! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
