## 96 Facts Best Spray Paint To Use On Metal | best spray paint to use on stainless steel
-   Whether you are using your finished surface indoors or outdoors, you should take steps to protect it from rusting and corrosion. Use a clear sealant over any **paint** where the metal is exposed to heavy wear or moisture such as water. You can find sealant in **spray** cans, pots, or brush-on formulas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For example, indoor **spray** **paint**s don’t have the same water resistance and durability as outdoor **paint**s (they need to resist winds, dew, atmospheric moisture, etc.). On the other hand, since indoor **spray** **paint**s don’t need to be so durable, manufacturers can go ahead and create them in a wider range of colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Consider using an airbrush instead of a **spray** can for more precise results if you want to **paint** insignia or other designs on your metal project. If you would prefer not to hand-**paint** those areas, stickers and decals are available that will adhere to the surface, so they don’t need to be **paint**ed. If possible, apply these before **paint**ing the rest of your project to avoid accidentally **paint**ing over them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Apply two coats of metal-approved **spray** **paint** in your color of choice. Hold the can about 8-10 inches away from the surface and use a sweeping back-and-forth motion to apply a thin, even coat across the entire piece, including the back and underside. Allow the **paint** to dry for two hours, or the time recommended by the manufacturer, between coats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Due to these differences, looking for the most appropriate **spray** **paint** for your project can be challenging. With this, to save you from the laborious work of assessing all the top brands of **spray** **paint**s for metal, we give you this comprehensive review. Here are the top picks we ranked for your convenience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Though this is a high quality **paint** that creates warm and natural colors, it does leave a semi-strong odor in its wake. Additionally, the big button applicator can be somewhat difficult to control while looking to perform minute adjustments. It’s a good **paint** to keep with your other household supplies like the best mop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spray **paint**s last between 3 and 10 years on metal. On average, **spray** **paint** will last 5 years before you notice any imperfections or changes in the **paint**. The reason **spray** **paint**s last a while on metal surfaces is that **spray** **paint**s designed for metal are usually oil-based. As such, the **spray** **paint** will be more durable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You shouldn’t **spray** **paint** over **paint**ed metal. This is because **paint**s used on metal are usually oil-based and **spray** **paint** will not stick to oil-based **paint**s. So if you **spray** over metal that was **paint**ed with oil-based **paint**, the **paint** will not stick properly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In any event, Rust-Oleum **spray** **paint** is available in what seems to be an infinite amount of colors. Check out the aisle at my local Home Depot. Crazy, huh? Some homeowners might salivate at this array of choices. I get overwhelmed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spray **paint**ing will provide top results if the surrounding temperature, humidity, and wind are under control. Thus, avoid working in cold temperatures, extreme wind, and extraordinary humidity. You must also wisely clean the surrounding area or else dust particles can fly around and settle on the **paint**ed surface when it is still damp. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have plans to create metal artwork for commercial sale, your work must comply with copyright laws. This includes original designs and reproducing images of famous artworks or characters from books or movies. Even if you are only planning to **paint** an electrical box in the corner of your home, make sure it does not violate any copyright protections before applying a clear sealant over the finished surface. Below are some ideas for projects that can be done without infringing on copyrights: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’re preparing your metal surface for **paint**ing – let’s make it simple and quick for you. All you need to do is grab a wire brush, a scraper and some cleaner/degreaser. Remove grease, oil and other surface contaminants by cleaning with appropriate detergents (something like Rust-Oleum Mathys ND14 Cleaner Degreaser is ideal). Then remove rust scale, loose mill scale, loose rust and loose coatings by scraping, wire brushing and sanding. This will leave you with a smoother surface to **paint** over and helps to ensure adhesion, don’t worry though you don’t have to remove ALL the rust! Finally, sand any previous coatings which are in good condition to roughen the surface slightly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s advised to shake the **spray** can before **spray**ing the **paint** to mix the content. But you shouldn’t over-shake the **spray** can. If you do, you’ll create bubbles inside the **spray** **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you **spray** **paint** metal, you need at least a coat of **paint** primer. To prime the metal, use a **paint**brush to apply a coat or two of the **paint** primer. Wait for each coat of primer to dry before applying another. The primer coating helps the **paint** to stick better to the metal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When the first coat is dry, you can apply the second coat. You need 2-4 coats of **spray** **paint** on metal. When both coats have dried, you have successfully **spray**-**paint**ed metal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the other hand, enamel **spray** **paint** is also a notable choice due to its heat resistance. With the right primer before application, enamel **spray** **paint** can also be as durable as oil-based types. Moreover, it is also capable of a terrific stain-resistance property. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your piece is now clean and ready for priming and **paint**ing. Lay your faded metal outdoor furniture on the middle of your drop cloth. Set it on top of a few old wooden blocks. Why? These blocks elevate the metal outdoor furniture piece over the drop cloth, making it easier to **paint** its feet. And it helps stop **paint** from bleeding through the drop cloth and making a mess underneath. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rust-Oleum 769 Damp-Proof Primer is based on a unique, low-odour formula based on fish oil. It’s the wonder primer that started it all for Scottish-born sea captain Robert Fergusson when he noticed that the rusty deck of his vessel stopped corroding in places where fish oil had been spilled. This discovery inspired the captain to develop the first fish oil-based anti-corrosion **paint**. In 1921 he perfected a type of **paint** that prevented rust and was capable of drying overnight without leaving any unpleasant odours, Rust-Oleum® Corporation was born. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You need 2-4 coats of **spray** **paint** on metal. Allow each coat to dry properly before you add the next one. You shouldn’t apply more than 4 coats as the **spray** **paint** can turn sticky. You shouldn’t add less than coats on metal as the **paint** will start to chip off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Though this is by no means a difficult-to-use product, we did find that the **spray** tip applicator was not as adjustable as our top pick, which could become frustrating while **paint**ing at awkward angles. Also, this product leaves a slightly stronger odor in its wake than our top pick, though it is by no means a deal breaker. You should always some **paint** on hand for projects, just like you have the best all purpose cleaner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Primer **spray** **paint** is one of the best options for almost any metal surface, including iron and carbon steel. The primer creates a porous surface that makes **paint** adhere much better than its natural state. It is also significantly more durable, protecting metal surfaces from rusting and corrosion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The short answer is yes, but it can be very challenging. Metal is brutal to adhere to anything because the material isn’t porous enough. The easiest way to **paint** metal is by using **spray** primer beforehand. Primer coats the surface with an adhesion agent that can help other **paint**s stick better and last longer. There are a few different **spray** **paint**s that can be effective on metal surfaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you’ve got a rusty old staircase, why not give it a re-vamp and **paint** it with bright, exciting colours! You could even use hanging baskets and flowers for a quirky, colourful look. Metal cladding not looking too great? Just **paint** over it with the damp-proof primer and choose a strong colour to bring it back to life. Whether you stick to a plain finish, or something bold, you’ll be able to hide the rust underneath and protect the surface with Rust-Oleum 769 Damp-Proof Primer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A few different types of metals are plated, but zinc provides an extremely shiny surface. If you are looking for a finish that does not require much preparation, Zinc electroplating produces a bright silver color. The **paint** can be applied right away without any preparation to protect against rust or durability. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Paint will not stick to fine over rust, so the rust need to be removed along with any old, flaking **paint**. There are a number of methods to do this. You can take away both rust and **paint** using a stiff wire brush or an electric drill furnished with a sanding pad and rough discs. Emery cloths can be utilized when there is minimal rust. Scrapers come in handy as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Now we’re sure you want to **paint** over that unsightly rust. Use Rust-Oleum 769 Damp-Proof Primer as it needs minimal preparation, and penetrates the rust all the way to the metal! You can apply it on slightly moist or dry surfaces, for durable corrosion protection. It works by expelling moisture and air, and encases the rust whether you use it with, or without a top coat! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best product we tried was easily Rust-Oleum Painter’s Touch Multi Purpose Spray Paint, which is available in a wide variety of **paint** and primer options, including gloss and matte, and can be purchased in multipacks of six units. The **paint** is dry within 20 minutes, which is pretty fast, and one unit boasts 12 square feet of coverage. The oil-based formula does not leave much of an odor and helps to cover up imperfections in materials. Keep reading to learn more about the Rust-Oleum Painter’s Touch Multi Purpose Spray Paint and the other products on this list. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thanks to the unique formulation on offer, this product cannot stand up to extreme weather conditions and is not recommended for outdoor use. Additionally, this can holds 11 ounces of product, as opposed to the 12 ounces found in our top pick. Always pick the best **paint** for the job, just as you would pick the best laundry detergent for your clothes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This is an 11 ounce can, however, which is slightly smaller than the 12 ounces typically found in comparable products. Additionally, it takes 30 minutes to dry to the touch, which is longer than the 15 or 20 minutes found in our top picks. Good **paint** is one of the best tools you can have. Now, in case you like fixing stuff around the house, you need the best socket wrench if you want to turn nuts or bolts without the need of repositioning the tool on the fastener. Speaking about fastening bolts, another key tool that can help you effectively tighten bolts and screws is the best torque wrench. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When exposed to rain, sun, and outdoor elements over long periods, metal patio furniture will eventually rust. With enough time, this natural phenomenon is mostly unavoidable, but a little rust doesn't mean you have to throw out your outdoor table and chairs or pass over an old patio set you found on the cheap. Painting rusted metal furniture is a simple DIY project that can quickly make tables and chairs look good as new. However, **paint** won't stick to dirty, rusty surfaces, so you'll have to remove the rust before adding your favorite **paint** color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For instance, rust-oleum **spray** **paint**s usually have silicone compounds to make the **spray** **paint** more resistant to heat. This means the **paint** will not be easily damaged by heat or UV rays. The additives and oil-based nature of most metal **spray** **paint**s make them last longer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Rust-Oleum Painter’s Touch Multi Purpose Spray Paint is a high quality oil-based formulation that is easily applied via an intuitive **spray** tip and dries to the touch within 20 minutes. It doesn’t leave much of an odor, covers 12 square feet with one can and is available in a wide variety of colors and finishes. It is also available in multipacks of up to six units, which we liked. We found the colors it produced to be rich, warm and smooth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 3 – Clean. Lastly, to prepare the outdoor piece, you will want to give it a good cleaning with a mild soap (car soap is a good) to remove any grease, dirt, or debris. Thoroughly dry the piece, particularly if you have rust problems already. I actually sand before cleaning because why clean twice?! This will ensure a good bond for the **paint** and primer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Step 4 – Setup for **spray** **paint**ing outdoor furniture. Generally speaking, you will want to elevate the chairs or furniture so you can get around the bottom and undersides. If you have a table, that’s great, or you can use bricks, cement stones or 4×4 pieces of wood. Lay a drop cloth over it and you are ready to **paint**! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Protect your freshly **paint**ed patio furniture from further rusting or chipping with a clear coat. Choose a sealer designed for outdoor projects with UV protection to help prevent fading. Following the manufacturer's instructions, let dry and cure completely before use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Other features include the ability to bond to plastic, laminate, wood, masonry, metal, etc., availability in multiple colors and compatibility with indoor/outdoor use. The only problem is that the **paint** takes relatively more time (25 minutes) to dry to touch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To scrape existing **paint**, you can use a **paint** scraper, a trowel, or a metallic putty knife. Ensure to scrape the **paint** from the base. This also helps to remove grime and rust beneath the **paint**. For tough **paint**s that refuse to come off, you can use baking soda or vinegar to dissolve and remove them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – Universal Bonding Primer (also comes in quart size for **paint**ing with a brush) For rusty surfaces that can’t be sanded – Rust Reformer. I haven’t actually used this one without sanding, however it gets rave reviews. Personally, I would be too nervous not to sand.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Are you looking at your rusty surfaces feeling stumped? Wondering “what **paint** to use on rusted metal?” Can you **paint** over rust? Or maybe you’ve just not been able to get round to it. Well, you don’t have to struggle any longer. It is possible to give rust a complete makeover turning it around. It’s simple to **paint** over it without having to spend a long time trying to manually remove it. Click here to skip recommended products and to continue reading. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Finally, you’ll need to use **spray** **paint** designed for metal. Such **spray** **paint**s are designed to last long on metal. It’s also advised to use **spray** **paint** that is moisture resistant and rust-proof on metal to prevent the finish from turning brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once applied, the **paint** provides superior protection on metal because it prevents rust formation. It also creates a shiny black glossy finish and you have multiple color options to choose from in gloss, satin or flat finishes. However, there is no matte option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is important to consider which colors of **paint** and sealant are available in the type you intend to use for your project. This includes the opacity factor, such as if a metallic or iridescent **paint** will be semi-transparent, translucent, or opaque with light shining through it. It might also impact the look of your finished product depending on what color it is mixed with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, some **spray** **paint**s shouldn’t be used on metal. For instance, it’s not advised to use wood stains on metal. This is because stain penetrates the material it is used on and since metal is non-porous, the stain can’t penetrate and can’t stick well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Sanding with medium-grit sandpaper first helps to remove imperfections and rust while creating a textured surface for the **paint** to stick. After sanding with medium-grit sandpaper, use fine-grit sandpaper. This helps to even the metal surface so you can get a smooth result. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Oil-based enamel **spray** **paint** is the most common type on metal surfaces. It provides a great finish that is very resistant to abrasions and cracks. Because of its oil base, it also has good durability in high temperatures. If you are **spray**ing outside, consider using opaque **paint** rather than a clear or transparent one since they are not UV stable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, **paint**s used over metal usually have additives that can repel **paint**. Your best bet to **spray** **paint** over a **paint**ed metal is to remove the existing **paint** first or at least, sand it. If you sand the existing **paint**, the bulk of the **paint** will be removed and the **spray** **paint** when applied will stick well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To **spray** **paint** metal, it’s generally advised to pick an oil-based enamel **spray** **paint**. Oil-based enamel **spray** **paint**s are durable and water-resistant meaning that the metal surface will be protected from moisture and rust. However, oil-based enamel **spray** **paint** will take longer to dry since the **paint** is oil-based. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The reflection and color of the metal will be different depending on the type of **paint** you choose to use. This difference can be subtle or dramatic, but one way that it is classified is by glossiness. The most popular options are satin, matte, and iridescent for a rustic look or shiny finishes such as high gloss for a more sophisticated appearance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Place the table and chairs on a drop cloth. Treat the sanded, rusty areas with a metal primer that deters rust, such as Rust-Oleum Rusty Metal Primer Spray ($7, The Home Depot). Make sure to **spray** the spot from all angles, reaching every nook and cranny. Let dry for two hours. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Ease of use is determined by a number of things. First, there are those **spray** **paint**s that don’t require a sanded surface before application, which simplifies their use. The same Krylon’s K08801001 above is one such product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spray **paint** gives a smooth, even finish on metal surfaces and dries swiftly. Plus, it is reasonable and appropriate to buy from almost any discount, home development, or hardware store. Though **spray** **paint** is a good option, you have to be very cautious when utilizing it. Always make sure to defend yourself by wearing a mask and gloves and **paint**ing in a well-ventilated range. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If necessary, prime the metal with primer to be **paint**ed. Make sure to follow instructions on the primer can to ensure the best results. Using an oil-based enamel, you should apply several thin coats instead of one or two thick ones for better coverage and adhesion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to **spray** **paint**ing, there are a lot of misconceptions. People think you can only use **spray** **paint** on certain surfaces, like wood or plastic. But the truth is, you can also use **spray** **paint** on metal! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Rust-Oleum Universal All Surface Spray Paint boasts a gorgeous metallic finish that really makes it pop on a wide variety of materials. On that note, it excelled with nearly every surface we tried it with, including fiberglass, concrete and metal. We also liked that it doesn’t leave too much of an odor after you **paint** and that the formulation stands up well to extreme weather conditions, making this great for mailboxes and the like. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many types of **paint**s leave markings behind where they have been **spray**ed or dried that can be difficult, if not impossible, to remove. This is often true with enamel **paint**s and varnishes used for woodworking projects and hobby crafts. Consider what will happen if these marks dry on your metal face before choosing which type of **paint** to use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spray **paint** does not stick to all metals. Iron and carbon steel are two very common types of metal that any type of **paint** will not adhere to properly. It is best to leave the surface as-is in these cases rather than attempting a **paint** job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That said, the 12 oz. can is fitted with an EZ touch 360 conical tip that reduces hand fatigue. This makes it more comfortable to work on large **spray**-**paint**ing projects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Primer is very significant when **paint**ing a metal surface. In the absence of primer, the **paint** will not stick to the metal, growing chances of rust formation and peeling **paint**. Utilize a worthy quality primer that is compatible with metal and the **paint** you plan to utilize. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although **spray** **paint**s are designed to work on metal, it is important that if your furniture has large sections of rust, you use a primer instead. After removing old **paint** or rust, you should also sand down the area to create a smooth surface that the new finish can stick to. This will allow your new finish to last longer and hold up against the elements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The product is actually a **paint**-and-primer in one and once applied, it dries to touch in as little as 10 minutes. After drying, it creates a glossy rust protective coat with durable adhesion for long-lasting use. There are other finish options though such as satin, metallic, flat, matte, etc. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Primer by itself isn't enough to protect the metal surface. Apply a top coat of **paint** to repel moisture and prevent it from rusting again. Check the label on your **paint** can to make sure that it will adhere to metal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This Rust-Oleum PK American Accents Spray Paint is a high quality product by one of the market leaders, offering similar functionality to our top pick, including a quick dry (20 minutes) and lack of any noticeable odor post-use. We also liked that it comes in a budget-conscious six pack, with one can boasting 12 square feet of coverage. It also bonds to plastic, making it an ideal choice for plastic-centric **paint** jobs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, remove existing **paint** from the metal surface. This step is optional. If there isn’t any **paint** on the metal, you don’t have to scrape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Examine each furniture piece to determine any rusted areas that need attention. Gently use a **paint** scraper ($8, The Home Depot) to remove loose, corroded material. Scrape off large chunks, but don't worry if you can't get it all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To help you choose the best **spray** **paint** for your home maintenance or art projects, we’ve tested dozens of top models, preferring **paint**s that excel with a variety of materials, including wood, metal and plastic. We also liked **paint**s that dried to the touch quickly, those that did not leave a foul odor after use and products with easy-to-use cans that boasted wide radiuses of contact. If you are also browsing for other quality tools that can help you execute your project, check out our best tools guide for great recommendations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The key to any good **paint** job is good surface preparation. You need to remove loose rust as well as any flaking or peeling **paint**. You don't need to get back to bare metal, but any flaking rust will prevent proper **paint** adhesion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You only need one coat of self-etching primer. If you don’t want to use this primer, you can go with a water-based primer that requires 2 coats. Just ensure the primer that you pick can be used on metal and will suit the **spray** **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **paint** you use depends on how much rust is on the surface. For light rust, Rust-Oleum's oil based protective enamel works great. For heavy rust, apply a coat of Rust-Oleum Automotive Rusty Metal Primer before the top coat for the best results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There are some points which should not be used on metal. Any **paint** with a glossier finish is likely to be extremely reflective and should not be used on outdoor surfaces. Similarly, **paint**s designed for plastics are not formulated to adhere to metal surfaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Don’t forget to keep the can in motion while **spray**ing, and at 10-16 inches apart from the surface. I have a tendency to move the can closer to the tough-to-reach spots and corners, which only results in wrinkling. Luckily, this can has an “any-angle” **spray** system allows you to **spray** at any angle for those hard-to-reach areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On metal, you’ll need 2-4 coats of **spray** **paint**. Ensure that each coat dries fully before re-coating. If you re-coat too soon, the finish can develop blisters as moisture will be trapped in the coat underneath. Check the container of the **spray** **paint** for how long to wait before re-coat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your choice of **spray** **paint** should depend on the type of metal you want to cover and what conditions your project will be exposed to. Whether indoor or outdoor use, standing up to harsh weather like rain, sleet or snow may affect the quality of the finish depending on how long ago it was applied. If you need protection that can stand up to regular moisture, you should consider using clear enamel instead of regular **spray** **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, bare metal surfaces are usually slick and non-porous. This means the **spray** **paint** can’t bite or penetrate the metal surface. Since the **paint** can’t penetrate, it doesn’t stick well to the metal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If there is rust on the metal, blisters are guaranteed to form as the **paint** starts to dry. You should remove the rust by scraping and sanding the metal before the **paint** is **spray**ed on. You can also use a rust-removal chemical if the rust is heavy and much on the metal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Before you begin this outdoor project, make sure the rust hasn't damaged the structural integrity of the item. Small spots of rust are likely manageable, but large corroded areas might not be salvageable. If the frame remains sturdy, use the following steps to **paint** rusty metal furniture, including pieces made from aluminum, iron, and steel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It is easier to **spray** **paint** metal instead of priming and **paint**ing it by hand in most cases. If you are going for a design or pattern, consider marking off sections with masking tape before applying your new finish. This will allow you to cover a larger surface area at once and ensure that the finish is completely covered. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Though this product shined with nearly every surface we threw at it, including ceramic and wood, we did run into some trouble while trying to **paint** vinyl furniture. Additionally, this is an oil-based formulation, so it is fairly toxic until dried. Prepare accordingly and wear gloves. When working with wood, it is not always necessary to **paint**, sometimes you can just use the best wood polish. Or for general purpose cleaning, hit it with the best duster now and then and it will look great. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Set up your work area by covering the **spray** area with a drop cloth or tarp. Make sure that you have covered enough to capture any rogue **spray**s. You don’t want to inadvertently **spray** a part of your basement floors or driveway a new color! If you are a complete klutz like me, you might want to do this project on grass. That way if you make a mess, the grass will grow and the **paint** will go away when the lawn is mowed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Water-based acrylic **paint** is a great choice too, but this **paint** is more ideal for indoor metal surfaces. The bright color of the acrylic **paint** will go well on an indoor metal surface. Spray **paint**s specially designed for metal use such as rust-oleum **spray** **paint** and Krylon **paint** can be used too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Update: It has been 3 years since I **paint**ed this furniture set, which we use all the time. While we have replaced the wood table and rug, the **paint** job looks great! Despite it being in full sun and all the elements, there is only a little bit of wear on the arm rests. While it could last even longer, I expect another 2-3 years out of it. Not bad for a project that was less than $200! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, ensure your work area is well-ventilated. My basement where I do most of my winter DIY projects has poor ventilation.

-   It’s true. Metal is porous, so you can’t use regular **spray** **paint**. But, there are particular types of **paint** made for use on metal. These **paint**s can be applied directly to the metal and even over rust! If the surface of your steel or iron isn’t too rusty, then you can clean it with steel wool to prep it for **paint**ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The oil-based type is the most common and the most famous choice among **spray** **paint**s.

-   Next, **spray** **paint** the metal. If you will be using **spray** **paint** in a **spray** can, you need to shake the can for a while before **spray**ing it so the content can be properly mixed. If you don’t do this, then the **paint** that comes out will not have even consistency or color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Rust-Oleum makes a variety of **spray** **paint**s, but I especially like the 2X Ultra Cover **spray** **paint** because it is a primer and **paint** in one.

If you are using **spray** **paint** to create a design or finish that isn’t metallic, you should get the same results with less frustration.

-   Before starting, ensure that the surface is clean and ready for **paint**ing.

-   When choosing whether to use a primer, **paint**, or sealant for your metal project, the answer depends on how much protection you need and how much time and money you are willing to spend.

-   Starting off the list is Krylon’s K08970000, which stands out as the best overall due to its large coverage of 25 sq. ft. This allows you to **spray** a wider area using the 12-ounce can, which is very economical in the long run. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
