-   Bissell rules the **carpet** cleaning and vacuum cleaner industries, along with Hoover. According to the Bissell website, the company sells upright, portable, and canister **carpet** cleaners.

-   Like the Bissells Big Green Deep Cleaning Machine, this is a very powerful deep cleaner. The downside to this kind of powerful cleaning is that the machine is larger and heavier than normal **carpet** cleaners. An advantage with the Rug Doctor over Bissells Big Green is its longer power cord (28 ft vs 25 ft) and better tank capacity (3 gallons vs 1.75 gallons). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The downside to all portable **carpet** cleaners is reduced cleaning power and smaller tanks. This means you have to refill more often and it takes more work to clean bigger areas of **carpet**. Spot cleaning is the goal with this machine, and it is not good for working larger areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The drying time varies, depending on the type of **carpet** you have and its thickness. Some **carpet** cleaners aid with the drying process, while others soak up dirt. Strategically place box fans in the room after you’ve cleaned the **carpet** to help the **carpet** dry faster. Most **carpet**s will dry completely after a few hours after you’ve cleaned them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   -Is the **carpet** cleaning machine easy to operate and learn? Efficiency – How well does it remove stains and clean the **carpet**? There is a big difference between the different price classes in this factor. So for tougher stains, old stains, and smelly pet stains you will not want the budget **carpet** cleaners. Other factors are suction, drying time, cleaning path and maneuverability. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You want the most effective cleaners that deep clean getting rid of the grime and dirt embedded in the fibers. They don’t all do that. If you have the budget for it, we can recommend BISSELL Big Green Deep Cleaning Machine and Rug Doctor Mighty Pro. They are top of the line, they clean extremely efficient, in my experience better than many rental cleaners, and they can deodorize the **carpet**s so by buying you will save a lot in the long run. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hiring a professional to clean your **carpet** is an option, but buying a machine to do it yourself can be the more cost-effective route in the long run. One factor that will determine how efficiently your device lifts embedded dirt is the size and power of the motor. For example, the BISSELL Turboclean Powerbrush Pet Carpet Cleaner has a four-row rotating power brush that makes it ideal for sucking up ground-in dirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even if you don’t have a major **carpet** “emergency” on your hands, you’ll still need to do a thorough deep cleaning periodically to rid your **carpet** of the everyday dirt and grime that accumulates. You may not even realize how dingy your **carpet** has become until it’s been cleaned. The process can revitalize old **carpet** and make it look like new again. If you’ve been thinking about replacing your old grimy **carpet**, investing in a nice **carpet** cleaner may just change your mind and help you save some money. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It’s not just the improved appearance of your flooring that will inspire you. Certain types of messes can leave your **carpet** smelling less than fresh. Repeated pet accidents, in particular, can trap foul odors in your **carpet** that only vigorous machine cleaning can remove. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Look in the comparison chart for cleaners that are extra small and easy to store. We can recommend BISSELL SpotClean Professional, it is portable and small, which makes it easy to store and handle, but still cleans efficiently and it has received good ratings by customers on the net. It is not a good choice for big areas of **carpet** though, because of its small tank. Hoover Power Scrub Deluxe, FH50150 is also a lightweight cleaner and a great option for limited space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you have small children it is a good idea to get an efficient cleaner that you can use often. There will be accidents again and again ;). If you are worried about using chemicals you can just load the cleaner with a 100 % natural cleaning solution or even just use hot water. The hot water used will still get the **carpet** clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
