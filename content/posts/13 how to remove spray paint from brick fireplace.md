## 13 Things About How To Remove Spray Paint From Brick Fireplace | Goo Gone Graffiti Remover
-   Once done, **spray** warm water to wash away the **paint** and stripper residue. Let the wall air-dry. Note that you are not supposed to opt for pressure washing as it can erode a brick wall's surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   White vinegar is an excellent compound to remove **paint** residue. Apply it generously on the wall and use a clean brush to remove the residue. Rinse the wall with water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Apply the agent on the **paint** using a brush. Wait for the solution to penetrate the **paint**. Take a ball of steel wool and scrub the surface. Wash the surface with warm water. One can also add vinegar to the recipe and clean soiled walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the target is dried **paint**, start with scraping it off. Apply a solvent-based **paint** remover on the wall surface. Choose your compounds wisely, as some solutions are acidic in nature. Some change the color of the brick; some fail. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Borox primarily comes from the desert mines of California and China. Cleaning companies tout this as a 'green' cleaning material. According to historians, the agent has been in use for the last 4,000 years. Note that borax is harmless to **paint**. But when coupled with ammonia and washing soda, it can effectively remove **paint**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Remember: While removing **paint**, you are dealing with chemical substances. Hence, one must use proper safety gear. Safety goggles, masks, gloves, and boots are prerequisites. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The process differs based on the **paint** status. If the **paint** is wet, use an absorbent material to soak the **paint**. Make sure you do not wipe the **paint**. Use white spirit or other solvents to treat the surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Using borax is an unusual way of removing older **paint**s from walls. Mix borax, ammonia, and washing soda in equal quantities. Mix them with twice the amount of water. Mix until you get a creamy paste. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If the wall still has **paint** flakes, apply another coating of the **paint** stripper. Repeat the 'brushing' part once again. If the **paint** is too stubborn, you may have to repeat the process a few more times. If you are satisfied with the removal process, you may move ahead to the last step. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Stripping **paint** off a wall is a challenging task. Though the process is pretty straightforward, the time it requires to strip off the **paint** is high. Several coatings of the stripper and multiple scrubbing are a must. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Start with brushing the wall with **paint** stripper outward and downward. Refer to the product and wait for the time mentioned by the manufacturer. Use a stiff-bristled brush to remove the **paint**. The **paint** usually comes off as chunks and flakes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In case your brick walls have been riddled with layers and layers of graffiti, you should go for a heavy-duty **paint** stripper. Heavy-duty **paint** strippers usually remain active on walls for 24 hours. This extended contact ensures the removal of graffiti no matter how many years it has been on the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Experts prefer TSP to get rid of oil stains from concrete driveways and creosote from fireplaces. Peeling off decades-old **paint** from a surface is a breeze with TSP. You will often see this solution at the workplaces in Los Angeles where **paint**ing works occur. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
