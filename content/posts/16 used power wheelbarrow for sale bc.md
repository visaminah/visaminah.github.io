-   This will determine how great a load you can move in your barrow, in terms of both volume and weight. Typically speaking, the larger the hopper, the more you can transport with the barrow. If you intend to use it for commercial use, or large-scale domestic projects, then a **wheelbarrow** with a larger hopper could be most useful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When I was about fifteen years old, my father decided to redesign our garden. Up to that time our garden consisted exclusively of a green area and now the construction of a terrace was planned. At the same time, the soil was to be partially replaced and new grass was to be sown. As a real do-it-yourselfer, it was immediately clear that he would carry out this project himself and we children were allowed to help. I still remember how proud I was that I was the one who was allowed to push the first load with the **wheelbarrow** myself! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The creators of ProBarrow have been Building and testing electric **wheelbarrow**s for over 10 years. Back then and even now there just wasn’t a properly engineered material handling device for contractors that offered power, manoeuvrability and ease of use all in a machine that functioned and transported as easily as a traditional **wheelbarrow**. So the Canadian concrete contractors built their own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A Muck-Truck® will pay for itself in a matter of months (vs equipment rental fees), is easy to maintain and extremely versatile. Interchangeable accessories can be swapped in a matter of seconds allowing this motorised **wheelbarrow** to become a towing machine, a vacuum for horse manure, leaves, etc. It even has a flat bed attachment to carry heavy and awkward items such as paving slabs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The present invention, as claimed, provides the unexpected and unpredictable benefit of a device that is convenient and easy to use, is durable yet lightweight in design, is versatile in its applications, and provides users with a convenient means of transporting large loads between remote locations. Such a power driven **wheelbarrow** advantageously eliminates the need for a user to physically push the **wheelbarrow** from one point to another, thus saving a considerable amount of energy. Since the individual will not become worn out as quickly as normal, they can do more work in the same, or less, amount of time. The power driven **wheelbarrow** is produced of durable materials, which ensures that the device will withstand years of continued use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Legend has it that the first **wheelbarrow** was the brainchild of a Chinese inventor, Ko Yu. However, most sources credit Chuko (Zhuge) Liang (181-234 AD) as the **wheelbarrow**'s true inventor. The **wheelbarrow** is one of the best labor saving inventions ever developed. A **wheelbarrow** is a small one or two-wheeled cart designed to be pushed by a single person using two handles at the rear. They are designed to ease the transport of heavy, often loose, loads and are common in the construction industry and in gardening. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   However, I also remember that it was a bit difficult to lift the **wheelbarrow** and push it, and also that keeping the balance looked easier with my father. But I wanted to help my dad at all costs. At that time, an electric **wheelbarrow** would have made our work immensely easier and it would have been faster and easier on our backs – especially for our grandfather. Although I have to admit that I was not the best helper, this is one of the fondest memories of my youth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Referring to FIGS. 1 , 3, 6, 11, 14, 16, 19 and 20, the device 10 further includes a mechanism 57 for automatically generating a torque at the wheel assembly 48 to thereby selectively propel the motorized wheel barrow along first and second opposed directions based upon first and second user inputs respectively. Such an automatic torque generating mechanism 57 is electrically coupled to the electrical control assembly 35 and includes an electric motor 58 mounted to the storage pan 20, a neutral gear lever 59 coupled to the electric motor 58 for allowing a user to adapt the electric motor 58 to a neutral position for enabling the user to manually push the **wheelbarrow**, and a multi-directional gear assembly 60 including a multi-directional gear box 62 coupled to the electric motor 58 and the wheel assembly 48 respectively. Such a multi-directional gear assembly 60 includes a reversible multi-gear box 62 directly coupled, without the use of intervening elements, to the electric motor 58 and the axle 49 respectively, and a reversible multi-gear box 62 directly coupled, without the use of intervening elements, to the electric motor 58 and the pan 20 respectively. The multi-directional gear assembly 60 further includes a drive sprocket 64 directly coupled, without the use of intervening elements, to the reversible multi-gear box 63 and spaced from the axle, a driven sprocket 65 directly and statically mounted, without the use of intervening elements, about the axle 49, and a drive chain 66 engaged about the drive and driven sprockets 64, 65 and thereby causing the axle 49 to rotate as the driven sprocket 65 rotates. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The apparatus of this invention is referred to generally in FIGS. 1-20 by the reference numeral 10 and is intended to protect a motorized **wheelbarrow**. It should be understood that the apparatus 10 may be used to protect many different types of **wheelbarrow**s and should not be limited to use with only those types of **wheelbarrow**s mentioned herein. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thankfully, motorized **wheelbarrow**s offer a more manageable and much easier solution. Their design allows the hopper to move independently of the base structure of the barrow. But what is a hopper? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the other hand, Mesoamericans never developed the **wheelbarrow**, the potter's wheel, nor any other practical object with a wheel or wheels.[29][30] Although present in a number of toys, very similar to those found throughout the world and still made for children today ("pull toys"),[29][30] the wheel was never put into practical use in Mesoamerica before the 16th century.[29][30] Possibly the closest the Mayas came to the utilitarian wheel is the spindle whorl, and some scholars believe that these toys were originally made with spindle whorls and spindle sticks as "wheels" and "axes".[30] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Doing this project together with dad was very educational and showed me how important teamwork can be and also taught me some lessons in responsibility and neat work. Finishing the project together and being able to see and use the great result and the pride in my dad’s eyes is something I will never forget. I was really happy to be able to get involved and actively help – but I wouldn’t have said “no” to an electric **wheelbarrow**. All the better that there are now such great machines that make the work easier and provide optimal support. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The drive shaft of the motor is directly connected, without the use of intervening elements, to a gear assembly which is used to rotate the wheels. After a load has been placed or filled into the interior area of the pan, the rheostat switch is moved from the null position to effectively activate the motor. Such a rheostat switch is moved further away from the null position to increase the speed of the motor for effectively moving the **wheelbarrow** faster. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
