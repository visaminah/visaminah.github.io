-   Bricks are naturally toned down but that doesn’t mean neutrals are your only option as the main color. For example, gold with a dollop of gray mixed in is beautiful with warm **red** **brick**s. Other muted colors can work equally well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

The natural wood front door and the chocolate-colo**red** paint used on the trim and siding pick up the lightest and darkest colors in the **brick** for a cohesive palette. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   We enjoy seeing what folks pick for their exterior paint colors and how they complement the home’s features. Recently, It is because they might be difficult to match paint colors with.

-   It’s not like you need our permission, but as you can tell from our recommendations thus far, we often recommend using both Sherwin Williams and Benjamin Moore paints together in one design! When painted on properly prepped **brick**, both brands perform beautifully. Seapearl looks especially lovely on **brick** because the front-facing **brick**s appear off-white, and the crevices between the **brick** look gray, providing built-in dimension. On this home, painting all of the non-**brick** siding in Iron Ore by Sherwin Williams and the trim and accents in Onyx by Benjamin Moore provides a rich, deep contrast and pulls out Seapearl’s gray undertones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because gray and tan **brick**s tend to be lighter shades, they are a great neutral option that looks good in nearly every room. The tones will match with just about any decor and color scheme.

-   Brick houses have a long history in the United States. What is believed to be the oldest standing **brick** abode today is located in Massachusetts and dates back to 1680, which speaks to the enduring quality of this building material. Bricks were made by hand until the Industrial Revolution, when they became easier and cheaper to produce, leading to an increase in **brick** homes. In some Southern states, **brick** continued to be used in the majority of new dwellings — upwards of 80% — through the late 20th century. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Further, the brown undertones of the **brick** will bring out the brown or tan undertones of the greige to create a warmth that’s especially welcome in a living room or den. In terms of the rest of the decor, try to keep things simple and refrain from accent walls. Instead, let your **brick**work become the eye-catching feature of your design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A good place to look for inspiration for accent colors for your **brick** home is the surrounding landscape. The greenery around this **brick** estate is complemented by sage green window trim. It's a subtle placement with high impact. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red **brick** and a multicolo**red** slate roof are the perfect pairing. A few well-chosen colors complete the look. When using the slate to inspire your accent colors, find tones that are slightly more vivid. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Whether you live in a renovated loft or brand new home, exposed **red** **brick** adds a touch of character and history to a home, harkening back to stoic 19th-century buildings. Make the most of this feature by filling the room with colors that allow it to shine. Play around with minimalism by using a neutral or light-toned backdrop, or embrace your bohemian side and experiment with vibrant accent colors like yellow, and orange.

As long as you offset dark tones with light hues and heavy material with light furnishings, your **red** **brick** feature will be the most-talked-about aspect of your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Earthy colors and materials go really well with **red** **brick**. It’s hard to go wrong when you stick with a natural color scheme that’s on the neutral side. Here we see a mix of browns found in the wall paint, cabinets and real wood butcher block countertops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Since the **brick** and gray tones are all earthy, neutral colors, you can add more vibrant colors with your decor. And don’t forget to include some plants. They not only add color but can also make a space feel a lot less sterile. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can also play a bit with the color wheel. Since **red** **brick**s are generally a warm color you can contrast that with a cool wall paint. However some **red** **brick**s are actually on the purple side which is a cool color. In this case use a warm color on the walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Because all **red** **brick**s are on the darker side light colors look that much better. The contrast a lighter shade of paint creates against the **brick** is a very nice look. It allows both the **brick** and wall colors to stand out without competing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Real, natural wood, looks great with a **red** **brick** accent wall. All you need is a simple sealer to bring out the natural color tones in the wood. Pretty much any type of wood you choose will go not only with the **brick** but also with other types of wood, so it’s a safe choice.

Using multiple wood tones and simple stains makes a room more interesting and less monotonous. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When it comes to making the right choices for your home’s interior color scheme, and answering the question, what interior paint colors go with **red** **brick**, remember to compliment the **brick** without overpowering it. It’s all in how colors are used together that defines just how great your design can be. Combine textures and colors effectively, choose a color scheme that works well with the **brick**, and make sure the **brick** can stand out. Try to use general principles of design as a guide rather than a list of steadfast rules that you have to follow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once you know what kind of look you're going for and the areas you'd like to paint, consider color theory. If you're working with **red** or orange **brick**, choose similar shades for an analogous or monochromatic color scheme. Or go for complementary shades of blue and green, which Mary Beth Wagner of Mary Beth Wagner Interiors recommends. "However, slate grey would be my first choice to accent the **brick**!" she shares. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Purple/Red - Purple-toned shades of **red** tend to be darker. Therefore, gray or tan walls work well with this color and beige is a really beautiful wall color with purple/**red** **brick**.

Also, try to avoid using blue or purple, especially in large amounts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red **brick** is a growing trend in the kitchen most notably as a backsplash.

Modern kitchens tend to be cold and **red** **brick** warms them right back up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   Above we see the **red** **brick** as the rooms mid tone. The white paint is naturally the light tone.

-   Think of your **brick** exterior as a neutral foundation onto which you can layer almost any color. Go traditional with white, black, or dark blues and greens. Be bold with orange or turquoise.

No matter which route you choose, keep in mind your home's architectural style, the surrounding environment, and the look you'd like to create. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
