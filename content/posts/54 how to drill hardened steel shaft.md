## 54 Interesting Facts How To Drill Hardened Steel Shaft | Cobalt Drill Bits For Hardened Steel
-   Steel round bars are available in hot rolled or cold rolled. Hot rolled round bar is typically used for applications like construction where finish and precise dimensions aren’t a priority. Conversely, cold rolled round bar is used for applications where a superior surface finish and exact dimensions are essential. Some common applications of steel round bar include frameworks, supports, braces, **shaft**s, and axles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drills come in standardized **drill** bit sizes. A comprehensive **drill** bit and tap size chart lists metric and imperial sized **drill**s alongside the required screw tap sizes. There are also certain specialized **drill** bits that can create holes with a non-circular cross-section.[1] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Metals are typically isotropic, so even an ordinary twist **drill** bit will shear the edges of the hole cleanly. Wood **drill**ed across the grain, however, produces long strands of wood fiber. These long strands tend to pull out of the hole, rather than being cleanly cut at the hole edge. The brad point **drill** bit has the outside corner of the cutting edges leading, so that it cuts the periphery of the hole before the inner parts of the cutting edges plane off the base of the hole. By cutting the periphery first, the lip maximizes the chance that the fibers can be cut cleanly, rather than having to be pulled messily from the timber. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The masonry bit shown here is a variation of the twist **drill** bit. The bulk of the tool is a relatively soft steel, and is machined with a mill rather than ground. An insert of tungsten carbide is brazed into the steel to provide the cutting edges. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Shafting bars are commonly used often used in applications that require high accuracy, such as weather measuring devices, laboratory tools, high-speed motor **shaft**s, drive **shaft**s, pump **shaft**s, and ball bushings. In these scenarios, the bar is often required to rotate at high speeds. Thus extreme straightness is critical to prevent unwanted vibration and wear on bearings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Center **drill** bits, occasionally known as Slocombe **drill** bits, are used in metalworking to provide a starting hole for a larger-sized **drill** bit or to make a conical indentation in the end of a workpiece in which to mount a lathe center. In either use, the name seems appropriate, as the bit is either establishing the center of a hole or making a conical hole for a lathe center. However, the true purpose of a center **drill** bit is the latter task, while the former task is best done with a spotting **drill** bit (as explained in detail below). Nevertheless, because of the frequent lumping together of both the terminology and the tool use, suppliers may call center **drill** bits combined-**drill**-and-countersinks in order to make it unambiguously clear what product is being ordered. They are numbered from 00 to 10 (smallest to largest). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In metal, the brad point **drill** bit is confined to **drill**ing only the thinnest and softest sheet metals, ideally with a **drill** press. The bits have an extremely fast cutting tool geometry: no point angle, combined with a large (considering the flat cutting edge) lip angle, causes the edges to take a very aggressive cut with relatively little point pressure. This means these bits tend to bind in metal; given a workpiece of sufficient thinness, they have a tendency to punch through and leave the bit's cross-sectional geometry behind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Drills are cutting tools used to remove material to create holes, almost always of circular cross-section. Drills come in many sizes and shapes and can create different kinds of holes in many different materials. In order to create holes **drill** bits are usually attached to a **drill**, which powers them to cut through the workpiece, typically by rotation. The **drill** will grasp the upper end of a bit called the shank in the chuck. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Although it is claimed that the stepped **drill** was invented by Harry C. Oakes it was in fact first produced by Bradley Engineering, Wandsworth, London in the 1960s and named the Bradrad. It was marketed under this name until the patent was sold to Halls Ltd.uk by whom it is still produced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   (HSS) is a form of tool steel; HSS bits are hard and much more resistant to heat than high-carbon steel. They can be used to **drill** metal, hardwood, and most other materials at greater cutting speeds than carbon-steel bits, and have largely replaced carbon steels. Cobalt steel alloys are variations on high-speed steel that contain more cobalt. They hold their hardness at much higher temperatures and are used to **drill** stainless steel and other hard materials. The main disadvantage of cobalt steels is that they are more brittle than standard HSS. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The diameter-to-length ratio of the **drill** bit is usually between 1:1 and 1:10. Much higher ratios are possible (e.g., "aircraft-length" twist bits, pressured-oil gun **drill** bits, etc.), but the higher the ratio, the greater the technical challenge of producing good work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Al-Chrome Silicon Nitride (AlCrSi/Ti)N is a multilayer coating made of alternating nanolayer, developed using chemical vapor deposition technique, is used in **drill**ing carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and CFRP-Ti stack. (AlCrSi/Ti)N is a superhard ceramic coating, which performs better than other coated and uncoated **drill**. [3] [4] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Screw extractors are essentially left-hand bits of specialized shape, used to remove common right-hand screws whose heads are broken or too damaged to allow a screwdriver tip to engage, making use of a screwdriver impossible. The extractor is pressed against the damaged head and rotated counter-clockwise and will tend to jam in the damaged head and then turn the screw counter-clockwise, unscrewing it. For screws that break off deeper in the hole, an extractor set will often include left handed **drill** bits of the appropriate diameters so that grab holes can be **drill**ed into the screws in a left handed direction, preventing further tightening of the broken piece. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The tip of the gimlet bit acts as a tapered screw, to draw the bit into the wood and to begin forcing aside the wood fibers, without necessarily cutting them. The cutting action occurs at the side of the broadest part of the cutter. Most **drill** bits cut the base of the hole. The gimlet bit cuts the side of the hole. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Manufacturers can produce special versions of the twist **drill** bit, varying the geometry and the materials used, to suit particular machinery and particular materials to be cut. Twist **drill** bits are available in the widest choice of tooling materials. However, even for industrial users, most holes are **drill**ed with standard high-speed steel bits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The geometry and sharpening of the cutting edges is crucial to the performance of the bit. Small bits that become blunt are often discarded because sharpening them correctly is difficult and they are cheap to replace. For larger bits, special grinding jigs are available. A special tool grinder is available for sharpening or reshaping cutting surfaces on twist **drill** bits in order to optimize the bit for a particular material. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A unibit (often called a step **drill** bit) is a roughly conical bit with a stairstep profile.[11] Due to its design, a single bit can be used for **drill**ing a wide range of hole sizes. Some bits come to a point and are thus self-starting. The larger-size bits have blunt tips and are used for hole enlarging. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The spiral (or rate of twist) in the **drill** bit controls the rate of chip removal. A fast spiral (high twist rate or "compact flute") **drill** bit is used in high feed rate applications under low spindle speeds, where removal of a large volume of chips is required. Low spiral (low twist rate or "elongated flute") **drill** bits are used in cutting applications where high cutting speeds are traditionally used, and where the material has a tendency to gall on the bit or otherwise clog the hole, such as aluminum or copper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A great number of holes with small diameters of about 1 mm or less must be **drill**ed in printed circuit boards (PCBs) used by electronic equipment with through-hole components. Most PCBs are made of highly abrasive fiberglass, which quickly wears steel bits, especially given the hundreds or thousands of holes on most circuit boards. To solve this problem, solid tungsten carbide twist bits, which **drill** quickly through the board while providing a moderately long life, are almost always used. Carbide PCB bits are estimated to outlast high-speed steel bits by a factor of ten or more. Other options sometimes used are diamond or diamond-coated bits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Left-hand bits are almost always twist bits and are predominantly used in the repetition engineering industry on screw machines or **drill**ing heads. Left-handed **drill** bits allow a machining operation to continue where either the spindle cannot be reversed or the design of the machine makes it more efficient to run left-handed. With the increased use of the more versatile CNC machines, their use is less common than when specialized machines were required for machining tasks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Long series **drill** bits are unusually long twist **drill** bits. However, they are not the best tool for routinely **drill**ing deep holes, as they require frequent withdrawal to clear the flutes of swarf and to prevent breakage of the bit. Instead, gun **drill** (through coolant **drill**) bits are preferred for deep hole **drill**ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The edge of the bit has a sharpened spur to cut the fibers of the wood, as in the brad point **drill** bit. A radial cutting edge planes the wood from the base of the hole. In this version, there is minimal or no spiral to remove chips from the hole. The bit must be periodically withdrawn to clear the chips. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **drill** bits for consumer use have straight shanks. For heavy duty **drill**ing in industry, bits with tapered shanks are sometimes used. Other types of shank used include hex-shaped, and various proprietary quick release systems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Water hardened **drill** rods are not heavily alloyed, allowing the material to be more easily machined than the oil hardened variety. During the water hardening process, the rod is heated until glowing red then plunged into a vat of water to cool. The result is a hard, durable metal which is easily machined. However, it is not suitable for welding. Water hardened **drill** rods are used in the manufacturing of hammers and files. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unibits are commonly used on sheet metal[11] and in general construction. One **drill** bit can **drill** the entire range of holes necessary on a countertop, speeding up installation of fixtures. They are often used on softer materials, such as plywood, particle board, drywall, acrylic, and laminate. They can be used on very thin sheet metal, but metals tend to cause premature bit wear and dulling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When reaming a pre-bored straight-sided hole, the spoon bit is inserted into the hole and rotated in a clockwise direction with a carpenters' brace until the desired taper is achieved. When boring into solid wood, the bit should be started in the vertical position; after a "dish" has been created and the bit has begun to "bite" into the wood, the angle of boring can be changed by tilting the brace a bit out of the vertical. Holes can be **drill**ed precisely, cleanly and quickly in any wood, at any angle of incidence, with total control of direction and the ability to change that direction at will. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Tungsten carbide and other carbides are extremely hard and can **drill** virtually all materials, while holding an edge longer than other bits. The material is expensive and much more brittle than steels; consequently they are mainly used for **drill**-bit tips, small pieces of hard material fixed or brazed onto the tip of a bit made of less hard metal. However, it is becoming common in job shops to use solid carbide bits. In very small sizes it is difficult to fit carbide tips; in some industries, most notably printed circuit board manufacturing, requiring many holes with diameters less than 1 mm, solid carbide bits are used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Traditional twist **drill** bits may tend to wander when started on an unprepared surface. Once a bit wanders off course it is difficult to bring it back on center. A center **drill** bit frequently provides a reasonable starting point as it is short and therefore has a reduced tendency to wander when **drill**ing is started. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A hollow cylindrical bit which will cut a hole with an annular cross-section and leave the inner cylinder of material (the "core") intact, often removing it, is also called a core **drill** bit or annular cutter. Unlike other **drill**s, the purpose is often to retrieve the core rather than simply to make a hole. A diamond core **drill** bit is intended to cut an annular hole in the workpiece. Large bits of similar shape are used for geological work, where a deep hole is **drill**ed in sediment or ice and the **drill** bit, which now contains an intact core of the material **drill**ed with a diameter of several centimeters, is retrieved to allow study of the strata. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A Forstner bit could bore the mounting hole for the hinge, but particle board and MDF are very abrasive materials, and steel cutting edges soon wear. A tungsten carbide cutter is needed, but the complex shape of a forstner bit is difficult to manufacture in carbide, so this special **drill** bit with a simpler shape is commonly used. It has cutting edges of tungsten carbide brazed to a steel body; a center spur keeps the bit from wandering. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The diamond masonry mortar bit is a hybrid **drill** bit, designed to work as a combination router and **drill** bit. It consists of a steel shell, with the diamonds embedded in metal segments attached to the cutting edge. These **drill** bits are used at relatively low speeds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   An adjustable wood bit, also known as an expansive wood bit, has a small center pilot bit with an adjustable, sliding cutting edge mounted above it, usually containing a single sharp point at the outside, with a set screw to lock the cutter in position. When the cutting edge is centered on the bit, the hole **drill**ed will be small, and when the cutting edge is slid outwards, a larger hole is **drill**ed. This allows a single **drill** bit to **drill** a wide variety of holes, and can take the place of a large, heavy set of different size bits, as well as providing uncommon bit sizes. A ruler or vernier scale is usually provided to allow precise adjustment of the bit size. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Hole saws take the form of a short open cylinder with saw-teeth on the open edge, used for making relatively large holes in thin material. They remove material only from the edge of the hole, cutting out an intact disc of material, unlike many **drill**s which remove all material in the interior of the hole. They can be used to make large holes in wood, sheet metal and other materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Used almost exclusively for deep hole **drill**ing of medium to large diameter holes (approximately 3⁄4–4 in or 19–102 mm diameter). An ejector **drill** bit uses a specially designed carbide cutter at the point. The bit body is essentially a tube within a tube. Flushing water travels down between the two tubes. Chip removal is back through the center of the bit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Forstner bits, named after their inventor,[when?] Benjamin Forstner, bore precise, flat-bottomed holes in wood, in any orientation with respect to the wood grain. They can cut on the edge of a block of wood, and can cut overlapping holes; for such applications they are normally used in **drill** presses or lathes rather than in hand-held electric **drill**s. Because of the flat bottom of the hole, they are useful for **drill**ing through veneer already glued to add an inlay. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Very high rotational speeds—30,000 to 100,000 RPM or even higher—are used; this translates to a reasonably fast linear speed of the cutting tip in these very small diameters. The high speed, small diameter, and the brittleness of the material, make the bits very vulnerable to breaking, particularly if the angle of the bit to the workpiece changes at all, or the bit contacts any object. Drilling by hand is not practical, and many general-purpose **drill**ing machines designed for larger bits rotate too slowly and wobble too much to use carbide bits effectively. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The modern-style twist **drill** bit was invented by Sir Joseph Whitworth in 1860. They were later improved by Steven A. Morse of East Bridgewater, Massachusetts, who experimented with the pitch of the twist.[6][7][8] The original method of manufacture was to cut two grooves in opposite sides of a round bar, then to twist the bar (giving the tool its name) to produce the helical flutes. Nowadays, the **drill** bit is usually made by rotating the bar while moving it past a grinding wheel to cut the flutes in the same manner as cutting helical gears. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The bit shown in the picture is a modern design for use in portable power tools, made in the UK in about 1995. It has a single spur, a single radial cutting edge and a single flute. Similar auger bits are made with diameters from 6 mm (3/16 in) to 30 mm (1 3/16 in). Augers up to 600 mm (2.0 ft) long are available, where the chip-clearing capability is especially valuable for **drill**ing deep holes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While the above is a common use of center **drill** bits, it is a technically incorrect practice and should not be considered for production use. The correct tool to start a traditionally **drill**ed hole (a hole **drill**ed by a high-speed steel (HSS) twist **drill** bit) is a spotting **drill** bit (or a spot **drill** bit, as they are referenced in the U.S.). The included angle of the spotting **drill** bit should be the same as, or greater than, the conventional **drill** bit so that the **drill** bit will then start without undue stress on the bit's corners, which would cause premature failure of the bit and a loss of hole quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A step **drill** bit is a **drill** bit that has the tip ground down to a different diameter. The transition between this ground diameter and the original diameter is either straight, to form a counterbore, or angled, to form a countersink. The advantage to this style is that both diameters have the same flute characteristics, which keeps the bit from clogging when **drill**ing in softer materials, such as aluminum; in contrast, a **drill** bit with a slip-on collar does not have the same benefit. Most of these bits are custom-made for each application, which makes them more expensive.[11] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A trepan, sometimes called a BTA **drill** bit (after the Boring and Trepanning Association), is a **drill** bit that cuts an annulus and leaves a center core. Trepans usually have multiple carbide inserts and rely on water to cool the cutting tips and to flush chips out of the hole. Trepans are often used to cut large diameters and deep holes. Typical bit diameters are 6–14 in (150–360 mm) and hole depth from 12 in (300 mm) up to 71 feet (22 m). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another, different, bit also called an installer bit has a very long flexible **shaft**, typically up to 72 inches (1.8 m) long, with a small twist bit at the end. The **shaft** is made of spring steel instead of hardened steel, so it can be flexed while **drill**ing without breaking. This allows the bit to be curved inside walls, for example to **drill** through studs from a light switch box without needing to remove any material from the wall. These bits usually come with a set of special tools to aim and flex the bit to reach the desired location and angle, although the problem of seeing where the operator is **drill**ing still remains. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A countersink is a conical hole cut into a manufactured object; a countersink bit (sometimes called simply countersink) is the cutter used to cut such a hole. A common use is to allow the head of a bolt or screw, with a shape exactly matching the countersunk hole, to sit flush with or below the surface of the surrounding material. (By comparison, a counterbore makes a flat-bottomed hole that might be used with a hex-headed capscrew.) A countersink may also be used to remove the burr left from a **drill**ing or tapping operation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Glass bits have a spade-shaped carbide point. They generate high temperatures and have a very short life. Holes are generally **drill**ed at low speed with a succession of increasing bit sizes. Diamond **drill** bits can also be used to cut holes in glass, and last much longer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Oil hardened **drill** rods are easily welded and machined and are very tough and durable. During the oil hardening process, the rod is heated until glowing red then plunged into a vat of warm oil. This causes the surface to become extremely hard. Oil hardened **drill** rods are used for general tool making. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A bit used to enlarge an existing hole is called a core **drill** bit. The existing hole may be the result of a core from a casting or a stamped (punched) hole. The name comes from its first use, for **drill**ing out the hole left by a foundry core, a cylinder placed in a mould for a casting that leaves an irregular hole in the product. This core **drill** bit is solid. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Brad point **drill** bits are ordinarily available in diameters from 3–16 mm (0.12–0.63 in). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Conventional twist **drill** bits tend to wander when presented to a flat workpiece. For metalwork, this is countered by **drill**ing a pilot hole with a spotting **drill** bit. In wood, the brad point **drill** bit is another solution: the center of the **drill** bit is given not the straight chisel of the twist **drill** bit, but a spur with a sharp point, and four sharp corners to cut the wood. While **drill**ing, the sharp point of the spur pushes into the soft wood to keep the **drill** bit in line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most modern solid-carbide bits should not be used in conjunction with a spot **drill** bit or a center **drill** bit, as solid-carbide bits are specifically designed to start their own hole. Usually, spot **drill**ing will cause premature failure of the solid-carbide bit and a certain loss of hole quality. If it is deemed necessary to chamfer a hole with a spot or center **drill** bit when a solid-carbide **drill** bit is used, it is best practice to do so after the hole is **drill**ed.[citation needed] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Spoon bits are the traditional boring tools used with a brace. They should never be used with a power **drill** of any kind. Their key advantage over regular brace bits and power **drill** bits is that the angle of the hole can be adjusted. This is very important in chairmaking, because all the angles are usually eyeballed. Another advantage is that they do not have a lead screw, so they can be **drill**ed successfully in a chair leg without having the lead screw peek out the other side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Masonry bits typically are used with a hammer **drill**, which hammers the bit into the material being **drill**ed as it rotates; the hammering breaks up the masonry at the **drill** bit tip, and the rotating flutes carry away the dust. Rotating the bit also brings the cutting edges onto a fresh portion of the hole bottom with every hammer blow. Hammer **drill** bits often use special shank shapes such as the SDS type, which allows the bit to slide within the chuck when hammering, without the whole heavy chuck executing the hammering motion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Shafting, also known as ‘Turned Ground and Polished’ **shaft**ing, refers to round bars made with fine precision and high-quality steel. They are polished to ensure flawless and perfectly straight surfaces. The manufacturing process is designed for extremely close tolerances for surface finish, roundness, hardness, and straightness which ensures a long service life with reduced maintenance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A more aggressive angle, such as 90 degrees, is suited for very soft plastics and other materials; it would wear rapidly in hard materials. Such a bit is generally self-starting and can cut very quickly. A shallower angle, such as 150 degrees, is suited for **drill**ing steels and other tougher materials. This style of bit requires a starter hole, but does not bind or suffer premature wear so long as a suitable feed rate is used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Many different materials are used for or on **drill** bits, depending on the required application. Many hard materials, such as carbides, are much more brittle than steel, and are far more subject to breaking, particularly if the **drill** is not held at a very constant angle to the workpiece; e.g., when hand-held. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
