## 25 Facts Apple Pencil 1St Vs 2Nd Generation Reddit | Apple Pencil 1 vs 2- Key Differences Explained (Compared) | 2022
-   In terms of the way the material feels in your hand, the **apple** **pencil** 1 and 2 are really different. Compared to the previous model Airpod case, the old **apple** **pencil** has a more glossy finish. In contrast, the Apple **pencil** 2 has a matte finish that gives it a more sturdy, reliable feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The overall design differences between the **apple** **pencil** 2 & 2 are not performance based. The improvements int he Apple Pencil 2 are mostly aimed at providing a more convenient experience to your workflow. Older models of the **apple** **pencil** (Apple **pencil** gen 1) are not as efficient. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The tips of both **pencil**s are hard. This makes tapping on the touch screen a bit louder compared to other styluses. If you have used other styluses with softer tips, this could take some adjusting to; however, the hardness is also the reason why you will not need to change tips for a long time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   - Apple Pencil has super low latency, which means that when you write on the ‌iPad‌, there's no delay between the movement of the **pencil** and what appears on the display. Apple Pencil latency is as low as 9ms on iPads with 120Hz displays (the ‌iPad Pro‌ models from 2017 and later). Precision - Apple Pencil is precise, so it is accurate down to the pixel. That means there's no offsetting between where the **pencil** is located and what's shown on the screen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another feature in both **pencil**s is tilt sensitivity. That is the ability of the stylus to recognize tilt angles other than just straight up. Now, you can write fine lines with the stylus straight up, or tilt it at a more natural angle for a wider, softer stroke. Shading, by tilting the pen as you would with a real **pencil**, feels very natural. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   There is a difference in the appearance of the screens on iPad Pros. Apple Pencil 2 works directly with 60Hz displays on iPad Pros, which may seem subtle to some users. However, the old models for Apple **pencil** 1 had a higher latency, 120Hz. Pen nibs are included, but there’s also accessories available for nibs, and even screen protectors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this article I’ve reviewed and covered all the differences between Apple Pencil generation one and generation two Apple Pencil. I was able to do this by extensively researching the two pens side-by-side. The Apple Pencil 2 has a slight technical benefit of the extra gesture shortcut button at the top of the **pencil**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Both Apple **pencil**s are compatible with all Apple Pencil-compatible apps. The built-in Apple Notes on the iPad is great as a quick, note-taking app. Just tap on the Lock screen with the Apple Pencil and the Apple Notes app opens with either a blank note or the last note you accessed (whichever one displays can be defined in your settings). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   - Apple designed the Apple Pencil to have a **pencil**-like feel in the hand, and it is weighted to feel like a real writing instrument. Low Latency - Apple Pencil has super low latency, which means that when you write on the ‌iPad‌, there's no delay between the movement of the **pencil** and what appears on the display. Apple Pencil latency is as low as 9ms on iPads with 120Hz displays (the ‌iPad Pro‌ models from 2017 and later). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   It has evolved quite a bit. For example, in addition to having a strong long battery life, it is very similar to the newer model with a magnetic connector. Compared to the older model of the **apple** **pencil**, it is .42 inches shorter in length. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   - Apple Pencil is precise, so it is accurate down to the pixel. That means there's no offsetting between where the **pencil** is located and what's shown on the screen. Simple Pairing - There's no need to fuss with Bluetooth with Apple Pencil. It connects automatically. Just plug in the first version or attach the second version to the ‌iPad Pro‌. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Apple Pencil 2 has a more **pencil**-like design because it has a flat side and a sanded design that improves the texture. The Apple Pencil 1 is smooth and round. Apple Pencil 2 also supports touch gestures for swapping between tools, something not possible with the original Apple Pencil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   - Apple Pencil is designed to work like a regular **pencil**, so if you hold it at an angle and press the side of the tip alongside the ‌iPad‌ for something like shading, it works. The Apple Pencil knows its general orientation and how it's being tilted. Pencil-Like Weighting - Apple designed the Apple Pencil to have a **pencil**-like feel in the hand, and it is weighted to feel like a real writing instrument. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   That said, the bottom line is this – the Apple Pencil that will work best for you boils down to what iPad you already have or which iPad you are planning to buy. It is the iPad model that will drive the Apple Pencil choice and not the other way around. But because both Apple Pencils’ features and performance are at the level of most premium styluses, we think either of these **pencil**s will be well suited not only for professional artists, illustrators and designers but also for office people, teachers, students and virtually anyone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Pencil 1’s shiny body gave way to a matte finish on the Pencil 2, which is now more tactile and feels less plasticky. The Pencil 2 also has a flat side, preventing the **pencil** from rolling off the desk. The Pencil 1’s branding is located on a silver band that circles the **pencil** near the cap while on the Pencil 2, the branding can be found on the flat side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Unfortunately, one feature that both **pencil**s lack is rotation sensitivity. This means that angled brushes will only be able to flow in a single direction unless you physically rotate the tablet. It is easy enough to rotate an iPad but still, it can be a bit annoying. The Wacom Art Pen, on the other hand, has rotation sensitivity. Professional artists will need to decide if this lacking feature on the Apple Pencils is a deal breaker or not. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Apple Pencil 2 has very well designed charging, whereas the Apple Pencil 1 sticks out awkwardly on the iPad, the same way a phone cord does. (it’s less awkward to charge the Apple **pencil** 2.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **pencil** measures 6.53 inches long and 8.89 mm in diameter, which is shorter than the previous model (**apple** **pencil** 1). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   - Depending on how much pressure is placed on the ‌iPad‌ while writing or drawing, a line can be thicker or thinner. Apple doesn't provide a specific pressure sensitivity level for the Apple Pencil. Tilt Sensitivity - Apple Pencil is designed to work like a regular **pencil**, so if you hold it at an angle and press the side of the tip alongside the ‌iPad‌ for something like shading, it works. The Apple Pencil knows its general orientation and how it's being tilted. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The Apple Pencil 1 does come with an extra tip; the Apple Pencil 2, on the other hand, does not. While that may seem like a cheap deal from Apple, users of the newer **pencil** say that there was hardly any sign of wear and tear, even after a year of regular use. Replacement tips for both **pencil**s are readily available. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Obviously, the original Apple Pencil gives you the broadest range of options for iPads that come in different screen sizes and budgets. In the end though, your **pencil** choice is dependent on the iPad you own. That can be a bummer if you were eyeing the newer Pencil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The shaft of the Apple Pencil 1 is slightly larger and longer than the Apple Pencil 2 because it has a removable cap at one end. When the cap is removed, it reveals a lightning connector that plugs into the lightning port of the iPad. This is also how you pair the **pencil** with the iPad the first time you use it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In real life, the harder you press on a pen or **pencil**, the stronger the mark you make on paper. Pressure sensitivity is the ability of the stylus to sense the amount of pressure you place and translate that into the thickness of a line. The more sensitivity levels you have, the finer is your control over your pen strokes. Both Apple **pencil**s have been shown to be very responsive and accurate when registering your strokes. They also demonstrated very low latency (time between writing/drawing and seeing it register on screen). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In addition to having a long battery life, it is very similar to the newer model. Compared to the new **apple** **pencil** model, it is .42 inches longer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Just based on technical and functional merits, without the compatibility factor, the Apple Pencil 2 is definitely superior to the original one. It did away with that awkward way of charging the **pencil** and introduced an innovative and practical technology – wireless or inductive charging. The double-tapping feature also enables one to do what physical buttons on other styluses did. The Apple Pencil 2 is just better and addresses issues found with the first generation one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
