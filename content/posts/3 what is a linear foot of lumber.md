## 3 Tips to What Is A Linear Foot Of Lumber | How To Measure Board Feet
-   According to the hardwood grading rules, the quality of **lumber** is judged from the poorer side of the **lumber**. However, if the wood is planed, then it is graded from the best side. I wonder if getting your wood 15/16 hit and miss is worth it, as the grade will probably be lower than if you had it rough. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Lumber is priced in the rough. So 8/4 would be 2" thick.All my comments were pertaining to **lumber** and not parts or cut-up pieces. Your idea of using actual sizes and so on is certainly valid for the small pieces and gives one a good idea of the total volume of wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Something Gene didn't mention at length that used to give me trouble is that I always measured fewer board feet in the **lumber** than my supplier had billed me for, until I found out that they round boards up to the next full inch that measure a whole number plus a half an inch. They tally a board that measures 10.5" as 11". I suppose that must be in the "rounding" rules. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
