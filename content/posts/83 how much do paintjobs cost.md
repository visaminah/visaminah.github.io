-   As for the painting itself, there are so many ways to do it. If you think you can handle the workload, you can simply do it yourself in the backyard.

Their customer service is fantastic, another positive point leading their services. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Needless to say, it’s not the same thing to paint over a car and a truck. Again, different vehicles need different types of treatment and aftercare as well.

Compared to them, Hondas or Toyotas don’t **cost** as much, since they don’t require any such specific or special treatment. No matter the type, you will need to spend at least $300. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Where you live plays a big part in how much a new paint job **cost**s. In some states, there are environmental concerns about automobile painting.

-   If a wall requires sanding and patching to attain a smooth surface that will accept paint flawlessly, the **cost** for wall prep is between $0.50 and $0.75 per square foot. Some contractors bundle prep work into either their hourly or per-square-foot charges. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>

-   The reason for the extreme **cost** in this particular situation is the paint and process. Single-stage paint is the culprit. It’s not a standard paint job and is rare these days.

-   Primary truck service paint is also known as low-end truck paint service. It includes quick painting with less **cost**.
