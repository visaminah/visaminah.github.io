## 78 Reference List: Colors That Go Well With Red And White | 20 Great Examples Of Red And White Color Combinations In Photography
-   If you consider yourself to have fair or light skin (cold/blue undertone), you will most likely fit into a few other categories as well. Your hair is an intense colour, either very blonde, very dark, or **red**. The sun is not a friend, and you’re burnt more often than tanned. You will probably have light colou**red** eyes as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another classic color combo known for its duality is baby blue and white. This serene combo communicates ease and trustworthiness, invoking the feeling of looking up at the sky on a sunny morning. Baby blue and white are the perfect color combo for brand **colors** in the healthcare, childcare, or non-profit industries. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The undertone of your skin is warm, either yellow, golden or olive green. Under the sun, you go brown rather than **red**. Your hair colour might range from dark brown to dark blonde and your eyes are most likely a shade of brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do not wear this color if you are an introvert and would like nothing more than a quiet spot at any party. One of the most important caveats of wearing **red** is that you should be confident in yourself. With a **red** colo**red** outfit, you cannot hide yourself in the crowd. It is the color of confidence and that is what you should be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Cyan can be a tricky shade of blue to pair, but the hot pink and cyan color combination really works. It’s bubblegum pop meets cyberpunk dystopia — a twist on the classic baby pink and baby blue. These bright, high contrast **colors** embody an excitement that is ideal for an alternative take on more playful brands. Think vape juice labels or scene/punk branding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Monochromatic. Monochromatic schemes are the simplest ones to create, as they’re all taken from the same color, but include variations in tints, shades, and tones. Monochromatic **colors** go well together, producing a soothing effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This finding might put you in a quandary, because we've found that **red** is sexy and confident, but it's also arrogant. Maybe we need to think of **red**ness as having an arrogance knob that we can turn up and down, and that we need it to be just so. Or perhaps arrogance is not the unattractive trait we might think it is - after all, feeling sexy and confident does require a certain degree of arrogance, doesn't it? Otherwise, why bother? We all know people who find romance in partners the rest of us find overbearingly arrogant, so perhaps it's not the passion-killer we might originally think it is. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So on those occasions when you're hoping to impress someone - interviews, first dates, your kids' school entry interrogations - you need to look confident. And if you want to feel confident, you're probably going to have to go with black. A conclusive 56% of respondents in our survey favou**red** black as a colour of confidence. Split by gender, 48% of women and 64% of men favou**red** it. If you feel confident, you'll probably exude capability and trustworthiness, which can't be a bad thing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to build on the natural warmth within the color yellow, the best option is to stick with **colors** close to this shade on the color wheel. Reds and oranges are perfect for highlighting the warmth in yellow. Browns can be extremely effective too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Most **colors** will go well with yellow when the right tones are chosen. However, certain **colors** may look too aggressive when used in large quantities. For instance, black and yellow is often associated with caution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you wear Red, you may be counted as a communist or a prostitute, or a bride depending on where you are. I do acknowledge the power of Red and personally never jump to such judgemental conclusions. But these pre-conceived notions on **red** do exist. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next, we have a beloved classic— sky blue and bubblegum pink. The playful and bright bubblegum pink pai**red** with a cooling and cheerful baby blue communicates a wholesome adolescent joy. This color pairing is ideal for parenting brands, childcare logos, or children's fashion, products, or toys. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Triadic color combinations are spaced evenly throughout the color wheel and tend to be more rich or vibrant in color. This color combination is typically dynamic, creating a harmonious visual contrast that pops when combined. Create a triangle on the color wheel and you'll find your 3 triadic **colors**. Examples: **red**, yellow, and blue; green, orange, and blue-violet; **red**-orange, yellow-green, and blue-violet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Earthy neutrals inspi**red** by the **colors** of the land, sea, and sand combine so well together. If your design features images of nature, using a palette of earth tones carries on the message and tone of the shirt. Our Light Olive and Stone Grey both serve as fantastic backdrops for your neutral design. Design a shirt with neutral **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Pastel yellows and greens are soft and appealing. They can make a room look fresh and welcoming, particularly when added as accents to a white background. Softer yellows and green have a springtime vibe, often linked to visuals of flower-cove**red** fields. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Charcoal and yellow (or black and yellow) is one of the most frequently used color combinations. These two **colors** wonderfully complement one another due to their high contrast. This combination would work well for logo design or a branded product label. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Neon **colors** are known for being eye-catching, bold, and daring. However, with such distinct qualities, they are also refer**red** to as disturbing and reckless. Because of these two contradicting sides, having two or three neon **colors** alongside each other is not the best of options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you want to make your audience feel something, color can help to achieve this. It remains the same whether you are choosing **colors** for a flyer, a photograph, a business card design, and choosing the perfect color combination for a logo or your website. Choosing the right color scheme for your brand or website is as important as selecting the right font for your logo design or ensuring you have a captivating brand name. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Why are we talking about this? Well, we asked our survey respondents to gauge the colours they found most attractive in their potential mates. A key finding was that people generally liked to see other people wearing the same colours as they themselves chose to look confident. The familiar black-**red**-blue-white pattern remained, and brown occupied the bottom spot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So what would happen if we were to mix the two polar opposite atmospheres? They will clash and look quite hideous. Needless to say that a person would also feel quite unsettled in such a space. Possible solutions would be to change one of the **colors** in the pair for a more appropriate counterpart – an analogous color or even white or black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   As we have already mentioned, **colors** have different moods and associations, and they influence us even more when we are placed in a room filled with certain hues. For example, a living room with marigold orange walls would bring a sense of coziness and playfulness. On the contrary, a bedroom with navy blue decor would create a refreshing and calm ambiance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Сolor is a tool that can help guide the eye. The more you want something to stand out, the more you should rely on contrasting **colors**. Generally, high contrast is the best choice for important content or key elements. If you want users to see or click something, make it stand out! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Composing in color begins with understanding color. The color wheel starts out with the prime **colors**. There are several color wheels out there, but since we are working with screens (on computers and cameras) you should keep things simple and just go for the RGB (**red**, green, blue) wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The **red** lipstick is a classic. Red pumps trump all other shoes in making you look the queen of the party. And the Little Red Dress is fast replacing the Little Black Dress. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Known for its assertiveness and spontaneity, **red** is a color that breathes energy into a room. When it comes to your decor it can be a showstopping focal point or a stimulating accent. It all depends on your design style and the atmosphere you want to create. Whether you’re going for down to earth or modern and eclectic, a **red** color palette gives you a variety of options to explore. With shades like maroon, burgundy, crimson and scarlet, you can go in any direction. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Analogous. Analogous color schemes are created from related **colors**; one color is used as a dominant color while others are used to enrich the scheme. While this is relatively easy to pull off, the trick is in deciding the vibrancy of the **colors** you’re using, as the entire scheme will be exaggerated by it. For example, Clear, a gesture-driven to-do app, uses the striking analogous **colors** to visually prioritize your current set of tasks. While Calm, a meditation app, uses the analogous **colors** blue and green to help users feel relaxed and peaceful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you’re choosing a color palette for your app/site, you can’t just be thinking about how things look — you have to think about how they feel too. The **colors** you choose can either work for or against the brand identity you’re trying to create. To get you started, I’ve compiled a quick reference guide that covers the basic associations with each color (in the western world). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This depends on a lot more variables than a single answer. If you have a coloring with high contrast ie contrast between hair color, skin and eye color. For eg dark hair and light skin, **red** can look smashing on you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Combine blues and greys to create a shirt that feels cool in tone. Because there are so many **colors** in the realm of blues and greys, and because we have so many types of blue and grey shirt **colors** to choose from, your possibilities are endless for this color combination. Design a blue and grey shirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red is said to be the color of Planet Mars. Mars is associated with ambition, power, courage and bravery. It is also associated with liveliness. If you are feeling lethargic **red** is one color that can make you feel energetic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Bright pinks and yellows together are a lot more aggressive. The two **colors** are extremely vivid, which leads to a fusion of confident and eye-catching shades. Bright pink and yellow used together in large doses can look garish and overwhelming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In stark contrast to the above-mentioned cotton candy **colors** are the rugged and earthy mustard, sage, and forest green. These three **colors** come together to form the ultimate earth-tone color palette. These **colors** are perfect for natural brands and suitable for logo design, web design, product design, and packaging. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Similar to the above-mentioned point about neon **colors**, we have another “fighting for your attention” unique combination — a huge design “no go” – vibrating **colors**. So-called vibration happens when two bold similar **colors** (usually with the same intensity) are placed next to each other. They create an impression of movement: some flow on top of each other, and others resemble a dent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Complementary. In their most basic form, these schemes consist of only two **colors** that contrast strongly. This scheme is used to attract the viewer’s attention. When using a complementary scheme, it is important to choose a dominant color and use its complementary color for accents. For example, when the human eye sees an object full of different kinds of greens, a bit of **red** is going to stand out very well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Overall, it’s not only painful to look at these saturated color combos, but also the moving sensation might be very disorienting. Especially in web design, where convex shapes might signify a button or other system elements. More than that, legibility plays a pivotal role in navigation and overall understanding in any type of design, so having these bright **colors** that make you look away is not the way to go. Thus, I would suggest changing one of the **colors** completely if it’s impossible to omit the duo altogether. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Soft shades of yellow and pink together have a wonderfully romantic vibe to them. We often associate pink with romance and affection, while yellow is a color typically associated with joy. Together, the **colors** can create an aesthetic perfect for conveying friendship and caring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Next on the list is the bold and vibrant color combination, **red** and yellow. This complementary color combo is the embodiment of cheer. Reimagine this classic ketchup and mustard color pairing with a modern, pastel take by changing the tints from **red** to coral. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   So let's assume you want to appear confident but don't want to stray into arrogant territory. You might want to avoid **red**. In our survey, **red** topped our chart in arrogance perception, although it was by a moderate 28% of the respondents. Orange and yellow came second and third, 19% and 16%, and good old white was conside**red** the least arrogant of the colours at 6%. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Low contrast refers to the lack of differentiation between one’s hair and skin colour. So, those who have tanned skin and light brown/dark blond hair, or those with dark skin and dark hair. You’ll be able to tell if you have low contrast if your usual concern when buying clothes is that certain colours wash you out. This also applies to pale Scandinavian complexions, most **red**heads, and those with grey hair or none at all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On the whole, it’s not about the color itself; it’s about the things that are associated with this color and how it works in specific color combinations. As we have discussed, neon pairs and vibrating color combos are just too aggressive to the viewers’ eyes, so that instead of attracting their attention, these **colors** put them off. As for the only dark color combinations, the associations, and feelings that these **colors** evoke come into the play. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red and blue; Red and Pink; Red and white ; Red and Black ; Grey and Red are all great combinations. Black is an often used color with **red**. White also goes well with **red**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Analogous color combinations are every two to five **colors** that sit beside each other on the color wheel. These color combinations create a sensation of balance and harmony. Typically one of these **colors** sits in the background, while the other more dominant color sits in the foreground. Examples: yellow, yellow-green, and green; violet, **red**-violet, and **red**; **red**, **red**-orange, and orange; blue, blue-violet, and violet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To start our list, we'll go for a trendy color combination, royal blue and peach. These two **colors** form a triadic combination, with the royal blue creating a bold sensation, balanced perfectly with peach's playfulness. This color combo is ideal for logo design or as accent **colors** for a web template or design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   This color combination is a great choice to make a design really pop. Delicate linework shows up best when there’s a strong contrast between the ink color and the color of the t-shirt fabric. So any bright color ink printed on white apparel, or white ink printed on a dark shirt color will always look sharp. Design a **red** and white shirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While on paper this color combination sounds limited to patriotic designs and flags, in practice it ends up working out really well for all sorts of designs. The primary **colors** of **red** and blue balance out well with the neutrality of white. Design a **red**, white and blue shirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   On pinterest for instance, they show pictures that have been posted years ago. Not that I mind. If they look nice you know. But if I saw them hund**red**s times before… Bo-ring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   When you place pure black next to a set of meticulously picked **colors**, the black overpowers everything else. It stands out because it’s not natural. Lots of the apps we use on a daily basis have blacks that aren’t really blacks, but dark greys instead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Complementary color combinations are the **colors** that sit on opposite sides of the color wheel. Combining these **colors** creates an effect of high contrast, catching the eye and leaving quite an impact. Examples: **red** and green, yellow and purple, orange and blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Browse our color combinations to step up your creative game and reap the rewards. Knowing what **colors** go together is a skill in itself and it can have a positive impact on all areas of your life. Once you gain an understanding of what different **colors** mean and the theory of color, you’ll see how they can influence perceptions. You can then use this to your advantage for personal or business use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Disclaimer: This article is just an opinion piece only, and it’s not intended to offend somebody’s taste or choice of color. The way you see **colors** might be different from the way we see them. Thank you for understanding! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Also, it’s crucial to evaluate the environment in which the combinations are used. A warm and cool tone mixture doesn’t work well in the interior design, and vibrating **colors** are extremely deceiving in web design. Making sure that your chosen qualitative color scheme transmits the message you intend them to and in the most comfortable way possible for the viewer is the safe path for the designer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Don’t skip on **red** and pink just because it makes you think of a Valentine’s Day card. By mixing **red** and different variations of pink, you can create a color combo that works in any room of your home, and the effect will be different depending on the shades that you choose. In a nursery or kids room, play with strawberry and bubblegum pinks and **red**s to keep the space soft and playful. Bring on the blushes for an inviting bedroom. Red and pink pai**red** in contrast with blacks and browns help to modernize the pairing for living rooms, and muted shades of each hue work to compliment each other in the kitchen and dining room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Color is fun, so if you don’t want to limit yourself, make the most of our 8-color limit. Something to keep in mind though, the price to screenprint is calculated on a per-color basis. To maximize your campaign profits, we suggest keeping your color count down, especially if you’re using your shirt sales to raise money for a cause. But you can still play with **colors**, even if you only use 4 or 5 **colors**. Design a rainbow-colo**red** shirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best color combinations come from nature. Why? Because those schemes seem natural to the eye. To get inspi**red**, we only need to look around us. If you see a particularly beautiful or striking color in your daily life, try creating a scheme around it. Simply take a picture of a beautiful moment and create your color scheme from it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But wait. Didn't we find that **red** is conside**red** a sexy colour too? Yes we did. What does that say about the traits we find attractive? People, you need to take a long, hard look at yourselves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   With 16.8 million **colors** to choose from, the color scheme options for your next logo, web, or brand design are just about infinite. Luckily for you, we got you cove**red**. Down below features 26 of the best color combinations that'll inspire your next design — classic and trending color combos alike. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red drove a wedge between the sexes. Asked about dressing to feel sexy on a first date, 54% of women said they'd opt for a passionate **red** number, whereas only 28% of men would.This is interesting because **red** is often associated with aggression, a typically male trait, and although most men aren't particularly aggressive, they absolutely don't want to give that impression, or even appear arrogant. Incidentally, men's second choice for a first date (after black) was a serene blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Usually, having two (or more) neon **colors** results in them fighting for your attention, meaning that, in the end, it’s just hard to concentrate on any of them. Also, it’s just painful for some people to look at a bunch of neon **colors** in one go because it hurts their eyes. Not the best way of transmitting information if you ask me. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Instead of reaching for harsh colour pairings, opt for more neutral bases and then add a warm version of your favourite colour such as a pine green or a warm blue to keep it interesting. When donning bright colours, such as a bright **red**, add it in through your tie or pocket square, alongside a muted blue button-up and navy suit. Tip: Stay away from clear colours such as icy blues and stark white. Opt for a warmer alternative to bring out the warmth in your complexion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You might be wondering, how come cool and warm **colors** make a bad combination. We all know the rules of complementary **colors** and how they look good together. Green goes well with magenta and blue looks great with yellow. And I agree with that – complementary **colors** make a great base for color palettes if you know how to use them properly. However, let’s move to a more specific sphere – interior design and see how complementary **colors** react in the environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Do not oversoak or use harsh detergents. Red colo**red** clothes are very susceptible to fading. Soak the clothes in a teaspoon of vinegar before washing ; this can set dyes and prevent fading to a degree. Salt is also said to do the trick. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Once again **red** gave us an insightful result - men like to see women wearing **red**, with 56% expressing a preference, while women liked their men to be wearing black or blue (66% and 48%). It would appear, therefore, that the way we dress is influenced by the way we are perceived, because there's a tendency to feel confident in the colours that the opposite sex finds attractive. Does this mean we feel most confident when we're feeling sexy? Or is it the other way round? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The best solution would be to use a toned-down right shade of one of the **colors**. As you can see in the picture, the neon cyan color was switched to dark indigo blue. In this way, you will be able to use neon pink as a statement color and don’t overstimulate the viewer. Moreover, in such vibrant color combinations, the neon would be powe**red** by the lightness or, in our case, the darkness of other **colors** to make use of its best qualities. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These **colors** pair so well together because of the high contrast between the maroon and white. Maroon shirts allow white designs to really shine, which is especially helpful when a design has delicate and thin lines. Bonfire’s Maroon Crewneck Sweatshirt is an awesome apparel item to print on to achieve this look. Design a maroon and white shirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Let me explain: dark **colors** usually don’t have the most pleasant associations – death, depression, blood, you name it. So, a couple of them in one place emerges the viewer into the darkest feelings that they personally associate with these **colors**. And not just one, but all together as an unidentified heaviness. That’s why dark with dark color combinations are best avoided. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Yet, at first, let me get this straight: any vibrant color is beautiful, but it all comes down to a matter of how we perceive **colors** because not all people see the right **colors** the same way. Why do certain people like certain hues and others don’t? To my mind, it’s all about the associations that these **colors** evoke. Some people might associate light cyan with the color of the clear sky; equally, for some, it’s just a color of the hospital walls. Also, the important factor is how we use the **colors** and how we combine them, as some of the combinations might have an opposite effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Look deeper, though, and it might not be so simple. The intelligence scale ran Black, Blue, White, Green, Purple, Brown, Red, Yellow, Orange and finally Pink, so we can also see a series that runs from "serious" to "playful" colours, and playfulness is probably not conside**red** an intelligence signifier. Somebody should probably tell the Financial Times. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   To get started, draw a line through the center of the wheel. When you do so, you’ll notice that there is a distinction between warm **colors** (**red**s, oranges, and yellows) and cool **colors** (blues, greens, and violets). Warm **colors** typically convey sentiments of energy, brightness, or life whereas cool **colors** convey sentiments of calmness, grounding, or serenity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   The effect of disturbance and disarrangement as if something is wrong, but you are not sure what exactly. On the one hand, it has no distinct mood, and it’s hard to notice something. On the other hand, when you do notice the **colors**, it has no point of visual interest. You would probably want to skim the piece and move on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Applying color to a design project has a lot to do with balance. The more **colors** you use, the harder it is to achieve that balance. You will get better results if you stick to a maximum of 3 primary **colors** in your color scheme. According to a University of Toronto study on how people used Adobe Color CC, most people said they prefer**red** simple color combinations that rely on only two or three **colors**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   These warm tones, when combined, create beautiful designs that feel fun and energetic. Print a design with these desert-like tones on a similar colo**red** apparel item, or neutral-toned tee for more balance between the shirt and design. Looking for more contrast? Choose a dark blue or purple to play off the **red**s and yellows in your design. Design a **red**, orange, and yellow shirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Throughout all our survey, black came first or second in most "good" traits (for example confidence, intelligence and sexiness) and barely figu**red** in the "bad" traits (arrogance). It wasn't a particularly good performer in the "generosity" scale, however, coming second to last after brown, but it's hard to imagine is being any other way. Try getting your kid to sit on the knee of a black-clad Santa. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Wear **red** with self-pride. It is a powerful color and should suit your personality. Exude self-belief and you will find that the **red** color you wear is a winner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   I recommend you to add a third color in the mix (not primary green). Or just do put way less yellow than **red**. Or opposite. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Dusty pink, soft rose, peach, jade green, taupe, gray, off-white and blue. Colours to avoid: Bright **red**, bright yellow. Try to steer clear of any super bright or neon colours that can overwhelm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Like a classic **red** lipstick, the color **red** in an interior design scheme is timeless, bold, and undeniably sexy. Whether you dress it up—or pare it down—the versatility of the shade makes it workable in all spaces. From cherry **red** lacquer to muted brick **red**, there are endless color pairings to bring the shade into the mix. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Orlando Bloom, David Beckham, and Zayn Malik. What to consider: Instead of reaching for harsh colour pairings, opt for more neutral bases and then add a warm version of your favourite colour such as a pine green or a warm blue to keep it interesting. When donning bright colours, such as a bright **red**, add it in through your tie or pocket square, alongside a muted blue button-up and navy suit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   But, as we all know, there isn’t just one shade of **red**. Women are typically more in-tune with their ‘colour profile’ because of hours spent finding the right shade of foundation or right shade of **red** lipstick for their complexion. There are dusty **red**s, maroons, wine-**red**s, true **red**s, pinky-**red**s, orangey-**red**s… and just as a blue undertone separates the colour from true **red**, so too does our undertone or level of contrast dictate what type of **red** looks best on us. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
