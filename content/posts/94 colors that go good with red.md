## 94 Things About Colors That Go Good With Red | colors that go good with red and yellow
-   Oh, **red**. It’s such a tricky color to work with in the design world. Too much **red** can be overwhelming, and it’s even said that it can raise the heart rate. But **red** most certainly does have a place in the home when done correctly. The key to working with **red** is to pair it with other **colors** that are complementary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For a more muted and calm room, try the pairing of **red** and tan. Tan is a calming color and looks great on walls. It gives you that neutral vibe, but if you want just a hint of color, throw in little pops of **red** here and there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Thankfully, blue can be quite complementary and easy to design around, according to Cristina Lehman, founder of C.Lehman Home. "Blue is a very versatile color and can almost be conside**red** neutral depending on how light or dark [it] is," she says. "For a really moody vibe, darker navy blues pai**red** with black make a big statement." - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Mix bold **red** with darker shades of green such as sage or emerald. Though not the usual, you may even experiment and consider army green. For a muted look, pair dark green with darker shades of **red** such as maroon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Looking to stay light in your color? Christine says a rose gold will look great on anyone with an olive complexion. “If you’re staying on the lighter side, the best **red** shade that will avoid feeling washed out will be a rose gold tone,” she notes. “Olive skin tones suit **red**s with a blue-violet under, such as auburn, burgundy, and mahogany.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. Avoid harsh shampoos. Most dandruff treatments are tough on colo**red** hair, says Jennifer J. But they are death to **red**heads, accelerating the fading process by weeks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For example, if you are wearing a **red** top, match it with white bottoms such as a pair of shorts or trousers. If you have a **red** skirt or trousers, put on a white shirt. This will neutralize the boldness of **red** but still make it pop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red, white, and blue may be the **colors** of the American flag, but that doesn't mean a color combo of **red** and blue has to feel patriotic.

Yet together, the two **colors** work — so long as there's a third shade to balance things out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   In this swanky seating area by Jen Talbot Design, rich saturated **colors** are the name of the game.

The cool color of the landing pad lightens the moody scheme and injects an unexpected burst of energy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Even though leafy green foliage frames a light blue accent wall in this room, the colorful bedding is the star of the show.

A low-profile black headboard anchors the bed and adds a modern edge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   2. You're no wallflower. Red is a head-turning hue, and you have to be self-assu**red** enough to accept the stares, says Tasha Forgash, color specialist at Shag Salon in Boston.

-   With **red** and white, you can’t go wrong. Any shade of **red** looks good with white but especially a deep shade of **red**.

-   Light gray walls provide the perfect neutral backdrop for kids' rooms that tend to be bursting with vibrant **colors**.

-   Copper highlights can be added to darker **red** shades to add realistic dimension and make **red** hair color look brighter and more energized.

-   Natural wood finishes or rich brown tones tend to complement both blue and **red** beautifully as demonstrated in this music corner by Raili Clasen.

-   Grey is cool and soft so it will make the color **red** pop. It’s a great alternative if you want a neutral pairing with **red** but wants to do without black and white. The two **colors** compliment each other very well, giving off a vibe that screams sophistication. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Another way to determine your undertone is through the “fabric” test, says celebrity colorist Jeremy Tardo. “An easy way to determine your skin’s undertones at home is to examine your complexion next to a stark white or jet black fabric,” he says. “Look into a mirror and hold the fabric up behind you or to the side of your face. Are your natural tones golden next to the fabric? Do you see **red**dish hues, pink, or even green? If you see none of these, your natural tone may be quite neutral in which case, you can wear almost any hair color well.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Don’t forget about adding in **red** textures. It doesn’t all have to be paint, furniture, and accent pieces.

-   Go bold with patterns when using **red**. The black and white leopard spot wallpaper is an aggressive choice—but up against a bright **red** and bold washstand it totally suits. The gold finishes add a lighter touch so as to not outdo anything in the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   “The **red** hair color molecule is larger than other color molecules which is why it fades and rinses out so quickly,” he says. “Since this molecule doesn’t enter the cortex (center) of the hair easily, we want to keep the cuticle (shell) as sealed and healthy as possible.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – if you’re struggling to find the exact right shade of **red**, remember in most cases that less is more. Also, you won’t commit yourself to a shade that you will tire of quickly. Commitment is a scary thing – if you’re just starting out and want to add **red** but are a little leary, don’t go too big. Try adding in a **red** book, blanket, or a few pillows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Red and purple aren’t usually the first two **colors** you would think to pair together given that they are located on opposite ends of the spectrum—but they can deliver quite the punch.

-   If your favorite color is **red** and all you want for your living quarters is a large dollop of drama and glamor, do not hesitate to go all-out **red**. You can dab a generous shade of **red** on the walls, furniture, and even the linen coverings on the furniture. To add more depth to the décor, use different shades of **red** such as cherry **red**, wine **red**, magenta, rose **red**, and burgundy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   While decorating your house, the first thing you must concentrate on is the color scheme you choose for the exterior and interiors of your abode.

Be it the living room or the bedroom, this bold color can beautifully transform your space into a luxurious haven. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – on that same note, you can add in **red** foliage as a non-committal way to see if you will like **red**. Something like a little **red** eucalyptus in a vase is a great start. Test swatches – if painting your walls **red**, always do test swatches. You want to make sure you get the right shade you are after. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A regal and beloved color accompaniment of **red** is gold. You must choose matte shades of gold so as to maintain a subtle balance with the bold **red** color of the walls.

-   Next, you'll want to consider your existing pieces of decor. Can you draw inspiration from a sofa or a rug that you already have? If you're starting from scratch you can compare fabric swatches, paint samples, and wood or metal finishes to get a better idea of how everything looks together. Keep in mind that all three **colors** don't have to be used equally throughout your space, you can use as little or as much as your heart desires. It might be easier to select one as the dominant color and design your space around that, and that's totally fine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – if painting your walls **red**, always do test swatches. You want to make sure you get the right shade you are after. Go with your gut – at the end of the day, it’s your house and you’re the one that has to live in it. If you like it, keep it! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Go all in on a bold palette like the team over at Cynthia Ferguson Designs and weave in a tertiary color like orange. In the corridor just beyond the foyer, half of the wall is decked out with wallpaper showcasing a blue and orange pattern, while the other half of the wall, ceiling, and trim are all painted in the same shade of cornflower blue. The color **red** — covering the door, walls, trim — is used to visually separate the entry from the corridor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Your undertone usually falls into one of three categories: cool, neutral, and warm. According to Aaron Bradford, colorist at NYC-based hair studio Cedric Salon, “cool” undertones have hints of blue, green, and violet in their skin, while “warm” tones appear **red**, orange, golden, or yellow. As for “neutral” hues, their undertones are usually a mix of warm and cool tones, which means this lucky bunch is able to find a wider variety of hair **colors** that flatter them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   – if you’re just starting out and want to add **red** but are a little leary, don’t go too big. Try adding in a **red** book, blanket, or a few pillows. Try foliage – on that same note, you can add in **red** foliage as a non-committal way to see if you will like **red**. Something like a little **red** eucalyptus in a vase is a great start. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   A sleek and modern **red** color combination involves the incorporation of the color grey. If you are looking to spruce up your living room and give it an ultra-modern look, you can opt for this unique color scheme. Go for a matte grey finish to your furniture and ambient lighting to bring out the **red** hues of the walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
