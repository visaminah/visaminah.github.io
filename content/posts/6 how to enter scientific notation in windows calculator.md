## 6 Things About How To Enter Scientific Notation In Windows Calculator | Wolfram Alpha
-   Start by entering a value into the **calculator**, such as 3.1416 for Pi. Next, hit the MS (Memory store) button to put it into memory. Now, when you want to use that number again, click MR (Memory recall) to load it into the **calculator**. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   For most people, though, the modern version should suffice. Since it receives updates through the Microsoft Store, it could gain new features in the future. The old **calculator** app isn't in active development anymore. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   First, use the slide-out menu on the left side to select the Standard **calculator**. You'll then see an icon to the right of the name that looks like an arrow pointing at a small box. Click that to pin the **calculator** to your screen and it will stay on top permanently. You can drag it around or resize it as needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   If you expand the **calculator** to show the History sidebar on the right, you can click the Memory header to view that value. In addition, you can store multiple values in memory to recall them easily. Hit MC to clear all values from memory. Like the history, these will disappear when you close the app too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   Windows 10 users have the modern Calculator, which is a Store app. The Windows 8.1 Calculator isn't as full-featured as what Windows 10 has. And those on Windows 8 or Windows 7 will see the old-school **calculator** instead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
-   You can open the **calculator** in any version of Windows by pressing the Windows key to open the Start menu, then typing **calculator** to search for it. Some keyboards also have a dedicated shortcut key for the **calculator**. If you use it often, right click on the Calculator app's Taskbar icon and choose Pin to taskbar to keep it close by. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite>
