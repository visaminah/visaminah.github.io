The video begins after he’s already stripped the floor to the bare plywood and removed a partial wall, leaving a bundle of wires and device boxes hanging. All that’s left is to demo the drywall from the back wall, which is about 6 feet long. He could use a hammer, but “when there are finished surfaces involved,” he says, “I don’t like to hit things that hard if I don’t have to.” - Source: Internet If you prefer something handheld to other tools, consider the Fiskars Pro Drywaller’s Utility Knife (US$19.98, Amazon). Part easy blade razor knife, part jab saw, this is one of the best tools for tasks such as cutting small holes. - Source: Internet To make fast work out of cutting drywall, go with an oscillating multi-tool. The Milwaukee M18 FUEL oscillating multi-tool includes a drywall cut-out tool and a variable speed trigger. The variable speed allows users to set the tool between 10,000 and 20,000 oscillations per minute. This cordless machine also includes an LED light spanning 180 degrees for better visibility. - Source: Internet As you can see, the process of cutting drywall and avoiding damage to the studs need not be complicated. All it takes is some initial planning and patience to create the opening manually. Let’s dive deeper into how to cut drywall and fix it onto studs and how to remove drywall from a wall. - Source: Internet Whether dealing with existing drywall or prepping new drywall, there are some tools that are vital to the process. Much like sanding tools, drywall screws, or carpenter’s pencils, the right drywall cutting tool is necessary for a smooth and efficient job. Whether the work is a large task or a simple project, there are drywall cutout tools to meet every need. - Source: Internet “This makes cutting sections of drywall a snap,” wrote one satisfied customer. “What surprised me was the dust collection, even with no vacuum attached this did a great job of collecting the dust inside of the clear dust box. I used this on my ⅝-inch drywall and it had no issues cutting it, very comfy grip and following my mark was simple due to the V guide on the front of the base.” - Source: Internet “I have 50 years’ experience as a carpenter/remodeler,” explained a customer. “This tool is well made and has multiple pilot drills for different materials, including several carbide bits and several sets of different cutters, all arranged in a convenient storage box. The central arbor/driver has a spring to ensure continuous contact of the clear acrylic cover with the ceiling, and the cover is held onto the arbor and spring with a reverse threaded nut.” - Source: Internet Locate a spot without any beams or circuits behind it. Once you’ve done so, press the blade of a handsaw into the wall. Then, use your palm to push the saw into the drywall gently. - Source: Internet Drywall is literally all around us. If you’re reading this in an office, chances are that every wall surface around you is made of drywall. And if you’re at home, your walls and ceilings are most likely made of drywall. - Source: Internet Strike a line or use a t-square as a guide. Cut through the paper on the front of the drywall. Turn the piece of drywall over and snap it along the line of your cut. Then fold the sheet of drywall and cut the back paper to finish the job. - Source: Internet “This compact saw is so darn handy, lays easily in my tool bag, is more convenient than my larger traditional circular saw to tote around that it’s becoming my go-to saw for small to intermediate cuts,” wrote one reviewer. “It has a nice/precise/quality rip fence and angle cut feature and the knobs are quick and secure to set any angle cut.” - Source: Internet For a deeper cut, it includes a jab saw. It hinges open for easy cleaning and can store both blades. The carbon blades are designed to stay sharp much longer than average even when you cut drywall regularly. It’s like having an extra tool along with the utility knife. - Source: Internet Normally you’ll need two people to use a chalkline. But there’s a simple trick to use the chalkline when you’re working by yourself. Let’s say you need to cut a 4’X 8′ sheet down to 20″ X 96″. Mark 20″ on one end of the board. - Source: Internet Next, dry fit your cut piece of drywall and press it in to the outlet or switch. The toothpaste will transfer to the back of your drywall showing you exactly where you’ll need to cut. If you have an extra outlet box, use that to trace around your transfer marks. - Source: Internet To score a straight line when cutting drywall panels, a utility knife is a handy choice. The Fiskars Pro Drywaller’s Utility Knife is actually a two-in-one tool. To create more shallow cuts, there is a standard drywall blade with a retraction button at the top and a magnet to keep it in place. - Source: Internet “This saw has been perfect for cutting drywall and wood,” wrote a professional. “I repair drywall full time and I love this thing… When used properly, it’s great. If you have the proper blades it’s great. The blade change is also good since it has a tab to push-turn the blade unlocked.” - Source: Internet One reviewer pointed out, “Professionals love the RotoZip because it can do that task faster and more cleanly in experienced hands.” Another buyer wrote, “This tool zipped through 5/8 in drywall and 1/2 in drywall with ease.” - Source: Internet Fold this cut portion of the drywall so it snaps off from the back. Turn the sheet over and cut the remainder of the drywall using the utility knife. Hold up the cut piece of drywall so you can check the fit. - Source: Internet Most demolition crews remove drywall by banging holes in it with a sledgehammer, then tearing it off in pieces. The last step is to remove any chunks of drywall surrounding the screw and nail heads, and yanking or backing out the fasteners. Actually, that’s the next-to-last step; the last step is to shovel and sweep up mounds of crumbly drywall while trying to contain clouds of dust. - Source: Internet Be sure to change out the blades once they are dull. (drywall is hard on knife blades!). A dull blade is more dangerous to use than a sharp one is because it takes more effort which makes it more likely you’ll lose control of the blade. - Source: Internet A hole saw is a tool you’re only going to use if you’re working on drywall that’s already in place. So for instance, a hole saw comes in handy when you want to make the hole for a recess light fixture. Having a hole saw makes a great addition to any toolbox, but it is by no means essential. - Source: Internet Some tools come with features that help control the amount of dust that comes with cutting drywall. Certain tools, often hole saws, have a specially designed dust shield. Many power tools include a dust-sealed switch to prevent dust from getting into the machine and causing damage. Consider looking for these features when shopping for cutting tools. - Source: Internet With the power and capability of a full circular saw, and at a great price too, the Rockwell compact circular saw is one of the most lightweight and easy-to-use tools to cut drywall. Compared to traditional circular saws, this corded circular cutter is much lighter and has an inline grip for greater control and comfort when cutting drywall panels. The adjustable depth setting lets users choose the cut they need, and the built-in port for a dust-vac prevents unmanageable debris. - Source: Internet With the panels removed in one piece, all that’s left is to score and fanfold them [4], and carry them down to the truck for disposal. No shoveling, no trail of dust on the carpet. “I’m able to surgically remove these pieces of drywall without building clouds of dust or creating buckets and buckets of crumbs,” Jackson says. “Plus, there’s much less risk of damaging existing surfaces, when the drywall is taken out in an orderly and controlled manner like this.” - Source: Internet Welcome to the Thomas guide to the best drywall cutting tools 2022. Thomas has been connecting North American industrial buyers and suppliers for more than 120 years. When you purchase products through our independent recommendations, we may earn an affiliate commission. - Source: Internet “This is a must-have if you’re going to be cutting holes in drywall, for whatever reason,” wrote another buyer. “Being cordless makes it quick and easy. It also has the power to do any job with speed and it’s very easy to control.” - Source: Internet Choosing the right drywall cutting tool for the project at hand is important. Cutting drywall can be a difficult and dusty process. Without the right tools for the job, it can be a major challenge—but the right cut-out tool depends on the job ahead. - Source: Internet We all need to know how to cut drywall. It’s going to come up in many renovation projects. Knowing how to cut it is one thing. Knowing how to do it like a pro is another! - Source: Internet Yes, drywall and spinning blades don’t mix except in the possible case of saws with dust collection systems. There are few circular saws that offer it, but one alternative is a track saw with dust collection. This is undoubtedly a specialty tool and hasn’t yet been widely accepted for this application. It’s certainly an option to get the job done when you need to cut many sheets at the same length. - Source: Internet Cutting into drywall to create an opening comes with its challenges. The last thing you want to do is cut into the studs located behind the gypsum board. Drywall is usually layered over wood studs or beams that are used to support the drywall, and it can get tricky to remove this layer without damaging the studs. - Source: Internet There are two steps to prevent cutting the studs behind the drywall. The first is to identify exactly where the studs are located and then work carefully around them. The second step is to manually cut the surface little by little, using a utility knife or jab saw to avoid cutting too deep and too quickly. - Source: Internet This inexpensive little tool is used to shave material off the edge of a board of sheetrock. Think of it as a block plane for drywall. It’s held and used in the same way a block plane is used. - Source: Internet Jackson starts by pulling the free end of the lower panel away from the wall while pushing on the upper panel just above the seam between panels [3]. The crease this creates makes it easy to cut the seam, this time with a regular, short-handled utility knife for better control. After a little fiddling with the drain line, Jackson lifts the free end of the panel and it comes away cleanly. The upper panel comes away even more easily. - Source: Internet First, you want to run a measuring tape across the surface of the wall and studs to determine the width of the drywall. Start measuring from the edge of the last sheet of drywall and take the tape up to the adjoining stud. Then, mark the center of this stud. - Source: Internet When the blade cuts through the drywall, begin sawing in a gentle to and fro motion. You want to ensure that your blade isn’t perpendicular to the wall but at a flattened angle instead. This way, you’ll feel a slight bump as soon as the blade comes in contact with any stud behind it. - Source: Internet Drywall is composed of a sheet of gypsum sandwiched between two paper backings. Cutting drywall doesn’t usually require cutting through all three layers – if you cut through one paper face and score the core, you can usually snap the back face along the line without having to turn the sheet over and cut through it. Unlike cutting the sheet along its width, to cut lengthwise, you don’t hang a drywall square from the top of the sheet to mark the line; instead, mark the line horizontally using tools you probably already have. - Source: Internet What remains now is the drywall face paper on the side that you didn’t score, but which you should have no trouble cutting it away at this point in the process. Once more, use your trusty utility knife to get the job done. Only be careful to avoid tearing the paper, particularly if your project is going to involve taping drywall seams. - Source: Internet Drywall ceilings are made to last a long time. However, you could be just one unexpected pipe leak away from needing to repair or replace yours. Even if you need to hire a pro to handle pipe and ceiling joist repair, removing and replacing the drywall ceiling yourself could save on overall project costs. - Source: Internet Take your knife and slice into the end of the drywall board going all the way through the sheet. Slide the end of your chalkline into the cut you’ve just made and it will hold securely in place. Now you don’t need a helper to hold the other end! Just unreel the line till you’re at the other end of the board, and snap the line. - Source: Internet When shopping for power tools for cutting drywall, whether you’re a professional drywaller or dabble in some DIY, consider this list of the best tools for the job based on thousands of drywall tool reviews. The best specialty tool for drywall cutting is the DeWALT 20V MAX rotary tool (US$149, Lowe’s). Among power tools, it offers a strong performance and straight cuts as well as a durable design. - Source: Internet The first point to consider is the overall scope of the job and the cutting power that’s needed. With a large task, a power tool can save time while still providing accurate cuts. If the job is smaller, however, a hand cut-out tool might be a more simple option. - Source: Internet We hope you’ve gained some knowledge from these 6 methods for cutting drywall. If you’re a Pro, and you have a drywalling tip, add them in the comments below—or contact us with your own Pro tips. Happy drywalling! - Source: Internet Use a utility knife to cut through the face of the drywall, as this will allow you to apply ample pressure without damaging the drywall. If you’re looking for a utility knife, a good choice is the REXBETI 2-Pack Utility Knife from Amazon.com. It is ultra-sharp, double-hardened, and comes with extra blades included. - Source: Internet This tool is perfect for a small job where cutting drywall is required. A keyhole saw, also known as a jab saw, is great for quick, albeit rough, cuts. This WilFiks Razor Sharp hand saw uses heat-treated blades for strength and durability and has a slim body design. - Source: Internet If the section of drywall bridges a joist, but you only want one side of the drywall removed, cut with your saw alongside the joist. Be sure to cut the inner portion so that the adjacent section of drywall is still fastened to the joist. Shown here, the section of drywall that remains is on the right; the portion to be removed is on the left. Lee Wallender - Source: Internet Because of the gypsum that the drywall is made with, it makes it harder for a fire to spread during an outbreak, this is one important reason why people proof their walls and ceilings with it. It will suffice to add that drywall are quite flexible to work with as opposed to other of its alternatives. Drywall obviously comes with a lot of benefits but installation also causes worry because of the higher tendency of dust maturing the place when going through this process. - Source: Internet “When using drywall stilts on a job site, I hated having cords from cut-out tools and strip-fed drywall screw guns,” noted a buyer. “This had the same power as the corded and along with the cordless screw gun and strip magazine attachment, I [am able] to maintain capacity and capability while keeping a cord-free floor.” - Source: Internet To get you started, here are some pointers to consider when searching for information regarding How To Cut Drywall Straight On Wall:\r- Do some research to find How to Replace Damaged Drywall in a Ceiling-related information from reputable sources.

It’s going to come up in many renovation projects. Knowing how to <strong>cut</strong> it is one thing. Knowing how to do it like a pro is another! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yes, <strong>drywall</strong> and spinning blades don’t mix except in the possible case of saws with dust collection systems. There are few circular saws that offer it, but one alternative is a track saw with dust collection. This is undoubtedly a specialty tool and hasn’t yet been widely accepted for this application.

The crease this creates makes it easy to <strong>cut</strong> the seam, this time with a regular, short-handled utility knife for better control. After a little fiddling with the drain line, Jackson lifts the free end of the panel and it comes away cleanly. The upper panel comes away even more easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>First, you want to run a measuring tape across the surface of the wall and studs to determine the width of the <strong>drywall</strong>. Start measuring from the edge of the last sheet of <strong>drywall</strong> and take the tape up to the adjoining stud. Then, mark the center of this stud. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When the blade <strong>cut</strong>s through the <strong>drywall</strong>, begin sawing in a gentle to and fro motion. You want to ensure that your blade isn’t perpendicular to the wall but at a flattened angle instead. This way, you’ll feel a slight bump as soon as the blade comes in contact with any stud behind it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Drywall is composed of a sheet of gypsum sandwiched between two paper backings. Cutting <strong>drywall</strong> doesn&rsquo;t usually require <strong>cut</strong>ting through all three layers &ndash; if you <strong>cut</strong> through one paper face and score the core, you can usually snap the back face along the line without having to turn the sheet over and <strong>cut</strong> through it. Unlike <strong>cut</strong>ting the sheet along its width, to <strong>cut</strong> lengthwise, you don&rsquo;t hang a <strong>drywall</strong> square from the top of the sheet to mark the line; instead, mark the line horizontally using tools you probably already have. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What remains now is the <strong>drywall</strong> face paper on the side that you didn’t score, but which you should have no trouble <strong>cut</strong>ting it away at this point in the process. Once more, use your trusty utility knife to get the job done. Only be careful to avoid tearing the paper, particularly if your project is going to involve taping <strong>drywall</strong> seams. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Drywall ceilings are made to last a long time. However, you could be just one unexpected pipe leak away from needing to repair or replace yours. Even if you need to hire a pro to handle pipe and ceiling joist repair, removing and replacing the <strong>drywall</strong> ceiling yourself could save on overall project costs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Take your knife and slice into the end of the <strong>drywall</strong> board going all the way through the sheet. Slide the end of your chalkline into the <strong>cut</strong> you’ve just made and it will hold securely in place. Now you don’t need a helper to hold the other end! Just unreel the line till you’re at the other end of the board, and snap the line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When shopping for power tools for <strong>cut</strong>ting <strong>drywall</strong>, whether you’re a professional <strong>drywall</strong>er or dabble in some DIY, consider this list of the best tools for the job based on thousands of <strong>drywall</strong> tool reviews.

Shown here, the section of <strong>drywall</strong> that remains is on the right; the portion to be removed is on the left.
