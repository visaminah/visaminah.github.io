Create a space that embodies the type of vibe you want to create. A lounge will look best with several large couches and side tables to sit back and relax in. A club atmosphere will have several high-top tables and plenty of open space for dancing. A sports bar might have high-top tables with bar stools and TVs on the wall. - Source: Internet If you have exposed brick for your basement walls, you have the ideal backdrop for an industrial or rustic-inspired basement bar. Work with the bricks or natural stone and create a space that’s comfortable and unpretentious. It should feel like your favorite neighborhood bar that welcomes you in with a warm hug and a cold drink. - Source: Internet If you decide to expand on it later, you can. Perhaps you start with a single shelf and then add on later or upgrade from the floating shelf to a built-in unit. You could start with a simple bar and build on it to have a decorative front, bar rail, and fancier barstools. - Source: Internet Use a variety of black materials when building your bar. You could have dark-stained wood, marble, or granite for the bar. Then black leather for the seating. Use black glass for the lighting shades. - Source: Internet To keep your basement bar from feeling too sparse and cold, you’ll want to add touches of natural materials. You could have a wood floor or wood bar front. Then place metal or wood barstools upholstered with leather or suede. - Source: Internet If you’re in the process of planning a basement remodel, this is your chance to create your dream finished basement. Why not turn yours into a wine cellar? You could build a wine rack on one wall for plenty of wine storage. You can buy kits, or you could build custom shelving for the number of bottles you own. Then you’ll need cabinetry for your wine glasses. - Source: Internet With running water, you can have a sink, ice maker, and a complete bar set. This eliminates the need to run upstairs and makes it easier for you to bartend. If you plan on hosting larger groups, consider adding a dishwasher to make washing lots of glassware easier. - Source: Internet There’s only so much you can do in a dry bar. It lacks running water, so you’ll need to bring ice down with you and carry used glassware back upstairs to clean. Skip all of this hassle and make your setup a wet bar. You can work with a plumber to ensure you tap into the correct plumbing lines. - Source: Internet You don’t have to go all out with your bar design. Sometimes, all you need is a bar cabinet, counter, and stools. These are the basic elements of a bar and they’re all you need to create one in your basement. This is a smart approach if your space or budget has limitations. - Source: Internet A basement remodel is the perfect opportunity to create a livable space. Why not create a room that’s perfect for hanging out and entertaining friends? You could build a bar and host events. Not all bars are the same, though. - Source: Internet Add a built-in cabinet or shelving around the counter space. This will give you plenty of storage for your alcohol, glassware, and bartending tools. You could install a wine and drink fridge under the countertop. This idea looks great and gives you a place to store drinks that need to be cold, like mixers. - Source: Internet You can’t go wrong with using wood to build your custom bar. It’s a classic building material and found in bars across America. Whether you use light or dark wood, you need to have an idea of what you’re building before you start. - Source: Internet Use reclaimed wood for the construction of the bar and any shelving. Or you could have fresh wood that still has its bark on the edge. Then leave this raw detail facing out when you mount your shelves or build your bar top. - Source: Internet If you love the modern look of an all-white living room or kitchen, then why not continue this design style to your basement? You could have crisp white walls that line elegant marble countertops and decorative pendant lights illuminating the space. The bright white design theme will keep the space feeling bright, welcoming, and fresh. Since there typically aren’t many windows in a basement, this is key to preventing the space from feeling too dark or cave-like. - Source: Internet Perhaps your bar could look ultra-modern like a cool club from the city. Or maybe you’d feel right at home in a rustic bar that’s reminiscent of a country cottage. If you’re serious about entertaining, perhaps you’ll build more than just a bar, and instead, a full kitchen. - Source: Internet Build your bar to fit the space you have available in your basement. Perhaps your basement bar design is only big enough for two barstools. That’s okay, but don’t go any smaller; just one bar stool will be awkward when using it with your guests. Instead, skip having the barstool setup entirely and create a walk-up bar and place seating elsewhere in your basement. - Source: Internet Choose simple lighting fixtures that have a single cable with a bulb. Or you could have a metal cage around the bulbs for an industrial touch. Then finish your bar with vintage metal bar stools. They’re affordable and will give your bar an authentic feel. - Source: Internet “I don’t like going into the basement. I’m always afraid that something’s going to blow up.” – Roz Chast - Source: Internet Not all bars need to have a countertop area that you can walk behind. If you’re short on square footage, this bar style will take up too much room to be functional. Instead, consider some bar wall ideas. These walk-up bars have an open concept. - Source: Internet To keep your basement from feeling like a black hole, highlight with contrasting materials, like metal. You could have a metal bar rail, furniture frames, and lighting fixtures. These will reflect the light to define the space and give it dimension without taking away from the black theme. - Source: Internet If you have a dead corner in your basement, use it for a corner bar. It doesn’t have to take up a lot of space. You could put a bar hutch in the corner and call it a day. Or you could build out around the corner. This will give you an effective space without taking up a lot of room. - Source: Internet If you love to do more than make drinks, consider adding a basement kitchenette. Then you could serve both drinks and snacks to your friends and family. Instead of having a bar to stand behind, you could replace it with a small kitchen island. Or you can combine the two so that the island still has a raised bar top on the opposite side of the kitchen. - Source: Internet It can help to use a pre-made bar plan. Measure to ensure it fits, and then follow the steps to build your bar. If you aren’t ready to build your bar from scratch, you can look for a kit. Just follow the instructions to put the pieces together. - Source: Internet Following are some suggestions for where to begin your search for data on Pinterest:\rYou should try to find The Top 56 Basement Bar Ideas – Interior Home and Design-related information from reputable places.
