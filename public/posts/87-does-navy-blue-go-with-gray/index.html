The navy <strong>blue</strong> grasscloth wallpaper really shines alongside clean white walls with <strong>blue</strong> undertones. Details such as the rope-style wall lamp and striped pillows nod to the seaside theme, while framed <strong>gray</strong> swim trunks and a charcoal throw at the foot of the bed offer neutral contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>– Infusing a splash of red into a room with <strong>gray</strong> adds instant energy into the space.
