Giving Sulking Room Pink, Inchyra Blue and Green Smoke as examples. &lsquo;However, if you want to keep the palette more monochromatic, layer tones of grey like Ammonite with Mole’s Breath.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A super popular smoky <strong>green</strong> hue, Green Smoke by Farrow & Ball is one of my favorites on this list. An army <strong>green</strong> color, subdued by gray undertones, Green Smoke really makes a statement. This color pairs beautifully with off-white <strong>colors</strong> and mustard yellows, just to name a few. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before 2020 ended, Pantone announced the Colour of The Year. For 2021, they were actually two. One of them was Ultimate Grey. With so much focus on this colour, you can help but wonder what you can mix and match with it? What <strong>colors</strong> can you pair with grey clothes? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We may be biased, but Farrow & Ball’s Pigeon shade is our go-to grey-<strong>green</strong> paint color. This shade evokes cozy and soft feelings and finds its name after the color of the pigeon bird. It brings out the vibrancy of brass material and matches pewter and greys beautifully. If you’re looking to incorporate a touch of <strong>green</strong> into your home, this shade is for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I love that this <strong>green</strong> is very dark but not overwhelmingly <strong>green</strong>. It almost looks charcoal in certain lighting. It’s a great dark <strong>green</strong> wall color that can almost look neutral in the right lighting! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With its subtle mix of blue and <strong>green</strong> pigments, Blue Gray creates the most relaxed of rooms. It has the magical quality of gently shifting between blue and grey depending on the light and time of day. We opted for this shade at the #kennyreno to achieve the Scandinavian look the clients were after. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;One of my personal favorite color combos is gray and <strong>green</strong>. Specifically, look for cool, mid-tone grays with blue undertones and cooler <strong>green</strong> hues (pistachio, light olive, etc) as well. This combination adds naturalism and freshness to whatever space it is in,&rsquo; says Kazimierski. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While we might not be able to identify or name all of them, there’s one thing we know. Grey is everywhere. And if you are thinking of dressing up, there are numerous shades of grey that you could choose from. Apart from that, you can pair it up with different <strong>colors</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>green</strong> color has a lot of gray undertones to it, making it not feel too bright. It instantly makes a room feel cozier. It’s definitely on the <strong>green</strong>er side for bluish <strong>green</strong> paint <strong>colors</strong>, but there is blue to it that can be brought out using blue accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The key to a great match lies in coordinating the tones. Warm gray shades go well with other warm-toned <strong>colors</strong>, like taupe, blush pink, butter yellow, and burnt orange. On the other hand, you can pair cool gray with other chill tones like navy blue, sage <strong>green</strong>, and cool whites. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The color grey has come to represent different things. It’s an awesome color that compliments so many other <strong>colors</strong>. It’s no wonder that a lot of brands lean towards grey. It has that modern, firm, and fresh feel that is cool to look at. It looks professional yet does not alienate the target audience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fieldstone is the chameleon of grey-<strong>green</strong> shades. It depends on the time of day and the space you’re looking at, as to what the color will look like. This shade offers a timeless and elegant look and is part of the Benjamin Moore Classic Color Collection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As a rule of thumb cooler-leaning <strong>green</strong>s and yellow-toned <strong>green</strong>s like lime, fern <strong>green</strong>s, jade <strong>green</strong>s and emerald <strong>green</strong>s work best with crisp true whites. You have more choice with more muted, dusky <strong>green</strong>s like sage and pistachio. They will usually work both with a bright white to add a freshness to these more muted tones or an off-white for a more warm, cocooning feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>’When introducing colour accents to lighter greys, think about the undertones of the pairing first and then the contrast you wish to achieve. Ammonite a soft stony grey will team beautifully with blues and <strong>green</strong>s such as Inchyra Blue or Hague Blue as both have the gentle undertones of nature, such as the delicate brown note found in Ammonite and the <strong>green</strong> in Inchyra Blue.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hugh Metcalf Deputy Editor As Livingetc&rsquo;s deputy editor, Hugh is in constant communication with the greatest designers in the world. This year, he has been out to Milan to meet the most innovative interiors brands and been reporting on new design ideas constantly for both the print and digital versions of Livingetc. He was able to use these contacts and this insight to get to the heart of what to pair with <strong>green</strong> right now. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Channel the 1950s Mid Century mood with a retro colour palette of chartreuse <strong>green</strong>, blue and mustard yellow. Neutral grey carpet and grey-scale rugs all the captivating colour palette of this vintage style to take centre stage. Grey ceramic lighting and cushions help to tie the grey tones in seamlessly without them distracting from the main attraction of retro <strong>green</strong>s and blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Green and pink are complementary <strong>colors</strong>, sitting opposite each other on the wheel. This means that the scheme is high impact,&rsquo; explains Sarah. Get your proportions right for a truly restorative space - a generous amount of <strong>green</strong> against touches of pink is gorgeous. Nature-inspired patterns, such as florals or botanicals, are particularly effective when decorating with this combination.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Since these <strong>green</strong>s all lean toward gray or have gray undertones, they’ll also pair well with your favorite modern greige paint color, too. (Your existing creamy whites or pure white trim will be OK, too.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As this expert advice hopefully proves, there&rsquo;s a right tone and shade of almost every color that will work with versatile <strong>green</strong>. However, there are some shades that can be challenging to put with <strong>green</strong>, just for the connotations these colour combinations have. This tends to particularly apply to a <strong>green</strong> shade mixed from primary yellow and blues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Green and yellow are adjacent to each other on the color wheel, so rooms in this palette are harmonious and easy to live with. &lsquo;When pairing <strong>colors</strong>, we strive for a similar base - so there’s a relationship between shades,&rsquo; explains architect and interior designer Noa Santos, founder of Nainoa (opens in new tab) and designer of this refined <strong>green</strong> living room. &lsquo;In this case the <strong>colors</strong>, though different, feel like they are a part of the same family.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;From a color pairing perspective, of course this harmony extends to combining <strong>green</strong> with neutrals. As mentioned, <strong>green</strong> sits in the center of the wheel so can be combined with both cold and warm tones. As an example - combining verdigris <strong>green</strong> with a chalky, blue-toned grey will create a cool, calm scheme, whereas pairing it with a warmer, yellow-toned beige will create an earthy, outdoorsy feel.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you hear somebody say they plan to their space <strong>green</strong>, you might think of a shade that’s bold and stark; however, there are numerous cool-toned shades of <strong>green</strong> that create a beautiful, neutral look. If you haven’t thought about using grayish-<strong>green</strong> paint in your home, we’re about to tell you why you should. The light <strong>green</strong> hue softened by undertones of gray is beautiful and creates a perfect neutral backdrop for decor and furnishings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Sage <strong>green</strong> is the optimal color choice right now. It harnesses the calming energy inherent in <strong>green</strong> but anchors it with an earthiness and depth not present in more vivid hues.&rsquo; explains Sarah Spiteri. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your grey clothes need a little pop, then you need to add more <strong>colors</strong> to your wardrobe. For some people, coming out with numerous clothing options might be difficult. But if you know what you are working with, it shouldn’t be too hard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We all know that Ultimate Grey is one of Pantone’s Colors Of The Year. If you don’t know what the other one is, it’s a color called Illuminating. It’s a vibrant yellow that exudes positivity and fortitude. Since the year is not over yet, you still have the chance to wear these two <strong>colors</strong> together! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;I can wax poetic forever when considering <strong>green</strong> in an interior,&rsquo; says interior designer Ghislaine Viñas. &lsquo;Green is one of those incredibly versatile <strong>colors</strong> that can be both soothing and activating – and used in combination can create a great balance.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;re able to recognize the color temperature of the gray you&rsquo;re considering, it will make choosing a complementary color palette that much simpler. Temperature or undertone incompatibility is almost always the culprit when <strong>colors</strong> don’t look “right” together. Consider charcoal gray as an alternative to black or dark blue: Charcoal gray can be the perfect dark color accent without being too deep or intense. It is also stunning as upholstered furniture or rugs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a beautiful earthy <strong>green</strong>. It’s slightly darker than light <strong>green</strong>, with both blue and gray undertones. It really transforms in different light! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But gray also has incredible undertones that can make the color look like other shades. Gray with <strong>green</strong> undertones <strong>colors</strong> is a massive hit due to the combo’s gorgeous aesthetics. But some combos have a heavier gray look, while others have a more significant <strong>green</strong> appearance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Add a rich yellow accent to a deeper, sludgy <strong>green</strong> grey. A flash of paint on architectural details can incorporate the colour without having to make too bold a statement with entire feature walls. Tie in the highlighted painted areas with co-ordinating furnishings and modern artworks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When choosing a specific gray shade for your room&rsquo;s color palette, you should start by choosing a tone of color. Warm grays are slightly tinted with either orange, yellow, or red, making them appear a bit cozier—they may even look almost beige. Cooler-toned grays have been cut with shades of blue, <strong>green</strong>, or purple. The resulting gray hue feels clean, crisp, and modern. True to its &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; title, gray really goes with almost every other color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;My go-to <strong>colors</strong> to pair with gray in home decor are shades of <strong>green</strong>,&rsquo; says Leonard Ang, CEO at iPropertyManagement (opens in new tab). &lsquo;It provides a sharp, clean effect, and the contrast between a charcoal grey and a bright <strong>green</strong> can really pop if the <strong>green</strong> is used in moderation.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Pairing <strong>green</strong> with a vivid orange will give more energy to a space; contrasting complementary <strong>colors</strong> emphasizes the qualities of each and creates a bold statement look. I’d use a strong black, too, to give a solidly masculine mid-century modern scheme. It’s calming because it’s strong and looks very put together.&rsquo; says Annie Sloan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Today I have rounded up my favorite blue-gray paint <strong>colors</strong> for you. The blue gives them a bright, happy shade that is very trendy right now. However, the grey undertones keep them from being too bright. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This list illustrated the many different levels of a gray-<strong>green</strong> paint combination. How your color looks on your screen or in the store might not accurately represent how it would appear in your home. It’s best to test your color choices on your walls for a few days. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a light blue <strong>green</strong> color that people even consider neutral. But, it’s definitely <strong>green</strong>. It’s a great option if you want a hint of <strong>green</strong> without it being too in your face. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s time to move over, Christian Grey. There are more than just 50 shades of grey! As with other <strong>colors</strong>, there are various shades of grey. Our eyes can distinguish more than 500 shades of grey . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You may have noticed that gray has become one of the top neutral <strong>colors</strong> in the interior design world. While beige, tan, and white will always be great picks, decorating with gray grants homeowners design options they might not get with other neutrals, but there&rsquo;s always the question of choosing <strong>colors</strong> that go with gray. Gray can appear to be cool or warm, which makes a difference when it comes to selecting <strong>colors</strong> that live well with gray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are on the lookout for a fall outfit, you can wear a combination of grey and sage <strong>green</strong>. The coolness of these <strong>colors</strong> is a good contrast to the orange and yellow <strong>colors</strong> of fall. You can stand out yet blend in at the same time!

Grey is the perfect neutral when combined with a splash of colour, it can really bring a room to life – especially a vibrant <strong>green</strong>. Associated with nature this revitalising shade can perk up all shades of grey, from soft almost lilac tones to more brooding charcoal tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Mix just the right tones and you&rsquo;ll create a modern-country look with a very particular mood. This chartreuse <strong>green</strong> and dark grey living room has been given a cosy cabin vibe with a white wood wall panels. Such a zingy sofa colour needs a grey of equal depth so works perfectly with the charcoal tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>OK – so this is really a gray paint color. But, it is a gray with blue <strong>green</strong> undertones. It’s a popular neutral but just <strong>green</strong> enough to fit in well on this list. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The great thing about this wedding palette is that both <strong>colors</strong> have so many shades and hues. And if the wedding entourage chose to wear something grey, there are various purple shades to complement their gowns and suits. [What Colors Go With Purple Clothes?] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;In this case, the space needed to be exciting but also needed to have a soothing quality that the family could always enjoy,&rsquo; says Katie. &lsquo;We did this by softening the brighter values of the red and <strong>green</strong> by pulling in wood tones and by adding in warmth with the metal finishes. We knew that our best approach to using these bold <strong>colors</strong> was in knowing they will stand out but also keeping in mind that they need to feel like they belong.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s no secret that I love decorating with <strong>green</strong>. Pretty much our whole house is <strong>green</strong> or blue-ish <strong>green</strong>. But, even I admit that <strong>green</strong> can be a lot for a wall paint color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you have a grey suit, a pink dress shirt elevates it.

Like with many interior design rules, think odd numbers. In the above image, three <strong>colors</strong> are used together throughout the space in various shades - pink, blue and yellow – and it works to bring life to the neutral gray scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Of course, your choice of <strong>green</strong> is equally as important at the color you pair it with.

Emerald <strong>green</strong>s are sophisticated and luxurious, while mint <strong>green</strong> can be playful and fun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Green goes very well with natural textures, and in particular pale wood.
