Working under a <strong>sink</strong> in a confined space is challenging. Also, you may not be physically capable of managing this task by yourself. Enlist the help of others or hire a master plumber. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You should ideally change a kitchen <strong>faucet</strong> if it’s of an older model. Many people even like to upgrade the kitchen <strong>faucet</strong> after moving into a new home to install more water-efficient options. Moreover, replace the <strong>faucet</strong> if it’s dispensing low-quality water even after installing a water filter or softener. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Nope! You can replace a <strong>faucet</strong> yourself without having to hire a plumber. It should take you less than an hour with a few basic tools, such as a basin wrench. The same techniques apply to both kitchen and bathroom <strong>faucet</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Even though we’ll be installing a <strong>faucet</strong> in the kitchen, the same principles apply to installing any <strong>faucet</strong>. Also, you should know that different <strong>faucet</strong>s may have different configurations. For example, bathroom <strong>faucet</strong>s may have a pop-up drain attached. Some <strong>faucet</strong>s have a single handle, or a mixer, and others have two handles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Whatever their reasons for replacing your kitchen <strong>faucet</strong>, this is causing a flux in the kitchen <strong>sink</strong> market growth. The market jumped from $338.3 million to $367.1 from 2020 to 2021. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Let’s get started by removing the old <strong>faucet</strong>. Like with most plumbing projects, we’ll start by turning off the hot and cold water shut-off valves, which are usually located in the cabinet directly under the <strong>sink</strong>. When you’re finished, open up the <strong>faucet</strong> to relieve the pressure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Let’s begin by saying that installing a kitchen <strong>faucet</strong> isn’t a pretty task. You’ll most likely squeeze yourself into the small cabinet space under your <strong>sink</strong> to access the water supply lines, water filter, and garbage disposal. As the cabinet floor tends to be higher than the usual kitchen floor, we recommend laying down a piece of plywood that would fit inside the cabinet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We know that connecting the water supply lines can be a bit overwhelming for beginners. But, there’s no need to worry as modern homes have simple water lines, and even the <strong>faucet</strong>s are labeled. You’ll just need to attach the supply lines with the corresponding water supply valve. The color coding is usually red for the hot water line and black or blue for the cold water line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Remove the <strong>sink</strong> sprayer hose. If you do not intend to reuse the old <strong>faucet</strong>, cut off the <strong>sink</strong> sprayer hose (if plastic). The heavy counterweight attached to the sprayer hose will drop off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While boring the holes with a drill is pretty easy on the <strong>sink</strong>, we recommend hiring a contractor to add holes on the countertop for a countertop-mount <strong>faucet</strong>. For the <strong>sink</strong>, cover the majority of the <strong>sink</strong> area in painter’s tape and mark the placement of each additional hole. Use your drill to make a pilot hole, then use a hole saw drill bit to make it bigger. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The kitchen <strong>sink</strong> market size continues to grow. Experts project it to grow at a 3.6% CAGR through 2030. Recent events are causing people to invest in the comfort and ambiance of their homes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You&rsquo;re going to be spending some time laying on your back inside the <strong>sink</strong> cabinet, so clear out everything inside first. I took this opportunity to get rid of a lot of cleaning supplies that we had duplicates of, or that we didn&rsquo;t really need. Then lay an old towel over the bottom of the cabinet so you&rsquo;re not laying in chemical residue while you work! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Take a look at the underside of your <strong>sink</strong> where the <strong>faucet</strong> is connected. There should be a nut that holds a U shaped brace against the <strong>sink</strong>. Before you try wrestling it off, give it a quick squirt of Liquid Wrench penetrating oil first. This will help loosen the nut, so you won&rsquo;t struggle with it for hours! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The very first step is turning off the water supplies at the valves located underneath the kitchen <strong>sink</strong> no matter if there are separate water supplies for cold and hot water. Then, unthread your American standard <strong>faucet</strong> head from the spray hose base a little. For this, you need to unscrew the lock nut by twisting it out counterclockwise, and if there is no lock nut in your <strong>faucet</strong> model, twist your <strong>faucet</strong> spray head counterclockwise. Secure your spray hose by tying them or taping them on the base using duct tape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you have one pipe with a splitter like this one, it sends cold water both to the <strong>faucet</strong> and another location like a refrigerator. You only have to turn off the one that goes to the <strong>faucet</strong>, so trace the destination of each pipe to figure out the correct one. Turn the knobs clockwise until they&rsquo;re tightly closed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The braided spray head line combines the hot and cold water together and delivers it to the <strong>faucet</strong>. Before you connect it, thread the end through the donut shaped weight first. This weight pulls the sprayer head back into position when you&rsquo;re done using it! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Step #2: Install the <strong>faucet</strong> cover plate (if required) on the <strong>sink</strong>, making sure to center it on the <strong>sink</strong>. Tighten up the hold down nuts under the <strong>sink</strong> with pliers or a basin wrench. Do not over tighten plastic nuts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>First, turn off the water supply, and if there are separate water supplies for cold and hot water, turn off both of them just underneath your kitchen <strong>sink</strong>. The next step is pulling away from your Delta kitchen <strong>faucet</strong> head a little from the base. Here, you will find a lock nut located underneath your Delta spray head. Well, to take apart the spray head, you have to twist this lock nut counterclockwise while holding the <strong>faucet</strong> head steady. However, if your model doesn’t have a lock nut, in this case, you need to twist the <strong>faucet</strong> head counterclockwise to take apart it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Removing the old <strong>faucet</strong> requires just a basic wrench and a little help from a second person. Before removing the <strong>faucet</strong>, it is required to turn off all the valves underneath the <strong>sink</strong> and turn on the <strong>faucet</strong> to relieve pressure in the lines. Before taking it off, it is better to click a picture of the plumbing configuration to use as a reference later. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you set the new <strong>faucet</strong> in place, you’ll need something to seal the base. Some <strong>faucet</strong>s, like ours, have a gasket that goes between the <strong>sink</strong> and the <strong>faucet</strong>. If yours does not have one, apply a bead of plumber’s putty along the groove around the plate. This will keep water from dripping down into the <strong>sink</strong> cabinet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It should be obvious, but before disconnecting anything you need to turn off the water valves under the <strong>sink</strong>. Otherwise, you will get very wet. Once the water valves are off, turn on the <strong>faucet</strong> to let the remaining water out of the lines. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The costs to replace a kitchen <strong>sink</strong> <strong>faucet</strong> can vary depending on the condition of your current <strong>faucet</strong>. A rusty <strong>faucet</strong> costs more to replace than a relatively cleaner one. Rusty <strong>faucet</strong>s also require more manpower to replace since they almost always need to be sawed out. On average, a <strong>faucet</strong> replacement job sits around $212 to $558 which includes labor charges as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Take a look under your <strong>sink</strong> before you shop for a new <strong>faucet</strong>. If there&rsquo;s a deck plate installed under the <strong>faucet</strong> neck, there&rsquo;s a good chance there&rsquo;s more than one hole hidden underneath. It&rsquo;s better to know what you&rsquo;re dealing with now to avoid any surprises during installation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We cannot reiterate enough the fact that you need to find a proper <strong>faucet</strong> that matches your kitchen <strong>sink</strong>. So, look at the existing <strong>faucet</strong> as well as your <strong>sink</strong> very carefully to note the things that your new <strong>faucet</strong> should have. If the current <strong>faucet</strong> has a traditional separate sprayer, you may want to upgrade to a modern pull-down <strong>faucet</strong> with a built-in sprayer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Note that for single-handle <strong>faucet</strong>s, the water connections are typically part of a single spout assembly. Whereas, in a double-handle <strong>faucet</strong> you’ll need to attach separate hot and cold water supply lines. If you find the supply line connections challenging to understand, do contact a plumber for clarity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fit the <strong>faucet</strong> body with the attached gasket through the holes on the top side of the <strong>sink</strong>. It’s helpful to have an assistant do this while you remain below the <strong>sink</strong>. Once the <strong>faucet</strong> body is in place, the assistant will need to hold it upright until the new locknuts have been tightened (installing the new locknuts is again a significantly easier process with a basin wrench). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It may seem like swapping out that old <strong>faucet</strong> for a new one is an easy task. Sometimes it can be. Other times, not so much. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now you’re ready to install the new <strong>faucet</strong>. Most <strong>sink</strong>s today have three holes to accommodate the <strong>faucet</strong>. Measure the distance, center to center, of the outside holes of your <strong>sink</strong> to make sure the new <strong>faucet</strong> will fit. And always be sure to read the manufacturer’s instructions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The next step is installing the deck plate over the holes in the <strong>sink</strong>. This should be fairly easy for single-hole <strong>faucet</strong>s as you’ll need to align the deck plate with the center hole. Ensure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions so that the deck plate fully covers any extra hole in the <strong>sink</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Chrome is believed to be the most long-lasting finish, and you’ll usually see them in hotel kitchens where the <strong>faucet</strong>s tend to get used heavily. Nickel is the next best option, and it’s often categorized as brushed or satin due to its dull shine. Even though they are more prone to catching water spots and fingerprints, most of these <strong>faucet</strong>s are chip resistant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some <strong>faucet</strong>s can be used with either a three hole or a single hole kitchen <strong>sink</strong>. The included deckplate covers up the extra holes, which are typically used for separate hot and cold temperature knobs. If you have a single hole <strong>sink</strong>, you don&rsquo;t need this piece. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>From below, turn on the water supply controls. From above, turn the <strong>sink</strong> <strong>faucet</strong> on and wait about a minute for the <strong>faucet</strong> to adjust to the waterflow. Use the flashlight to observe below the <strong>sink</strong> cabinet for leaks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If the <strong>sink</strong> <strong>faucet</strong> kit has a detached spray hose, insert this from above through the hole to the side of the <strong>sink</strong> <strong>faucet</strong> body. Tighten from below with the lock nut. Attach the heavy counterweight to the hose at its lowest point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After the supply lines are disconnected, use a basin wrench to loosen the nuts that are holding the <strong>faucet</strong>. While you’re loosening the nuts, ask a second person to hold the <strong>faucet</strong> from above the <strong>sink</strong>. Once the nuts are loose, remove the <strong>faucet</strong> from the configuration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You’ll either have one, two, or three holes in your <strong>sink</strong>. And it will be center-set or widespread. Sometimes, in our excitement to pick out that new <strong>faucet</strong>, this gets overlooked and you end up taking another trip back to the store to get the right type. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Plus, installing a new <strong>faucet</strong> is an easy project for a beginning do-it-yourselfer. In this video, we’ll show you how to install a basic, pull-out <strong>faucet</strong> in your kitchen <strong>sink</strong>. But before we get started, here are a few things to keep in mind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Kitchen <strong>faucet</strong>s are often categorized based on their spout height and reach.

You should also choose a spout height and reach based on the size of frequently used utensils. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At Chicago Faucets, we know that installing a kitchen <strong>faucet</strong> can seem like a daunting chore.

Therefore, remove the aerator from the <strong>faucet</strong> before opening and turn on the water slowly. Let the water run aerator-free for some time and recheck for any leaks under the <strong>sink</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To take apart Moen, Delta, Kohler, American Standard, and Grohe kitchen <strong>faucet</strong> heads, you need to unthread the <strong>faucet</strong> heads from the pull-out hose by twisting out the connector counterclockwise.
