You should try to maintain an optimal 5.5 pH, along with proper fertilization and watering. You can test your soil’s acidity levels with a soil testing kit you can buy from a local hardware store. - Source: Internet If you do not want to install seed or sod, then you can install centipede grass plugs. Start off by tilling the area of the yard that you want to plant the grass plugs and add an extra layer of fertilizer. Remove any previous grass from the areas. Next, install the centipede grass plugs using a sod plug drill bit. Space the plugs about 1 foot apart from each point. - Source: Internet Keep your centipede grass sod thoroughly watered for the next 3-4 weeks until it has reached 2-3 inches tall. Then you can mow it for the first time. Remove the grass clippings from the first mow so the thatch layer does not get too thick. - Source: Internet Also, there is the machinery to think about. Growing and harvesting grass seed is expensive as it takes much special equipment and machinery, which come at a high cost. Also, grass seeds need to be coated before release, so they survive during the transportation (which adds to the shipping costs). - Source: Internet I hope this article coherently explained why centipede grass is expensive. Before purchasing this type of grass, be sure to buy it from reputable stores, so you are assured high-quality grass seed for a great looking turf in time. Good luck! - Source: Internet If you install centipede grass in your yard, do not be concerned if it does not immediately sprout and start to grow. Centipede grass grows slowly and can take anywhere between 2-4 weeks to germinate properly. During this time, you need to keep it adequately watered so it will grow well. - Source: Internet Centipede grass is popular because it needs relatively little maintenance and care compared to other types of grass. You do not need to regularly water centipede grass. Only water it when it shows signs of wilting and withering or during drought conditions. Too much water can drown centipede grass and prevent it from growing properly. - Source: Internet You can plant centipede grass from either traditional seed, sod, or plugs. The method that you should choose depends on how much you can afford and whether you have the time to seed a lawn by yourself. In each case, you can opt for professional installation. - Source: Internet Centipede grass is a costly investment but worth it, thanks to its low maintenance needs and the beautiful color it produces. When you are aware of its processes, it becomes clearer why people have to pay more for grass seed. Fortunately, there are ways to save up in the long run, such as purchasing grass seeds in bulk and opting to cut labor costs to maintain your lawn yourself. - Source: Internet Proper maintenance will help thicken your centipede grass, but there are some other ways to make sure your lawn looks great. One of the best ways to make your centipede grass thicker is to create walkways or stepping stones on your lawn to minimize damage from foot traffic. Centipede grass will also look thicker and healthier if you don’t have trees on your lawn as they will sap nutrients and water away from the grass. - Source: Internet Centipede grass should be kept at about 1-1.5 inches long with relatively infrequent mowing. Any longer and there is the risk that the thatch layer could get too thick. Keep your mower blades sharp, or else you run the risk of pulling the grass out of the ground. Also, you should minimize foot traffic on your centipede grass directly after seeding and mowing. - Source: Internet Centipede grass seed is relatively cheap overall, but it does take some work to plant and grow. Since centipede grass is a warm-season grass, you should plant the seed in the late spring, about 3-4 weeks before its growing season. Centipede grass does not grow incredibly fast, so if you are reseeding a lawn, you should try to remove altogether the grass that was there previously, or else it may overtake the centipede grass. - Source: Internet Centipede is known for its excellent heat tolerance making it one of the best grasses for the Southeast region. This extremely low maintenance grass is available as Gulf Kist seed, produced exclusively by Woerner Turf. Enhanced with Bio-Kote, Gulf Kist Centipede Seed is available raw and in bulk, and has a special coating that establishes a “microenvironment” for stimulating vigorous growth.
