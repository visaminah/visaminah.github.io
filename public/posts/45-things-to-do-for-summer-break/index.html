Sweet and thoughtful, your girls will love this perfect summer accessory! - Source: Internet Shannon Des Roches Rosa, mother to 10-year-old Leo and co-editor of The Thinking Person’s Guide to Autism, says that her son, who has autism, “is used to 1:1 supervision and engagement all day long, and I can’t possibly provide the kind of routine and stimulation he craves, no matter how many camps and grandparent visits his sisters get shuffled off to. I try to keep Leo occupied, and I have a lot of support, and having an iPad helps, but I still worry that—as has happened in summers past—it won’t be enough, and Leo’s behavior and abilities will keep disintegrating until school resumes at the end of August.” - Source: Internet Go hiking. Find a nearby stream and take a dip. The cool water will feel amazing in the summer sun. - Source: Internet This is another activity you can engage in. You can learn a new skill or get better at the one you’ve been learning before. There are different skills you can learn during the break. There’s writing, baking, product design, fashion design, and the likes. - Source: Internet Whether you have been wanting to start your own home bakery or settling up a side business of online financial consultation, do not procrastinate any longer. This summer holiday, make use of the time and set up your dream project. Give it a start and you will have a wonderful opportunity to take it forward. - Source: Internet Biking — what could be better than riding through the wind on a summer’s evening? While many of us learnt this in our formative years, not everyone did. E-bikes are incredibly easy and safe to ride, and summer offers the perfect weather to learn to ride. Simply download the Bolt app and try out our e-bikes! - Source: Internet Kids who thrive on predictability and are prone to panic over transitions—including those on the autism spectrum—benefit from posted schedules that outline what will happen throughout the day (i.e., 7am: Wake up, go to the bathroom, wash face…8am: breakfast…) Depending on your child’s developmental level, simple pictures can also help. - Source: Internet With natural attractions like Old Faithful Geyser, the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone River, Yellowstone Lake, Grand Prismatic Spring, and abundant wildlife viewing, Yellowstone National Park has been one of the top summer vacation spots in the U.S. for more than a century, and this year is no different. - Source: Internet Get involved in a local summer reading program, specifically at your local public library. Most public libraries have a summer reading program you can take advantage of. This is something you can get all of your kids involved with, or just go to the library and read to the little one(s) while the older ones participate. - Source: Internet Relaxation is a relative term. Many of us have children of our own, who are also on summer break, and that adds a level of responsibility to our day. But for the most part, we try to take advantage of the readily available opportunities to relax during the summer. - Source: Internet Even with the best-laid plans, you may see some regression and worsening behavior over vacation. Give yourself a break for not being able to magically avoid it. And be ready to hold your ground in as calm, firm, and consistent a manner as possible. Yelling or becoming physical only escalates things, while giving in teaches your child that if he screams loud enough, he’ll get what he wants. - Source: Internet You can’t visit the Waterpark Capital of the World and not stay at a water park resort. There’s really no wrong choice for family accommodations in Wisconsin Dells, but if you want to go all-in for your summer vacation, book your stay at the Wilderness Resort, one of the largest water park resorts in the country. In addition to its four indoor and outdoor water parks, you’ll enjoy a black light mini-golf course, zip lining, laser tag, and go-karts. - Source: Internet Summer vacation means the kids are out of school, the calendar is wide open for family fun, and the best summer vacation spots in the U.S. are welcoming kids and parents with open arms. For most families, that means summer vacation ideas are back on the radar after a year or two of COVID-conscious family road trips, backyard movie nights, and other staycation vacations. - Source: Internet Not that our students would understand that. To most of them, we teachers are mysterious beings with mysterious lives; what we do during our summer vacations is downright unfathomable. But for those glorious few months when we’re traveling with our families or taking a tennis lesson, we’re just like everyone else. - Source: Internet Sure, it’s not really part of the U.S., but the Bahamas is one of the most popular and convenient summer vacation ideas for families pining for a piece of paradise without the hassle that usually goes hand-in-hand with getting to the more far-flung Caribbean beaches (or flying with kids on flights that require multiple connections). - Source: Internet It’s true: Many teachers use their summer breaks to revamp curriculum, update classroom activities, or attend classes for their certification. Some even have summer jobs; online teaching, tutoring, and counseling are some of the best summer side hustles, The Balance Careers says. But the beautiful thing about working over the summer is that we do it on our own terms—sometimes even poolside. That’s at least sort of a vacation, right? - Source: Internet If you have some free time on your hands, why not explore your hobbies? Many a time you wish to pursue crafts or other activities but can’t do so due to a lack of time. Make use of your summer holiday and take up an activity. It can be something as simple as making a craft out of an old box or something as grand as painting your own home. Get a good property insurance plan beforehand to cover your house and then get going. - Source: Internet Ok, there we have it. I hope those give you some good ideas on how to spend your time this summer. I’ll still be living here in Taiwan this summer where it is Hot Hot HOT until the fall. Hope we make it. - Source: Internet Yet while she remains “scared of summer,” she also sees a lot of potential—especially for Leo, a self-taught swimmer who enjoys basking in the family pool. No backyard pool? You may find your child is just as happy playing in a sprinkler and earning music downloads for good behavior. And if you can maintain a sense of fun, there will be many moments of learning and development of the kind that can’t happen in a classroom. - Source: Internet From bucket-list family vacation ideas to epic family travel adventures the kids will never forget, here are the summer vacation spots in the U.S. that offer a little something for everyone in the family—and every budget, too. - Source: Internet If you can obtain the ability to fluently speak two languages, you’ll give yourself the ultimate career advantage. Forget about that fancy, expensive degree. If you can speak two languages, your ‘hireability factor’ will automatically soar. Learning a new language is not easy, though! It could take you years of hard work to obtain fluency. So start working at it this summer and give yourself a headstart. - Source: Internet As you can clearly see from the points mentioned above, there are many things you can do while staying put in your own city this summer vacation. Cover your house with a good property insurance plan and then enjoy the season with your near and dear ones. Give the above-mentioned ideas a try and spend your time in the best possible ways. - Source: Internet Take swimming lessons — an essential skill; this works both ways. You get to cool off during summer while learning how to swim. Plus, it’s one of the best ways to stay fit as it works your entire body, engaging muscles and building strength. - Source: Internet And last but not least put the gloom of the winter away and get outdoors. You can simply spend time at the pool, go golfing, enjoy picnics or spend long days at the beach nearest to your house. Go for long drives, take your kids to the park and make the most of the break you have. Winters restrict your movement, but summers make it possible to bask in the sunshine. Take full advantage of this and spend time with your loved ones while creating some priceless memories. - Source: Internet Run a mini marathon. Set a goal time and distance — but make it reasonable — and work toward it all summer. You’ll feel awesome as you see your time and endurance improve. - Source: Internet At Universal Orlando Resort, thrill seekers are raving about the parks’ newest coaster, the Jurassic World-themed VelociCoaster. For those extra-hot summer days, you can’t do better than a private cabana at Universal’s Volcano Bay, one of the most immersive water parks in Orlando. And the popularity of Universal’s Mardi Gras festival has led to a brand-new summer food offerings found throughout the Universal parks. - Source: Internet Many of us fit vacations with out-of-town friends and visits to relatives into our summer plans. But because we have a tough time taking off our teacher hats, our travels tend to be very organized—and we usually plan activities throughout the trip to engage and educate our families. We also make notes and take pictures of the things we see and experience so that we can share them with our students in the fall. Oh, and we text our colleagues the great ideas that our trips inspire, too. But yeah, we travel. - Source: Internet Come summertime, all bets are off. We get nuts at night and sleep until we can sleep no more in the morning! OK, fine—we stretch it to 11 p.m. and wake up at the same time out of habit. But at least there’s no alarm? - Source: Internet It might surprise some students to learn that their teachers look forward to summer breaks as much as—maybe even more than—they do. No longer are we subject to rigorously regimented days; we’re free to do things like use the bathroom whenever we need to and wear pants as little as we want. Summer breaks mean we don’t have to plan every minute of an eight-hour school day—and can day-drink if we want to. - Source: Internet It’s tough to slow down during school breaks after being immersed in the fast-paced environment of the med school semester. If you’re like second-year medical student Jannel Lawrence, you’re looking for ways to stay active during these breathers. In this article, Jannel discusses her six tips for keeping the momentum going during the summer. - Source: Internet During the summer break, schools often organize coaching lessons to prepare students for the next class. It’s a new class that you probably have little or no idea about. So, the classes are meant to give you a taste of what it’s about before you finally resume. - Source: Internet You can do a lot online these days. From watching your favourite movies to binge-watching some web series to playing games to attending a webinar to joining an activity class, you can spend the whole day in front of your TV, phone or laptop. If you plan to spend your summer holidays at home this time, explore the various online entertainment options and enjoy them from the comforts of your own home. - Source: Internet If a private beach and the lushly tropic atmosphere of a Polynesian paradise sound like your idea of a summer vacation dream come true, you have to stay at San Diego’s Catamaran Resort Hotel and Spa between Mission Beach and Pacific Beach. Restaurants and shops are walking distance away, and you can rent bikes (and beach essentials) from the hotel. Ocean views suites and private balconies round out the experience. - Source: Internet If you have been watching your kids play soccer while waiting to pick them up, it’s time for you to join the fun too! If you have a job, such as teaching, where you enjoy a summer break, make the most of it by enrolling in a sport. Depending on how fit you are, you can choose a sport. You can join cricket or soccer if you are very fit. Else, swimming, aerobics, badminton and Zumba are some of the other options that are both enjoyable and easy to do. Get together with your friends and family members and make a party out of it, while you work on your fitness too. - Source: Internet If Dollywood is the focal point of your summer vacation, you can’t beat Dollywood’s DreamMore Resort and Spa for family accommodations. But if you want to branch out, head to Pigeon Forge’s main drag, The Island (is a hub of dining, shopping, and entertainment) where you’ll find Margaritaville Island Hotel, which combines mountain latitude with island attitude (and a rooftop pool). Parents love the St. Somewhere Spa, while kids can’t get enough of the hotel’s resident parrot, Max, who’s known to sway in time with the lobby music. - Source: Internet My kids LOVE salsa and they also love zucchini bread. Making a salsa garden or growing zucchini is something that your kids might really enjoy doing. You don’t need much space to make a garden like this, but if you don’t have the yard space, you can try growing things in pots. This is a great summer-long activity to do and they’ll enjoy eating what they helped grow as well. - Source: Internet Some of us golf, play tennis, or swim; others garden, cook, or play in a band. Our summer breaks allow us to reconnect with our nonteaching passions, and that refuels us for the upcoming school year. Time spent out of the classroom is vital to success inside it; we need to fill our souls with whatever creative, physical, or spiritual endeavor inspires and motivates us. We are, after all, only human. - Source: Internet You need all the rest you can get because it’s been a long and probably, tiring ride. Rest is sometimes underrated because students believe that the body will adjust. You can plan your rest. Yes, that’s how intentional you can be about it during the summer break. - Source: Internet Choose your travel destination carefully. Give popular tourist destinations a break — overtourism harms the environment since it depletes the region’s natural resources. Instead, go for the lesser known locations and discover something new; - Source: Internet More than just the winter vacation destination made famous around the world by the 2002 Winter Olympics, Park City is one of the best summer vacation spots in the U.S. because of its family-friendly outdoor activities year-round. - Source: Internet If you’re a student, you long for summer vacation. School takes a lot out of you so it’s nice to have a few months to unwind. You get to catch up and focus on all of the things you don’t normally get to enjoy. But one of the biggest problems students face is staying productive during summer break. You spend 2-3 months having fun in the sun and when you return to class in early September, you end up feeling overwhelmed and stressed out. - Source: Internet As a second-year medical student, I often find it difficult to do anything besides study. During breaks from school, I try to engage myself in something that is both beneficial and enjoyable. The length of breaks during medical school vary in terms of the curriculum and also on the school’s location. Below are some of the ways that I have managed to stay productive during breaks from school. - Source: Internet But Steve found that camp can be great for Michael if it is more structured and geared toward his strengths and interests. Today, Michael is busy throughout the summer at a series of camps for typically developing kids that keep him engaged with things like Lego Robotics and skateboarding. While Michael usually does well, Steve makes sure to keep a line of communication open with camp personnel so that any potential problem involving his son can be “straightened out before he gets kicked out.” - Source: Internet For many people, the other name for vacation is enjoyment and relaxing, well in a way it is even true. whenever we get summer vacation, we make several plans and think of doing things that are adventurous and fun.

Give it a start and you will have a wonderful opportunity to take it forward. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Biking — what could be better than riding through the wind on a <strong>summer</strong>’s evening? While many of us learnt this in our formative years, not everyone did. E-bikes are incredibly easy and safe to ride, and <strong>summer</strong> offers the perfect weather to learn to ride. Simply download the Bolt app and try out our e-bikes! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Kids who thrive on predictability and are prone to panic over transitions—including those on the autism spectrum—benefit from posted schedules that outline what will happen throughout the day (i.e., 7am: Wake up, go to the bathroom, wash face…8am: <strong>break</strong>fast…) Depending on your child’s developmental level, simple pictures can also help. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With natural attractions like Old Faithful Geyser, the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone River, Yellowstone Lake, Grand Prismatic Spring, and abundant wildlife viewing, Yellowstone National Park has been one of the top <strong>summer</strong> vacation spots in the U.S. for more than a century, and this year is no different. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Get involved in a local <strong>summer</strong> reading program, specifically at your local public library. Most public libraries have a <strong>summer</strong> reading program you can take advantage of. This is something you can get all of your kids involved with, or just go to the library and read to the little one(s) while the older ones participate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Relaxation is a relative term. Many of us have children of our own, who are also on <strong>summer</strong> <strong>break</strong>, and that adds a level of responsibility to our day. But for the most part, we try to take advantage of the readily available opportunities to relax during the <strong>summer</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Even with the best-laid plans, you may see some regression and worsening behavior over vacation. Give yourself a <strong>break</strong> for not being able to magically avoid it. And be ready to hold your ground in as calm, firm, and consistent a manner as possible. Yelling or becoming physical only escalates things, while giving in teaches your child that if he screams loud enough, he’ll get what he wants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can’t visit the Waterpark Capital of the World and not stay at a water park resort. There’s really no wrong choice for family accommodations in Wisconsin Dells, but if you want to go all-in for your <strong>summer</strong> vacation, book your stay at the Wilderness Resort, one of the largest water park resorts in the country. In addition to its four indoor and outdoor water parks, you’ll enjoy a black light mini-golf course, zip lining, laser tag, and go-karts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Summer vacation means the kids are out of school, the calendar is wide open for family fun, and the best <strong>summer</strong> vacation spots in the U.S. are welcoming kids and parents with open arms. For most families, that means <strong>summer</strong> vacation ideas are back on the radar after a year or two of COVID-conscious family road trips, backyard movie nights, and other staycation vacations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Not that our students would understand that. To most of them, we teachers are mysterious beings with mysterious lives; what we do during our <strong>summer</strong> vacations is downright unfathomable. But for those glorious few months when we&rsquo;re traveling with our families or taking a tennis lesson, we&rsquo;re just like everyone else. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sure, it’s not really part of the U.S., but the Bahamas is one of the most popular and convenient <strong>summer</strong> vacation ideas for families pining for a piece of paradise without the hassle that usually goes hand-in-hand with getting to the more far-flung Caribbean beaches (or flying with kids on flights that require multiple connections). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It&rsquo;s true: Many teachers use their <strong>summer</strong> <strong>break</strong>s to revamp curriculum, update classroom activities, or attend classes for their certification. Some even have <strong>summer</strong> jobs; online teaching, tutoring, and counseling are some of the best <strong>summer</strong> side hustles, The Balance Careers says. But the beautiful thing about working over the <strong>summer</strong> is that we do it on our own terms—sometimes even poolside. That&rsquo;s at least sort of a vacation, right? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you have some free time on your hands, why not explore your hobbies? Many a time you wish to pursue crafts or other activities but can’t do so due to a lack of time. Make use of your <strong>summer</strong> holiday and take up an activity. It can be something as simple as making a craft out of an old box or something as grand as painting your own home. Get a good property insurance plan beforehand to cover your house and then get going. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ok, there we have it. I hope those give you some good ideas on how to spend your time this <strong>summer</strong>. I’ll still be living here in Taiwan this <strong>summer</strong> where it is Hot Hot HOT until the fall. Hope we make it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yet while she remains “scared of <strong>summer</strong>,” she also sees a lot of potential—especially for Leo, a self-taught swimmer who enjoys basking in the family pool. No backyard pool? You may find your child is just as happy playing in a sprinkler and earning music downloads for good behavior. And if you can maintain a sense of fun, there will be many moments of learning and development of the kind that can’t happen in a classroom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>From bucket-list family vacation ideas to epic family travel adventures the kids will never forget, here are the <strong>summer</strong> vacation spots in the U.S. that offer a little something for everyone in the family—and every budget, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you can obtain the ability to fluently speak two languages, you’ll give yourself the ultimate career advantage. Forget about that fancy, expensive degree. If you can speak two languages, your ‘hireability factor’ will automatically soar. Learning a new language is not easy, though! It could take you years of hard work to obtain fluency. So start working at it this <strong>summer</strong> and give yourself a headstart. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As you can clearly see from the points mentioned above, there are many things you can do while staying put in your own city this <strong>summer</strong> vacation. Cover your house with a good property insurance plan and then enjoy the season with your near and dear ones. Give the above-mentioned ideas a try and spend your time in the best possible ways. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Take swimming lessons — an essential skill; this works both ways. You get to cool off during <strong>summer</strong> while learning how to swim. Plus, it’s one of the best ways to stay fit as it works your entire body, engaging muscles and building strength. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>And last but not least put the gloom of the winter away and get outdoors. You can simply spend time at the pool, go golfing, enjoy picnics or spend long days at the beach nearest to your house. Go for long drives, take your kids to the park and make the most of the <strong>break</strong> you have. Winters restrict your movement, but <strong>summer</strong>s make it possible to bask in the sunshine. Take full advantage of this and spend time with your loved ones while creating some priceless memories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=20><li>Run a mini marathon. Set a goal time and distance — but make it reasonable — and work toward it all <strong>summer</strong>. You’ll feel awesome as you see your time and endurance improve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>At Universal Orlando Resort, thrill seekers are raving about the parks’ newest coaster, the Jurassic World-themed VelociCoaster. For those extra-hot <strong>summer</strong> days, you can’t do better than a private cabana at Universal’s Volcano Bay, one of the most immersive water parks in Orlando. And the popularity of Universal’s Mardi Gras festival has led to a brand-new <strong>summer</strong> food offerings found throughout the Universal parks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Many of us fit vacations with out-of-town friends and visits to relatives into our <strong>summer</strong> plans. But because we have a tough time taking off our teacher hats, our travels tend to be very organized—and we usually plan activities throughout the trip to engage and educate our families. We also make notes and take pictures of the things we see and experience so that we can share them with our students in the fall. Oh, and we text our colleagues the great ideas that our trips inspire, too. But yeah, we travel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Come <strong>summer</strong>time, all bets are off. We get nuts at night and sleep until we can sleep no more in the morning! OK, fine—we stretch it to 11 p.m. and wake up at the same time out of habit. But at least there&rsquo;s no alarm? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It might surprise some students to learn that their teachers look forward to <strong>summer</strong> <strong>break</strong>s as much as—maybe even more than—they do. No longer are we subject to rigorously regimented days; we&rsquo;re free to do things like use the bathroom whenever we need to and wear pants as little as we want. Summer <strong>break</strong>s mean we don&rsquo;t have to plan every minute of an eight-hour school day—and can day-drink if we want to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s tough to slow down during school <strong>break</strong>s after being immersed in the fast-paced environment of the med school semester. If you’re like second-year medical student Jannel Lawrence, you’re looking for ways to stay active during these breathers. In this article, Jannel discusses her six tips for keeping the momentum going during the <strong>summer</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>During the <strong>summer</strong> <strong>break</strong>, schools often organize coaching lessons to prepare students for the next class. It’s a new class that you probably have little or no idea about. So, the classes are meant to give you a taste of what it’s about before you finally resume. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can do a lot online these days. From watching your favourite movies to binge-watching some web series to playing games to attending a webinar to joining an activity class, you can spend the whole day in front of your TV, phone or laptop. If you plan to spend your <strong>summer</strong> holidays at home this time, explore the various online entertainment options and enjoy them from the comforts of your own home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If a private beach and the lushly tropic atmosphere of a Polynesian paradise sound like your idea of a <strong>summer</strong> vacation dream come true, you have to stay at San Diego’s Catamaran Resort Hotel and Spa between Mission Beach and Pacific Beach. Restaurants and shops are walking distance away, and you can rent bikes (and beach essentials) from the hotel. Ocean views suites and private balconies round out the experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you have been watching your kids play soccer while waiting to pick them up, it’s time for you to join the fun too! If you have a job, such as teaching, where you enjoy a <strong>summer</strong> <strong>break</strong>, make the most of it by enrolling in a sport. Depending on how fit you are, you can choose a sport. You can join cricket or soccer if you are very fit. Else, swimming, aerobics, badminton and Zumba are some of the other options that are both enjoyable and easy to do. Get together with your friends and family members and make a party out of it, while you work on your fitness too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If Dollywood is the focal point of your <strong>summer</strong> vacation, you can’t beat Dollywood’s DreamMore Resort and Spa for family accommodations. But if you want to branch out, head to Pigeon Forge’s main drag, The Island (is a hub of dining, shopping, and entertainment) where you’ll find Margaritaville Island Hotel, which combines mountain latitude with island attitude (and a rooftop pool). Parents love the St. Somewhere Spa, while kids can’t get enough of the hotel’s resident parrot, Max, who’s known to sway in time with the lobby music. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>My kids LOVE salsa and they also love zucchini bread. Making a salsa garden or growing zucchini is something that your kids might really enjoy doing. You don’t need much space to make a garden like this, but if you don’t have the yard space, you can try growing things in pots. This is a great <strong>summer</strong>-long activity to do and they’ll enjoy eating what they helped grow as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some of us golf, play tennis, or swim; others garden, cook, or play in a band. Our <strong>summer</strong> <strong>break</strong>s allow us to reconnect with our nonteaching passions, and that refuels us for the upcoming school year. Time spent out of the classroom is vital to success inside it; we need to fill our souls with whatever creative, physical, or spiritual endeavor inspires and motivates us. We are, after all, only human. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You need all the rest you can get because it’s been a long and probably, tiring ride. Rest is sometimes underrated because students believe that the body will adjust. You can plan your rest. Yes, that’s how intentional you can be about it during the <strong>summer</strong> <strong>break</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Choose your travel destination carefully. Give popular tourist destinations a <strong>break</strong> — overtourism harms the environment since it depletes the region’s natural resources. Instead, go for the lesser known locations and discover something new; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>More than just the winter vacation destination made famous around the world by the 2002 Winter Olympics, Park City is one of the best <strong>summer</strong> vacation spots in the U.S. because of its family-friendly outdoor activities year-round. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re a student, you long for <strong>summer</strong> vacation. School takes a lot out of you so it’s nice to have a few months to unwind. You get to catch up and focus on all of the things you don’t normally get to enjoy. But one of the biggest problems students face is staying productive during <strong>summer</strong> <strong>break</strong>. You spend 2-3 months having fun in the sun and when you return to class in early September, you end up feeling overwhelmed and stressed out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As a second-year medical student, I often find it difficult to do anything besides study. During <strong>break</strong>s from school, I try to engage myself in something that is both beneficial and enjoyable. The length of <strong>break</strong>s during medical school vary in terms of the curriculum and also on the school’s location. Below are some of the ways that I have managed to stay productive during <strong>break</strong>s from school. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But Steve found that camp can be great for Michael if it is more structured and geared toward his strengths and interests. Today, Michael is busy throughout the <strong>summer</strong> at a series of camps for typically developing kids that keep him engaged with things like Lego Robotics and skateboarding. While Michael usually does well, Steve makes sure to keep a line of communication open with camp personnel so that any potential problem involving his son can be “straightened out before he gets kicked out.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For many people, the other name for vacation is enjoyment and relaxing, well in a way it is even true. whenever we get <strong>summer</strong> vacation, we make several plans and think of doing things that are adventurous and fun. The excitement that we have at that time cannot be described in words. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As a secondary school student, the <strong>summer</strong> <strong>break</strong> comes after a long session of having to deal with school work, including examinations.
