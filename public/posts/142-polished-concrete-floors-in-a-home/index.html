It could be perceived as somehow similar to sanding wood. - Source: Internet Architects have a complicated relationship with concrete when it comes to sustainable living. Cement is a huge producer of CO2 emissions, however, it’s only a component of concrete, and when used thoughtfully, its durable, long-lasting nature means that it can be a worthy trade-off in the long run compared to alternatives. Plus, designers often use concrete flooring as a way to contribute to a home’s heating mix, reducing its energy requirements. - Source: Internet However, if you need to pour new concrete flooring, then you need to prepare to pay approximately an overall of $80 per square metre for both the new concrete and the finishing.

Regular grey concrete looks quite nice with just a light grind and either a polish or a coating. This finish is the most economical as the hard work of heavy grinding is kept to a minimum. If you have opted for a coloured or decorative concrete mix then you are like to want a full or heavy grind to expose all the colour and rock that you paid for. - Source: Internet The standard grey concrete flooring may not be the right fit for your space, no matter how polished it is. In such cases, you can always dye or stain concrete to blend it with the color palette and design of the room.

And you can use a concrete for flooring in just about any room in the house, assuming the sub-floor is properly prepared and designed to take the weight. The variation of colours and textures make it suitable style-wise any home, even period conversions. - Source: Internet Here is another example of polished concrete flooring but with a fairly obvious artistic difference. The beauty of concrete flooring is that it is highly adaptable, as seen by this river pattern infused within the design.

This design is also a different colour to the typical concrete floor, opting for a polished sand colour, giving the hallway some much needed character. - Source: Internet Concrete floors are very low-maintenance when it comes to cleaning: sweep away any mess then use a recommended cleaner and you’re done. Most concrete floors only need mopping with a damp cloth, but some can also be steam-cleaned.

It becomes even more complicated if you’re doing the job on or above the ground level of your home, which can often involve installing new concrete. - Source: Internet Aesthetically, concrete surfaces suit modern and industrial homes. A high gloss look isn’t right for classic vintage home styles. A polished concrete floor would be awkward in a Colonial-style dwelling, but suitable for a modern house. - Source: Internet There are many finishes, polishes, seals and coatings that can be applied to a concrete floor to achieve a specific finish. The more specialised your choice, the higher the cost. The broad quote given by most concrete flooring companies is upwards of £100 per square metre, with the average cost being £130 per square metre. - Source: Internet In this space, for example, a polished concrete floor meets an exterior brick tile, which extends into the home from the outdoor patio. ‘The living spaces are designed to be an extension of the garden,’ explains Paul Porjazoski of BENT Architecture (opens in new tab), ‘and transitioning materials such as brick paving from outside to inside reinforces this connection.’ The concrete floor extends through the rest of the living spaces in this single-story home. - Source: Internet Concrete floors can appear monolithic - seamless interventions into a space that unites a floorplan with a common flooring. However, it doesn’t have to be that way. It’s possible to combine floor types to zone a room in different ways, or to add interesting design details. - Source: Internet When looking for the answer to whether polished concrete is more affordable or tiles, it really depends on the type of flooring you have at the moment. If you already have concrete flooring installed, then you will have to pay only for the polishing, which will cost you approximately $50 per square metre. Tiles prices alone, on the other hand, can range from $35 to $50 per square meter, as natural stone tiles can go over $100. Having the tiles installed will be a separate charge. - Source: Internet Some homeowners opt for the added durability of epoxy sealing instead of polishing, but you cannot do both. Sealing a concrete floor in a large, open space usually costs from $0.85 to $1.60 per square foot. Sealing a smaller space with tight corners is more difficult and thus costs more, sometimes up to $10 per square foot. - Source: Internet The polished concrete flooring option is popular mainly because of its durability. This makes it ideal for high-traffic areas such as kitchens and hallways, as well as offices and shops. It is also suitable both for indoor and outdoor areas. - Source: Internet The cost of polished concrete floors is offset by virtually no maintenance costs. Timber floors, for example, have a relatively high maintenance cost and are not nearly as durable.

Polished concrete is a hypoallergenic flooring system, meaning that many elements of hay fever, asthma and respiratory conditions won’t be trapped in your floor. Surfaces like carpet, will potentially entrap dust, bacteria and other allergens. Whereas the smooth and solid surface of polished concrete reduces this risk significantly as there are no groves or gaps to trap these elements. - Source: Internet The salts then form a chemical reaction with the calcium hydroxide within the cement, which transforms the colour of the concrete and gives you a smart, artistic stain.

Still, some can be more suitable for certain areas and properties in general than others. - Source: Internet Polished concrete flooring is relatively easy to maintain.

Depending on your polished concrete floor finish, you may have additional maintenance requirements. - Source: Internet That concrete flooring feels cold underfoot is often reported as its major drawback, and it is true that concrete does not retain heat, so when your house starts getting cold in winter, the floor will too. However, concrete feels no colder underfoot than ceramic or stone, so it’s more about where you choose to lay it. Radiant heat cables can be installed under concrete flooring to help retain more heat, and it’s also compatible with underfloor heating, if you prefer warm floors. - Source: Internet Concrete flooring today is far more versatile and stylish than it was 20 years ago.

To overcome this, you can embed radiant heating cables in <strong>concrete</strong> <strong>floors</strong> to reduce heat loss. Best of all, you’ll usually pay lower utility costs than with a forced-air system, because <strong>concrete</strong> floor radiant heating consumes less energy to achieve the same level of comfort. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Unlike many other flooring options, polished <strong>concrete</strong> <strong>floors</strong> are great alternative for asthma and allergy problems.

Depending on your polished <strong>concrete</strong> floor finish, you may have additional maintenance requirements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>That <strong>concrete</strong> flooring feels cold underfoot is often reported as its major drawback, and it is true that <strong>concrete</strong> does not retain heat, so when your house starts getting cold in winter, the floor will too. However, <strong>concrete</strong> feels no colder underfoot than ceramic or stone, so it&rsquo;s more about where you choose to lay it.

If the answer is yes, then the cost of steel trowelling your <strong>concrete</strong> will most likely be lower than that of acquiring floorboards and having them installed by an expert. The approximate price range of wooden floorboards is from $30 to $120 per square metre, as the quality of the wood and whether you are opting for solid hardwood or engineered timber can significantly change the price.
