For example, a <strong>black</strong> turtleneck over beige linen pants will look just as great as a <strong>black</strong> T-shirt paired with maroon denim. But avoid wearing your <strong>black</strong> tops with flamboyantly-colored bottoms like green or pink if you don’t plan on wearing a jacket! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple is a great color for dark skin because it’s one of the best <strong>colors</strong> for dark skin.
