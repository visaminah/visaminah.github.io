Built with heaviness in mind with a wide U-shaped flute, a roughing gouge is a great tool for tapering wood, creating cylinders and smooth planing wood. Beginner woodturners typically do well with a roughing gouge sized between 7/8 and 1 inch, especially when dealing with medium to large pieces of wood. - Source: Internet After you create basic shapes with the spindle roughing gouge, a spindle gouge helps you add fashionable detailing to your piece. Spindle gouges have a shallow flute design that woodturners can manipulate to craft beads, coves and other fine details in their work.
