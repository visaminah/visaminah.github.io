In three-season climates, you can trust that your <strong>wood</strong> <strong>siding</strong> is holding in the warm air during winter and keeping cool air from escaping in the summer. This lowers your monthly energy expenses to heat and cool your home and keeps your HVAC and plumbing systems running smoothly all year long.

It’s also a fantastic option for <strong>wood</strong> lapping projects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Board and Batten Vinyl Siding or Vertical <strong>siding</strong>, runs up and down the house, vertically. It usually consists of wide boards with a smaller board or &lsquo;batten&rsquo; used to seal the crack where the two wide boards meet. This makes it very weather tight and helps keep the harsh winter winds out. It has been used for hundreds of years and is still extremely popular. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wood <strong>siding</strong> is definitely one of the more attractive options, and if you can keep up with the high expense, it’s worth it to keep it up in older homes that already have this option built into the <strong>siding</strong>. With a stained option especially, a <strong>wood</strong> <strong>siding</strong> can offer a classic, rustic look to a home. However, we don’t necessarily recommend it for those building a home or looking to replace existing <strong>siding</strong>, as there can be some issues with <strong>wood</strong>s <strong>siding</strong> not present in the other options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Exposure to moisture and insects are a huge risk for your <strong>wood</strong> materials.

It is critical to properly treat your <strong>wood</strong> before installation and maintain the recommended maintenance schedule to lessen your risk of damage to your <strong>siding</strong>. Choose reputable products and high-quality protection to prevent failure of your <strong>siding</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some varieties of pine fir can be challenging to work with. Adding exterior <strong>wood</strong> cladding on houses often requires long pieces of <strong>wood</strong>. Pine fir comes in different lengths, but a vast majority are too short to cover most walls with a single plank adequately. Since it is a soft<strong>wood</strong>, it is also not very resistant to the elements. This means that it has to be well-sealed and maintained to keep out moisture and prevent decay. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Charred <strong>wood</strong> (Shou Sugi Ban), also known as burnt <strong>wood</strong>, is one of the most highly sought-after <strong>wood</strong> <strong>siding</strong> types available. The charring process entails applying an open flame to a <strong>wood</strong> plank to create a slight char along the board’s surface without weakening it. This char weatherproofs the plank and keeps insects away, which is an essential feature for new and old homes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Installation of natural <strong>wood</strong> requires a flat surface and a moisture barrier. Contractors usually start with ply<strong>wood</strong> to cover the house frame, then secure the moisture barrier atop the board for protection before attaching the exterior planks. The boards may be attached with construction adhesive or screws and nails, depending on the project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With worldwide shipping and custom <strong>wood</strong> charring services, they’re an excellent option for anyone looking to upgrade their home.

It not only serves as the first defense against rain, wind, and ice, but also transforms your house from a bare skeleton into a completed home that complements your style. In other words, <strong>siding</strong> brings your home to life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fiber cement <strong>siding</strong> is prized for its exceptional durability and longevity. For example, fiber cement is highly resistant to warping, insect infestation, and even fire. It can also be made to resemble the look of natural <strong>wood</strong> without any of the downsides. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The number one enemy of <strong>wood</strong> <strong>siding</strong> are, of course, termites. If left untreated, your <strong>wood</strong> <strong>siding</strong> could be eaten up by insects in a matter of days. Choosing an insect-resistant <strong>wood</strong> is a great place to start your defensive strategy, but make sure to consult your contractor for more information on <strong>wood</strong> maintenance and treatment schedules to ensure that your home is protected against any local critters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Red<strong>wood</strong> resists shrinking and holds up to all elements with minimal warping or cupping, making it a fantastic choice for any climate. It also has little pitch or resin, which means that stains and finishes require less maintenance and maintain their color longer. Although charred <strong>wood</strong> is known to keep insects at bay, red<strong>wood</strong> is naturally insect-repellant, especially useful in <strong>wood</strong>ed areas.

Vinyl <strong>siding</strong> is cost effective yet highly durable and low maintenance. Plus, some models are exceptionally energy efficient. However, it is still important to be careful when choosing vinyl <strong>siding</strong> for your home.

If you live in a region that experiences heavy rains, but also high heat, be warned that a thin vinyl could end up becoming damaged and disfigured. Once the house <strong>siding</strong> is damaged, water can easily enter and become trapped. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The aesthetic of a Douglas fir <strong>wood</strong> is hard to beat.

Douglas fir <strong>wood</strong> has been a popular staple in century-old homes that are still standing today. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you live in a particularly sunny and hot climate, remember that <strong>wood</strong> is a natural insulator. Light-colored or painted <strong>wood</strong>s may be beneficial in direct sunlight to reflect the damaging rays and maintain cooler air inside the house. Darker colors and deep-toned <strong>wood</strong> <strong>siding</strong> will pull in more heat and have the reverse effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Engineered <strong>wood</strong>, simply put, is manmade lumber. This kind of <strong>wood</strong> is designed to have the highest durability and strength while still looking like natural <strong>wood</strong>. Engineered <strong>wood</strong> can be a composite of different materials, depending on the brand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to <strong>wood</strong> <strong>siding</strong> for houses, there are many different varieties available.

Here is some useful information on cleaning most any type of vinyl <strong>siding</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are many reasons to choose Hardie® fiber cement <strong>siding</strong> over vinyl , the first of which is appearance. James Hardie <strong>siding</strong> is over five times thicker than vinyl, allowing for deeper grooves and a more authentic <strong>wood</strong>-grain effect. The result is more elegant than vinyl (which is plastic), particularly on a historic home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Risinger notes that fiber cement is a durable material made from Portland cement, sand, cellulose, and water. “There’s really nothing in here that I’m worried about termites eating.” When it comes to fire, he points to the fact that fiber cement <strong>siding</strong> is non-combustible and may help a home better withstand fire damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cedar is an extremely stable <strong>wood</strong> that holds up well against the elements.

It is also widely loved for its durability and can last for over 50 years! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Later in the video, Risinger notes that <strong>wood</strong>-based products such as engineered <strong>wood</strong> <strong>siding</strong> are combustible in wildfires, as well as in common scenarios like grill fires. “It’s not going to fare well,” he says. Risinger also points out that some pests can be an issue for engineered <strong>wood</strong> <strong>siding</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Western Red Cedar <strong>siding</strong>, particularly cedar shake, is the common choice for houses in damp climates.

It has long been a prized home <strong>siding</strong> material. Vinyl cedar shake looks like real <strong>wood</strong> without the high cost and high maintenance associated with real <strong>wood</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The single most destructive element that causes <strong>siding</strong> to fail is moisture.

Homes in wet or very humid climates are at greater risk of these issues, particularly during heavy rain seasons with very little sun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fir is another soft<strong>wood</strong> variety. It is comparable to both pine and spruce and is commonly used in residential projects.

The right <strong>siding</strong> should be the first line of defense against the New Orleans humidity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are two huge advantages of modified <strong>wood</strong>: it’s exceptionally water-resistant and it requires very little maintenance. The density of these boards makes them almost waterproof in design and perform very well in wet climates. Better yet, modified <strong>wood</strong> requires no surface treatments and only occasional cleaning when it gets dirty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cypress is ideal for <strong>wood</strong> cladding projects due to its reliability and low maintenance costs. It can stand up to most elements. Rumor even has it that the legendary Noah’s Ark was made of cypress <strong>wood</strong>! Cypress <strong>wood</strong> is so durable that it’s been known to last for generations, making it one of the most cost-effective and ideal old <strong>wood</strong> cladding styles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The cons of brick include the cost (it can be up to 7% more costly than vinyl <strong>siding</strong>) and the color limitations. Though bricks themselves come in a couple of color options based on the composition and temperature that they were made at, the choices are few compared to other <strong>siding</strong>s. While brick can be painted, it’s a long and laborious process as each individual groove and side of the brick must be covered. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As you can see there are many different vinyl <strong>siding</strong> styles to choose from.

Accoya <strong>wood</strong> coatings also last longer than other <strong>wood</strong> types and require less maintenance, making it a fantastic hassle-free and cost-effective option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fiber cement has a lot of advantages. It’s one of the toughest materials you can clad your home in and is highly recommended by architects for homes in hurricane or storm zones. In terms of weather, fiber cement can really handle whatever Mother Nature throws its way. This material also comes in a wide range of colors and textures, including faux <strong>wood</strong> grain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Brick homes were the standard of quality in the industry for many years, and while there has been a shift over time, brick remains popular for new construction. A study done by the National Association of Home Builders showed that 34% of people ranked brick as their top choice for home exteriors, closely followed by vinyl <strong>siding</strong> at 21%. Brick is great because it is generally low-maintenance, easily repurposed, and weather-resistant (which can mean lower homeowner insurance rates.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ash<strong>wood</strong>’s open pores make it an excellent choice for applying a smooth finish since it doesn’t blotch when stained. It’s incredibly dense and stable, and an excellent choice for a sturdy exterior. It comes in several different colors, such as yellow, red, and brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The material also maintains its dimensional stability when Risinger performs the water submersion test.

However, your climate should be a factor in deciding which type of <strong>wood</strong> you purchase. Cedar has a naturally water-resistant temperament, making it an ideal choice for rainy or tropical climates.

If you live in a particularly wet climate, keep in mind that your <strong>siding</strong> may require being sealed more frequently to stay protected from water damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, <strong>wood</strong> <strong>siding</strong> doesn’t come without its challenges. Aspiring homeowners should do their research before beginning construction to ensure adequate planning for their home’s needs. Here are a brief list of pros and cons homeowners need to know about <strong>wood</strong> <strong>siding</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Oak<strong>wood</strong> cladding for houses tends to add a lot of weight to a structure, which is not always beneficial to DIY projects.

Red oak is very porous and should be limited to indoor applications.
