To find that out, we tapped celebrity stylist Britt Theodora for her expert know-how, asking her to pick the five <strong>colors</strong> she thinks pair best with the <strong>gold</strong> metallic. And to say she picked some truly incredible hues would be an understatement. From the most unexpected pairing (<strong>gold</strong> with emerald) to slightly easier ones (black with <strong>gold</strong>), Theodora&rsquo;s covered it all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pale <strong>gold</strong> is a soft, light, luminous shade that is often used in textiles. Due to its moderate catchiness, it can be used in everyday wardrobe and this makes this shade versatile. You can sit a day in the office without unnecessary sidelong glances, and then go to evening events without changing clothes. Evening black will always transform pale <strong>gold</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The combination of blue and <strong>gold</strong> is discreet. This is probably the only tone that is trying to convey <strong>gold</strong> – modesty. As a highly spiritual shade, it smoothes the all-consuming sparkle of attention but does not pull the “blanket” in its direction. Both humble and not humble: blue and <strong>gold</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Old <strong>gold</strong> (hex code: #cfb53b, RGB (207,181,59)) is a shade that’s very close to the color of olives. Coined back in the 19th century, it is now closely associated with American football and college university programs. Try creating an earthy analogous combination with Beaver (#9fcf3b) and Sky Magenta (#cf6b3b). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Depending on the accents you choose, mixing reds with <strong>gold</strong> can fit a number of style categories from vintage to modern. This kitchen is done nicely in turquoise with accents of both red and <strong>gold</strong>. It’s hints at worldly design. And while this backdrop of turquoise suits the space, it could have been done in a variety of <strong>colors</strong>–white, black, brown–and the reds and <strong>gold</strong>s would still coordinate nicely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Old <strong>gold</strong> is when yellow has more blue light add-ons than yellow or bright <strong>gold</strong>. This <strong>gold</strong> gives a retro feel. Against the background of “dimmed <strong>gold</strong>”, its brilliance seems less intense. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Royalty has been playing up the elegance of purple and <strong>gold</strong> forever. It’s quite an exquisite combination, whether you enjoy just a whisper of purple, like these walls, or the darker mysterious look of bold purple. Mixing finishes of metallics is popular, so choose the pieces you love, and the look of your room will have your personal touch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gold is good for a mature woman. If a lady is aged, then in combination with <strong>gold</strong>, every wrinkle on her face will look noble. If a woman is young, then she will need a good figure for the <strong>gold</strong>en color (since he is fat), but if there is one, the <strong>gold</strong>en color will make her a goddess worthy of worship. For little girls, light tones of <strong>gold</strong> are suitable: yellow, pale, pink, but you should not overdo it with them: the moderate use of <strong>gold</strong> tones will make an angel out of a girl, but too much will look vulgar. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Warm green is combined with <strong>gold</strong> to create a very attractive pair. Of course, to achieve harmony, the shades of greenery should be muted, so that the opportunity to fully shine with <strong>gold</strong>. Consider a combination with pistachio, avocado, olive, marsh green, brownish-green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You must have spotted this combination in government offices or hotel rooms. Well, there is a reason it is used so widely like this - because it works! We recommended cherry red or maroon red with <strong>gold</strong> but you can pick any shade of red as per your taste. This combination can be used in Commercial, Office spaces, Shops etc. too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Golden yellow and white together are also an excellent combination. As mentioned above, <strong>gold</strong>en yellows are usually associated with things like luxury and wealth. At the same time, white is a shade connected to creativity, peacefulness, and purity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Simple. Stunning. You wouldn’t think that gray would mix well with <strong>gold</strong>, but on the contrary, gray provides a soft backdrop for <strong>gold</strong> accents. Gold hardware is a great way to instill classic style to the contemporary finishes of a space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most <strong>colors</strong> will go well with yellow when the right tones are chosen. However, certain <strong>colors</strong> may look too aggressive when used in large quantities. For instance, black and yellow is often associated with caution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Add text in <strong>gold</strong>. This works especially well if you’re designing flyers and invitations to festive events. In Picsart, try the fonts Good Vibes or Dancing Script, they look magnificent in the color <strong>gold</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The combination of gray and <strong>gold</strong> is soft, sophisticated. There is practically no light contrast in it, but there is a slight one in warmth and color saturation. Such a pair is good for the “summer” color type; in other cases, you can choose a more advantageous combination. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bright <strong>gold</strong> – artificial color: rich, amazing, evocative glows like the <strong>gold</strong> of the Incas: rich, juiciness. Of course, it is fun to stay the color within the clubs, parties, and banquets. Evening light for bright <strong>gold</strong> is the best companion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although they&rsquo;re not decor-related photos, I can&rsquo;t help but notice how elegant this colour combination would be for home interiors. The black and white combination is as classic as can be, and <strong>gold</strong> adds an elegant vibe that warms up the formality. Adding greeneries to a black, white and <strong>gold</strong> decor provides a color contrast that allows the eyes a place to rest between the two color extremes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to build on the natural warmth within the color yellow, the best option is to stick with <strong>colors</strong> close to this shade on the color wheel. Reds and oranges are perfect for highlighting the warmth in yellow. Browns can be extremely effective too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Neutral <strong>colors</strong> include white, beige, gray, and black. Of course, they are the most frequent companions of <strong>gold</strong> (with the exception of beige, it is rarely paired, since it merges with <strong>gold</strong>). We will present these combinations more broadly below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the options for this combination is the addition of white to the range. White brings a rejuvenating character to the black <strong>gold</strong> couple as well as contrast. Of course, white, as an airy color, looks better at the top (in a blouse, sweater, scarf) than at the bottom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yellow and <strong>gold</strong> in combination, like the previous version, is rare, however, as a deepening of the main shade, you can use the complex tones of the first. More saturated or paler <strong>colors</strong> from the main one will add juiciness, tenderness to <strong>gold</strong>, leaving it in the foreground. Try a combination with champagne, apricot, sunny yellow, corn, amber. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Soft shades of yellow and pink together have a wonderfully romantic vibe to them. We often associate pink with romance and affection, while yellow is a color typically associated with joy. Together, the <strong>colors</strong> can create an aesthetic perfect for conveying friendship and caring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gold-toned walls produce a different effect &ndash; whether pale or deep, the room has a glow similar to sunlight. Gold is always a warm hue, ranging from subdued tan to vibrant <strong>gold</strong>enrod. The warmth of a <strong>gold</strong>en color gently balances the coolness of gray, and the energy of <strong>gold</strong> balances the peacefulness of gray, making them ideal companion <strong>colors</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As already mentioned, <strong>gold</strong> is one of the most attractive <strong>colors</strong>. In combination, it subjugates other shades to itself, and in order to achieve harmony, that is, to enclose the main color in a suitable frame, muted tones are selected (they can be saturated, but their nature must be complex). The exception to this rule would be red, which can come to the fore when combined with <strong>gold</strong> and is classically exciting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In a combination of this tone, choose complex, muted, but saturated shades, preferably darker than light. All <strong>colors</strong> should have an admixture of blue. Consider this option with amaranota, dark pink, wine, sienna, dark orange, honey, <strong>gold</strong>en oak, protective, brown-green, sea black, blueberry, charoite, plum, dark brown, marengo, dark black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pink with <strong>gold</strong> is combined, forming a light, delicate, airy flavor. The sheen of the gilded fabric also spreads over the pink surfaces and is perceived in a more glamorous way than they really are. However, it is worth noting that the main tone and pink are practically the same lightness, and at the same time the tone difference does not look grandiose, therefore other shades are used in such a combination: white, black, several shades of pink, gray, beige, burgundy. In most cases, the range is pastel, but not boring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There is a reason why this is our top pick! This combination with Gold can never go wrong. Gold is a metallic color that really gets subdued with black and at the same time pops out in the presence of white. Though all these <strong>colors</strong> are great to create a bold style, hence you must be very smart while playing with these combinations. We suggest design & decor professionals for the final look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Psychedelic Purple (#d700ff) and Bright Turquoise (#00ffd6), together with <strong>gold</strong>, create a bold and vibrant triadic color scheme. As it often is the case with triadic schemes, you’re better off using two of the <strong>colors</strong> as mere accents. If you want to keep it festive but don’t wanna go all out, try muting the <strong>colors</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If <strong>gold</strong> and pink make you think of a nursery, you’d be right on–today’s new parents are answering the question of what goes with <strong>gold</strong> as they prepare for baby’s arrival. It’s beyond beautiful! But, pinks are gorgeous with <strong>gold</strong> for grownups as well. I think this dining room achieves an exquisite design! The blush pink chairs are ideal for a subtle look without choosing neutrals. But, the chandelier certainly steals the show. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another neutral shade that works great with a <strong>gold</strong>en wall is beige. Anything <strong>gold</strong> introduces luxury, shine, and drama to any setup. When combined with <strong>gold</strong>en hues, it works like magic. When paired with a neutral color like beige it beautifies the <strong>gold</strong> in a big picture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This shade has a hex code #FFDF00 and an RGB decimal (255, 223, 0). In the CMYK system, it is made up of 0% cyan, 12.5% magenta, 100% yellow, and 0% black. One of the official <strong>colors</strong> of the US Air Force, <strong>gold</strong>en yellow is a fifty-fifty mix of amber and yellow. The difference between <strong>gold</strong> and <strong>gold</strong>en yellow is slight but noticeable in designs, so if you want to move toward yellow, this is the right choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The combination of blue and <strong>gold</strong> – contrasts in the warmth and lightness of <strong>colors</strong>. One is attractive and intense. Pairs with dark blue and blue-green are especially appreciated. This is a win-win option that can always be complemented with white or black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So you are a lover of <strong>gold</strong>, that means you like the beautiful and sophisticated style.

With the right design elements, this will be a niche look for your home. It is one of the most preferred choices of home buyers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The combination of <strong>gold</strong> and orange is quite rare due to the similarity of shades and the lack of pronounced contrast. However, the pair is quite possible. It can involve both light and dark tones of orange, such as light peach, mango, tangerine, red-orange, red. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue is our favorite color recommendation.

Thanks to this, it can be used for everyday wear, but it reveals its true self in the evening. Its distinctive feature is a mysterious dark color, its brilliance is lost in the dark and is born from it. Such an entity practically hypnotically affects people, forcing them to play a fantasy about the hidden secrets of your soul. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The combination of black and <strong>gold</strong> is one of the most classic. Black, like the color of nobility, and <strong>gold</strong>, like the color of kings, reinforce each other, reaching a state of absolute chic. It is always a win-win, moreover, it gives you the opportunity to control your figure: if the <strong>gold</strong> color makes you look fat and black makes you slim, you can always place the accents correctly: for example, enlarge your breasts with a <strong>gold</strong> blouse and reduce the bottom with a black skirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>An uncommon choice but very unique in its ways.

The combination is good for mature and elderly women, where burgundy gives rise to passionate feelings in us, and <strong>gold</strong> takes us to the country of bohemia. The combination is comparable to “black and <strong>gold</strong>”, where burgundy acts as a mood and figure regulator (the color slims, gives youth to the face). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A pale gray with a hint of blue gives the ceiling a sense of receding, like the sky.

A light-colored ceiling that incorporates a hint of <strong>gold</strong> brings in the light and subtle warmth of the sun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The combination of brown and <strong>gold</strong> can undoubtedly be attributed to the stained glass style. Dark shades of brown will transform the <strong>gold</strong> tone no worse than black and burgundy, so when composing your wardrobe, in which there are <strong>gold</strong>en things, do not forget about it. Softer shades of brown can adapt clothes to a casual tone, but the gloss will remain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pale <strong>gold</strong> / Silver-<strong>gold</strong> is a pale yellow or beige tone with a rich sheen. This shade of <strong>gold</strong> is often used in clothing and accessories. Delicate with pure light, it suits the most common summer color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>gold</strong>en color is associated with the unfading radiance of the sun. Gold, like a metal (reflective light), difficult to corrode, yellow in color, personifies heavenly forces: eternal, exuding energy. Therefore, everything that is attributed to the highest and incomprehensible, the bestowing and formidable, is depicted with gilding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gold, sometimes also called <strong>gold</strong>en, is a rich color. Rich not only because it is immediately associated with money, but also because its uses and meanings, shades, and color combinations are so numerous and diverse. That being said, it is <strong>gold</strong> color‘s obvious link to opulence, success, and nobility, that’s responsible for the lion’s share of its applications in design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The analogous <strong>colors</strong> of <strong>gold</strong> color are International Orange (#ff5700) and Spring Bud green (#a8ff00). This means that these three <strong>colors</strong> sit next to each other on the color wheel and create a serene harmonious look. This particular combination – orange/<strong>gold</strong>/green – gives off the careless tropical vibe of a summer festival invitation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The combination of red and <strong>gold</strong> is extremely festive, bright, feminine. The charm and attractiveness of the woman in red and the regal inaccessibility of the <strong>gold</strong>en lady are intertwined in him. But one should be wary of such a combination, since both red and <strong>gold</strong> play in the direction of expanding space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue is the color of trust in web design and branding, as many studies on color psychology have un-earthed. It is also preferred by many people, both men, and women, to most other <strong>colors</strong>.
