Rubber mulch’s elasticity gives it a springy quality when used in thicker layers of 3 - 6 inches. Rubber mulch is a natural choice for playgrounds. - Source: Internet Ordering in bulk can save money and time. All bulk orders are shipped in large super sacks that can vary in weight, but will typically weigh 2,000lbs per sack. Bulk rubber mulch is a great solution for any playground in an HOA or public space! - Source: Internet Keep everything in place and looking as it did the day you completed your project with landscaping borders. They help your mulch stay in place and can be used to distinguish or define certain areas in your landscape. Plus, our borders come in a variety of different colors and styles, so they add to the visual appeal of a backyard setting. - Source: Internet The density and resilience of rubber mulch make it perfect for protecting children from falls in play areas. Rubber mulch is clean, so it won’t stain your kids’ clothes, and it stays in place so your kids won’t be tracking it into the house. Just make sure you get the wire-free variety. For effective shock absorption, install a layer of at least 6 inches. - Source: Internet Durable, easy to care for, and an excellent insulator, rubber mulch is a practical choice for beds with mature shrubs or trees. Its soft, springy texture also makes it useful in children’s play areas. For flower and vegetable beds, though, it’s less than ideal. Smaller plants are more vulnerable to the chemicals and metals rubber mulch releases into the ground and vegetables can absorb these contaminants. - Source: Internet Because rubber mulch contains petroleum, it’s more likely than organic mulch to catch fire from a flame or heat source, such as a cigarette butt or tipped-over garden lantern. If it does, it will burn faster and hotter, be harder to extinguish, and release thick smoke laden with harmful chemicals. While there’s little risk of your mulch catching fire, it’s something to consider if you’re looking for a material that’s safe to use around open flames. - Source: Internet Rymar Rubber Mulch is an innovative and eco-friendly alternative to traditional wood mulch for landscaping and playgrounds. Compared to wood mulch, rubber mulch is safer, more cost-effective, durable, environmentally-friendly and lower-maintenance. Plus, rubber mulch is clean—minimizing airborne dust and particles. Available in six fade-resistant colors, rubber mulch is a superior solution for every playground and landscaping project. - Source: Internet Rubber Mulch will not decompose. If fading begins after at least 12 years, you can either top-dress it with fresh Rubber Mulch or till it into the soil. Rubber Mulch is safe to till into the soil because it is nontoxic and acts as an aerator to help keep the soil from compacting. Similar rubber products such as crumb rubber are being used for the same purpose in athletic fields all across the country. You can also rake up your faded mulch to use as landfill. - Source: Internet When heated by the sun, rubber mulch can release chemicals known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Not only do these fumes often smell bad, they’re also bad for your health. If you live in a climate with hot summers, avoid using rubber mulch around seating areas where you don’t want the smell of hot rubber. - Source: Internet In spite of some manufacturer’s claims, rubber mulch is flammable. In multiple tests, it’s proved to burn hotter and faster than wood mulch. It spread faster and was more challenging to extinguish because of its comparatively high carbon to nitrogen ratio. Therefore, if you live in an area of elevated fire risk, avoid rubber mulch and opt for an organic mulch that’s more difficult to ignite and slower to spread. - Source: Internet Rubber mulch is made from ground-up tires and tends to be heavier than its organic counterparts. Therefore, it’s not typically blown away by strong winds or swept out of your garden bed in heavy rain. With wood and straw mulches, you can accidentally blow them all over the place just by being a little too enthusiastic with your leaf blower. You won’t have this trouble with rubber mulch. - Source: Internet Add mega curb appeal to your yard by using these borders to line your islands, gardens, and shrubbery. They may be a small part of the total project, but rubber mulch borders impact your landscape in a big way. Wow all your guests and neighbors with your clean and neat lines, and add the ideal finishing touch to your yard. - Source: Internet In mulch form, recycled rubber releases volatile organic compounds, or VOCs. These gaseous compounds are dangerous if inhaled and can lead to long-term health complications, ranging from nausea and dizziness to kidney, liver, and neurological damage. VOC increases as the rubber warms up, making the mulch undesirable for hot climates. - Source: Internet Mulch made from wood tends to attract pests such as carpenter ants, termites, and wasps, which limits where you can use these mulches. Pests like these avoid rubber mulch. You can safely use rubber mulch near your home’s foundation or around outbuildings without worrying you’ll end up with termites. In fact, rubber mulch helps protect your buildings from wood-eating pests, so you can use less pesticide. - Source: Internet Because it breaks down so slowly, rubber mulch will look much the same year after year even with next to no maintenance. While some cheaper dyed mulches might fade, many brands are rated to keep working and looking good for at least 10 years. Unlike with most organic mulches, you won’t have to replace rubber mulch every year or two, so you’ll save both time and money. - Source: Internet Absolutely! Rubber mulch is 100% non-toxic and eco-friendly. “Playground surfaces can contain recovered rubber and PVC materials that are often more desirable than wood chips, sand, or asphalt, because they can provide more cushioning and thereby may be safer for children. You can find playground surfaces made with recovered materials at schools, military bases, and housing developments.” – Source EPA.gov - Source: Internet Safe surfaces like bonded play shred are increasing in popularity across the UK, and we are installing more and more in-play areas (https://www.rubber-playground-mulch.co.uk/playground/) and parks. - Source: Internet The most ideal way to install rubber mulch is over a weed fabric. We recommend using a weed fabric and not a plastic material because plastic is not permeable. When installing rubber mulch over a weed fabric, you will never have any weed problems, and you won’t have to worry about previous mulch debris mixing with it.

If you don’t mind using the same rubber mulch that long, it’s an economical option. Just beware of cheap rubber mulches, which are often made from radial tires and might still have bits of wires inside. Wire-free mulch costs more. - Source: Internet Rubber might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of mulch, but this material’s been gaining popularity for a number of reasons. It’s long-lasting, stays in place, and doesn’t attract bugs. Because this mulch is made from recycled tires, though, there are some concerns about how healthy it is for your soil and plants. - Source: Internet Worse yet, this mulch can leach heavy metals such as aluminum, zinc, cadmium, and chromium into the soil and eventually the groundwater. In particular, rubber from tires contains a high level of zinc oxide, which can accumulate in your plants and eventually kill them. This is even more of a problem in areas where the soil is already rich in zinc, so it’s a good idea to have your soil tested before you apply rubber mulch. - Source: Internet Bonded Rubber or Poured-in-place rubber playground surfacing is an excellent low-maintenance, safe and wheelchair accessible unitary playground surface.

Whether using our rubber mulch borders to surround your landscaping handiwork, or the kids’ playground, there are options that fit every need. - Source: Internet Rubber mulch isn’t organic, so it lasts much longer than wood, straw, and leaf alternatives. Some manufacturers claim their rubber mulches can last up to 10 years before you need to replace them. Wood mulch, on the other hand, breaks down completely in four to seven years. - Source: Internet Before you use rubber mulch, you’ll need to lay down landscaping fabric to keep the mulch separate from the soil.

Rubber Mulch also offers ADA-Qualified wheelchair accessibility. - Source: Internet Organic mulches tend to absorb and hold onto a lot of water, which can result in a hub of fungi, mold, and pathogens. Rubber mulch, on the other hand, isn’t absorbent at all. Water simply passes around the mulch and straight into the soil, keeping plants thoroughly hydrated. - Source: Internet Rubber mulch is heavy enough that it won’t easily float or blow away. If your planting bed becomes flooded from rain or over-enthusiastic watering, pine straw, and wood chips are likely to float and drift so much you’ll need to rake the mulch back into place. Strong winds and leaf blowers can do the same to lightweight organic mulches. If you live in a storm-prone area or you use wind-generating garden equipment, rubber mulch can save you some cleanup work. - Source: Internet Well-known for its insulating properties, rubber can hold warmth in your soil for longer.

Rubber mulch doesn’t biodegrade quickly and doesn’t add nutrients to the soil, so you can’t till it into the soil to get rid of weeds. If weeds pop up, you’ll need to pull them by hand. - Source: Internet Mulch is primarily used to inhibit weed growth, and rubber is the all-star. The material is heavy and dense, so it blocks light and compresses the soil surface, discouraging weeds from germinating or pushing up new growth. And it’ll help you in your fight against your neighbor’s weed seeds, too—because it doesn’t hold water, rubber mulch is inhospitable, holding and dehydrating the weed seeds before they can germinate and take root in your soil. - Source: Internet To begin started, here are some tips for finding information about The Pros and Cons of Rubber Mulch:\r- Research best price on brown rubber mulch-related information from credible sources.

Rubber <strong>mulch</strong> doesn’t biodegrade quickly and doesn’t add nutrients to the soil, so you can’t till it into the soil to get rid of weeds. If weeds pop up, you’ll need to pull them by hand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Mulch is primarily used to inhibit weed growth, and rubber is the all-star. The material is heavy and dense, so it blocks light and compresses the soil surface, discouraging weeds from germinating or pushing up new growth.
