This incredible coffee mug is made of high-quality ceramic and features a brilliant raised bas-relief design. We also love the scratched and dented look achieved by the incredible paint job. The great part about owning a Boba Fett mug such as this one is that even if you scratch or chip your mug, it will blend right in with the design. - Source: Internet If you are looking for a great collectible coffee mug from the Force Awakens movie, then you surely need to check out this product. While Kylo Ren had a cold and frightening aura about him, this incredibly cute ceramic mug is quite the opposite. In fact, if you plan on using this mug at your workplace, then it will surely lighten the mood of your colleagues. - Source: Internet Needless to say, this product is suitable for washing in the dishwasher, and it is also microwave-safe. However, unlike the former product, this coffee mug comes with an irresistible offer. In fact, it has a 100% Money Back Guarantee in case you are not satisfied with the quality of the product. Moreover, you also get the choice of including a free gift message along with a gift wrap. Its practicality not only makes it perfect for everyday use, but it is also a great gift idea for any grown-up Star Wars fans. - Source: Internet Just like previous Tiki mugs featured on our list, the Boba Fett mug is equally functional. In fact, it has a decent capacity of 14 oz (397 ml) for your favorite beverage. Moreover, it is suitable for washing in the dishwasher, albeit in the top shelf. On top of that, it is also marked safe for microwave use. - Source: Internet Vandor has done it again! This incredible coffee mug is surely one of the best products that Vandor has to offer. Not only does it look stunning in its amazing glossy black paint job, but it is actually quite practical for everyday use. Moreover, it is made from high-quality stoneware which makes the Darth Vader Sculpted Mug even more impressive. - Source: Internet If you thought we were done with cool and quirky mugs, then you are highly mistaken. In fact, we have yet another series of products which are as ostentatious as they are functional. More on that later. - Source: Internet However, this is where its functionality ends, and just like the other steins/mugs featured earlier, this mug is not safe for microwave use, nor is it suitable for washing in the dishwasher. But, to be fair, most buyers will not purchase this product for regular use. Instead, this amazing BB-8 mug makes for a great collectible, and if you are buying it for that reason, then we highly recommend this product. - Source: Internet While it may not be quite as large as some of the other mugs featured on this list, it still manages to offer a decent 12 oz (355 ml) capacity for your favorite beverage. And we believe some people might actually prefer that instead of a gargantuan mug. Moreover, this coffee mug is quite practical for everyday use. In fact, it is not only suitable for dishwasher use, but it is also microwave-safe. - Source: Internet The BB-8 stein/mug is quite large. In fact, it has a rather substantial capacity of 32 oz (946 ml), which if you ask us is more than what the craziest of coffee drinkers can handle. Then again, this incredibly cute BB-8 mug is not just meant for your coffee, it is also a stein. - Source: Internet Not everyone is a fan of flashy and ostentatious products, and if you are someone like that, then this coffee mug is surely going to pique your interest. If this mug seems familiar, that is because it is a variation of the “Freeze, You Rebel Scum!” Ceramic Coffee Mug we featured earlier. While the former had a black and white color combination, this one comes with a rather cool combination of red and black. - Source: Internet If you loved the previous product on our list, then you will surely need to check out this minimalistic coffee mug with an incredibly witty print. Just like the Star Wars “Who’s Your Daddy” Darth Vader coffee mug, this product is made from high-quality ceramic and finished with a premium black printing on the side. Moreover, it has the same capacity of 11 oz (325 ml), and we believe that should suffice for all but the craziest of coffee drinkers. - Source: Internet Although the coffee mug we have featured has a decent capacity of 12 oz (355 ml), it is also available in an incredible 20 oz (591 ml) form. In case you are planning on using this as your regular coffee mug, then we must admit that it is neither microwave-safe nor is it suitable for dishwasher use. Then again, we are quite confident that any Star Wars fan will be more than willing to make this sacrifice for this incredible Star Wars Heat Reactive Light Sabers Mug. - Source: Internet While the previous R2-D2 mug featured on our list was not an official Star Wars product, this one is. Moreover, it will be a great companion to the C-3PO coffee mug we reviewed earlier. Just like the C-3PO mug, this product is also made of high-quality, durable ceramic. It even features a highly detailed exterior paint job. - Source: Internet If you are a big Star Wars fan but are not fond of ostentatious objects, then this incredible Star Wars Imperial Logo Mug will be right up your alley. How, you ask? Well, for starters, it features an incredibly cool matte black paint job which gives this coffee mug a stealth appearance. Moreover, the beautiful blood red emblem of the Galactic Empire and the subtle “Star Wars” outline text complement the stealth look very well. - Source: Internet If you loved our previous helmet coffee mugs, then you will surely be impressed with this product. Star Wars fans will be all too familiar with the legendary assassin, Boba Fett, and this incredible product is a perfect representation of the character in the form of a coffee mug. What is even more impressive than the concept is the incredible attention to detail. In fact, this mug’s brilliant paint job incorporates the dents and scratches of the original Boba Fett helmet. - Source: Internet This incredible product is as practical as it is stylish. In fact, it comes with a rather sizeable capacity of 14 oz (397 ml), and we believe it should suffice for all but the craziest of coffee drinkers. Moreover, it is safe for microwave use and suitable for washing in the top-shelf of the dishwasher. However, if you plan on using it regularly and want it to stand the test of time, then we would advise you to wash it by hand. - Source: Internet Now, hold on! We understand you are getting tired of these incredibly cool but highly impractical steins/mugs. But, we promise this is the last one. This amazing BB-8 Ceramic Stein/Mug is not only overflowing with cuteness, but it is also made of high-quality ceramic. Moreover, it is built perfectly to BB-8’s shape and finished with a premium paint job. - Source: Internet If we have one gripe about this product, then that would be the paint job. Unlike the previous Boba Fett coffee mugs, we have featured, this one does not embrace the scratches and dents of the Mandalorian warrior’s armor. Then again, it is only a minor gripe, and we believe that most people purchasing it as a collectible item will love it regardless. - Source: Internet If you were looking for the ultimate C-3PO coffee mug, then this is where your search ends. This incredible sculptured stein/mug is shaped in the form of C-3PO. It is made of high-quality ceramic and is finished with a premium shiny gold paint. And that surely makes it one of the most ostentatious products featured on this list. - Source: Internet Hence, if you are looking to buy this mug as a replacement for your regular coffee mug, then we would advise against it. There are many more functional products featured on our list, and those would make a much more logical choice for an everyday coffee mug. However, if you are looking to buy this as a collectible item, then we highly recommend this product. - Source: Internet Darth Vader fans, we have yet another fantastic product for you. In fact, this is surely one of the coolest Darth Vader mugs ever made. This incredible sculptured stein/coffee mug is made of high-quality ceramic and finished in premium glossy black paint. Moreover, it can hold an impressive 22 oz (624 ml) of your favorite beverage. - Source: Internet When it comes to the functionality, this elegant coffee mug does a great job. While it may not be as large as some of the other coffee mugs featured on this list, it can still hold a decent 12 oz (355 ml). Moreover, it is marked safe for microwave use, and it is also suitable for washing in the dishwasher. - Source: Internet If you loved the oval coffee mugs we featured earlier, then you surely need to check out this incredible The Force Awakens BB-8 Oval Ceramic Mug. Just like the Yoda oval mug and the Darth Vader oval mug, this product is constructed out of high-quality ceramic. Moreover, it features an incredible glossy orange paint job which is finished with a high-resolution print of BB-8. - Source: Internet Chewbacca’s facial expression looks quite menacing here, doesn’t it? Despite his angry expression, we believe that this mug will bring nothing but joy to those using it. Just like the other Tiki mugs we have featured, the Chewbacca Tiki Mug is no different when it comes to the construction. In fact, it is not only made of high-quality ceramic, but it also features a premium glossy paint job. - Source: Internet While Darth Maul cannot win a battle of fame against Darth Vader, this incredible coffee mug can definitely hold its own against any Darth Vader mug when it comes to the cool factor. In fact, we love the matte black paint job and the incredibly cool molded face of the Sith warrior. We have to commend the Disney design department for doing a brilliant job in highlighting Darth Maul’s scary facial tattoos on this mug. - Source: Internet If you loved the incredibly cute BB-8 Ceramic Sculpted Mug, then you will love this product inspired by the iconic R2-D2 character from Star Wars. Just like the former, this incredible mug from high-quality ceramic and finished with a beautiful paint job. This coffee mug is slightly larger than the BB-8 mug and can hold 20 oz (591 ml) of your favorite beverage. - Source: Internet Just like the “Freeze, You Rebel Scum!” Ceramic Coffee Mug, this one is also capable of holding 12 oz (355 ml) of your favorite beverage. Moreover, due to its sturdy ceramic construction coupled with the high-quality paint job, this coffee mug is much more functional compared to the ostentatious products featured on our list. In fact, it is not only safe for microwave use, but it is also suitable for washing in the dishwasher. - Source: Internet However, neither its design nor its functionality are the most impressive things about it. That honor would have to go to its current price, and at this value, we cannot recommend it enough. Finally, the fact that it is one of the most popular Yoda mugs should surely seal the deal for you. - Source: Internet After experiencing a drink from this incredible sculptured Darth Vader Coffee Mug, we believe that everyone will be willing to embrace the dark side. Not only does it look surprisingly similar to the Darth Vader helmet, but it is also actually quite functional as a coffee mug. In fact, it can hold an incredible 20 oz (591 ml) of your favorite beverage. Moreover, the removable lid is also functional and can be used to keep your drink warm. - Source: Internet When it comes to the functionality, it is quite similar to the other Vandor products featured here. In fact, it has a cavernous capacity of 20 oz (591 ml), which should suffice for even the craziest of coffee drinkers. Moreover, it is marked safe for microwave use. However, just like the previous Vandor products, we suggest not to wash it in the dishwasher. If you can do that, then this incredible coffee mug will easily stand the stern test of time. - Source: Internet Continuing with the minimalistic theme is the Star Wars “Who’s Your Daddy” Darth Vader coffee mug. While it may not be as cool as some of the other Darth Vader products featured on this list, it was never meant for that kind of audience. In fact, this mug is understatedly cool, and we believe that is exactly what some people are looking for. - Source: Internet While the last coffee mug was an amazing take on the Stormtrooper helmet, this incredible Star Wars Stormtrooper Ceramic Mug With Lid takes it a step further. In fact, at first sight, it is hard to believe that this is a coffee mug. We are quite sure that most people would think of it as a showpiece if you casually place it on your office desk. Just like the last coffee mug featured here, it is incredibly capacious and can hold 20 oz (591 ml) of your favorite beverage. - Source: Internet If you thought that the last coffee mug was cool, then wait till you feast your eyes on this incredible Star Wars Stormtrooper Sculptured Mug. It is made of high-quality ceramic and finished with the iconic white and black colors of a Stormtrooper suit. While it may have a whimsical appearance for a coffee mug, it is actually quite practical. - Source: Internet The C-3PO mug is quite a unique product because of its tall and quirky design. This coffee mug is shaped like C-3PO’s torso, and we must say that Star Wars has done a fantastic job in designing this mug. We absolutely love the quality of the ceramic used for this product along with the intricate paint job. - Source: Internet Needless to say, its whimsical and cheerful appearance does not aid its functionality. In fact, this Kylo Ren mug can only hold 10 oz (295 ml) of your drink. Moreover, it is neither suitable for washing in the dishwasher, nor is it microwave-safe. Then again, this product was never meant to serve as a replacement for your regular coffee mug, and if you are buying for that purpose, then we would advise against it. However, if you are planning on gifting this mug to a Star Wars fan or purchasing it as a collectible, then we highly recommend this product. - Source: Internet While the last few products on our list had some sort of ostentatious element, this coffee mug manages to look cool without any. In fact, it is shaped like a regular coffee mug. However, it does come with an incredible glossy black paint job which is finished with a brilliant Darth Vader print on one side and an iconic Darth Vader quote on the other side. Moreover, the ceramic construction not only feels high-quality, but it is also quite durable. - Source: Internet The story of this mug’s practicality is akin to its top-notch construction. In fact, it comes with a decent capacity of 14 oz (397 ml) for your favorite beverage. While it may not be as capacious as some of the other humongous mugs we have featured here, its size is more manageable. Moreover, it is microwave-safe and suitable for washing in the top-shelf of the dishwasher. - Source: Internet When it comes to the practicality, this amazing coffee mug reigns supreme. In fact, it comes with an incredible capacity of 18 oz (532 ml) for your favorite beverage. Moreover, it is completely safe for microwave use, and it is suitable for washing in the dishwasher as well. - Source: Internet Now that we have got that out of the way, let us explore the brilliant features of this incredible coffee mug. Just like any other Vandor product, it is made from high-quality ceramic. Moreover, this coffee mug has high-resolution prints both on the interior as well as the exterior of the mug. We also love the classic combination of black and white and feel that it is perfect for representing the Stormtrooper theme, wouldn’t you agree? - Source: Internet While the last Chewbacca themed coffee mug was in the shape of his head, this incredible product features the entire body instead. The Star Wars Chewbacca Stein/Mug will definitely leave you impressed with its high-quality sculptured ceramic construction. Moreover, it also features a premium glossy paint job. On top of that, it can hold an amazing 22 oz (624 ml) of your favorite beverage! - Source: Internet When it comes to the functionality, this quirky mug does surprisingly well. In fact, it comes with a sizeable capacity of 14 oz (397 ml), and we believe that should easily suffice for most coffee drinkers. Moreover, you can use it to heat up your beverage in the microwave. Although this mug is marked safe for dishwasher use, it is only recommended that you put it in the top row. In case you are a little skeptical about that, we would suggest you wash it by hand instead. - Source: Internet While most buyers will refrain from using it as an everyday coffee mug, the Princess Leia Coffee Mug does come with the functionality of one. In fact, it has a decent capacity of 12 oz (355 ml), which should suffice for most coffee drinkers. Moreover, it can be washed in the dishwasher, and it is also marked safe for microwave use. - Source: Internet While its design and heat reactive feature may break the cool scale, this coffee mug does sacrifice a fair bit when it comes to the functionality. Sure, it has an incredible capacity of 20 oz (591 ml) for your favorite beverage. But its bold design features mean that it is not safe for dishwasher use, nor is it microwave-safe. If that does not bother you, then you can go right ahead and purchase it without a second thought. - Source: Internet Needless to say, this incredible coffee mug is as practical as they come. In fact, it has an amazing capacity of 20 oz (591 ml) for your favorite beverage. Moreover, it is not only safe for microwave use, but it is also dishwasher safe.

The great part about owning a Boba Fett mug such as this one is that even if you scratch or chip your mug, it will blend right in with the design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are looking for a great collectible <strong>coffee</strong> mug from the Force Awakens movie, then you surely need to check out this product. While Kylo Ren had a cold and frightening aura about him, this incredibly cute ceramic mug is quite the opposite. In fact, if you plan on using this mug at your workplace, then it will surely lighten the mood of your colleagues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Needless to say, this product is suitable for washing in the dishwasher, and it is also microwave-safe. However, unlike the former product, this <strong>coffee</strong> mug comes with an irresistible offer. In fact, it has a 100% Money Back Guarantee in case you are not satisfied with the quality of the product. Moreover, you also get the choice of including a free gift message along with a gift wrap. Its practicality not only makes it perfect for everyday use, but it is also a great gift idea for any grown-up Star Wars fans. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Just like previous Tiki <strong>mugs</strong> featured on our list, the Boba Fett mug is equally functional. In fact, it has a decent capacity of 14 oz (397 ml) for your favorite beverage. Moreover, it is suitable for washing in the dishwasher, albeit in the top shelf. On top of that, it is also marked safe for microwave use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Vandor has done it again! This incredible <strong>coffee</strong> mug is surely one of the best products that Vandor has to offer. Not only does it look stunning in its amazing glossy black paint job, but it is actually quite practical for everyday use. Moreover, it is made from high-quality stoneware which makes the Darth Vader Sculpted Mug even more impressive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you thought we were done with cool and quirky <strong>mugs</strong>, then you are highly mistaken. In fact, we have yet another series of products which are as ostentatious as they are functional. More on that later. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, this is where its functionality ends, and just like the other steins/<strong>mugs</strong> featured earlier, this mug is not safe for microwave use, nor is it suitable for washing in the dishwasher. But, to be fair, most buyers will not purchase this product for regular use. Instead, this amazing BB-8 mug makes for a great collectible, and if you are buying it for that reason, then we highly recommend this product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While it may not be quite as large as some of the other <strong>mugs</strong> featured on this list, it still manages to offer a decent 12 oz (355 ml) capacity for your favorite beverage. And we believe some people might actually prefer that instead of a gargantuan mug. Moreover, this <strong>coffee</strong> mug is quite practical for everyday use. In fact, it is not only suitable for dishwasher use, but it is also microwave-safe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The BB-8 stein/mug is quite large. In fact, it has a rather substantial capacity of 32 oz (946 ml), which if you ask us is more than what the craziest of <strong>coffee</strong> drinkers can handle. Then again, this incredibly cute BB-8 mug is not just meant for your <strong>coffee</strong>, it is also a stein. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Not everyone is a fan of flashy and ostentatious products, and if you are someone like that, then this <strong>coffee</strong> mug is surely going to pique your interest. If this mug seems familiar, that is because it is a variation of the “Freeze, You Rebel Scum!” Ceramic Coffee Mug we featured earlier. While the former had a black and white color combination, this one comes with a rather cool combination of red and black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you loved the previous product on our list, then you will surely need to check out this minimalistic <strong>coffee</strong> mug with an incredibly witty print. Just like the Star Wars “Who’s Your Daddy” Darth Vader <strong>coffee</strong> mug, this product is made from high-quality ceramic and finished with a premium black printing on the side. Moreover, it has the same capacity of 11 oz (325 ml), and we believe that should suffice for all but the craziest of <strong>coffee</strong> drinkers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although the <strong>coffee</strong> mug we have featured has a decent capacity of 12 oz (355 ml), it is also available in an incredible 20 oz (591 ml) form. In case you are planning on using this as your regular <strong>coffee</strong> mug, then we must admit that it is neither microwave-safe nor is it suitable for dishwasher use. Then again, we are quite confident that any Star Wars fan will be more than willing to make this sacrifice for this incredible Star Wars Heat Reactive Light Sabers Mug. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While the previous R2-D2 mug featured on our list was not an official Star Wars product, this one is. Moreover, it will be a great companion to the C-3PO <strong>coffee</strong> mug we reviewed earlier. Just like the C-3PO mug, this product is also made of high-quality, durable ceramic. It even features a highly detailed exterior paint job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are a big Star Wars fan but are not fond of ostentatious objects, then this incredible Star Wars Imperial Logo Mug will be right up your alley. How, you ask? Well, for starters, it features an incredibly cool matte black paint job which gives this <strong>coffee</strong> mug a stealth appearance. Moreover, the beautiful blood red emblem of the Galactic Empire and the subtle “Star Wars” outline text complement the stealth look very well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you loved our previous helmet <strong>coffee</strong> <strong>mugs</strong>, then you will surely be impressed with this product. Star Wars fans will be all too familiar with the legendary assassin, Boba Fett, and this incredible product is a perfect representation of the character in the form of a <strong>coffee</strong> mug. What is even more impressive than the concept is the incredible attention to detail. In fact, this mug’s brilliant paint job incorporates the dents and scratches of the original Boba Fett helmet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This incredible product is as practical as it is stylish. In fact, it comes with a rather sizeable capacity of 14 oz (397 ml), and we believe it should suffice for all but the craziest of <strong>coffee</strong> drinkers. Moreover, it is safe for microwave use and suitable for washing in the top-shelf of the dishwasher. However, if you plan on using it regularly and want it to stand the test of time, then we would advise you to wash it by hand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now, hold on! We understand you are getting tired of these incredibly cool but highly impractical steins/<strong>mugs</strong>. But, we promise this is the last one. This amazing BB-8 Ceramic Stein/Mug is not only overflowing with cuteness, but it is also made of high-quality ceramic. Moreover, it is built perfectly to BB-8’s shape and finished with a premium paint job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If we have one gripe about this product, then that would be the paint job. Unlike the previous Boba Fett <strong>coffee</strong> <strong>mugs</strong>, we have featured, this one does not embrace the scratches and dents of the Mandalorian warrior’s armor. Then again, it is only a minor gripe, and we believe that most people purchasing it as a collectible item will love it regardless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you were looking for the ultimate C-3PO <strong>coffee</strong> mug, then this is where your search ends. This incredible sculptured stein/mug is shaped in the form of C-3PO. It is made of high-quality ceramic and is finished with a premium shiny gold paint. And that surely makes it one of the most ostentatious products featured on this list. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hence, if you are looking to buy this mug as a replacement for your regular <strong>coffee</strong> mug, then we would advise against it. There are many more functional products featured on our list, and those would make a much more logical choice for an everyday <strong>coffee</strong> mug. However, if you are looking to buy this as a collectible item, then we highly recommend this product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Darth Vader fans, we have yet another fantastic product for you. In fact, this is surely one of the coolest Darth Vader <strong>mugs</strong> ever made. This incredible sculptured stein/<strong>coffee</strong> mug is made of high-quality ceramic and finished in premium glossy black paint. Moreover, it can hold an impressive 22 oz (624 ml) of your favorite beverage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to the functionality, this elegant <strong>coffee</strong> mug does a great job. While it may not be as large as some of the other <strong>coffee</strong> <strong>mugs</strong> featured on this list, it can still hold a decent 12 oz (355 ml). Moreover, it is marked safe for microwave use, and it is also suitable for washing in the dishwasher. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you loved the oval <strong>coffee</strong> <strong>mugs</strong> we featured earlier, then you surely need to check out this incredible The Force Awakens BB-8 Oval Ceramic Mug. Just like the Yoda oval mug and the Darth Vader oval mug, this product is constructed out of high-quality ceramic. Moreover, it features an incredible glossy orange paint job which is finished with a high-resolution print of BB-8. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Chewbacca’s facial expression looks quite menacing here, doesn’t it? Despite his angry expression, we believe that this mug will bring nothing but joy to those using it. Just like the other Tiki <strong>mugs</strong> we have featured, the Chewbacca Tiki Mug is no different when it comes to the construction. In fact, it is not only made of high-quality ceramic, but it also features a premium glossy paint job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While Darth Maul cannot win a battle of fame against Darth Vader, this incredible <strong>coffee</strong> mug can definitely hold its own against any Darth Vader mug when it comes to the cool factor. In fact, we love the matte black paint job and the incredibly cool molded face of the Sith warrior. We have to commend the Disney design department for doing a brilliant job in highlighting Darth Maul’s scary facial tattoos on this mug. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you loved the incredibly cute BB-8 Ceramic Sculpted Mug, then you will love this product inspired by the iconic R2-D2 character from Star Wars. Just like the former, this incredible mug from high-quality ceramic and finished with a beautiful paint job. This <strong>coffee</strong> mug is slightly larger than the BB-8 mug and can hold 20 oz (591 ml) of your favorite beverage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Just like the “Freeze, You Rebel Scum!” Ceramic Coffee Mug, this one is also capable of holding 12 oz (355 ml) of your favorite beverage. Moreover, due to its sturdy ceramic construction coupled with the high-quality paint job, this <strong>coffee</strong> mug is much more functional compared to the ostentatious products featured on our list. In fact, it is not only safe for microwave use, but it is also suitable for washing in the dishwasher. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, neither its design nor its functionality are the most impressive things about it. That honor would have to go to its current price, and at this value, we cannot recommend it enough. Finally, the fact that it is one of the most popular Yoda <strong>mugs</strong> should surely seal the deal for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After experiencing a drink from this incredible sculptured Darth Vader Coffee Mug, we believe that everyone will be willing to embrace the dark side. Not only does it look surprisingly similar to the Darth Vader helmet, but it is also actually quite functional as a <strong>coffee</strong> mug. In fact, it can hold an incredible 20 oz (591 ml) of your favorite beverage. Moreover, the removable lid is also functional and can be used to keep your drink warm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to the functionality, it is quite similar to the other Vandor products featured here. In fact, it has a cavernous capacity of 20 oz (591 ml), which should suffice for even the craziest of <strong>coffee</strong> drinkers. Moreover, it is marked safe for microwave use. However, just like the previous Vandor products, we suggest not to wash it in the dishwasher. If you can do that, then this incredible <strong>coffee</strong> mug will easily stand the stern test of time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Continuing with the minimalistic theme is the Star Wars “Who’s Your Daddy” Darth Vader <strong>coffee</strong> mug. While it may not be as cool as some of the other Darth Vader products featured on this list, it was never meant for that kind of audience. In fact, this mug is understatedly cool, and we believe that is exactly what some people are looking for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While the last <strong>coffee</strong> mug was an amazing take on the Stormtrooper helmet, this incredible Star Wars Stormtrooper Ceramic Mug With Lid takes it a step further. In fact, at first sight, it is hard to believe that this is a <strong>coffee</strong> mug. We are quite sure that most people would think of it as a showpiece if you casually place it on your office desk. Just like the last <strong>coffee</strong> mug featured here, it is incredibly capacious and can hold 20 oz (591 ml) of your favorite beverage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you thought that the last <strong>coffee</strong> mug was cool, then wait till you feast your eyes on this incredible Star Wars Stormtrooper Sculptured Mug. It is made of high-quality ceramic and finished with the iconic white and black colors of a Stormtrooper suit. While it may have a whimsical appearance for a <strong>coffee</strong> mug, it is actually quite practical. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The C-3PO mug is quite a unique product because of its tall and quirky design. This <strong>coffee</strong> mug is shaped like C-3PO’s torso, and we must say that Star Wars has done a fantastic job in designing this mug. We absolutely love the quality of the ceramic used for this product along with the intricate paint job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Needless to say, its whimsical and cheerful appearance does not aid its functionality. In fact, this Kylo Ren mug can only hold 10 oz (295 ml) of your drink. Moreover, it is neither suitable for washing in the dishwasher, nor is it microwave-safe. Then again, this product was never meant to serve as a replacement for your regular <strong>coffee</strong> mug, and if you are buying for that purpose, then we would advise against it. However, if you are planning on gifting this mug to a Star Wars fan or purchasing it as a collectible, then we highly recommend this product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While the last few products on our list had some sort of ostentatious element, this <strong>coffee</strong> mug manages to look cool without any. In fact, it is shaped like a regular <strong>coffee</strong> mug. However, it does come with an incredible glossy black paint job which is finished with a brilliant Darth Vader print on one side and an iconic Darth Vader quote on the other side. Moreover, the ceramic construction not only feels high-quality, but it is also quite durable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The story of this mug’s practicality is akin to its top-notch construction. In fact, it comes with a decent capacity of 14 oz (397 ml) for your favorite beverage. While it may not be as capacious as some of the other humongous <strong>mugs</strong> we have featured here, its size is more manageable. Moreover, it is microwave-safe and suitable for washing in the top-shelf of the dishwasher. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to the practicality, this amazing <strong>coffee</strong> mug reigns supreme. In fact, it comes with an incredible capacity of 18 oz (532 ml) for your favorite beverage. Moreover, it is completely safe for microwave use, and it is suitable for washing in the dishwasher as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now that we have got that out of the way, let us explore the brilliant features of this incredible <strong>coffee</strong> mug. Just like any other Vandor product, it is made from high-quality ceramic. Moreover, this <strong>coffee</strong> mug has high-resolution prints both on the interior as well as the exterior of the mug. We also love the classic combination of black and white and feel that it is perfect for representing the Stormtrooper theme, wouldn’t you agree? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While the last Chewbacca themed <strong>coffee</strong> mug was in the shape of his head, this incredible product features the entire body instead. The Star Wars Chewbacca Stein/Mug will definitely leave you impressed with its high-quality sculptured ceramic construction. Moreover, it also features a premium glossy paint job. On top of that, it can hold an amazing 22 oz (624 ml) of your favorite beverage! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to the functionality, this quirky mug does surprisingly well. In fact, it comes with a sizeable capacity of 14 oz (397 ml), and we believe that should easily suffice for most <strong>coffee</strong> drinkers. Moreover, you can use it to heat up your beverage in the microwave. Although this mug is marked safe for dishwasher use, it is only recommended that you put it in the top row. In case you are a little skeptical about that, we would suggest you wash it by hand instead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While most buyers will refrain from using it as an everyday <strong>coffee</strong> mug, the Princess Leia Coffee Mug does come with the functionality of one. In fact, it has a decent capacity of 12 oz (355 ml), which should suffice for most <strong>coffee</strong> drinkers. Moreover, it can be washed in the dishwasher, and it is also marked safe for microwave use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While its design and heat reactive feature may break the cool scale, this <strong>coffee</strong> mug does sacrifice a fair bit when it comes to the functionality. Sure, it has an incredible capacity of 20 oz (591 ml) for your favorite beverage. But its bold design features mean that it is not safe for dishwasher use, nor is it microwave-safe. If that does not bother you, then you can go right ahead and purchase it without a second thought. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Needless to say, this incredible <strong>coffee</strong> mug is as practical as they come. In fact, it has an amazing capacity of 20 oz (591 ml) for your favorite beverage. Moreover, it is not only safe for microwave use, but it is also dishwasher safe. This is truly the mug that Yoda fans deserve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://cdn.thisiswhyimbroke.com/images/monster-mug.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Vintage Star Wars Coffee Mugs - Star Wars Paladone 3D Darth Vader Star Wars Mug">
