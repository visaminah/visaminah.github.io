This makes the color less vibrant without changing the hue. Blue-gray is already toned down as it’s a combination of <strong>blue</strong> and gray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another of our beautiful <strong>blue</strong> and grey living room ideas. This grand looking room uses <strong>blue</strong>, cream, grey and white to great effect. The light grey carpet is unobtrusive and is the perfect base for the <strong>blue</strong> sofa, cream chairs and <strong>blue</strong> & white patterned seating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We know that there are about a dozen or so possible combinations that can go well with navy <strong>blue</strong>, and choosing just one can be a bit confusing. Fortunately, we&rsquo;ve listed the best and most popular combinations for you to choose from. Keep reading as we also give you suggestions on wood choices that you can use for navy <strong>blue</strong>-colored rooms in your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Depending on your aesthetic and the overall vibe you&rsquo;re going for, the colors <strong>blue</strong> and gray can act as a great starting point. Whether it&rsquo;s coastal-chic, boho, or midcentury that you&rsquo;re aiming for, pairing certain shades with the neutral combo can either make or break your space. That being said, there are a few things to keep in mind when finalizing your colo palette. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Each color on the visible light spectrum has unique wavelengths. On one end of the spectrum, red has long, stretched-out wavelengths, while the other end is violet, which has short wavelengths that occur more frequently. So, if we look at a red apple, all the colors with shorter wavelengths, such as violet, <strong>blue</strong>, and green, will be absorbed while red, which has the longest wavelengths, will reflect off the object. Thus, the apple will appear red to us. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To create peaceful spaces, look outside for calming colors and earthen textures that complement navy <strong>blue</strong>. Nature-inspired elements such as rich wood furniture, straw-hued wicker and rattan accents, leather upholstery, warm neutral paint colors, and concrete-gray accents partner perfectly with navy <strong>blue</strong> hues. Pick neutral accessories and materials that are lighter or much darker than a room&rsquo;s navy <strong>blue</strong> finishes and furniture to emphasize color differences and lend distinction to each element. No matter which colors you pair with navy, use contrast to avoid a muddied-up palette and supply resting places for the eye. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Jeans come in all colors these days, but classically they belong to the <strong>blue</strong> family, and as explained above, <strong>blue</strong> is a perfect match for grey. Jeans come in all sorts of washes, from very dark – navy to acid washed – basically white, all hues complemented beautifully with a grey tank, blouse, or sweater. Jeans paired with a grey top can make up an outfit for any occasion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Choose a color that contrasts with the navy <strong>blue</strong> shade of your pants. For example, if you’re wearing dark or black dress pants then a light or white colored shirt is ideal for creating an effective contrast. Make sure your shirt isn’t too flashy- otherwise it will dominate and take all the attention away from your outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Similar to yellow, gold makes a brilliant complement to navy <strong>blue</strong>. Incorporate the color into your navy <strong>blue</strong> room with metallic gold accents or gold-toned wood finishes on floors, furniture, or trim. This radiant hue is especially helpful for lightening up dark navy <strong>blue</strong> colors to ward off a gloomy look. A large gold mirror on a navy <strong>blue</strong> wall, for example, will reflect light around the space to create an expansive effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To sum it up, a <strong>blue</strong>-gray paint color is gray with <strong>blue</strong> added to it. Some of these livid colors are more <strong>blue</strong> than gray and others are more gray than <strong>blue</strong>. These cool toned colors can also be considered slate colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The color ochre is an earthy, deep yellow tone that goes well with navy <strong>blue</strong> because of its warmth. While it almost looks similar to yellow, ochre brings about the richness and depth of a room. Since ochre is close to yellow hues, it contrasts well with navy <strong>blue</strong>, but it looks richer and a little more glamorous to look at when used in your space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>People often confuse the CMYK color model for being similar to RGB. CMYK is a form of subtractive mixing that’s used for printer ink. The primary colors on the CMYK color model are cyan, magenta, and yellow, while the secondary colors are red, green, and <strong>blue</strong>. Even though those are the same but opposite colors of RGB, the two models are very different. Colors like black, gray, and brown exist in CMYK even though they don’t exist in RGB. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>On the RGB color model, the primary colors are red, green, and <strong>blue</strong>. When mixing colored lights together, the results usually get lighter. The three primary colors mixed together at full brightness make white, which is much different from the brown that the RYB primary colors make. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I’d think twice before painting your entire kitchen <strong>blue</strong>. According to a study published in Appetite, people tended to drink and eat more when they were using <strong>blue</strong> cups and plates. I find this fascinating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another way to match navy <strong>blue</strong> is to find colors that are similar to navy <strong>blue</strong> on the color wheel. These colors are called “analogous colors. ” Analogous colors can be used to create a more subtle look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Choosing lighter shades of grey to go with the blackest of blacks will give you a classic look. On the other hand – when pairing darker <strong>charcoal</strong> with black – don’t forget you can always add a pop of color here too for interest. A colourful or patterned scarf, tie, or shoes are just a few options to complete and balance a darker outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A navy <strong>blue</strong> shirt can go with a variety of different colors and styles of clothing. Some common choices include white, black, or gray pants or skirts; denim jeans; and khaki shorts or trousers. When it comes to shoes, brown or black loafers, dress shoes, or sneakers can all look great with a navy <strong>blue</strong> shirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you know me, you know I’m a fan of <strong>blue</strong>. I gravitate towards the color all the time. Whether it involves shopping for clothes or furniture, my eyes are almost always drawn to <strong>blue</strong> colors first. The same goes for paint colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Owen Wilson, Mahershala Ali, and Ed Sheeran. What to consider: Muted hues such as light <strong>blue</strong>s and greys work particularly well on those on the lighter side of the spectrum, whereas those with a richer skin tone will find it easier to experiment with bold colours. Every colour you wear should help create a contrast that lacks in your complexion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue-gray doesn’t have many meanings on its own, but the color does define “livid,” which is a synonym for anger. It’s used to describe bruising since that’s the color that skin sometimes turns. In addition to these meanings, <strong>blue</strong>-gray also shares some similar symbolism to <strong>blue</strong> and gray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Right now, certain colors seem more popular than others (we&rsquo;re looking at you, hot pink), but one shade that never goes out of style is navy <strong>blue</strong>. It continues to be a mainstay in our wardrobe year-round, whether we&rsquo;re rocking a striped navy and white swimsuit by the beach or bundling up in a knit navy sweater. However, despite this neutral being such a classic, deciding what colors go with navy <strong>blue</strong> can sometimes feel tricky. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In my opinion, the bedroom is the optimal place to use these colors. Since <strong>blue</strong> promotes calmness and relaxation, it’s perfect for a bedroom. Blue grays are great because they have a bit of color to them while being on the neutral side. And that makes sense for a bedroom paint color since you don’t want your paint to be overly colorful or vibrant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another classic, the combination of navy <strong>blue</strong> and red, is very reminiscent of nautical-themed spaces. However, different shades of red can be used and depending on how light or dark this red is, the feel of the room will drastically change. Darker, heavier red hues are more elegant, while brighter, striking firehouse reds are sure to bring in the heat to the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When <strong>blue</strong> and gray are used together, they provide a calming and soothing effect. They might be used together in a somber painting or a relaxing office space. However, they could be considered too serious for most bedrooms and living rooms, unless other colors are added to the design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The color wheel can be a helpful tool for determining what colors go with navy <strong>blue</strong>. For a complementary color scheme, look to <strong>blue</strong>&rsquo;s opposite on the wheel: orange. The fiery hue introduces warmth that balances the cool depth of navy <strong>blue</strong>. Establish a bold, colorful look with a medium-tone shade of orange, such as tangerine or papaya, that will stand up well against its dark counterpart. Lighter shades like coral or cantaloupe make beautiful accent colors in coastal-style rooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In CMYK, the K stands for “key color,” which is black. That’s why printer ink comes with black in addition to the primary colors. Gray can be made in CMYK by using a little black. Then, if you mix <strong>blue</strong> and gray in CMYK, you’ll get <strong>blue</strong>-gray, just like you would in RYB. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue and gray are two hues that work beautifully in a bedroom as proven by this dreamy design from Studio Rey. The matte gray paint color on the walls provides a quiet backdrop for the much bolder, rust-colored headboard. A pale <strong>blue</strong> blanket on top of white linens tempers the warm shade and complements the gray walls. Colorful accent pillows echo the headboard and act as the perfect finishing touches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>According to the color wheel, the complementary color of <strong>blue</strong> is orange. This is because <strong>blue</strong> and orange are opposite each other on the wheel. Blue is a cool color, while orange is a warm color. Together, they create a. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But, as we all know, there isn’t just one shade of red. Women are typically more in-tune with their ‘colour profile’ because of hours spent finding the right shade of foundation or right shade of red lipstick for their complexion. There are dusty reds, maroons, wine-reds, true reds, pinky-reds, orangey-reds… and just as a <strong>blue</strong> undertone separates the colour from true red, so too does our undertone or level of contrast dictate what type of red looks best on us. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A great choice for more masculine spaces, navy <strong>blue</strong> and gray work beautifully together to create a neutral palette. Varying shades of gray can be used to create a calming, natural palette that goes well with navy <strong>blue</strong>. The color gray also makes the perfect base palette to add different accents and furniture to suit a minimalist-looking space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you really want to amp up the drama of a <strong>blue</strong> and gray color scheme, a dark color like black is definitely the way to go. TFAD Architects incorporated the inky hue in this modern bedroom and the finished result is stunning. The gray accent wall showcasing Cole & Son&rsquo;s Nuvolette wallpaper draws all attention toward the bed, which is topped with earthy brown linens and a black blanket. The navy <strong>blue</strong> walls add to the moody vibe and provide just a hint of color. Herringbone wood floors, decorative ceiling trim, and swanky lighting complete the scene. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Navy <strong>blue</strong> is a pretty neutral shade from all of the <strong>blue</strong>s; this dark shade is complimentary to most colors. Navy <strong>blue</strong> goes well with colors like white, yellow, pink, ochre, red, gray, or gold. Navy <strong>blue</strong> also goes well with other <strong>blue</strong> shades, perfect if you&rsquo;re going for a monochromatic color scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Light grey can be paired with almost any shade of <strong>blue</strong> – light to dark – and <strong>charcoal</strong> grey can create varying effects depending on the <strong>blue</strong> that is chosen to go with it. This colour combo can also be used in any and every season and appropriate for any occasion. Pro tip: for a <strong>blue</strong> and grey outfit, choose a warm-toned brown shoe to complete the look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With yellow being a natural contrasting color to <strong>blue</strong>, it comes as no surprise that it does well to combine this color with navy <strong>blue</strong>.

The color yellow can be added as an accent or as a striking piece of color that draws visitors to the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Nothing will happen if you try to mix <strong>blue</strong> and gray lights because there’s no such thing as gray light.

Temperature or undertone incompatibility is almost always the culprit when colors don’t look “right” together. Consider <strong>charcoal</strong> gray as an alternative to black or dark <strong>blue</strong>: Charcoal gray can be the perfect dark color accent without being too deep or intense. It is also stunning as upholstered furniture or rugs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you consider yourself to have fair or light skin (cold/<strong>blue</strong> undertone), you will most likely fit into a few other categories as well. Your hair is an intense colour, either very blonde, very dark, or red. The sun is not a friend, and you’re burnt more often than tanned. You will probably have light coloured eyes as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Here&rsquo;s another <strong>blue</strong> and gray bedroom design for the win, but this time, it&rsquo;s from the team over at Arent & Pyke.

You know I love my teal colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Red and <strong>blue</strong> can be a classy combination if you have the eye for it. You can throw on a <strong>blue</strong> chambray blazer over a muted red dress for formal meetings or a powder <strong>blue</strong> leather jacket if you are headed out. Finish off with a red hat to take it in the opposite direction. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue paint is a little trickier to make since <strong>blue</strong> is a primary color. Yet, if you look at CMYK, which is a subtractive color model used for ink, you’ll find your answer. According to that color model, you can create <strong>blue</strong> by mixing magenta and cyan. However, those aren’t common paint colors, so you’d be better off buying more <strong>blue</strong> paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Due to its neutral profile, navy <strong>blue</strong> goes well with different colors of wood, depending on the feel you&rsquo;d like to have in your space. If you are looking to add hardwood floors to your navy-colored room, you&rsquo;re in luck. Navy <strong>blue</strong> goes well with many hardwood floors, ranging from the lightest white hardwoods to the darker, richer mahogany hardwood floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you think about mixing colors, gray probably isn’t one of the first colors you think to use unless your goal is to tone down another color. That’s because gray can make paint mixtures dull, and gray can’t be used when mixing lights. However, it can still create some unique paint colors, especially when mixed with <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Create a dynamic color scheme by pairing navy <strong>blue</strong> with a much lighter, brighter color. Shades of yellow, including soft butter yellow and rich mustard yellow, offer warmth and brilliance that stands out vividly against the cool, deep tones of navy <strong>blue</strong>. Use this color combination for an energizing effect in living spaces or bedrooms. Choose fabrics and materials with subtle differences in patterns and textures to layer in extra interest within a navy <strong>blue</strong> and yellow color scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The bathroom is another room where you want to create a serene and spa-like atmosphere. Again, <strong>blue</strong> is a color that is peaceful and calming. Bringing in a lighter <strong>blue</strong>-gray paint color will add a neutral softness to the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One way is to find a color wheel and locate navy <strong>blue</strong> on the wheel. Then, find the colors that are directly opposite of navy <strong>blue</strong> on the wheel. These colors are called “complementary colors. ” Complementary colors can be used to create a bold look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;re looking to add a pop of color to any room, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with a vibrant shade of orange. And bonus: The hue will work especially well with <strong>blue</strong> palettes since orange is a complementary color (meaning it&rsquo;s on the opposite side of the color wheel). Keep in mind that a little goes a long way, as proven by this bedroom design. Here, a citrus-hued throw and patterned accent pillow warm up the cooler <strong>charcoal</strong> gray walls and light <strong>blue</strong> headboard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are looking to do a monochromatic theme for your space, navy <strong>blue</strong> works beautifully with other shades from its family. Colors can range anywhere from the light <strong>blue</strong> shades to the more classic <strong>blue</strong>s, and it will create a beautiful gradient of calming <strong>blue</strong> colors. Make use of neutral whites and grays to accentuate your space for a crisp, classic look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>On this color model, the primary colors are red, yellow, and <strong>blue</strong>. Combinations of two primary colors can result in secondary colors like green, orange, and purple. If you mix an equal amount of all three primary colors together, you’ll usually get brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yes, navy <strong>blue</strong> can go with greige. The two colors can complement each other nicely, especially if you use different shades or tones of each color. For example, you could pair a light greige with a dark navy <strong>blue</strong>, or vice versa. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Instead of reaching for harsh colour pairings, opt for more neutral bases and then add a warm version of your favourite colour such as a pine green or a warm <strong>blue</strong> to keep it interesting. When donning bright colours, such as a bright red, add it in through your tie or pocket square, alongside a muted <strong>blue</strong> button-up and navy suit. Tip: Stay away from clear colours such as icy <strong>blue</strong>s and stark white. Opt for a warmer alternative to bring out the warmth in your complexion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Remember to consider the available lighting (both artificial and natural) in your space — if your room is already pretty dark, and you want to brighten it up, this might affect your color choice. Similarly, pay attention to the undertones of your wall paint — some shades lean more <strong>blue</strong> or yellow. Last but certainly not least, take time to refer to the color wheel to see the relationship between different hues. Now that we&rsquo;ve supplied you with a little inspo and some helpful tips, you&rsquo;re ready to make some tough decisions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For a coastal vibe, <strong>blue</strong>, gray, and white are the perfect color combination. Follow the lead of Pure Salt Interiors and throw in woven elements — like the lighting and jute rug — for added texture and warmth. The navy <strong>blue</strong> grasscloth wallpaper really shines alongside clean white walls with <strong>blue</strong> undertones. Details such as the rope-style wall lamp and striped pillows nod to the seaside theme, while framed gray swim trunks and a <strong>charcoal</strong> throw at the foot of the bed offer neutral contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Orlando Bloom, David Beckham, and Zayn Malik. What to consider: Instead of reaching for harsh colour pairings, opt for more neutral bases and then add a warm version of your favourite colour such as a pine green or a warm <strong>blue</strong> to keep it interesting. When donning bright colours, such as a bright red, add it in through your tie or pocket square, alongside a muted <strong>blue</strong> button-up and navy suit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The key to a great match lies in coordinating the tones. Warm gray shades go well with other warm-toned colors, like taupe, blush pink, butter yellow, and burnt orange. On the other hand, you can pair cool gray with other chill tones like navy <strong>blue</strong>, sage green, and cool whites. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bright colors are the name of the game in this moody living room by Jessica Helgerson Design. Here, dark wood millwork and a <strong>charcoal</strong> gray accent wall provide a neutral backdrop for the more vibrant pieces of home decor. The <strong>blue</strong> velvet sofa and matching club chairs compete for attention with a fuchsia lounge chair, pink throw pillows, and a large pink and <strong>blue</strong> work of art. A dark gray area rug adds to the dramatic scene, while simultaneously anchoring the bold setup. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue and gray go well with neutral colors like black, beige, and white, or dark colors like green and gold. Pastel versions of bright colors like purple or pink can make the design more positive and fun. Adding in shades and tints of <strong>blue</strong> can also bring the design to life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s true, we have been having many customers asking for cool gray paint colors with more of a <strong>blue</strong> undertone to it. This makes my heart so happy. I feel like so often people are terrified of color on their walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Picture whitecaps breaking atop dark <strong>blue</strong> waves, and you&rsquo;ll immediately realize why whites go so well with navy <strong>blue</strong>. White is a classic high-contrast partner that sets off the deep hue and gives navy a lively lift. Juxtapose navy <strong>blue</strong> furniture, decor, or cabinetry with a backdrop of crisp white walls for an energizing effect. Alternatively, you can balance dark, inky <strong>blue</strong> walls with white furniture, fabrics, and breezy sheer curtain panels. In addition to cool snow-white, off-whites and creams also make fine partners for navy <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Final Thoughts Blue gray or should I say livid colors are beautiful paint colors that work in all kinds of applications. From the exterior of the home to a master bedroom, choosing a <strong>blue</strong> gray paint color is sure to add a sense of calmness and beauty to the space. If you are looking for a color that has neutral tendencies, opt for a <strong>blue</strong> gray. You get all the pizzaz of a <strong>blue</strong> while having the neutrality of a gray. A true win-win in my book. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Navy <strong>blue</strong> is quite a masculine color, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that it cannot pair well with a feminine shade such as pink. Light, candy-colored pink shades add a softness to the darkness of navy, and it is perfect for adding in intimate spaces like bedrooms or living rooms. This color combination works beautifully in spaces that receive lots of light to emphasize both colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Here’s another Parisian street style look you can try. Wine red is a beautiful hue that has a grandeur vibe like no other color. Pair a teal <strong>blue</strong> dress with a red overarching jacket and red pumps to up the ante of your look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Navy <strong>blue</strong> is a shade of <strong>blue</strong> that sits in the middle of <strong>blue</strong> and black. Out of all the shades of <strong>blue</strong>, navy <strong>blue</strong> does well as a neutral color because of its black elements. Since it is a little darker than other <strong>blue</strong> shades, a good number of colors can be used to complement or accentuate them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Coming in with the lightest color, navy <strong>blue</strong> and white hardwood floors go other to create a beachy, fresh, and airy look to your space. The light hardwood floors will definitely brighten the darkness of the navy <strong>blue</strong> shade, without taking over too much of the room&rsquo;s vibe. It also goes well if you are going for a distressed, rustic look in your space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Daphne, Bracing Blue, and Distance are all more on the <strong>blue</strong> side of the color. They have a slate-like look to them. They are great darker <strong>blue</strong> gray options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Chestnut hardwood floors are generally common in many homes, as the rich brown color works well with any if not all colors. With navy <strong>blue</strong>, it becomes richer and warmer, making your room look inviting and intimate. Warm chestnut hardwood floors can work with many different furniture pieces, and they can be used whether you have a traditional or modern-looking space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Towards the darker side of things, we have navy or galaxy <strong>blue</strong>. These colors have more blacks in them, making it a lot deeper and darker when used in the room. It tends to make spaces a little small, so be careful in using this shade as it can be almost comparable to using grays or blacks in interior design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Those with high contrast colouring typically have very dark hair (such as black or dark brown) with very pale skin. And, if you tan, there’s still a noticeable shift between the colour of your skin and the colour of your hair. People with this kind of complexion typically have very deep brown eyes or clear <strong>blue</strong> eyes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This all-American pairing is a classic color scheme for interiors. Combine red and white with navy <strong>blue</strong> to decorate patriotic country-style spaces and playful nautical-inspired kids&rsquo; rooms. Vibrant cherry red or scarlet accents can also provide striking contrast against navy <strong>blue</strong> in modern or eclectic designs. This look works well for busy areas like kitchens, entryways, and living rooms. Pairing navy <strong>blue</strong> with more muted shades of red, such as salmon, rich burgundy, or brick red, can help set a sophisticated tone that&rsquo;s ideal for formal dining rooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Have fun with the color navy <strong>blue</strong>! Despite its dark appearance, this shade does really well with a multitude of colors without creating harsh and shocking combinations. The color works beautifully for walls or furniture, and it brings about a calming vibe to the space. Make sure to accentuate your interiors to bring out the best in this color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grey pants can go with a <strong>blue</strong> shirt, but it depends on the shade of <strong>blue</strong> and the shade of grey. If you want a more casual look, try pairing light grey pants with a navy shirt. For a more formal look, try pairing darker grey pants with a light <strong>blue</strong> shirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Various shades of <strong>blue</strong> come together to form serene color schemes that remind us of clear <strong>blue</strong> skies over broad expanses of water. To design a successful monochromatic color combination, use a paint chip for guidance. Select your desired navy <strong>blue</strong> color first (which will likely be the darkest shade on the swatch), then incorporate lighter tints of the color throughout the space. Depending on your shade of navy, muted, dusty-<strong>blue</strong> shades or true <strong>blue</strong> hues can create attractive compositions. For a more tropical look, choose green-tinted colors, such as aqua and turquoise, to pair with navy <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue is a classic color and it’s one of the most popular color families. When mixed with gray, it creates the perfect balance of color and neutral. A <strong>blue</strong> gray paint color is the perfect storm of colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most people would say that gray does not match with navy <strong>blue</strong>, but it can depend on the shade of gray and navy <strong>blue</strong>. If you have a dark gray and a dark navy <strong>blue</strong>, then they may match well together. If you have a light gray and a light navy <strong>blue</strong>, then they may also match well together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The first recorded use of gray as a color name in the English language was in 700. Gray is an achromatic color, a color without hue, like white and black. A chromatic gray is a gray color in which the red, green, and <strong>blue</strong> codes are not exactly equal, but are close to each other, which is why it appears to be a shade of gray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Since <strong>blue</strong> and gray are both cool colors, the combo can make interior spaces feel cold and uninviting in a hurry; unless, of course, you pair the duo with a warmer accent, such as wood. In this bathroom by Raili Clasen, light wood cabinets sandwich a light gray floating sink. Blue details — like the flooring, faucet, and even the trim on the pendant light — add an unexpected and fun pop to an otherwise serious color scheme, as well as complement the <strong>blue</strong> undertones that are oftentimes found in gray. &ldquo;In this case, we used <strong>blue</strong> as our accent color because it does not clash with the solid gray.&rdquo; explains Clasen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you use <strong>blue</strong> and gray by themselves, you’ll have more options for designs. Gray goes with almost any color, especially vibrant colors like red, purple, pink, or yellow. Adding brightly colored furniture items to an otherwise neutral room can make the space more interesting. Blue also works with most colors, including pink, green, red, purple, or pink. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Mahogany wood is rich and very deep in color, which some people might think would be too over the top if used with navy <strong>blue</strong>. However, mahogany hardwood floors also carry a beautiful red hue that contrasts well with the navy <strong>blue</strong> color. Used correctly with other complementary and contrasting colors, navy <strong>blue</strong> and mahogany can make your space look intimate and warm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So for somewhat of a similar reason as the light <strong>blue</strong> shirt, this color is appropriate for wearing to school or work because it’s also pretty understated. But unlike the light <strong>blue</strong> shirt, you can only wear it when it’s appropriate to wear such outfits hence the “light.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s easy to worry when you run out of paint, but if you need more gray or <strong>blue</strong>, you may be able to make it from scratch. Gray is made by using an equal amount of black and white. If you want a darker gray, add more black, but if you want a lighter version, extra white is needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue and gray might sound like a dark pairing, but that&rsquo;s not always the case, as proven by Studio Ashby in this bedroom. Here, the cream-colored walls and carpet set a warm and inviting tone while a gray headboard and <strong>charcoal</strong> nightstands add depth. A dark <strong>blue</strong> throw and orange pillow liven up the sleepy scheme without taking it over, and sleek brass pendants add a luxurious note. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After taking a peek at some street style inspiration, we&rsquo;ve realized it doesn&rsquo;t matter.

Here are a few great navy outfit ideas to prove it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Navy <strong>blue</strong> has a distinct color that instantly takes precedence every time this color is incorporated. However, in the world of paints and interior design, navy <strong>blue</strong> has varying degrees of darkness and lightness, which you can all use for your space. Some navy <strong>blue</strong> shades are a tad lighter than the standard navy <strong>blue</strong>, while some are a lot darker, nearly close to black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you add white to a color, you’ll create a tint, which is a lighter version of a color. The more white you add, the paler your <strong>blue</strong>-gray will look. Starting out with a lighter gray or <strong>blue</strong> can also give you a lighter end result. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A classic combination, navy <strong>blue</strong> and white, goes well together because of the colors&rsquo; neutral profile. This combination is simple and elegant, and it features a really classic feel in any room with this pairing. With a navy <strong>blue</strong> and white color combination, you&rsquo;ll have a palette that can carry other accents and a multitude of furniture that fits well with the scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Red can be paired with neutral colors like white or black quite easily.

It depends on where you are headed and what your personal preference is, but here’s a list with a little bit of everything. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When using navy <strong>blue</strong> for your interiors, you can choose to use it either as your wall color or as the base for your furniture color.

Whereas, North Star has a touch more <strong>blue</strong> in it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When choosing a specific gray shade for your room&rsquo;s color palette, you should start by choosing a tone of color. Warm grays are slightly tinted with either orange, yellow, or red, making them appear a bit cozier—they may even look almost beige. Cooler-toned grays have been cut with shades of <strong>blue</strong>, green, or purple. The resulting gray hue feels clean, crisp, and modern.

Colours to avoid: Bright red, bright yellow. Try to steer clear of any super bright or neon colours that can overwhelm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grays are not typically used as hardwood floors, but more recent modern interior design enthusiasts are leaning towards this neutral color.
