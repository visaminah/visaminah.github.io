In a previous project we used a really cool mauve floor tile as one of our modern bathroom ideas to offset the soft grey tones found in the veins of the marble. Of course, a pale mauve or lilac also looks equally fresh, crisp, and clean, when paired with a neutral shade of white or cool-undertone shade of cream.” - Source: Internet Dark purple also works well with bright or dark colors that contrast with it. Dark yellows often pair well with dark purple, as do bright reds. You can also pair dark purple with blue tones, drawing out the cool tones in purple. - Source: Internet The light purple color is associated with femininity and spirituality. It has a calming effect. This is one reason it’s often used in marketing beauty products. - Source: Internet Like the smiling monkey symbol in this logo, the bright yellow used is full of energy and delight. The almost-black shade of grey, popular within the entertainment industry (especially nightclubs), has an air of mystery and intrigue. Black and yellow are two colors that go really nicely together. - Source: Internet Neutrals are almost always a safe bet for matching purple clothing. You’ll still want to pay attention to the tone of purple you are wearing, but most white, beige, gray, and even some black clothes will make good purple outfits. The only neutral to be cautious with is brown, which can be tricky to coordinate. - Source: Internet Dubbed “millennial purple”, the powdery pastel palette of lilac and lavender had taken over the styles of many celebrities. They wore it monochrome or matched it with whites, creams, pinks, blues, and black. Valentino’s spring/summer collection saw a lilac frilled and feathered mini dress with an asymmetrical neckline. Prada came out with a lilac embroidered skirt paired with a soft and subtle grey shade. Alberta Ferretti and Gucci sent purple regal gowns down the catwalk. - Source: Internet Sitting on the color spectrum between blue and red, purple is historically associated with royalty and rarity. In recent times, designers have rediscovered purple’s more intriguing and creative affiliations with spirituality, mystery and originality. From Byzantine emperors to the lyrics of a Prince song, purple has a diverse and fascinating cultural history, and its mystique and drama continue to inspire designers today. - Source: Internet In dressing up, it’s never limited to black and white. There are always in-betweens, so you can always explore the style that is comfortable and good for you. Experiment with colors and you might discover a new color combination that might work very well with your aesthetic. - Source: Internet Burgundy and navy is a classic color combination that exudes class and sophistication. Both colors are warm and rich, with plenty of contrast for visual interest in an outfit or a room painted in a light, neutral color. It is also a combo commonly used for fall weddings. - Source: Internet When choosing accessories for a purple dress, you’ll first want to consider the occasion. If you’re wearing the dress to a wedding, you’ll want to steer clear of any white accessories since white is considered off-limits to anyone but the bride. You may also want to avoid black since many brides consider that bad luck on their wedding day. - Source: Internet You’ll also want to pay attention to the undertones of the greens and purples you mix. Pairing a warm-tone green like an olive green won’t work with a blue-toned purple like periwinkle. Stick to colors that are both cool or both warm to make good combinations. - Source: Internet With medium skin tones, a deeper shade of blue purple can look good. With olive skin tone, pastel periwinkle adds contrast and dimension. Light brown skin tones can go for electric shades of periwinkle. - Source: Internet Beige is the ultimate neutral color and works well with certain shades of purple. It pairs best with any purples that have earthy tones, such as shades of plum, mauve, and even certain shades of lavender. Beige often works best when paired with light shades of purple. You’ll commonly see a light lavender blouse paired with a beige pantsuit or skirt for a classy office look. A beige overcoat would also pair well with a light purple ensemble, especially if you accessorize it with a beige handbag to match. - Source: Internet You will often see pairings of bright pink with bright purple for a high-intensity look. This combination has been especially popular recently, as fashion trends from the 1980s and 1990s have risen in popularity again.

Take inspiration from these sets of pairs and allow the room for further decorations that will make your spaces go a notch above. - Source: Internet Bright Purple is a regal color. It makes things look luxurious and wealthy. There is something about Purple and royalty – it is more associated with wealth, and power than any other color. You must have noticed that Queen Elizabeth wears a purple-colored suit (different, ofcourse) every now and then for her official functions?. This website has the explanation for it. - Source: Internet The color purple exudes mystery. It is a rich and mysterious color. It has a lot of shades that range from light to dark and it is set to cater to the designer and the wearer’s message and sense of style. - Source: Internet Why is purple divisive? Perhaps in part because purple has long been associated with ambiguity, mystery, and magic. Treading the line between aggressive red and restrained blue, purple occupies a cryptic middle ground. While light purple can evoke feelings of romance and nostalgia, darker purples can feel gloomier, moodier, and provoke feelings of sadness and frustration. - Source: Internet To find the colors and exact hex codes that go with purple, use our color combinations tool.

However, applying it right and with creativity will surely help in elevating your overall look. Purple lipstick with a velvety and purple dress will look very classy and sophisticated with a whip of mystery and even magic. - Source: Internet When it comes to matching colors, many designers and artists turn to the color wheel and basic color theory for choosing coordinating options. The color wheel contains all of the main colors of the rainbow, ranging from shades of red to shades of purple. By looking at the colors next to the color, you wish to match and the colors across from it, you should be able to choose colors that pair well. - Source: Internet Triadic color combinations are rich and vibrant color combinations. Use the triadic color theory if you’re looking for a dynamic three-color palette. Simply draw a triangle on the color wheel and you’ll hit three colors that are evenly spaced out. - Source: Internet Why does purple have a longstanding connection with royalty? It is because the pigments required to make the color purple were, for many centuries, difficult to source, meaning only the very wealthiest were able to afford purple fashion or interior decor. Flash forward to current home trends, and you will find that purple is now more widely affordable, and as a result, popular. Color theory experts like to use it to add a note of richness to decor. - Source: Internet Purple is fun to wear year-round and pairs well with many different colors.

Speaking particularly of lilac, one of - if not the - most popular tone of pale purple. “Soft pastel tones such as ‘Hortense’ and ‘Lady Char’s Lilac’ are a gentle and calming pale lilac tone,\" Ruth says. “You can use a pale lilac by itself in a room for a pale and pretty scheme, or, thanks to their powdery pale finish, it’s possible to be a bit more daring and match lilac with a deep plum or aubergine color of purple (such as Adventurer or Grenache) for an impactful yet intimate living room atmosphere.” When you see how striking lilac can look when applied with Ruth’s decor advice (see image above), it is very tempting. - Source: Internet As with light purple, dark purple clothes often go well with neutral colors like white or gray. Beige can be a bit trickier with dark purple but can work if you pair it with a warm-toned purple that has reddish hues. You’ll also want to avoid browns, oranges, and certain shades of red and green with dark purple. - Source: Internet Bride’s maids and groom’s men can wear anything gray and purple to match the groom’s outfit. Their bouquets, bracelets, belts, and shoes should have the same color combinations. The bride can wear a white wedding dress or a traditional gray and purple outfit. - Source: Internet There are many historical sources pointing to purple as an exclusive color for the noble sectors of society. In Japan, it’s associated with the Emperor and the aristocracy. In the 20th century modern monarchs continued to use the color symbolically, such as the British royal family, who chose it for their ceremonial dress and stationery. - Source: Internet This one’s an unconventional color palette, but teal and purple look great together so long as one remains the dominant color. Here, we’ve used a soft lavender to create contrast against a darker background. This color combination is moody and magical. - Source: Internet Purple is one of the most unique and beautiful colors existing in nature.

Both blue and red are accent colors to purple and often pair well with the color. Looking across from purple, its direct opposite shade is yellow, which contrasts well. - Source: Internet Purple and brown clothing combinations are one of the few that rarely seem to work. This is mostly because it is difficult to find tones of purple and brown that work well with each other. Brown tends to be much more warm-toned than most purples are, given that purple has strong influences of blue within it. - Source: Internet Although this color can sometimes be polarizing, people can either love or hate it. It is undeniable that purple is a fun color to play with in terms of clothing. Not only does it exude a distinct mood, but it also allows for combinations and offers a whole different genre of style whenever it is paired. - Source: Internet Gold and purple are the best fall wedding purple color scheme.

People often make the decorating decision that a cool shade of grey will suit a purple room, but often this leads to a room looking too cold and gloomy, especially if it’s already north facing with a cool natural light source, or has no natural light at all.

However, it’s one of the best colors for dressing up or down.

In fact experts say a considered grey shade can go particularly well with a purple hue, allowing for a two-tone color palette to be used to great effect. It’s all about the undertone, and working with the purple tone, not against it. Essentially, to get it right you need to look for a grey which has a warmer and softer characteristic to it. - Source: Internet Black does not always work well with light purple colors, however.

A tan and purple combination will make the purple appear quite striking but also make it appear more elegant than it would with a zany orange, for instance. If the purple you are using is also darker and more of an eggplant, a purple and tan palette begins to appear more rustic and harvest, like a Fall food tableau. - Source: Internet When in doubt, one of the best and simplest way to use purple is to combine it with other bright and vivid hues like mint, bittersweet orange, bright blue, and yellow. A color combination like this is energetic, happy, and quite pop. Similar palettes are commonly applied in design work for children and also for music festival artwork and installations.

In a previous project we used a really cool mauve floor tile as one of our modern bathroom ideas to offset the soft grey tones found in the veins of the marble. Of course, a pale mauve or lilac also looks equally fresh, crisp, and clean, when paired with a neutral shade of white or cool-undertone shade of cream.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dark <strong>purple</strong> also works well with bright or dark <strong>colors</strong> that contrast with it. Dark yellows often pair well with dark <strong>purple</strong>, as do bright reds. You can also pair dark <strong>purple</strong> with blue tones, drawing out the cool tones in <strong>purple</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The light <strong>purple</strong> color is associated with femininity and spirituality. It has a calming effect. This is one reason it’s often used in marketing beauty products. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Like the smiling monkey symbol in this logo, the bright yellow used is full of energy and delight. The almost-black shade of grey, popular within the entertainment industry (especially nightclubs), has an air of mystery and intrigue. Black and yellow are two <strong>colors</strong> that go really nicely together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Neutrals are almost always a safe bet for matching <strong>purple</strong> clothing. You’ll still want to pay attention to the tone of <strong>purple</strong> you are wearing, but most white, beige, gray, and even some black clothes will make good <strong>purple</strong> outfits. The only neutral to be cautious with is brown, which can be tricky to coordinate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dubbed “millennial <strong>purple</strong>”, the powdery pastel palette of lilac and lavender had taken over the styles of many celebrities. They wore it monochrome or matched it with whites, creams, pinks, blues, and black. Valentino’s spring/summer collection saw a lilac frilled and feathered mini dress with an asymmetrical neckline. Prada came out with a lilac embroidered skirt paired with a soft and subtle grey shade. Alberta Ferretti and Gucci sent <strong>purple</strong> regal gowns down the catwalk. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sitting on the color spectrum between blue and red, <strong>purple</strong> is historically associated with royalty and rarity. In recent times, designers have rediscovered <strong>purple</strong>’s more intriguing and creative affiliations with spirituality, mystery and originality. From Byzantine emperors to the lyrics of a Prince song, <strong>purple</strong> has a diverse and fascinating cultural history, and its mystique and drama continue to inspire designers today. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In dressing up, it’s never limited to black and white. There are always in-betweens, so you can always explore the style that is comfortable and good for you. Experiment with <strong>colors</strong> and you might discover a new color combination that might work very well with your aesthetic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Burgundy and navy is a classic color combination that exudes class and sophistication. Both <strong>colors</strong> are warm and rich, with plenty of contrast for visual interest in an outfit or a room painted in a light, neutral color. It is also a combo commonly used for fall weddings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When choosing accessories for a <strong>purple</strong> dress, you’ll first want to consider the occasion. If you’re wearing the dress to a wedding, you’ll want to steer clear of any white accessories since white is considered off-limits to anyone but the bride. You may also want to avoid black since many brides consider that bad luck on their wedding day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You’ll also want to pay attention to the undertones of the greens and <strong>purple</strong>s you mix. Pairing a warm-tone green like an olive green won’t work with a blue-toned <strong>purple</strong> like periwinkle. Stick to <strong>colors</strong> that are both cool or both warm to make good combinations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With medium skin tones, a deeper shade of blue <strong>purple</strong> can look good. With olive skin tone, pastel periwinkle adds contrast and dimension. Light brown skin tones can go for electric shades of periwinkle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Beige is the ultimate neutral color and works well with certain shades of <strong>purple</strong>. It pairs best with any <strong>purple</strong>s that have earthy tones, such as shades of plum, mauve, and even certain shades of lavender. Beige often works best when paired with light shades of <strong>purple</strong>. You’ll commonly see a light lavender blouse paired with a beige pantsuit or skirt for a classy office look. A beige overcoat would also pair well with a light <strong>purple</strong> ensemble, especially if you accessorize it with a beige handbag to match. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You will often see pairings of bright pink with bright <strong>purple</strong> for a high-intensity look. This combination has been especially popular recently, as fashion trends from the 1980s and 1990s have risen in popularity again. Don’t be surprised if you see increasingly bold color combinations hitting your store shelves soon! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A lot has been talked about <strong>purple</strong> alone, let’s discover its combinations and style your home. The next eight combinations given below have been drafted in the vision to bring more color and brightness that is sure to catch many eyes. Take inspiration from these sets of pairs and allow the room for further decorations that will make your spaces go a notch above. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bright Purple is a regal color. It makes things look luxurious and wealthy. There is something about Purple and royalty – it is more associated with wealth, and power than any other color. You must have noticed that Queen Elizabeth wears a <strong>purple</strong>-colored suit (different, ofcourse) every now and then for her official functions?. This website has the explanation for it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The color <strong>purple</strong> exudes mystery. It is a rich and mysterious color. It has a lot of shades that range from light to dark and it is set to cater to the designer and the wearer’s message and sense of style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Why is <strong>purple</strong> divisive? Perhaps in part because <strong>purple</strong> has long been associated with ambiguity, mystery, and magic. Treading the line between aggressive red and restrained blue, <strong>purple</strong> occupies a cryptic middle ground. While light <strong>purple</strong> can evoke feelings of romance and nostalgia, darker <strong>purple</strong>s can feel gloomier, moodier, and provoke feelings of sadness and frustration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To find the <strong>colors</strong> and exact hex codes that go with <strong>purple</strong>, use our color combinations tool. It shows you monochromatic, analogous, triadic, and contrasting color palettes for a variety of <strong>purple</strong> shades. Try a scheme with <strong>purple</strong>, violet, mauve, or lilac. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pale gray is a soft, soothing color with muted tones that are perfect alongside a pale lavender. You can go for gray furniture with a few lavender accents or go all out and paint your walls your favorite pale <strong>purple</strong>. Choose a gray with cool undertones for the best look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The main <strong>colors</strong> you’ll want to avoid are browns, oranges, and certain shades of red and green. These generally won’t pair well with light <strong>purple</strong> unless your outfit already has hints of these <strong>colors</strong> within its fabric. The only exception to this rule is for bright red <strong>colors</strong>, which will often pair well with light <strong>purple</strong> clothing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple makeup can be quite out of the ordinary and daily looks and styles. However, applying it right and with creativity will surely help in elevating your overall look. Purple lipstick with a velvety and <strong>purple</strong> dress will look very classy and sophisticated with a whip of mystery and even magic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to matching <strong>colors</strong>, many designers and artists turn to the color wheel and basic color theory for choosing coordinating options. The color wheel contains all of the main <strong>colors</strong> of the rainbow, ranging from shades of red to shades of <strong>purple</strong>. By looking at the <strong>colors</strong> next to the color, you wish to match and the <strong>colors</strong> across from it, you should be able to choose <strong>colors</strong> that pair well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Triadic color combinations are rich and vibrant color combinations. Use the triadic color theory if you’re looking for a dynamic three-color palette. Simply draw a triangle on the color wheel and you’ll hit three <strong>colors</strong> that are evenly spaced out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Why does <strong>purple</strong> have a longstanding connection with royalty? It is because the pigments required to make the color <strong>purple</strong> were, for many centuries, difficult to source, meaning only the very wealthiest were able to afford <strong>purple</strong> fashion or interior decor. Flash forward to current home trends, and you will find that <strong>purple</strong> is now more widely affordable, and as a result, popular. Color theory experts like to use it to add a note of richness to decor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple is fun to wear year-round and pairs well with many different <strong>colors</strong>. After reading this, you should have plenty of inspiration to draw from as you make your new outfit selections. Keep this guide handy as you shop, and don’t be afraid to make some bold color choices! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ruth Mottershead, creative director of paint brand Little Greene, is an expert in paint and pigment for decor. Speaking particularly of lilac, one of - if not the - most popular tone of pale <strong>purple</strong>. “Soft pastel tones such as ‘Hortense’ and ‘Lady Char’s Lilac’ are a gentle and calming pale lilac tone," Ruth says. &ldquo;You can use a pale lilac by itself in a room for a pale and pretty scheme, or, thanks to their powdery pale finish, it’s possible to be a bit more daring and match lilac with a deep plum or aubergine color of <strong>purple</strong> (such as Adventurer or Grenache) for an impactful yet intimate living room atmosphere.” When you see how striking lilac can look when applied with Ruth’s decor advice (see image above), it is very tempting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As with light <strong>purple</strong>, dark <strong>purple</strong> clothes often go well with neutral <strong>colors</strong> like white or gray. Beige can be a bit trickier with dark <strong>purple</strong> but can work if you pair it with a warm-toned <strong>purple</strong> that has reddish hues.

FedEx: <strong>purple</strong> and orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple works quite well with warm neutrals like tan and taupe and these <strong>colors</strong> really provide the right kind of contrast for <strong>purple</strong> to work in a design. A tan and <strong>purple</strong> combination will make the <strong>purple</strong> appear quite striking but also make it appear more elegant than it would with a zany orange, for instance. If the <strong>purple</strong> you are using is also darker and more of an eggplant, a <strong>purple</strong> and tan palette begins to appear more rustic and harvest, like a Fall food tableau. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When in doubt, one of the best and simplest way to use <strong>purple</strong> is to combine it with other bright and vivid hues like mint, bittersweet orange, bright blue, and yellow.

The look is striking, distinctive and totally modern and if you are looking for a fresh approach to bathroom or kitchen decor then we think this should be on the list of options to consider. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A brick accent wall is a great feature that works well with a ton of <strong>colors</strong>.

You can also pair dark gray clothing with darker <strong>purple</strong> tones for a moody look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re set on trying to find a combination that works, stick to earthy tones. Go for a warm-toned <strong>purple</strong> or mauve paired with a warm, medium brown color. Stick to brown <strong>colors</strong> commonly seen in leather handbags, especially those in a medium to the light color range. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s all about the pigment and the shades that you match together in a decor scheme, and whilst stronger shades of <strong>purple</strong> and green might clash and look somewhat too rich and sickly, paler shades in both the <strong>purple</strong> and green spectrums look rather wonderful together.

This can make dark <strong>purple</strong> <strong>colors</strong> look more intense than they normally would against other color shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A <strong>purple</strong> color goes well with all neutral shades. You can use <strong>purple</strong> accessories to style a neutral trouser suit or a shift dress for a pop of color.

On the car doors, you can hook lavender or lilac bouquets. The machine should also fit the theme if the wedding takes place in a retro style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You’ll want to stick to a pure white color, however. Off-white shades can have yellowish tones, which won’t always work with all shades of <strong>purple</strong>. If you stray into the off-white range, try to pair it with <strong>purple</strong> <strong>colors</strong> with warmer tones – like plum, mauve, or shades with a reddish hue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The two <strong>colors</strong> that make <strong>purple</strong> are red and blue. If you look at a traditional painter’s color wheel, you’ll see that <strong>purple</strong> sits between red and blue.

To ensure that darker shades don’t overwhelm an interior, especially when used on wall or floor tiles, an ombre effect can be a fun and interesting way to add what I call ‘quiet pattern’ and instant visual interest to a space.” Damla says , “You can achieve this by choosing a plain tile, such as our Herringbone tile which is a narrow cement encaustic tile, and building up lines of tiles in varying tones from light to dark either in the same colour or mixing in complementary shades.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We hope that you must have found the inspiration you were looking for in <strong>purple</strong>.

In particular, the color blue emphasizes the cool tones of <strong>purple</strong> clothing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If it’s intelligence, confidence, and trust that you’re after for your logo, try combining blue and turquoise.

Tasteful use of bright <strong>colors</strong> can really make a design pop! Bright teal pairs well with almost any darker, muted color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Match light <strong>purple</strong> with dark <strong>purple</strong> tones to give contrast to your look.

Keep cool-toned <strong>purple</strong>s separate from warm-tone <strong>purple</strong>s since they will look like entirely different <strong>colors</strong> when placed side-by-side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a very royal color palette. Yellow and <strong>purple</strong> are the perfect complementary color scheme, but the gradient here adds a new level of dimension to this logo design.

Very uplifting and perfect for a wellness business! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Combined, teal and coral bring a fun and creative vibe to your logo.

Fashion is expression and an excellent way to express this is through <strong>colors</strong>. Assessing what <strong>colors</strong> belong together is part of the fun process of fashion. What <strong>colors</strong> go with <strong>purple</strong> clothes? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple is made up of red and blue and therefore comes in many different shades with both warm and cool undertones. Your best chance of matching <strong>purple</strong> clothing is to choose <strong>colors</strong> that share the same undertones as the <strong>purple</strong> you have. Stick to warm <strong>colors</strong> with red-toned <strong>purple</strong>s, and use cool <strong>colors</strong> with blue-toned <strong>purple</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple and white are a natural pair when it comes to planning outfits.

This is because as early as the 15th century BC <strong>purple</strong> dye (known as Tyrian <strong>purple</strong>) was sourced from a certain type of mollusk, making it a rare and special color. It was reserved for Roman magistrates, Byzantine emperors and, later, by Roman Catholic bishops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another reason for <strong>purple</strong>’s popularity has been its flexibility. Purple is made through a combination of red and blue and can be created in various tones and intensities. This makes it a color that can be tailored to fit many different styles, skin tones, and seasons – making it a go-to choice for designers all year long. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When in doubt, you can always pair your <strong>purple</strong> clothing with other <strong>purple</strong>s.
