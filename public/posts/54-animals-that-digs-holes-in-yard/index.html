One of the best ways we found that you can avoid holes in the <strong>yard</strong> complements the use of nematodes. Since food is the most likely reason a small animal will get attracted to the <strong>yard</strong>, keep a watch on any food left outside the house for too long, especially at night. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pocket gophers are active during the day and at night. You’ll know you have pocket gophers when you see their mounds (horse-shoe or crescent-shaped when viewed from above), formed when they push the loose dirt to the surface while tunneling. They may cause damage in your <strong>yard</strong> and garden, where they eat garden crops, ornamental plants, shrubs and trees. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another animal troubling to landscapes is the mole.

Moles have an enormous appetites and may eat up to 100 percent of their body weight in a single day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This repellent is called a sonic spike but could give mixed results if the <strong>animals</strong> learn to adjust to the sounds.

An Alabama Extension wildlife specialist offered tips on controlling these <strong>animals</strong> from destroying <strong>yard</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A mole will rarely leave an opening to a hole above the ground. These <strong>animals</strong> feast on grubs plus other soil organisms like earthworms. They tend to dig a tunnel 10” in depth beneath the <strong>yard</strong>’s surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The easy way is to fill the holes with soil to even out the <strong>yard</strong>’s surface once again. Use a shovel and pat the rough places down with the underside to level the <strong>yard</strong>. Check the vicinity of the house to see if the <strong>animals</strong> have dug holes outside the <strong>yard</strong> as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Small rodents like rats, moles, squirrels, voles, and gophers cause small, rounded holes. The holes will differ depending on what animal is the culprit. Listed below are some common reasons you may see holes in your back<strong>yard</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Basically, these small <strong>animals</strong> are drawn in by strong scents, so any rotting food is a bad idea to keep outside while you’re watching over the surroundings.

Scan the <strong>yard</strong> properly for any such things that can bring the <strong>animals</strong> readily to the <strong>yard</strong> at night. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pocket gophers—which some people call “sandy-mounders” or even more creatively, “salamanders”—are secretive mammals that live underground. These <strong>animals</strong> create tunnel systems 6 to 12 inches below the surface, where they eat roots and the fleshy parts of plants. Pocket gophers excavate soil for their tunnel system and mound it into large, asymmetrical, crescent-shaped heaps that are about 10 inches across. While these heaps—a lighter color of soil than the surrounding area—have no visible entrance holes, a plug of soil may be noticeable offset from the center of the mound. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>That’s not all; there are quite a few <strong>animals</strong> who eat grubs that are commonplace even in the most well-tended <strong>yard</strong>.

Foraging armadillos typically create many shallow holes 1–2 inches wide and up to 6 inches deep as they search for invertebrates in the upper layers of soil (Figure 5). Figure 5. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Speaking of foraging, other <strong>animals</strong> hunting for food in your landscape may also be tearing up the ground. Foraging armadillos can leave an impression on your landscape in the way of 1-2 inch wide holes that are up to 6 inches deep. Foraging by wild hogs can cause extensive damage as they create deeper holes and ruts across larger areas; it&rsquo;s hard to mistake the damage done by wild hogs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>, but you have to be sure to .

They are safe to use if you have children or domestic <strong>animals</strong>. Another hi-tech repellent prevents <strong>animals</strong> from coming into the <strong>yard</strong> by emitting frequencies of sound that scare them off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now, most of these <strong>animals</strong> appear in springtime, looking for places to hide. But one of the main reasons they dig through the <strong>yard</strong>s is that they are looking for food. An animal such as a skunk, raccoon, or mole comes back to look for food stored in a location under the <strong>yard</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>, and can also be seen during daylight hours. They will do most of their hunting at night. These <strong>animals</strong> are omnivores which is why they reside so close to humans. They can invade houses in search of food - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pruning and trimming would reduce the volume of the foliage and vegetation. Just safeguard the <strong>yard</strong> from cover areas where rodents can hide easily, should they decide to return. Get a landscape architect to give you a great design, and if you want support for the technical aspects of landscaping. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some holey homes are quite distinctive. For example, if the large hole in your <strong>yard</strong> has a large mound of sandy soil in front of the entrance, you may have a gopher tortoise. The hole made by a gopher tortoise is almost exactly shaped like its shell—more of an oblong circle that is flattened on the bottom then a totally circular hole. Gopher tortoises are a threatened species and both the tortoises and their burrows are protected under state law and must be left alone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you know that the rodents can easily hide under bushy or overgrown vegetation, do not let go of the opportunity to transform the <strong>yard</strong>’s look altogether.

Larger holes that are 6 to 12 inches in diameter and are found near the base of trees, logs, or walls are likely to have been made by a red fox, skunk, armadillo, or coyote. Beyond size you can use other clues like tracks (or even smells) to determine which of these <strong>animals</strong> made your hole. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Do try and remember if you have any low-covering shrubs or piles of wood stacked in the <strong>yard</strong>.

They are more common in spring and fall when soil moisture and temperatures are conducive to earthworm activity. There is usually no hole in the top. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Moles are mostly solitary creatures that spend most of their lives in their underground burrows. You’ll rarely see them, but you will see their raised ridges (aka surface tunnels) and volcano-shaped mounds. Moles have big appetites and can eat 70 to 80 percent of their body weight every day. They feed during the day and night, eating insects, spiders, earthworms and white grubs. Mole burrows may cause damage in your <strong>yard</strong>, disfiguring your lawn, destroying your flowerbeds and tearing up the roots of your grass. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Many people also use household items instead of repellents to solve the pest problem.

Just make sure to put them in the tunnels that have appeared in your <strong>yard</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Putting a fence around your home is a cost-effective way that can keep out pests. Mesh fencing is the best option for homeowners. If the mesh does not work, adding chicken wire around the fence will provide more deterrence. Any fencing used to exclude digging or burrowing <strong>animals</strong> should be buried at least 10 inches into the ground to discourage the animal from digging under the fence. This will make it nearly impossible for <strong>animals</strong> to get through. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>On the other hand, raccoons use their front paws to pull out clumps of sod and then flip them over whenever they can spot any grubs in the ground. Then, you have rabbits. Rabbits tend to burrow into the ground and are also known for digging in the <strong>yard</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The SC Department of Natural Resources (DNR) does not allow the trapping and relocation of trapped <strong>animals</strong> to another location because of animal and human disease considerations, such as rabies. However, if the landowner has a large piece of property, the animal can be released further away from the home on the landowner’s own property. If this is not an option, then the trapped animal must be killed, and then buried or bagged and disposed of in the garbage. There are many brands and sizes of wire cage traps, such as those by Havahart Traps, Comstock Custom Cages, Tomahawk Live Traps, Catch & Release Live Animal Traps, Kage-All Live Cages, JT Eaton Live Animal Cage Traps, and Petrum Humane Animal Trap Cages. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Products for control also can be purchased at local gardening stores.
