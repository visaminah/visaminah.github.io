The contrast makes skin appear porcelain-like and suits green eyes beautifully. - Source: Internet Pastel pink, purple or blue.

You can also opt for a color which has some pink or strawberry undertones. This draws the color out of the complexion without making you look washed-out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The first thing to base your decision on is your skin tone. If you have a cool complexion and blond hair, bright white shirts bring out the best things about your features. Silver jewelry and cool tones like ice <strong>blue</strong> or mint green look shockingly good on you. If you are warm-toned, you should play up the peachiness in your complexion and wear <strong>colors</strong> such as coral, warm red and yellow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Think about where you’ll be going.

First, your eyes are a great indication of your skin tone. If they are <strong>blue</strong> or green, chances are your skin tone is cool. If you find flecks of gold, then your skin tone is warm. Still not sure? Check your wrist: veins that appear <strong>blue</strong> or purple speak of cool undertones; if they appear green, then you most likely have warm undertones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For fair skin with either hazel or <strong>blue</strong> eyes, try a medium ashy brown color. The ash color carries the same properties as platinum or ash blonde, and it’s a perfect complement to a base of cool skin tones with pink or red undertones. If you’re looking for a way to achieve an ashy brown, make sure you or your stylist puts on a toner to lighten the rich tones of the brown color. Ashy brown is very popular now but looks the best on people with fair skin. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When I wear them, it’s like the life has gone out of my face – all the color is gone.

If you want to give Elsa from Frozen a run for her money, go for a bright platinum or white color. This will look fantastic on pale skin with <strong>blue</strong> eyes (like the Disney queen).

Porcelain-skin blondes tend to look better in pastels than anyone else. Reach for soft shades of baby <strong>blue</strong>, minty green, lavender, pale pink, and buttery yellow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This meant that I would look great in “jewel-like” tones like sapphire <strong>blue</strong>, ruby red, and emerald green.

For example, wearing a <strong>blue</strong>-violet top makes <strong>blue</strong> eyes take on a purple hue, whereas a teal shirt brings out the green undertones in <strong>blue</strong> eyes. Steer clear of <strong>blue</strong> eye makeup, though, as this distracts rather than highlights the <strong>blue</strong> of your eyes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The lighter the <strong>blue</strong> color is, the more natural it looks.

The best part? It naturally matches with one of the best items in your closet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Just like your complexion, your shade of blond ranges from cool to warm. Platinum blond is the coolest shade on the spectrum, and rose-gold blond &ndash; a combination of honey, apricot and gold tones &ndash; is one of the warmest. Cool-hued blondes look stunning in true red and almost any shade of <strong>blue</strong>, particularly vibrant electric <strong>blue</strong>. Warmer-toned blondes tend to look best in rich, autumnal <strong>colors</strong> like orange, rust, or deep chocolate brown. Another classic look is an outfit made up of monochromatic neutrals like cream. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pastel <strong>blue</strong> hair is everyone’s number one choice.

My only advice on color would be to hold <strong>colors</strong> up against your face and see how your skin reacts to that color. Have fun and experiment! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to choosing a hair color, we also need to pay attention to the importance of skin tone. Two people could have <strong>blue</strong> eyes and dark hair, but their skin tones can be completely different. One may have skin which is prone to burning in the sun and has a ‘cool’ tinge to it. The other may have skin which tans when exposed to the sun and comes across as warmer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Here’s a final light-meets-dark look that combines a frosty silver top with dark <strong>blue</strong>. The silver blends into <strong>blue</strong> at about eye level, which means the hair is mostly <strong>blue</strong>. The silver on the top provides a healthy amount of contrast and gives this look a style of its own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Neon hair <strong>colors</strong> are sweeping every fashion magazine, and there’s no more vivid hair color than electric <strong>blue</strong>. Especially striking on pale skin tones, this hairstyle works well for anyone who loves to stand out. Amp the look up to 10 with a complementary fuchsia pink or statement neon purple lip. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pale babes know that strawberry, amber and rust are some of the best hair <strong>colors</strong> for light skin. Stars like Jessica Chastain and Emma Stone know how well their cool undertones are complemented by a warm red-like copper shade. You’ll want to mix cool and warm tones in your dye to achieve a creamy color with hints of copper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want hair <strong>colors</strong> for light skin that aren’t in the blonde family, try taking your look to the other end of the color spectrum with a rich espresso shade. Dark brown hair may be too intense for cool-toned skin but it’s ideal for those with warmer or more olive-toned skin. The contrast makes skin appear porcelain-like and suits green eyes beautifully. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pastel pink, purple or <strong>blue</strong>. Again, these pale <strong>colors</strong> work well with pale skin and are perfectly offset by <strong>blue</strong> eyes. If you have warmer tones in your skin, you might find these pastel shades hard to pull off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You simply can&rsquo;t make a blanket statement about what looks good on people with blond hair. Thanks to some serious improvements in hair coloring technology there are a multitude of different shades of blond &ndash; from chic platinum to brilliant gold to warm honey. Aside from your blond tone, there are several factors to take into consideration when choosing <strong>colors</strong> that complement your own unique palette. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol><li>Cool ash blond: When in doubt, look at the color wheel. Opposite medium to dark <strong>blue</strong>, you&rsquo;ll find yellow, which is why cool and neutral ashy hair <strong>colors</strong> look so good with <strong>blue</strong> and gray/violet eyes. Think bronde (brunette + blond), beige and champagne combinations to give your hair some depth and create an overall ashy shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Fair-skinned beauties often choose blonde when it comes to hair color for skin tone. If you’ve got yellow or even olive undertones choose a warm blonde color such as caramel, amber or butterscotch. Ashy blonde can wash olive skin out easily so choose something warm. Chances are, if you have light-colored eyes such as light <strong>blue</strong>, green, light hazel, or golden brown, then a warm blonde is for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=5><li>CLEAR: Dark medium brown to black hair. Very light or medium skin tone. Bright eye colours (green, <strong>blue</strong> or hazel) or dark brown (This one is MEEEE). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>For a darker look, draw inspiration from the beautiful Megan Fox. Her warm skin tone and amazing <strong>blue</strong> eyes work well with any number of hair <strong>colors</strong>, but she consistently chooses a deep brown with warm, lighter brown highlights. This gives the style a bit of body and dimension rather than being one color all over. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before dyeing your bleached hair light <strong>blue</strong>, you need to make sure that your hair is squeaky clean. Any buildup can cause the color to be distributed unevenly. The best way to get your hair clean is to purchase a special pre-color shampoo. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A midnight <strong>blue</strong> hair color shade is the perfect way to add a creative twist to dark hair. A dark <strong>blue</strong> hair shade is a <strong>blue</strong> color so rich that it has touches of black and purple. Avoid black clothes if you choose a dark <strong>blue</strong> hair color shade, and keep your look bright with yellows and metallic-hued clothes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This light <strong>blue</strong> shade is for those who want to make a superb style statement. It highlights your overall bold look with a brilliant shade of lighter <strong>blue</strong> on top. The goth in you is going to love this hair color more than anything because it creates an ideal contrast between your subtle <strong>blue</strong> hair and dark personality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Not all dark <strong>blue</strong>s are the same. As you’ve seen in this article, there are all kinds of shades of dark <strong>blue</strong>, so that’s something to think carefully about when choosing a color. You don’t need to become a color theory expert. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re into darker shades, consider stealing this idea for your next trip to the hair salon. Dark chocolate with subtle sunkissed highlights can be your best choice if you have skin with warm undertones and gray or <strong>blue</strong> eyes. The soft hints of blonde make this hair look flattering and natural, and add an incredible glow to the face. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fashion <strong>colors</strong> are extremely popular right now and <strong>blue</strong> is a top contender. Blue hair lets you have a lot of freedom due to the variety of shades that you can choose from when going <strong>blue</strong>. This hair color also fades great and can last an extremely long time. When it comes to choosing a <strong>blue</strong> color for your hair, you can have a lot of fun with the color and your style. If you want to style your hair different and need a bigger change, <strong>blue</strong> is a great option to go with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you don’t want to be a blonde, you always have the option of going over to the dark side. One of the most amazing hair <strong>colors</strong> for those with <strong>blue</strong> eyes, fair skin, and a cool skin tone is jet black. This dramatic hair change is very striking. Follow in the footsteps of Alexis Bledel, Katy Perry and Zooey Deschanel with this show-stopping style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to go for a striking redhead look, opt for shades that have the same amount of warmth in them. If your skin gets freckly in the sun, a gentle cinnamon shade could enhance your skin and make those <strong>blue</strong> eyes pop. If you’re quite pale with warm undertones, choose a rich coppery red. If your skin is darker, go for a bright popping red, like Rihanna, whose lighter eyes look fantastic with such a contrasting style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Light <strong>blue</strong> ombre looks especially fantastic when you mix different shades of <strong>blue</strong>. You can add a few purple strands to improve the look even further. Keep the darker color on top and lighter on the bottom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=4><li>Cinnamon brown: Imagine rich, warm brown with a hint of coppery shine where the light hits. Cinnamon brown looks stunning with <strong>blue</strong> eyes and pale skin, and you can customize how strong you want the copper to show through. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>A short haircut is ideal to show off <strong>blue</strong> hair color. Dye the shoulder-length bob cut with bangs in a pastel <strong>blue</strong> shade with subtle darker patches in between. The electric green temples spice up this brisk look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Having <strong>blue</strong> eyes and fair skin means there’s a good chance that you have pink, <strong>blue</strong> or purple undertones in your skin. This doesn’t mean that you have pink or purple skin. It just means that you have ‘cool’ undertones. If you turn over your wrist, you’ll probably see <strong>blue</strong> and purple veins, whereas someone with warmer skin might see green veins. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Not everyone wants to keep their hair within the natural shades most people are born with. If you’re looking for a playful color but have pale skin, avoid deep jewel tones that will look too harsh on pale skin. Unicorn <strong>colors</strong> in pastels will suit fair skin best. Lavender tones are ideal for warm skin tones and light rose complement cool skin tones in a beautiful, dramatic way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=http://www.prettydesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Beautiful-High-Ponytail-for-Purple-Hair.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="What Colors Look Good With Blue Hair - what colors look good with brown hair blue eyes">
