To find out, test the wood by pouring some water on a shady spot of your deck and seeing how long it takes to soak in. If the water disappears in less than 5 minutes, the wood is ready for a new coat. If a finish seems to be fading too quickly, use a stain with more pigment. - Source: Internet It depends on the type.

A more opaque finish will usually need to be reapplied more often. A clear stain will allow the wood’s natural color to shine, while tinted supplies just a bit of color. Semitransparent stain supplies color the wood and can also add a more consistent finish.

Stairs have much more traffic than railings, for example, so they might need a more durable seal or require restaining more often. Remember that all decks need to be regularly cleaned, and any finish will require periodic upkeep and re-application. - Source: Internet You can safeguard wood in one of two ways: either with paint, which seals it under an opaque film, or, perhaps better, with exterior stain. The beauty of stain is that it’s easy to apply, resistant to peeling, and brings out wood’s texture or grain. But stain comes in a bewildering number of types. Some are as clear as bourbon; others are as milky as paint. Some form a film on top of the wood; others leave behind nothing but a hint of surface color. - Source: Internet If it’s bare, chose whichever stain you want. But if it has a film finish, it’s easiest to stick with that; penetrating stains can’t go over a film. Also, water-based stains will cover oil-based ones, but not the other way around. - Source: Internet Lap marks can be prevented by staining continuous lengths. This method prevents the front edge of the stained area from drying before a logical stopping place is reached. Working in the shade is desirable because the drying rate is slower. Stain that has been applied by spray, without back-brushing, is prone to show blotchy patterns as it weathers. - Source: Internet Poolside deck got that cedar stain treatment 😎 pic.twitter.com/YF39k5bfQ3 — jerry.

Problem is, the solvents in most oil-based stains contain VOCs, which pollute the air and are unhealthy to breathe. - Source: Internet You have the option to apply semi-transparent stains by brush, spray, pad, or roller. Brushing will usually give the best penetration and performance. Spray or roller application followed by back-brushing is also an acceptable method of application. Oil-based stains are generally thin and runny, so application can be messy. - Source: Internet Shown: A knock-out deck starts with great wood—in this case, clear redwood protected with a burgundy-tinted penetrating stain.

Staining Cedar is useful to prevent the wood from greying and weathering due to UV rays, moisture, mildew, and other climate changes. - Source: Internet Weathering stains and bleaching oils are refinished the same way as the semi-transparent oil based penetrating stains. Semi-transparent latex stains act more like very thin paints and may require more extensive surface preparation (scraping, sanding, etc.) before being refinished. Care should be taken not to build-up the film thickness by recoating too frequently. Manufacturers’ instructions should be followed carefully. - Source: Internet Basically it’s a lightly pigmented, semitransparent oil-based stain that contains a special bleaching agent.

Excessive scraping and sanding are not usually required. Simply use a stiff bristle (non-metallic) brush to remove all surface dirt, dust, and loose wood fibers. Following proper cleaning to kill mildew contamination, apply a new coat of stain. The second coat of penetrating stain often lasts longer than the first coat because more can be applied as it penetrates into small surface checks. - Source: Internet Most any stain made for decking can also be used on siding.

Choosing the wrong color or material, however, could turn your deck into a distraction as well as a maintenance nightmare. The ideal deck color scheme will depend on a variety of factors, including your home&rsquo;s existing color palette and exterior features, as well as the deck&rsquo;s level of use. Use these tips on choosing deck colors to select the paint, <strong>stain</strong>, or material that works best for your lifestyle and your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Really pleased with #armstrongclark products!

To find out, test the wood by pouring some water on a shady spot of your deck and seeing how long it takes to soak in. If the water disappears in less than 5 minutes, the wood is ready for a new coat. If a finish seems to be fading too quickly, use a <strong>stain</strong> with more pigment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It depends on the type. Those with more pigment last the longest: up to 7 years for a solid-color <strong>stain</strong>. Clear toners, which have the least amount of pigment, need to be reapplied annually. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After 20 minutes, mop up any <strong>stain</strong> that hasn&rsquo;t penetrated. To avoid spontaneous combustion, put <strong>stain</strong>-soaked rags in a sealed can filled with water. Dispose of the container at a hazardous-waste center. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A bold trim color can highlight a house&rsquo;s best features.

Step back and view it from different angles and at different times of the day to see how it looks. You can also find some retailers that allow you to try out the color virtually using an online tool. Keep in mind that some deck materials might impact the deck color. Wood decking, for example, sometimes has a tint that influences how a particular <strong>stain</strong> color looks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>These are my favorite kind of decks to wash and <strong>stain</strong>!

A more opaque finish will usually need to be reapplied more often. A clear <strong>stain</strong> will allow the wood&rsquo;s natural color to shine, while tinted supplies just a bit of color. Semitransparent <strong>stain</strong> supplies color the wood and can also add a more consistent finish. A solid <strong>stain</strong> will allow very little of the wood&rsquo;s own color to show through. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dip one end of a <strong>stain</strong> application pad in the <strong>cedar</strong> color <strong>stain</strong> and apply it to a test board, says Family Handyman . If the <strong>stain</strong> matches, apply it in even strokes to the surface of the pine item. Protect flooring with drop cloths. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Waterborne acrylic <strong>stain</strong>s stand up best to the sun. Oil <strong>stain</strong>s penetrate deeply, even in tropical hardwoods. New, hybrid blends do both and are low in VOCs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Has less pigment than a solid-color <strong>stain</strong>, so it only partially obscures the wood&rsquo;s grain. Leaves no surface film; can&rsquo;t peel. Recoat every 2 to 4 years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Your deck colors should be a cohesive part of your home&rsquo;s exterior color scheme. To help guide your choice of paint or <strong>stain</strong> colors, consider the existing shades on your siding, trim, and other exterior elements. You can pull out one of the hues used elsewhere on the facade for your deck or select an accent color that blends with your home&rsquo;s style. If you&rsquo;re updating your home&rsquo;s exterior as well as the deck, be sure to include deck colors when deciding on your new overall color palette. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The wood particles in wood-and-plastic composite decking are just as vulnerable to the sun as solid wood and will turn dingy over time. Specialized semitransparent <strong>stain</strong>s for composites allow you to restore or change the color of weatherbeaten decking. These last a year or two. You can also use a standard solid-color acrylic deck finish and get 3 to 5 years of service. High-traffic areas may need more frequent attention. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Choose a decorating style. Some styles are suited for wood, including country, colonial or rustic designs. If you’ve always dreamed of a secluded cabin or hunting lodge, play up your <strong>cedar</strong> wood. If you want a sleeker, more modern style, downplay your <strong>cedar</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>From a distance, this Craftsman-influenced house looks painted, but closer inspection reveals a penetrating semitransparent <strong>stain</strong> on its <strong>cedar</strong> clapboards.

Stairs have much more traffic than railings, for example, so they might need a more durable seal or require re<strong>stain</strong>ing more often. Remember that all decks need to be regularly cleaned, and any finish will require periodic upkeep and re-application. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can safeguard wood in one of two ways: either with paint, which seals it under an opaque film, or, perhaps better, with exterior <strong>stain</strong>. The beauty of <strong>stain</strong> is that it’s easy to apply, resistant to peeling, and brings out wood’s texture or grain. But <strong>stain</strong> comes in a bewildering number of types. Some are as clear as bourbon; others are as milky as paint. Some form a film on top of the wood; others leave behind nothing but a hint of surface color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If it&rsquo;s bare, chose whichever <strong>stain</strong> you want. But if it has a film finish, it&rsquo;s easiest to stick with that; penetrating <strong>stain</strong>s can&rsquo;t go over a film. Also, water-based <strong>stain</strong>s will cover oil-based ones, but not the other way around. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Lap marks can be prevented by <strong>stain</strong>ing continuous lengths. This method prevents the front edge of the <strong>stain</strong>ed area from drying before a logical stopping place is reached. Working in the shade is desirable because the drying rate is slower. Stain that has been applied by spray, without back-brushing, is prone to show blotchy patterns as it weathers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Poolside deck got that <strong>cedar</strong> <strong>stain</strong> treatment 😎 pic.twitter.com/YF39k5bfQ3 — jerry.

We translate the confusing labels, show you some of the many places <strong>stain</strong>s are used, and offer tips on how to apply and maintain a finish for maximum durability. Once you make your choice and lay it on, you can rest easy, knowing that your wood is taken care of. Well, at least until next spring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The amount of flexibility you have with your deck colors depends on the material. Wood and composite decking, for example, can be painted or <strong>stain</strong>ed in a wide variety of colors. You can also <strong>stain</strong> decks made of concrete, but brick pavers are generally static in color. If you want the ability to easily change your deck colors when desired, wood decks typically offer the most options for paint and <strong>stain</strong> colors and the simplest application. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>O&rsquo;Neil favors a thick, 4- to 6-inch block <strong>stain</strong> brush, like the one here, which gives him better control than a sprayer. To prevent lap marks, work on only two or three boards or courses at a time and go from one end to the other. If spraying or rolling on the finish, always go back and brush the surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Just finished <strong>stain</strong>ing the <strong>cedar</strong> on my deck.

Stains are packed with solvents to ensure that their resins and pigments penetrate wood fibers. Problem is, the solvents in most oil-based <strong>stain</strong>s contain VOCs, which pollute the air and are unhealthy to breathe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You have the option to apply semi-transparent <strong>stain</strong>s by brush, spray, pad, or roller. Brushing will usually give the best penetration and performance. Spray or roller application followed by back-brushing is also an acceptable method of application. Oil-based <strong>stain</strong>s are generally thin and runny, so application can be messy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Shown: A knock-out deck starts with great wood—in this case, clear redwood protected with a burgundy-tinted penetrating <strong>stain</strong>.

Wolman DuraStain Semi-Transparent in Chestnut Brown, similar to shown; wolman.com - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Waterborne resins dry faster than oils, so you can get out on your deck sooner. But greater care is required during application to prevent lap marks; brush the finish on no more than two boards at a time, and be sure to cover their lengths in one pass. Also, <strong>stain</strong>s should be applied in the shade when surface temperatures are above 50 degrees. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Staining a wood gazebo can be a daunting task, but by following this simple “how to <strong>stain</strong> a gazebo” guide you are sure to be tackling the project in no time.

Here are the quick and easy steps you can take to get your summer garden looking fabulous. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cedar is an excellent wood for <strong>stain</strong>ing. It takes <strong>stain</strong> so well. Staining Cedar is useful to prevent the wood from greying and weathering due to UV rays, moisture, mildew, and other climate changes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Weathering <strong>stain</strong>s and bleaching oils are refinished the same way as the semi-transparent oil based penetrating <strong>stain</strong>s. Semi-transparent latex <strong>stain</strong>s act more like very thin paints and may require more extensive surface preparation (scraping, sanding, etc.) before being refinished. Care should be taken not to build-up the film thickness by recoating too frequently. Manufacturers’ instructions should be followed carefully. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Basically it&rsquo;s a lightly pigmented, semitransparent oil-based <strong>stain</strong> that contains a special bleaching agent. Once it&rsquo;s brushed onto new, uncoated softwood siding, such as <strong>cedar</strong>, fir, or cypress, the surface changes to a light gray in about 6 months to a year. Recoat every 3 to 5 years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Even rot-resistant <strong>cedar</strong> tables and chairs can benefit from a <strong>stain</strong> to repel water.

Excessive scraping and sanding are not usually required. Simply use a stiff bristle (non-metallic) brush to remove all surface dirt, dust, and loose wood fibers. Following proper cleaning to kill mildew contamination, apply a new coat of <strong>stain</strong>. The second coat of penetrating <strong>stain</strong> often lasts longer than the first coat because more can be applied as it penetrates into small surface checks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most any <strong>stain</strong> made for decking can also be used on siding. Plus, it&rsquo;ll last longer than the same finish on a deck because vertical surfaces take less of a beating.
