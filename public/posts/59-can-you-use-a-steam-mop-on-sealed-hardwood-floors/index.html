When wood gets into contact with water, much damage can occur. For example, the hardwood floor can be warped when water enters a woody surface. - Source: Internet Heels can easily scratch hardwood floors and may even dent them, depending on the type of heel. Your best bet is to leave the heels off. In fact, we recommend taking all shoes off inside. - Source: Internet Unlike traditional mops, steam mops don’t require you to repeatedly dunk their pads in a bucket of water. They carry their water inside a reservoir which is heated into steam and sent into the mop’s pad. The steam then soaks the pad and effectively cleans the floor. The hot steam loosens dirt and stubborn grime, kills germs and provides you with an effective chemical-free sanitizing system. - Source: Internet Simply lift up the mop head again and reheat with a burst of steam. Just a very, very, tiny little burst is all you need; If you get the cloth too wet, it loses friction against the floor and will not work as well. When the cloth becomes too wet or too dirty, just change it out for a fresh one. - Source: Internet Even engineered hardwood floors that are factory finished and sealed, there is a chance that during the process of laying the floor the fitter may leave very small gaps between the boards where steam can penetrate. It can get directly to the sub base of the finished wood laminate layer. This will often be constructed of a material less resistant than the sealed surface wood to repelling any moisture or steam. - Source: Internet Nothing cleans dirty, grimy floors faster and better than a high-quality steam mop. The steam penetrates and loosens the dirt with incredible ease, leaving your floor perfectly clean and sanitized. In fact, here’s a full list of floors you can use a steam mop on. - Source: Internet Melissa Witulski, the business operations manager for Merry Maids, suggests quick regular cleanings a couple times per week to keep your floors from getting too dirty. “The best way to clean hardwood floors is to use a microfiber dust mop to remove dust, dirt, and whatever other particles were brought into your home,” Witulski says. “The microfiber dust mop will not scratch your floors as some vacuums might.” - Source: Internet Hardwood floors bring a warm, traditional aesthetic to interior space, whether they are weathered, reclaimed materials or brand new wood. However, they require special cleaning to ensure they look their best and prevent damage or stains. Steam mops are excellent tools for gently and thoroughly maintaining your hardwood floor. - Source: Internet IS VINEGAR SAFE FOR CLEANING HARDWOOD FLOORS? Not with hardwood floors. Contrary to common advice, you should never use diluted vinegar or ammonia to clean polyurethane. The acid can etch the finish, making it dull. You will probably not notice this after the first couple washes using vinegar but the acid will slowly eat away at your hardwood floor finish over time. You won’t notice until the damage is already done. - Source: Internet The trick to getting floors beautifully streak-free with a steam mop is to keep the floor cloth as clean and dry as possible. That is why it’s so important to choose a model that allows you to easily change the cloths. (It’s also important to mop in the direction of the grain, regardless of how you clean them.) - Source: Internet Using steam mops on wood floors is a trend nowadays as it can kill germs, eliminate pet odours, make your floors cleaner and look like new again. This is because of the heat it releases during the cleaning process. Using steam mops on wood floors is also safer since you only clean using water instead of harsh chemicals. - Source: Internet This is not a problem with efficiency but with general floor maintenance. Because excessive moisture might harm some surfaces, steam mops should only be used on sealed floors. Moisture might build up in the pad and damage the floor surface. - Source: Internet Combine 2 cups warm water and 1/4 cup distilled white vinegar. Dip a soft-bristled toothbrush in the solution and shake until just damp. Gently scrub the cracks and then wipe away the debris with a soft cloth or vacuum it up with a handheld vac or a vacuum with a crevice tool. Dust mop and clean the floor as usual. - Source: Internet By the way, one sales rep said the Monster steam mop kills dust mites, so you’re encouraged to use it on your mattress and fabric furniture. I look forward to trying it on my mattress next. Again, I might add a few spritzes of essential oil spray to the mattress surface first for even better deodorizing. - Source: Internet With everything in place, it’s time to start. With your steam mop set to the absolute lowest steam pressure, sweep the floor with smooth even strokes. Do not spend too much time in one area and definitely don’t allow the mop to stand still in one spot. - Source: Internet It’s been over 5 years now. I’m very happy with the Bona spray mop itself and the Bona hardwood floor cleaner. My floors look great! - Source: Internet Hardwood floor cleaning when undertaken should be approached with caution, any excess of water or steam may cause damage to the floor. Manufactures warranties will normally specify a maintenance regime for the cleaning and treatment of the floor. So be cautious if that regime does not approve the use of steam mops as the warranty could be void. - Source: Internet It has a stainless steel boiler (1,200w pressurized boiler) that creates a drier steam for faster — and drier — cleaning. Most steam mops work by dripping water onto a hot plate. The Monster steam mop works more like a cappuccino machine with a boiler inside. - Source: Internet Though engineered hardwood floors appear to be robust on the surface, they are still bonded using adhesives. Steam cleaning can compromise the quality of those adhesives. Moisture can seep between the layers, deteriorating the connection and causing irreversible damage to the flooring. That is why it is imperative to avoid using steam mops on engineered hardwood floors. - Source: Internet The best steam mop for hardwood floors is the Dupray NEAT™ Steam Cleaner which can be set to much lower steam pressure. This results in a very gentle amount of minimal steam being produced. Just enough to do an excellent job at steam cleaning your wood flooring without the extreme risk of permanent damage. - Source: Internet A steam cleaner utilises water heated to a scalding vapour to clean and sanitise a floor’s surface. Several firms provide steam cleaning equipment that claims to be capable of safely cleaning hardwood floors. These claims are made because these cleaners include a feature that sweeps up extra moisture as it goes around the floor, absorbing the water and allegedly leaving the floor dry. - Source: Internet The presence of steam creates a particular difficulty with hardwood. Water is a relatively thick liquid. On the other hand, steam is exceptionally light and thin, and it can readily enter even hairline cracks on a surface. This enables it to travel along the sides of hardwood boards or up from beneath. As the vapour cools and condenses back into liquid water, moisture is left behind, damaging wood fibers. - Source: Internet Consider how much hardwood flooring you need to clean. If you have to maintain an especially large space, a bigger water reservoir will allow you to mop for longer and requires less refills. However, large water tanks make steam mops heavier, which may not be ideal for some users. - Source: Internet The width of the attachment is important. The wider it is, the more evenly the heat and steam are distributed, resulting in a much safer cleaning experience. A good steam mop will have a broad floor attachment that can sweep a large area at once while still being able to swivel in-and-out of tight corners. - Source: Internet Everyone wants an easier way to clean without giving up cleanliness. It’s no wonder why people ask if wood floors can be steam cleaned, it’s certainly easier than scrubbing with wood oil or moping around the house. Not every way of cleaning is best for everything in the house. Using a glass cleaner to scrub the tub doesn’t make the most sense, right? So, is it the best idea to use a steam cleaner on hardwood floors? - Source: Internet in order to use the Monster on a regular basis. (With the Bona, I have to buy a refill cartridge of the hardwood floor cleaner every few months.) I like how the Monster cleaning pads can be cleaned in the washing machine . That’s super convenient. (The Bona cleaning pads can be washed 300 times!) - Source: Internet More on finishing. Where the hardwood floor finishing is the thinnest is also where most dirt would be. See, it’s worn because of all the foot traffic and hence the mess. So steam cleaning these areas does more damage as you’ll be trying harder to get rid of the dirt. - Source: Internet Refinishing a hardwood floor involves sanding it down to the fresh wood and re-coating it with sealer. It’s an expensive, messy project that requires the skill and expertise of a professional — or very handy handyperson. In general, a hardwood floor can be refinished four to six times over its lifespan. - Source: Internet Once you’ve determined that the floor surface is safe, you may proceed to clean it with your steam cleaner. Attach a mop pad to the foot of the steam cleaner, fill the water reservoir, and turn it on as directed by the manufacturer. As you wash, keep the steam mop moving, and don’t let it sit in one area for too long. - Source: Internet Steam mops come in various configurations. Some work as portable steamers for deep cleaning other surfaces or areas of the home. This feature is handy for some, but adds little for those who only need a cleaner for their hardwood floors. - Source: Internet It is essential to vacuum the floor before steaming. If you don’t have a vacuum, you can sweep, but high suction power will take lint, dust, and other surface particles from the crevices, keeping them from dirtying the mop pad. After vacuuming, your floor is ready for a steam mop. - Source: Internet But I’ve often been asked about — and wondered myself about — using steam to clean hardwood floors. Mostly because it’s generally a safer, greener, kid-friendly way to clean. (Who doesn’t want “sanitized” floors?) - Source: Internet Steam mops generate too much moisture for laminate flooring, typically built with compacted fibre layers. The steam might cause the product to bulge and deform. Laminate floors are resilient, inexpensive, and popular. However, they do necessitate some upkeep to keep them looking their best. - Source: Internet When I’m using my canister steam cleaners, I like to attach two cloths to the mop head. I wrap one all the way around the mop head and attach the other cloth only at the front of the mop head. That way, when I lift up the mop head and trigger the steam, only the cloth wrapped around the mop head gets wet while the cloth that hangs free on the top stays dry. - Source: Internet Damage the sub-flooring. Steam penetrates through finishing and so can warp the sub-flooring along with the hardwood. That’s double the trouble while getting doubly clean. - Source: Internet The steam exits simultaneously from 2 tanks — with jets on the bottom of the mop shooting steam through the cleaning pad (automatically), as well as jets on the sides of the mop shooting steam above the pad directly onto the floor’s surface (whenever you pull the trigger). The down-shooting jets are automatically activated as soon as you pull the handle away from the default upright position. Releasing the handle immediately shuts the steam stream off. Another independent set of forward-shooting steam jets are activated when you pull the trigger button on the handle. This angle is perfect for cleaning along the baseboards and in hard-to-reach corners. - Source: Internet If you use a steam mop and are getting streaks once the floor is dry, consider changing your laundry detergent or using less of it. Another culprit is if your floor cloths are too wet. Remember, the wetter the cloth, the more friction you lose and the worse it works. - Source: Internet Drip a tiny amount of water onto the surface of your hardwood floor to evaluate the thickness and longevity of the seal. If the water beads up instantly, the seal is intact, and the floor cannot be breached. However, if the water spreads out or sinks into the wood that must mean that the seal has been damaged and must be reapplied. - Source: Internet Steam is water. Water damaged hardwood floors. It can warp it, cause rot, and a host of other issues. While having sealed hardwood floors can help, you’re still blowing very hot water at an organic material that responds to it in a negative way. - Source: Internet There are different types of hardwood floors. These hardwood floorings include laminate, sealed hardwood, unsealed hardwood and wood grain vinyl flooring. From the above hardwood flooring, the unsealed hardwood is the only one that cannot be steam cleaned. However, you can steam clean the rest without any degradation on the floor surface when you steam properly. - Source: Internet If you want to double-check if your hardwood floor is safe for steam cleaning, make sure it is acid cured or has aluminum oxide, water-based polyurethane, oil-based polyurethane or moisture-cured urethane finish. If your hardwood floor has a penetrating oil sealer, it is worth noting that steam cleaning will degrade the floor over time, and you will be forced to re-touch it frequently to avoid the effects of steam cleaning. However, you can use the best steam mop for laminate floors to achieve a glossy finish. - Source: Internet Ceramic and porcelain tile floors can be cleaned using a steam mop. The steam mop will clean the tile surfaces. These tiles can be cleaned safely with a steam mop without causing permanent damage since they are put on a mortar and concrete board surface. - Source: Internet Scuff marks. Try to rub it out first with your finger. Many scuff marks will disappear. An eraser may also remove shallow marks on most hardwood floors. Be sure to test it on a hidden area first. - Source: Internet It’s best to steam clean hardwood floors with as little moisture as possible. Make sure you find a steam mop that allows you to adjust the steam output so you can control exposure. Too much steam can result in excess water on your floor, which may cause damage if it sits for an extended period. Some steam mops come in multiple configurations, with one configuration offering for more steam settings than another. Whenever possible, choose the unit that allows you the most flexibility. - Source: Internet Warranties. If you have a warranty on your hardwood floor, be sure it allows for using steam cleaning. Not all of them do because of the issues noted above. They won’t come in for a free resurfacing if you’re the one who steamed it away. - Source: Internet A. Some hardwood manufacturers do not recommend using a steam mop to clean their flooring, even going so far as to state that doing so will void the warranty. However, many homeowners swear by the results, and you can find many models that are marketed specifically for hardwood surfaces. As long as your floor is sealed and you do not saturate the surface with excess water, steam mops are safe for periodic use. - Source: Internet A. Some steam mops allow you to add scented liquid to their water tanks. However, you should skip any soap or additives when it comes to cleaning hardwood floors as this can impact the sealant. It’s best to only use fresh, clean water. - Source: Internet Steam mops often leave excess water on the floor surface. If water is left to penetrate a wood floor it can result in the grain rising, expanding and splitting or worse the wood warping completely out of shape. The danger of the steam also finding its way into the grain of the wood during cleaning is also high. - Source: Internet Even if the paint layer is sealed, steam cleaning over a painted surface is dangerous. The heat from the steam might cause bubbles beneath the paint to form, which can cause it to peel. Steam mopping should be avoided on all painted floor surfaces. - Source: Internet Some mops excel in cleaning one type of floor material but fall short on others. For example, steam mops that feature rigid bristles work best on textured surfaces or tiled floors with grout, which can trap dirt and grime. If you’re cleaning hardwood floors, select a steam mop with soft cleaning pads as opposed to a model with abrasive brushes or pads. Too much abrasion can remove its protective sealant and result in a dull appearance. - Source: Internet Not all hardwood floors are sealed with polyurethanes or varnishes. In fact a large amount of modern engineered wood floors that are sold today are just as likely to be finished in oil or a mixture of oils and waxes. This gives the finished wood floor a more natural appearance and allows the texture of the wood to be appreciated rather than being sealed in. - Source: Internet I mean, liquid cleaners can literally seep in between the floor boards too. So even if your hardwood floors are sealed (mine are) and/or the floor boards begin to gap in some areas due to changes in the home’s moisture levels at different times of the year (like mine do), then you would technically have the same moisture issues as when using steam. Right? - Source: Internet Older wood floors and poorly installed hardwood can have cracks between the boards that trap dirt and dust. The cracks can worsen during periods of low humidity when the wood dries out. Removing the dirt and debris that becomes trapped is easy but a bit time-consuming. Clean in small sections, starting at the far corner of the room and working your way out the door, so you can come back to where you left off if you can’t do the entire room at once. - Source: Internet If you want to use a steam mop, be sure that your hardwood floors are well-sealed with no worn spots in the finish. Set the mop to the lowest temperature setting and do not create “steam bursts” as you work. Never leave the mop in one spot for too long. - Source: Internet Hardwood floors sealed with a polyurethane coating or varnish should be able to withstand surface moisture better than an unfinished floor. Some manufactures will advise that using steam mops on a low setting is safe. However seal does wear over time and even small areas of damage can cause a break in the surface protection. If water or steam gets into these exposed areas it will absorb into the wood underneath the seal and will not be able to dry adequately due to the surface above being sealed. This may cause staining or discoloration as well as forcing the wood to expand and further open up the seal. - Source: Internet Whether laminate or engineered hardwood floors, remember that they are more delicate than real hardwood. It’s the top layer that is the strongest, once you get past that it’ll suffer the same fate as real woods. If you have laminate or engineered hardwood flooring, it’s best to stay away from steam cleaning. The damage will happen much faster. - Source: Internet Once a month (or more often if necessary), wood floors should be mopped to deep-clean the wood and make them shine. Residue from many commercial floor cleaners, however, can make wood floors look dull. To make wood floors shiny without leaving a film, the answer is vinegar. - Source: Internet What you’ll love: The pivoting design makes it easy to navigate around furniture. Its dual spinning pads gently clean and polish your floor. It comes in two models, with one providing two steam settings and the other offering three settings. This mop features a generous 22-foot power cord. - Source: Internet A. Clean your reusable steam mop pads after every use. Some models require hand washing while others are machine-wash friendly.

When wood gets into contact with water, much damage can occur. For example, the <strong>hardwood</strong> floor can be warped when water enters a woody surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Heels can easily scratch <strong>hardwood</strong> floors and may even dent them, depending on the type of heel. Your best bet is to leave the heels off. In fact, we recommend taking all shoes off inside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Unlike traditional <strong>mop</strong>s, steam <strong>mop</strong>s don’t require you to repeatedly dunk their pads in a bucket of water. They carry their water inside a reservoir which is heated into steam and sent into the <strong>mop</strong>’s pad. The steam then soaks the pad and effectively cleans the floor. The hot steam loosens dirt and stubborn grime, kills germs and provides you with an effective chemical-free sanitizing system. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Simply lift up the <strong>mop</strong> head again and reheat with a burst of steam. Just a very, very, tiny little burst is all you need; If you get the cloth too wet, it loses friction against the floor and will not work as well. When the cloth becomes too wet or too dirty, just change it out for a fresh one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Even engineered <strong>hardwood</strong> floors that are factory finished and sealed, there is a chance that during the process of laying the floor the fitter may leave very small gaps between the boards where steam can penetrate. It can get directly to the sub base of the finished wood laminate layer. This will often be constructed of a material less resistant than the sealed surface wood to repelling any moisture or steam. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Nothing cleans dirty, grimy floors faster and better than a high-quality steam <strong>mop</strong>. The steam penetrates and loosens the dirt with incredible ease, leaving your floor perfectly clean and sanitized. In fact, here’s a full list of floors you can use a steam <strong>mop</strong> on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Melissa Witulski, the business operations manager for Merry Maids, suggests quick regular cleanings a couple times per week to keep your floors from getting too dirty. &ldquo;The best way to clean <strong>hardwood</strong> floors is to use a microfiber dust <strong>mop</strong> to remove dust, dirt, and whatever other particles were brought into your home,&rdquo; Witulski says. &ldquo;The microfiber dust <strong>mop</strong> will not scratch your floors as some vacuums might.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hardwood floors bring a warm, traditional aesthetic to interior space, whether they are weathered, reclaimed materials or brand new wood. However, they require special cleaning to ensure they look their best and prevent damage or stains. Steam <strong>mop</strong>s are excellent tools for gently and thoroughly maintaining your <strong>hardwood</strong> floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>IS VINEGAR SAFE FOR CLEANING HARDWOOD FLOORS? Not with <strong>hardwood</strong> floors. Contrary to common advice, you should never use diluted vinegar or ammonia to clean polyurethane. The acid can etch the finish, making it dull. You will probably not notice this after the first couple washes using vinegar but the acid will slowly eat away at your <strong>hardwood</strong> floor finish over time. You won’t notice until the damage is already done. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The trick to getting floors beautifully streak-free with a steam <strong>mop</strong> is to keep the floor cloth as clean and dry as possible. That is why it&rsquo;s so important to choose a model that allows you to easily change the cloths. (It&rsquo;s also important to <strong>mop</strong> in the direction of the grain, regardless of how you clean them.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Using steam <strong>mop</strong>s on wood floors is a trend nowadays as it can kill germs, eliminate pet odours, make your floors cleaner and look like new again. This is because of the heat it releases during the cleaning process. Using steam <strong>mop</strong>s on wood floors is also safer since you only clean using water instead of harsh chemicals. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is not a problem with efficiency but with general floor maintenance. Because excessive moisture might harm some surfaces, steam <strong>mop</strong>s should only be used on sealed floors. Moisture might build up in the pad and damage the floor surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Combine 2 cups warm water and 1/4 cup distilled white vinegar. Dip a soft-bristled toothbrush in the solution and shake until just damp. Gently scrub the cracks and then wipe away the debris with a soft cloth or vacuum it up with a handheld vac or a vacuum with a crevice tool. Dust <strong>mop</strong> and clean the floor as usual. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>By the way, one sales rep said the Monster steam <strong>mop</strong> kills dust mites, so you’re encouraged to use it on your mattress and fabric furniture. I look forward to trying it on my mattress next. Again, I might add a few spritzes of essential oil spray to the mattress surface first for even better deodorizing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With everything in place, it’s time to start. With your steam <strong>mop</strong> set to the absolute lowest steam pressure, sweep the floor with smooth even strokes. Do not spend too much time in one area and definitely don’t allow the <strong>mop</strong> to stand still in one spot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s been over 5 years now. I’m very happy with the Bona spray <strong>mop</strong> itself and the Bona <strong>hardwood</strong> floor cleaner. My floors look great! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hardwood floor cleaning when undertaken should be approached with caution, any excess of water or steam may cause damage to the floor. Manufactures warranties will normally specify a maintenance regime for the cleaning and treatment of the floor. So be cautious if that regime does not approve the use of steam <strong>mop</strong>s as the warranty could be void. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It has a stainless steel boiler (1,200w pressurized boiler) that creates a drier steam for faster — and drier — cleaning. Most steam <strong>mop</strong>s work by dripping water onto a hot plate. The Monster steam <strong>mop</strong> works more like a cappuccino machine with a boiler inside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Though engineered <strong>hardwood</strong> floors appear to be robust on the surface, they are still bonded using adhesives. Steam cleaning can compromise the quality of those adhesives. Moisture can seep between the layers, deteriorating the connection and causing irreversible damage to the flooring. That is why it is imperative to avoid using steam <strong>mop</strong>s on engineered <strong>hardwood</strong> floors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best steam <strong>mop</strong> for <strong>hardwood</strong> floors is the Dupray NEAT™ Steam Cleaner which can be set to much lower steam pressure. This results in a very gentle amount of minimal steam being produced. Just enough to do an excellent job at steam cleaning your wood flooring without the extreme risk of permanent damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A steam cleaner utilises water heated to a scalding vapour to clean and sanitise a floor’s surface. Several firms provide steam cleaning equipment that claims to be capable of safely cleaning <strong>hardwood</strong> floors. These claims are made because these cleaners include a feature that sweeps up extra moisture as it goes around the floor, absorbing the water and allegedly leaving the floor dry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The presence of steam creates a particular difficulty with <strong>hardwood</strong>. Water is a relatively thick liquid. On the other hand, steam is exceptionally light and thin, and it can readily enter even hairline cracks on a surface. This enables it to travel along the sides of <strong>hardwood</strong> boards or up from beneath. As the vapour cools and condenses back into liquid water, moisture is left behind, damaging wood fibers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Consider how much <strong>hardwood</strong> flooring you need to clean. If you have to maintain an especially large space, a bigger water reservoir will allow you to <strong>mop</strong> for longer and requires less refills. However, large water tanks make steam <strong>mop</strong>s heavier, which may not be ideal for some users. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The width of the attachment is important. The wider it is, the more evenly the heat and steam are distributed, resulting in a much safer cleaning experience. A good steam <strong>mop</strong> will have a broad floor attachment that can sweep a large area at once while still being able to swivel in-and-out of tight corners. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Everyone wants an easier way to clean without giving up cleanliness. It&rsquo;s no wonder why people ask if wood floors can be steam cleaned, it&rsquo;s certainly easier than scrubbing with wood oil or <strong>mop</strong>ing around the house. Not every way of cleaning is best for everything in the house. Using a glass cleaner to scrub the tub doesn&rsquo;t make the most sense, right? So, is it the best idea to use a steam cleaner on <strong>hardwood</strong> floors? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>in order to use the Monster on a regular basis. (With the Bona, I have to buy a refill cartridge of the <strong>hardwood</strong> floor cleaner every few months.) I like how the Monster cleaning pads can be cleaned in the washing machine . That’s super convenient. (The Bona cleaning pads can be washed 300 times!) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>More on finishing. Where the <strong>hardwood</strong> floor finishing is the thinnest is also where most dirt would be. See, it&rsquo;s worn because of all the foot traffic and hence the mess. So steam cleaning these areas does more damage as you&rsquo;ll be trying harder to get rid of the dirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Refinishing a <strong>hardwood</strong> floor involves sanding it down to the fresh wood and re-coating it with sealer. It’s an expensive, messy project that requires the skill and expertise of a professional — or very handy handyperson. In general, a <strong>hardwood</strong> floor can be refinished four to six times over its lifespan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once you’ve determined that the floor surface is safe, you may proceed to clean it with your steam cleaner. Attach a <strong>mop</strong> pad to the foot of the steam cleaner, fill the water reservoir, and turn it on as directed by the manufacturer. As you wash, keep the steam <strong>mop</strong> moving, and don’t let it sit in one area for too long. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Steam <strong>mop</strong>s come in various configurations. Some work as portable steamers for deep cleaning other surfaces or areas of the home. This feature is handy for some, but adds little for those who only need a cleaner for their <strong>hardwood</strong> floors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It is essential to vacuum the floor before steaming. If you don’t have a vacuum, you can sweep, but high suction power will take lint, dust, and other surface particles from the crevices, keeping them from dirtying the <strong>mop</strong> pad. After vacuuming, your floor is ready for a steam <strong>mop</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But I’ve often been asked about — and wondered myself about — using steam to clean <strong>hardwood</strong> floors. Mostly because it’s generally a safer, greener, kid-friendly way to clean. (Who doesn’t want “sanitized” floors?) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Steam <strong>mop</strong>s generate too much moisture for laminate flooring, typically built with compacted fibre layers. The steam might cause the product to bulge and deform. Laminate floors are resilient, inexpensive, and popular. However, they do necessitate some upkeep to keep them looking their best. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When I&rsquo;m using my canister steam cleaners, I like to attach two cloths to the <strong>mop</strong> head. I wrap one all the way around the <strong>mop</strong> head and attach the other cloth only at the front of the <strong>mop</strong> head. That way, when I lift up the <strong>mop</strong> head and trigger the steam, only the cloth wrapped around the <strong>mop</strong> head gets wet while the cloth that hangs free on the top stays dry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Damage the sub-flooring. Steam penetrates through finishing and so can warp the sub-flooring along with the <strong>hardwood</strong>. That&rsquo;s double the trouble while getting doubly clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The steam exits simultaneously from 2 tanks — with jets on the bottom of the <strong>mop</strong> shooting steam through the cleaning pad (automatically), as well as jets on the sides of the <strong>mop</strong> shooting steam above the pad directly onto the floor’s surface (whenever you pull the trigger). The down-shooting jets are automatically activated as soon as you pull the handle away from the default upright position. Releasing the handle immediately shuts the steam stream off. Another independent set of forward-shooting steam jets are activated when you pull the trigger button on the handle. This angle is perfect for cleaning along the baseboards and in hard-to-reach corners. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you use a steam <strong>mop</strong> and are getting streaks once the floor is dry, consider changing your laundry detergent or using less of it. Another culprit is if your floor cloths are too wet. Remember, the wetter the cloth, the more friction you lose and the worse it works. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Drip a tiny amount of water onto the surface of your <strong>hardwood</strong> floor to evaluate the thickness and longevity of the seal. If the water beads up instantly, the seal is intact, and the floor cannot be breached. However, if the water spreads out or sinks into the wood that must mean that the seal has been damaged and must be reapplied. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Steam is water. Water damaged <strong>hardwood</strong> floors. It can warp it, cause rot, and a host of other issues. While having sealed <strong>hardwood</strong> floors can help, you&rsquo;re still blowing very hot water at an organic material that responds to it in a negative way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are different types of <strong>hardwood</strong> floors. These <strong>hardwood</strong> floorings include laminate, sealed <strong>hardwood</strong>, unsealed <strong>hardwood</strong> and wood grain vinyl flooring. From the above <strong>hardwood</strong> flooring, the unsealed <strong>hardwood</strong> is the only one that cannot be steam cleaned. However, you can steam clean the rest without any degradation on the floor surface when you steam properly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to double-check if your <strong>hardwood</strong> floor is safe for steam cleaning, make sure it is acid cured or has aluminum oxide, water-based polyurethane, oil-based polyurethane or moisture-cured urethane finish. If your <strong>hardwood</strong> floor has a penetrating oil sealer, it is worth noting that steam cleaning will degrade the floor over time, and you will be forced to re-touch it frequently to avoid the effects of steam cleaning. However, you can use the best steam <strong>mop</strong> for laminate floors to achieve a glossy finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ceramic and porcelain tile floors can be cleaned using a steam <strong>mop</strong>. The steam <strong>mop</strong> will clean the tile surfaces. These tiles can be cleaned safely with a steam <strong>mop</strong> without causing permanent damage since they are put on a mortar and concrete board surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Scuff marks. Try to rub it out first with your finger. Many scuff marks will disappear. An eraser may also remove shallow marks on most <strong>hardwood</strong> floors. Be sure to test it on a hidden area first. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s best to steam clean <strong>hardwood</strong> floors with as little moisture as possible. Make sure you find a steam <strong>mop</strong> that allows you to adjust the steam output so you can control exposure. Too much steam can result in excess water on your floor, which may cause damage if it sits for an extended period. Some steam <strong>mop</strong>s come in multiple configurations, with one configuration offering for more steam settings than another. Whenever possible, choose the unit that allows you the most flexibility. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Warranties. If you have a warranty on your <strong>hardwood</strong> floor, be sure it allows for using steam cleaning. Not all of them do because of the issues noted above. They won&rsquo;t come in for a free resurfacing if you&rsquo;re the one who steamed it away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A. Some <strong>hardwood</strong> manufacturers do not recommend using a steam <strong>mop</strong> to clean their flooring, even going so far as to state that doing so will void the warranty. However, many homeowners swear by the results, and you can find many models that are marketed specifically for <strong>hardwood</strong> surfaces. As long as your floor is sealed and you do not saturate the surface with excess water, steam <strong>mop</strong>s are safe for periodic use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A. Some steam <strong>mop</strong>s allow you to add scented liquid to their water tanks. However, you should skip any soap or additives when it comes to cleaning <strong>hardwood</strong> floors as this can impact the sealant. It’s best to only use fresh, clean water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Steam <strong>mop</strong>s often leave excess water on the floor surface. If water is left to penetrate a wood floor it can result in the grain rising, expanding and splitting or worse the wood warping completely out of shape. The danger of the steam also finding its way into the grain of the wood during cleaning is also high. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Even if the paint layer is sealed, steam cleaning over a painted surface is dangerous. The heat from the steam might cause bubbles beneath the paint to form, which can cause it to peel. Steam <strong>mop</strong>ping should be avoided on all painted floor surfaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some <strong>mop</strong>s excel in cleaning one type of floor material but fall short on others. For example, steam <strong>mop</strong>s that feature rigid bristles work best on textured surfaces or tiled floors with grout, which can trap dirt and grime. If you’re cleaning <strong>hardwood</strong> floors, select a steam <strong>mop</strong> with soft cleaning pads as opposed to a model with abrasive brushes or pads. Too much abrasion can remove its protective sealant and result in a dull appearance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Not all <strong>hardwood</strong> floors are sealed with polyurethanes or varnishes. In fact a large amount of modern engineered wood floors that are sold today are just as likely to be finished in oil or a mixture of oils and waxes. This gives the finished wood floor a more natural appearance and allows the texture of the wood to be appreciated rather than being sealed in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I mean, liquid cleaners can literally seep in between the floor boards too. So even if your <strong>hardwood</strong> floors are sealed (mine are) and/or the floor boards begin to gap in some areas due to changes in the home’s moisture levels at different times of the year (like mine do), then you would technically have the same moisture issues as when using steam. Right? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Older wood floors and poorly installed <strong>hardwood</strong> can have cracks between the boards that trap dirt and dust. The cracks can worsen during periods of low humidity when the wood dries out. Removing the dirt and debris that becomes trapped is easy but a bit time-consuming. Clean in small sections, starting at the far corner of the room and working your way out the door, so you can come back to where you left off if you can&rsquo;t do the entire room at once. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to use a steam <strong>mop</strong>, be sure that your <strong>hardwood</strong> floors are well-sealed with no worn spots in the finish. Set the <strong>mop</strong> to the lowest temperature setting and do not create &ldquo;steam bursts&rdquo; as you work. Never leave the <strong>mop</strong> in one spot for too long. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hardwood floors sealed with a polyurethane coating or varnish should be able to withstand surface moisture better than an unfinished floor. Some manufactures will advise that using steam <strong>mop</strong>s on a low setting is safe. However seal does wear over time and even small areas of damage can cause a break in the surface protection. If water or steam gets into these exposed areas it will absorb into the wood underneath the seal and will not be able to dry adequately due to the surface above being sealed. This may cause staining or discoloration as well as forcing the wood to expand and further open up the seal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Whether laminate or engineered <strong>hardwood</strong> floors, remember that they are more delicate than real <strong>hardwood</strong>. It&rsquo;s the top layer that is the strongest, once you get past that it&rsquo;ll suffer the same fate as real woods. If you have laminate or engineered <strong>hardwood</strong> flooring, it&rsquo;s best to stay away from steam cleaning. The damage will happen much faster. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once a month (or more often if necessary), wood floors should be <strong>mop</strong>ped to deep-clean the wood and make them shine. Residue from many commercial floor cleaners, however, can make wood floors look dull. To make wood floors shiny without leaving a film, the answer is vinegar. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What you’ll love: The pivoting design makes it easy to navigate around furniture. Its dual spinning pads gently clean and polish your floor. It comes in two models, with one providing two steam settings and the other offering three settings. This <strong>mop</strong> features a generous 22-foot power cord. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A. Clean your reusable steam <strong>mop</strong> pads after every use. Some models require hand washing while others are machine-wash friendly. Either way, thoroughly rinse your pads to remove any traces of soap and allow them to dry before your next use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://res.cloudinary.com/sharkninja-na/image/upload/v1622652034/SharkUS/WebCollage/Hardfloor/S7001/S7001_WEBSN_ISH_PDP3.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Can You Use A Steam Mop On Sealed Hardwood Floors - How To Clean Hardwood Floor">
