It’s also reversible, with a black side and a white side, so it can probably match your decor wherever you mount it. - Source: Internet Arguably this long-range TV antenna’s biggest strength is its two TV-compatibility, In terms of installation, it does need to be mounted 30 feet above the best results. However, it also includes an adjustable angle mounting bracket that works well for exterior walls in case users cannot get that high. For simpler installation indoors, you might also want to consider the best indoor TV antenna. - Source: Internet Mohu is another favored brand of our for indoor antenna products. They make high-powered, compact antennas that are great fits for apartments, living rooms, dorms, and similar indoor spots. This 65-mile antenna showcases some of Mohu’s best work. Don’t let the basic rectangle design fool you; this UHF/Hi-VHF multi-directional antenna has a wide range, is fully ready for 4K signals, and includes a compact amplifier to help improve signal strength.

As you move the antenna around a room, every six seconds it gives you an update on the number of channels you can receive. In every location we tried, using the app to position the antenna helped the Flatwave Amped Pro rank either first or second in the number of channels received. The amp is USB-powered, the antenna is reversible with black and white sides, and you get a generous amount of cable. However, the cable isn’t detachable, and the Flatwave Amped Pro is usually about twice the price of typical amplified flat antennas. - Source: Internet This long-range TV antenna works very well, starting with a UHF/VHF signal-equipped range with a built-in rotor and full 360-degree coverage to get the best signal. Its rotor is even capable of turning in opposite directions to help prevent tangled cables. 1080p HDTV reception allows for tons of over the air content from ABS, PBS, NBC, and other popular channels without paying for a cable subscription. - Source: Internet Indoor antennas need to be mounted fairly close to your TV. And while putting it out of sight behind the TV would be ideal, this doesn’t always translate to getting the best reception. In other words, you may end up with an antenna hanging on your wall in plain view. Make sure the one you select isn’t something you’d hate looking at every day! Many antennas are simple flat squares that can be painted over, which helps a lot in this situation. - Source: Internet The reason you need one of these antennas is that you probably live a long way from the nearest tower. But knowing exactly how much distance there is between you and the closest tower is good to know before you buy an antenna. The Tablo tool will give you an overhead map view of the nearest broadcast towers in your area. - Source: Internet In terms of installation, this long-range TV HDTV antenna runs about the baseline. It requires connecting front, middle and rear sections using screws and wingnuts – a more involved process than a pre-assembled antenna with snap-on mechanisms. If you are OK with a more involved installation, its 100-mile range and excellent signal reception will most likely compensate for it. - Source: Internet Finding out that a certain channel you wanted isn’t available in your area can make you think twice about getting a TV antenna. Make sure you do your due diligence to understand what channels are available. There are several online tools like rabbitears.info that can help you with this. - Source: Internet We like the fact this long-range antenna offers a simplified and lighter weight design. It only uses a rotating head and short antennas as opposed to the longer tree-branch style antennas in its class. full HD (1080P), ultra HD (4K) quality really comes out crisp with little static in strong signal areas. - Source: Internet This selection is the best antenna for getting HDTV reception in rural areas. It supports 720p, 1080i, and 1080p and is rated to receive signals from towers up to 150 miles away. The antenna has a UHF working frequency between 470 and 890 MHz and a VHF working frequency between 30 and 400 MHz. It also has a high gain rating of 32 dB and comes with 33-feet of HD antenna coaxial cable. - Source: Internet In terms of installation, no other long-range antenna we’ve researched comes close. Simply attach a mast clamp and coaxing cable before extending all of its parts open before mounting on a rooftop or outdoor. It’s almost as easy as installing some of the highest rated indoor tv antennas. The free RCA Signal Finder app is also very intuitive with a simple address entry to find nearby channels and select stations. - Source: Internet Antennas Direct DB8e 8-Element Bowtie Attic/Outdoor HDTV Antenna $159.99 at Antennas Direct See It (Opens in a new window) The decidedly retro-looking Antennas Direct DB8e 8-Element Bowtie Antenna is actually a very powerful multidirectional outdoor antenna. It features two panels, each with four elements and a reflector, that can be angled toward clusters of nearby stations to get the best results. It’s still a multidirectional antenna, but a big one you can aim to get even better reception from over 70 miles away. - Source: Internet Our preference is for long-range TV antennas to have a minimum range of 60 miles. In general, opt for a higher range in rural areas and a reduced range in urban areas, which are typically closer to broadcast towers. All long-range TV antennas should offer UHF and high VHF reception for a wider variety of content. - Source: Internet Suitable for attic or outdoor mounting Cons Plastic mounting bracket feels a little cheap Best Prices Today: The Winegard Elite 7550 immediately impressed with its ability to pick up more broadcast channels than the competition at higher signal levels. It has a built-in amplifier and performed well on both VHF-High and UHF broadcast bands. Because of its size you’ll want this one in the attic or outside of your house. Read our full Winegard Elite 7550 review Antennas Direct Clearstream 4 Max — Best attic/outdoor TV antenna, runner-up Pros Good reception of strong to medium level signals on UHF and VHF-High - Source: Internet The most important consideration when choosing an antenna is range. In other words, how far away can the antenna be from a broadcast tower and still pick up the signal? For the most part, anything 50 miles and up will be more than enough, and even 35 miles should work, unless you live in a very rural area. Any distance below that, you’ll want to make sure there’s a tower close by, or you may have problems getting a good signal. - Source: Internet Antennas Direct ClearStream Flex Amplified UHF/VHF Indoor HDTV Antenna $61.07 at Amazon See It (Opens in a new window) The ClearStream Flex is pricier than the ClearStream Eclipse, and larger. Thanks to its bigger size and included amplifier, this indoor antenna sports a much longer 50-plus-mile range than the Eclipse. - Source: Internet Monoprice Active Curved HD5 HDTV Antenna $18.00 at Amazon See It (Opens in a new window) Monoprice remains one of the best-kept secrets for home theater enthusiasts and installers, with reliable and inexpensive antennas, cables, and other A/V equipment.

It’s even paintable, so you can paint it to match your wall or nearby décor. The 12-foot coaxial cable also gives you plenty of options to place the antenna away from your TV. - Source: Internet An antenna is only as good as the materials used in its construction. Because these are outdoor antennas, they need to handle wind, rain, snow, ice, and anything else Mother Nature throws at them. The level of weatherproofing you need, however, depends on your environment. - Source: Internet This best long range TV antenna for rural areas is very well rounded, starting with Ultra HD and ATSC 3.0 support for an improved audio and video picture adhering to the latest broadcast standards. UHF and VHF reception provides a neat variety of content. We like this long-range TV antenna for an attic or mounted outdoors on a rooftop, mountable to a mast. Consider this one of the better antennas on the market. - Source: Internet It’s a bummer when your family camping trip falls on the same dates as a major sporting event. Most RV antennas don’t get great reception in remote locations, so you’ll need to upgrade to catch the game. Here are some options for the best outdoor TV antenna for rural areas. - Source: Internet When considering the best indoor TV antennas, many can solve a number of TV problems in one swipe. They let you cut your cable bill, give you access to local news and sports broadcasts, receive HD or 4K broadcasts totally for free (in the right regions), and typically work with built-in TV tuners straight out of the box. And with today’s indoor antenna designs, there’s no need to mess with complicated outdoor placements: a nearby window or shelf is all you need! - Source: Internet Picks like our Antenna’s Direct antenna have a smaller range at 35 miles, designed primarily for those who live in more urban areas where TV towers tend to have plenty of overlap. This 1byone antenna goes the opposite direction. It has a massive 200-mile range that attempts to pick up signals from as many towers as possible, a much better choice for those living in small towns or more rural areas. - Source: Internet While the antenna is affordable, it’s surprisingly sturdy. The durable plastic makes it virtually indestructible, and the anodized aluminium makes it ultra-weather resistant. You don’t have to worry about it breaking if you live in an area where it rains a lot. - Source: Internet Turn on your meter and tune to the lowest broadcast channel in your area. Now rotate your antenna 360 degrees and stop at the highest signal strength. Use your compass and mark the direction of the highest antenna signal. Rinse and repeat this process for each channel and record the result carefully. - Source: Internet One of our favorite features with this long-range TV HDTV antenna is its dedicated smartphone app, which allows users to check for nearby obstructions using augmented reality using a top-down map view. It is also a very formidable TV signal finder. Augmented reality also includes a satellite pointer to optimize your antenna’s location. It’s a high-end choice for anyone in the market for the best omnidirectional TV antenna. - Source: Internet Kudos for long-range TV antennas with UV and weatherproofing, helping them better respond to the elements. Copper end coaxial cables and surge protection antennas are good to have. Note, despite the most durable long-range TV antennas, signals are highly susceptible to thunderstorms and heavy rain. - Source: Internet Every antenna is rated to receive frequencies in a different range. These frequencies are measured in megahertz. To put it simply, an antenna with a larger frequency range will be able to receive more channels, provided there’s no interference or signal interruptions from competing frequencies. - Source: Internet If you live in an area with hills or forests, you may consider getting an antenna with a built-in amplifier (i.e., a preamplifier). The alternative is to purchase an antenna without an amp first, test its reception, and attach an amp to it later if you’re not satisfied. - Source: Internet The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HDTV Antenna has been our budget pick in this guide for a few years running. It performs almost as well as our top pick; if you’re within about 15 miles of the broadcast antennas, you might not miss any channels with this one. It has an inline amplifier, includes a fairly generous amount of cable, and is relatively compact. The only downsides are that the cable is not detachable and the antenna is not reversible or paintable, so your only color option is black. - Source: Internet One of the best things about it is that its compactness makes it easy to install in the attic, removing the need for you to set it up outdoors. But if you don’t mind the height, you can use the installation kit included in the box to quickly install the antenna. The detailed manual makes things that much easier. - Source: Internet We use a set-top box to scan for channels and record the number of RF channels received by each antenna and their strength. Each RF channel carries a number of digital stations, but the number is different per channel and can change, so digital stations received isn’t as useful a measurement. We scan several times and adjust the direction of the antenna on some rescans. - Source: Internet That being said, reducing interference usually relies on raising the antenna up higher. Generally speaking, mounting your antenna higher will reduce the number of obstacles between it and the broadcast tower you’re trying to receive signal from. Fewer obstacles equals less interference. - Source: Internet Antennas Direct ClearStream Eclipse Indoor HDTV Antenna $29.90 at Amazon See It (Opens in a new window) Antennas Direct is a popular brand with a wide selection of indoor and outdoor antennas. The Eclipse Indoor HDTV Antenna is a simple, flat, disc-shaped antenna with a stick-on design. You can slap it on any smooth surface, like a window, without using tape or any other adhesive. It’s a multidirectional antenna and features a 35-mile range. - Source: Internet In terms of installation, this long-range TV outdoor antenna runs about mid-range. It does not come preassembled, but simple enough to mount in less than five minutes using a wrench and Phillips screwdriver to clamp together with a J mount masty and two U clamps. Kudos for its weatherproof parts which work well in extreme conditions as low as -50 Celsius. It’s certainly one of the best outdoor TV antennas for rugged climates on our list. - Source: Internet Many antennas come with built-in signal amplifiers that increase their effective range by boosting the signal they pick up. This sounds like it should be a great feature to look for, but there are a couple caveats: External power source: Amplified antennas usually require an external power source. With most antennas you just need to connect the coax cable to your TV and you’re set, but antennas with built-in amps also need to be plugged into a power outlet. This can make placement trickier, so keep that in mind. - Source: Internet This long-range TV antenna handles over-the-air broadcast signals very well across all types of frequencies, good for 100 miles of coverage. It picks up popular channels such as FOX, NBC, PBS with ease. Our only criticism is that it takes incoming signals from a single direction and does not include a built-in rotor for 360° of movement, which helps capture signals more efficiently. - Source: Internet Look for the best long-range HDTV TV antennas to carry a minimum 60-mile range. In general, opt for the longest range possible in rural areas sans shorter ranges in urban areas. They should also run VHF and UHF frequencies to get the most channels possible. Built-in amplifiers also work to correct lost signals as a result of cable deterioration and splitting to multiple televisions. Pixelation and dropouts should also be reduced. - Source: Internet Our only criticism is that this best indoor TV antenna offers an up to the 60-mile range and is more susceptible to obstructions such as surrounding buildings and farther distances from broadcast towers. Bonus points for coming in multiple colors and finishes to match rooftop or attic decor, which most long-range TV antennas do not offer. It outperforms even in the best rabbit ear antenna. - Source: Internet This long-range outdoor TV antenna offers a little bit of everything, optimized for indoor attics with excellent VHF and UHF signal reception – good enough for an up to 60-mile range. Free local TV channels such as NBC, ABC, and PBS could be had. Its mounting bracket and mast take less than five minutes to assemble with our preferred snap-on style installation. - Source: Internet Knowing the real channel number will help you select an antenna. TV broadcasting in North America is spread across three frequency bands: VHF-Low (channels 2 through 6), VHF-High (channels 7 through 13), and UHF (channels 14 through 51). Because of the different frequencies in use, antennas are designed to cover one, two, or three bands. Not every antenna covers them all. - Source: Internet This antenna is the best for rural hilly areas because it can be extended to nearly 17 feet tall with its boom length and the additional vertical height of the antenna. It will receive HDTV reception from towers up to 65 miles away and that range can be extended with Winegard’s Boost coupler. The antenna itself is made of zinc-plated steel hardware to improve its resistance to rust and corrosion. - Source: Internet AntennaWeb’s TV station tool categorizes nearby stations based on the sort of outdoor antenna you need to tune in. This is because indoor antennas are highly dependent on the architecture of your home and any sort of structures that can interfere with signals. This doesn’t mean the map is useless for indoor antennas, though; yellow and green stations can be tuned into with small and medium multidirectional antennas mounted outdoors, which means you can probably get a signal from them using an indoor multidirectional antenna. For farther and weaker stations that require directional antennas or a preamp, you’ll need to be able to mount it outside. - Source: Internet Not designed to receive VHF TV stations Best Prices Today: The Antennas Direct DB8e’s reception is just as impressive as its looks. This is a large, heavy antenna cleverly designed to receive weak signals with two antenna arrays, or in areas of better reception to point to towers in different directions. Read our full Antennas Direct DB8e review Antennas Direct 91XG — Best roof-mount TV antenna, runner-up Pros Good reception of weak signals - Source: Internet Excess cable can get messy quick Best Prices Today: This antenna impressed us with its ability to pull in more broadcast channels than the competition. Further, those it did receive were a little stronger than from our runner-up, which should make for happier TV viewing. Read our full Winegard FlatWave Amped (model FL-5500A) review Channel Master Smartenna+ — Best amplified indoor TV antenna, runner-up Pros Automatic tuning to receive the greatest number of channels - Source: Internet Directional antennas are, well, directional. They tend to be shaped like fins, arrows, or tubes, and need to be pointed toward the stations they’re tuned to. This means they need to be adjusted to properly get signals from stations, so you’ll need to plan carefully when mounting them. Their ranges can be much, much farther than multidirectional antennas, though, letting you tune into weaker and more distant stations if the antenna is pointing at them. - Source: Internet Before you start shopping for an antenna, you should check what channels are available near you. AntennaWeb(Opens in a new window) has a helpful tool that lets you enter your location to see where the nearest TV stations are. It even provides a helpful map that shows distance from each station and the type of antenna you need to get a strong signal. Once you know what TV you can get near you, you can figure out the best antenna to buy. - Source: Internet The amplifier of the RCA ANT3ME1 has a built-in signal-level meter that provides a near-instantaneous readout of the signal strength. This feature allows you to quickly find the optimum position for the antenna, a process that could take more than an hour if you instead use the TV’s internal channel-scanning process to evaluate different positions. The ANT3ME1 is essentially the same as our previous runner-up, the RCA ANT3ME, but with a slightly wider antenna design that helped it to perform roughly equal to our top pick before we used the meter. When we used the meter to fine-tune the antenna’s positioning, the ANT3ME1 sometimes outperformed our top pick. But the cable is not detachable, and the amplifier requires an AC outlet rather than USB power. - Source: Internet Once you’ve made your list, examine the Rabbit Ears results to find the channels you want to watch. Write down the number in parenthesis, which is the “real channel,” the “Direction (true),” and the color (green, yellow, or red). The colors will inform you if an indoor antenna will be sufficient, or if you’ll need an attic or roof-mounted model to pull them in. - Source: Internet With this omni-directional digital antenna, you’ll be able to enjoy signal reception from towers up to 150 miles away. It has a built-in antenna for 360-degree reception and a high-gain, low noise amplifier to increase signal strength and reliability. The antenna itself is compact and comes with 33 feet of durable coaxial cable to make installation easier. The entire antenna housing features a UV-resistant, waterproof design that also improves signal reliability on windy and/or rainy days. - Source: Internet This Channel Master antenna can receive a variety of signals from towers up to 100 miles away. It’s a directional antenna with a six-foot turning radius and 30 pounds of wind resistance (tested at wind speeds of 100 mph). It comes with a U-bolt mounting clamp to make installation easier and is designed to handle extreme weather. It’s made of half-inch aluminum elements with bifurcated rivets for added strength. - Source: Internet With a 109-inch boom length, you’ll be able to extend the Channel Master nearly 10 feet above the surface you mount it to. It receives low frequencies between 54 and 216 MHz and high frequencies between 470 and 700 MHz.

The antenna comes with a detachable amplifier that can draw power from your TV’s USB port, as well as a long, detachable cable, which is convenient if you want to replace it with a cable of a different color or length.

It’s reversible, paintable, and generally has a host of placement options, which saves as much space as possible. - Source: Internet Start by getting an antenna signal meter and a compass.

You can also easily mount it anywhere that works, including the back of your TV, a nearby wall, or a window. - Source: Internet Indoor antennas are typically fine for all the strong local channels, but if you want channels that are weaker or further away, you might need to go larger and put an antenna in your attic space or on your roof. For that, we recommend the Antennas Direct DB8e. If you don’t want to climb onto your roof, and you have an attic, the Winegard Elite 7550 can be installed either in your attic or on your roof.

And with today’s indoor <strong>antenna</strong> designs, there’s no need to mess with complicated outdoor placements: a nearby window or shelf is all you need! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Picks like our Antenna’s Direct <strong>antenna</strong> have a smaller range at 35 miles, designed primarily for those who live in more urban areas where TV towers tend to have plenty of overlap. This 1byone <strong>antenna</strong> goes the opposite direction. It has a massive 200-mile range that attempts to pick up signals from as many towers as possible, a much better choice for those living in small towns or more <strong>rural</strong> areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While the <strong>antenna</strong> is affordable, it’s surprisingly sturdy. The durable plastic makes it virtually indestructible, and the anodized aluminium makes it ultra-weather resistant. You don’t have to worry about it breaking if you live in an area where it rains a lot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Turn on your meter and tune to the lowest broadcast channel in your area. Now rotate your <strong>antenna</strong> 360 degrees and stop at the highest signal strength. Use your compass and mark the direction of the highest <strong>antenna</strong> signal. Rinse and repeat this process for each channel and record the result carefully. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of our favorite features with this long-range TV HDTV <strong>antenna</strong> is its dedicated smartphone app, which allows users to check for nearby obstructions using augmented reality using a top-down map view. It is also a very formidable TV signal finder. Augmented reality also includes a satellite pointer to optimize your <strong>antenna</strong>’s location. It’s a high-end choice for anyone in the market for the best omnidirectional TV <strong>antenna</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Kudos for long-range TV <strong>antenna</strong>s with UV and weatherproofing, helping them better respond to the elements. Copper end coaxial cables and surge protection <strong>antenna</strong>s are good to have. Note, despite the most durable long-range TV <strong>antenna</strong>s, signals are highly susceptible to thunderstorms and heavy rain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Every <strong>antenna</strong> is rated to receive frequencies in a different range. These frequencies are measured in megahertz. To put it simply, an <strong>antenna</strong> with a larger frequency range will be able to receive more channels, provided there’s no interference or signal interruptions from competing frequencies. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you live in an area with hills or forests, you may consider getting an <strong>antenna</strong> with a built-in amplifier (i.e., a preamplifier). The alternative is to purchase an <strong>antenna</strong> without an amp first, test its reception, and attach an amp to it later if you’re not satisfied. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HDTV Antenna has been our budget pick in this guide for a few years running. It performs almost as well as our top pick; if you’re within about 15 miles of the broadcast <strong>antenna</strong>s, you might not miss any channels with this one. It has an inline amplifier, includes a fairly generous amount of cable, and is relatively compact. The only downsides are that the cable is not detachable and the <strong>antenna</strong> is not reversible or paintable, so your only color option is black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the best things about it is that its compactness makes it easy to install in the attic, removing the need for you to set it up outdoors. But if you don’t mind the height, you can use the installation kit included in the box to quickly install the <strong>antenna</strong>. The detailed manual makes things that much easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We use a set-top box to scan for channels and record the number of RF channels received by each <strong>antenna</strong> and their strength. Each RF channel carries a number of digital stations, but the number is different per channel and can change, so digital stations received isn’t as useful a measurement. We scan several times and adjust the direction of the <strong>antenna</strong> on some rescans. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>That being said, reducing interference usually relies on raising the <strong>antenna</strong> up higher. Generally speaking, mounting your <strong>antenna</strong> higher will reduce the number of obstacles between it and the broadcast tower you’re trying to receive signal from. Fewer obstacles equals less interference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Antennas Direct ClearStream Eclipse Indoor HDTV Antenna $29.90 at Amazon See It (Opens in a new window) Antennas Direct is a popular brand with a wide selection of indoor and outdoor <strong>antenna</strong>s. The Eclipse Indoor HDTV Antenna is a simple, flat, disc-shaped <strong>antenna</strong> with a stick-on design. You can slap it on any smooth surface, like a window, without using tape or any other adhesive. It&rsquo;s a multidirectional <strong>antenna</strong> and features a 35-mile range. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In terms of installation, this long-range TV outdoor <strong>antenna</strong> runs about mid-range. It does not come preassembled, but simple enough to mount in less than five minutes using a wrench and Phillips screwdriver to clamp together with a J mount masty and two U clamps. Kudos for its weatherproof parts which work well in extreme conditions as low as -50 Celsius. It’s certainly one of the best outdoor TV <strong>antenna</strong>s for rugged climates on our list. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Many <strong>antenna</strong>s come with built-in signal amplifiers that increase their effective range by boosting the signal they pick up. This sounds like it should be a great feature to look for, but there are a couple caveats: External power source: Amplified <strong>antenna</strong>s usually require an external power source. With most <strong>antenna</strong>s you just need to connect the coax cable to your TV and you’re set, but <strong>antenna</strong>s with built-in amps also need to be plugged into a power outlet. This can make placement trickier, so keep that in mind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This long-range TV <strong>antenna</strong> handles over-the-air broadcast signals very well across all types of frequencies, good for 100 miles of coverage. It picks up popular channels such as FOX, NBC, PBS with ease. Our only criticism is that it takes incoming signals from a single direction and does not include a built-in rotor for 360° of movement, which helps capture signals more efficiently. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Look for the best long-range HDTV TV <strong>antenna</strong>s to carry a minimum 60-mile range. In general, opt for the longest range possible in <strong>rural</strong> areas sans shorter ranges in urban areas. They should also run VHF and UHF frequencies to get the most channels possible. Built-in amplifiers also work to correct lost signals as a result of cable deterioration and splitting to multiple televisions. Pixelation and dropouts should also be reduced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Our only criticism is that this best indoor TV <strong>antenna</strong> offers an up to the 60-mile range and is more susceptible to obstructions such as surrounding buildings and farther distances from broadcast towers. Bonus points for coming in multiple colors and finishes to match rooftop or attic decor, which most long-range TV <strong>antenna</strong>s do not offer. It outperforms even in the best rabbit ear <strong>antenna</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This long-range outdoor TV <strong>antenna</strong> offers a little bit of everything, optimized for indoor attics with excellent VHF and UHF signal reception – good enough for an up to 60-mile range. Free local TV channels such as NBC, ABC, and PBS could be had. Its mounting bracket and mast take less than five minutes to assemble with our preferred snap-on style installation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Knowing the real channel number will help you select an <strong>antenna</strong>. TV broadcasting in North America is spread across three frequency bands: VHF-Low (channels 2 through 6), VHF-High (channels 7 through 13), and UHF (channels 14 through 51). Because of the different frequencies in use, <strong>antenna</strong>s are designed to cover one, two, or three bands. Not every <strong>antenna</strong> covers them all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>antenna</strong> is the best for <strong>rural</strong> hilly areas because it can be extended to nearly 17 feet tall with its boom length and the additional vertical height of the <strong>antenna</strong>. It will receive HDTV reception from towers up to 65 miles away and that range can be extended with Winegard’s Boost coupler. The <strong>antenna</strong> itself is made of zinc-plated steel hardware to improve its resistance to rust and corrosion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>AntennaWeb’s TV station tool categorizes nearby stations based on the sort of outdoor <strong>antenna</strong> you need to tune in. This is because indoor <strong>antenna</strong>s are highly dependent on the architecture of your home and any sort of structures that can interfere with signals. This doesn’t mean the map is useless for indoor <strong>antenna</strong>s, though; yellow and green stations can be tuned into with small and medium multidirectional <strong>antenna</strong>s mounted outdoors, which means you can probably get a signal from them using an indoor multidirectional <strong>antenna</strong>. For farther and weaker stations that require directional <strong>antenna</strong>s or a preamp, you’ll need to be able to mount it outside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Not designed to receive VHF TV stations Best Prices Today: The Antennas Direct DB8e’s reception is just as impressive as its looks. This is a large, heavy <strong>antenna</strong> cleverly designed to receive weak signals with two <strong>antenna</strong> arrays, or in areas of better reception to point to towers in different directions. Read our full Antennas Direct DB8e review Antennas Direct 91XG — Best roof-mount TV <strong>antenna</strong>, runner-up Pros Good reception of weak signals - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Excess cable can get messy quick Best Prices Today: This <strong>antenna</strong> impressed us with its ability to pull in more broadcast channels than the competition. Further, those it did receive were a little stronger than from our runner-up, which should make for happier TV viewing. Read our full Winegard FlatWave Amped (model FL-5500A) review Channel Master Smartenna+ — Best amplified indoor TV <strong>antenna</strong>, runner-up Pros Automatic tuning to receive the greatest number of channels - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Directional <strong>antenna</strong>s are, well, directional. They tend to be shaped like fins, arrows, or tubes, and need to be pointed toward the stations they’re tuned to. This means they need to be adjusted to properly get signals from stations, so you’ll need to plan carefully when mounting them. Their ranges can be much, much farther than multidirectional <strong>antenna</strong>s, though, letting you tune into weaker and more distant stations if the <strong>antenna</strong> is pointing at them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before you start shopping for an <strong>antenna</strong>, you should check what channels are available near you. AntennaWeb(Opens in a new window) has a helpful tool that lets you enter your location to see where the nearest TV stations are. It even provides a helpful map that shows distance from each station and the type of <strong>antenna</strong> you need to get a strong signal. Once you know what TV you can get near you, you can figure out the best <strong>antenna</strong> to buy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The amplifier of the RCA ANT3ME1 has a built-in signal-level meter that provides a near-instantaneous readout of the signal strength. This feature allows you to quickly find the optimum position for the <strong>antenna</strong>, a process that could take more than an hour if you instead use the TV’s internal channel-scanning process to evaluate different positions. The ANT3ME1 is essentially the same as our previous runner-up, the RCA ANT3ME, but with a slightly wider <strong>antenna</strong> design that helped it to perform roughly equal to our top pick before we used the meter. When we used the meter to fine-tune the <strong>antenna</strong>’s positioning, the ANT3ME1 sometimes outperformed our top pick. But the cable is not detachable, and the amplifier requires an AC outlet rather than USB power. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once you’ve made your list, examine the Rabbit Ears results to find the channels you want to watch. Write down the number in parenthesis, which is the “real channel,” the “Direction (true),” and the color (green, yellow, or red). The colors will inform you if an indoor <strong>antenna</strong> will be sufficient, or if you’ll need an attic or roof-mounted model to pull them in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With this omni-directional digital <strong>antenna</strong>, you’ll be able to enjoy signal reception from towers up to 150 miles away. It has a built-in <strong>antenna</strong> for 360-degree reception and a high-gain, low noise amplifier to increase signal strength and reliability. The <strong>antenna</strong> itself is compact and comes with 33 feet of durable coaxial cable to make installation easier. The entire <strong>antenna</strong> housing features a UV-resistant, waterproof design that also improves signal reliability on windy and/or rainy days. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This Channel Master <strong>antenna</strong> can receive a variety of signals from towers up to 100 miles away. It’s a directional <strong>antenna</strong> with a six-foot turning radius and 30 pounds of wind resistance (tested at wind speeds of 100 mph). It comes with a U-bolt mounting clamp to make installation easier and is designed to handle extreme weather. It’s made of half-inch aluminum elements with bifurcated rivets for added strength. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With a 109-inch boom length, you’ll be able to extend the Channel Master nearly 10 feet above the surface you mount it to. It receives low frequencies between 54 and 216 MHz and high frequencies between 470 and 700 MHz. The gain of this <strong>antenna</strong> is 10 dB for VHF frequencies and 16 dB for UHF frequencies and it has a front-to-back gain ratio of 17 dB. It’s also equipped with an F-type output connector and weighs a total of 11.5 pounds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>No matter where (or in what city) we hung it, the Antennas Direct ClearStream Flex always ranked among the best in pulling in the most TV channels. Its flat design makes it easy to hang on a wall, and it’s reversible, with black and white sides (it’s also paintable). The <strong>antenna</strong> comes with a detachable amplifier that can draw power from your TV’s USB port, as well as a long, detachable cable, which is convenient if you want to replace it with a cable of a different color or length. The only downside is that the ClearStream Flex is a little larger than average for a flat <strong>antenna</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It can drive a crystal-clear 4K picture to your TV with ease. But that’s not even the best part. The HD2605 comes with four splitters, allowing the <strong>antenna</strong> to connect to up to eight TVs. One of these <strong>antenna</strong>s is all you need to make the entire home cable-free. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Multidirectional <strong>antenna</strong>s are designed to pick up signals from any direction. They’re typically flat, shaped like rectangular sheets or discs that can be easily mounted on a window. If mounted properly, they can tune into any station within range, regardless of whether the station’s positioned north, south, east, or west. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The connection from your <strong>antenna</strong> to your TV is every bit as important as the <strong>antenna</strong> itself. You need a high-quality coaxial cable (“coax” for short) for the job. Coax has a center wire that carries the signal and is surrounded by a plastic insulator. An outer braid shields the center cable from interference, and an outer sheath protects the cable from the elements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The BEFORE <strong>antenna</strong> is made to support two TVs at a time without the need for a splitter that reduces signal strength. It’s rated for VHF frequencies between 40 and 300 MHz and UHF frequencies between 470 and 890 MHz. This <strong>antenna</strong> also receives FM signals and includes a built-in super low noise amplifier to provide a clearer signal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Unless you have a stockpile of coaxial cables lying around, you’re probably going to need to use the one that comes with your <strong>antenna</strong>. Double-check that it’s not too long or too short for your room! Too long, and you’ll end up with a mass of cable dangling in space. Too short, and you may not be able to position the <strong>antenna</strong> optimally. There’s no hard-and-fast rule here—just be aware of your room size so you don’t have to buy extra cables. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Start by learning how many channels are available in your area. There are a number of online tools to help you do this, but we suggest Tablo. It will tell you which channels are available so that you can make sure to choose an <strong>antenna</strong> that can receive the same frequency those channels are being broadcast over. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sturdy design and build quality Cons Bulkier than other amplified <strong>antenna</strong>s Best Prices Today: The word “smart” gets bandied about quite a lot these days, but it’s more than just hyperbole in the case of Channel Master’s Smartenna+ over-the-air TV <strong>antenna</strong>. This amplified <strong>antenna</strong> has a tiny tuner onboard that can virtually change its reception pattern to pull in the most stations possible. We like it a lot. Read our full Channel Master Smartenna+ review Antennas Direct DB8e — Best roof-mount TV <strong>antenna</strong> Pros Good reception of weak signals - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This snap-on mount long-range TV <strong>antenna</strong> with mounting hardware does an excellent job across the board. It operates on both UHF and VHF frequencies for a higher selection of TV shows, sports, entertainment, and HD channels. Kudos for its streaming device compatibility for an even greater selection of content. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This best long range TV <strong>antenna</strong> indoor works well with range, covering a 150-mile range with a built-in 360-degree rotor controlled by a handheld infrared remote control. It does an excellent job of capturing digital TV UHF/VHF signals. along with free 4K channels and TV stations for access to a wide variety of content. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Our favorite feature with this long-range TV <strong>antenna</strong> is the Winegard app, which uses augmented reality overlay to check for nearby towers – excellent for moving towards the best signal possible. It also helps users find free over-the-air HDTV towers nearby. No need for the best TV <strong>antenna</strong> amplifier with this choice! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you install your <strong>antenna</strong> in the attic, you’ll probably get slightly less signal than if it was on the roof because it’s an enclosed space, but it might be enough to get stable TV reception. If you hate the look of an outdoor <strong>antenna</strong>, then experiment. An attic-mounted <strong>antenna</strong> will also be easier to maintain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you don’t want to spend much money at all on a TV <strong>antenna</strong> but still want results, Mohu has an option for you: The Leaf Metro, which falls under $30, offers the basics, including a 10-foot detachable coaxial cable. While it’s not a large bar, it’s also not as thin as the peel-and-paste options on our list, so you will need to make a little room for it behind or under your TV or perhaps on a nearby window sill. It&rsquo;s reversible, paintable, and generally has a host of placement options, which saves as much space as possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Start by getting an <strong>antenna</strong> signal meter and a compass. Disconnect coaxial cables from your TV or tuner. Plug your <strong>antenna</strong>’s F-connector to the socket marked ‘Antenna’ on your meter. Connect your TV to the socket on your meter marked ‘TV’. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For those who still want excellent range but don’t like the idea of attaching anything to their walls or windows, this indoor <strong>antenna</strong> offers an alternative. It’s a bar that you can set either horizontally or vertically, and it’s stylish enough to go with other objects around your TV center so you don’t have to worry about hiding anything. Range is impressive, too, at 80 miles, making this another model for picking up as many channels as possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of this long-range TV <strong>antenna</strong>’s strengths is its quick assembly. It can be completed in five minutes by simplifying opening the reflection panel and connecting all fasteners before conducting a quick channel search. All in all, we consider this long-range TV <strong>antenna</strong> one of the easiest ones to manage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We like the fact this long-range TV <strong>antenna</strong> regularly picks up 35+ channels regardless of region. Our only knock is its installation, which is not as intuitive as pre-assembled <strong>antenna</strong>s, requiring more screwing of individual elements to a large cross brace. it is also heavier than most. If you do a lot of camping and traveling, you might also want to consider the best RV <strong>antenna</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The “Amped” part is also far from an exaggeration: This <strong>antenna</strong> was designed to pick up signs from up to 60 miles away, a strong rating for getting as many channel options as you can in your area. It also uses Clear Circuit technology to help make broadcasts more accurate and less prone to suddenly pixelating at key moments. You can also easily mount it anywhere that works, including the back of your TV, a nearby wall, or a window. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Indoor <strong>antenna</strong>s are typically fine for all the strong local channels, but if you want channels that are weaker or further away, you might need to go larger and put an <strong>antenna</strong> in your attic space or on your roof. For that, we recommend the Antennas Direct DB8e. If you don’t want to climb onto your roof, and you have an attic, the Winegard Elite 7550 can be installed either in your attic or on your roof. The higher you can go with an <strong>antenna</strong>–and the fewer line-of-sight obstacles to the broadcast towers you’re looking to tune to–the better your TV reception will be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>antenna</strong> can provide uncompressed HD video from a variety of networks, including major carriers like ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC. It includes advanced CleanPeak filter technology that removes cellular and FM signals in order to provide a clearer picture and reduce signal interruption. You won’t need any additional tools to install this <strong>antenna</strong>, but the recommended pole mount is sold separately and it is recommended to mount it at least 30 feet off the ground. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Monoprice Clear Window or Wall Mount Paper Thin HDTV Antenna $18.84 at Amazon See It (Opens in a new window) Most indoor <strong>antenna</strong>s are opaque, but the Monoprice Clear Window Antenna is clear, or at least translucent. This means you can attach it to the window and still let plenty of light through. It also features an inline amplifier, so it should have the same 60-mile range as Monoprice&rsquo;s curved <strong>antenna</strong> for just a few dollars more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>antenna</strong> offers a lot more to like. It comes with a built-in motor, allowing you to rotate it at the press of a button. This feature gives access to a broader array of programs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://www.peimag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1byone-OUS00-0357-Digital-Attic.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Best Long Range Indoor Tv Antenna For Rural Areas - 10 Best Long Range TV Antennas in 2022">
