The similar option isn’t leather and if you’re comparing the two in terms of quality they’re worlds apart – but the fit is similar. The sleeves are a little long (they hit me around my mid-hand), but really the sleeves are a little long on my Madewell jacket also. - Source: Internet Noah classic recycled tee Does a heavier T-shirt mean that it’s recycling more?
