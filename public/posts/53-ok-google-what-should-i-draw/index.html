You never know what kind of pattern you might end up with. - Source: Internet Think of the days when you were a kid and drawing a nature scene seemed like the best idea ever. Give a call to that inner kid and draw those mountains with a sun blooming in the sky and a perfect lake flowing below its glory. Oh, and don’t forget to draw birds in the shape of V. Wink! - Source: Internet If you’re looking for some inspiration for your next masterpiece, look no further. We’ve compiled a list of 40 cool, easy things to draw when you’re bored.

Hey, add wine to any of your art parties and you’re bound to have a good time. - Source: Internet When you start designing art purely for the sake of selling it, you get into a different mindset.

But, by surrounding yourself with other artists, you’ll get a lot of great ideas and simply have more fun drawing than you would have on your own. - Source: Internet It’s amazing how a few swiveled lines can create a beautiful image.

A rose or hydrangea maybe. - Source: Internet For a more seasoned artist, if you’re bored, why not practice drawing this awesome bird. You can get creative with the colours and choose your own. The colours themselves scream “cool easy things to draw”. - Source: Internet When you are getting bored then all you can think of is having some fun.

If you’re overdue for a restock though, this can be a fun way to get inspired to draw again. - Source: Internet A caricature is a type of cartoon drawing where something about the subject is exaggerated to be funny.

Draw some with too-big eyes and some with antenna flicking around. Take the Monsters, Inc. for inspiration and start drawing faces so weird, unlike anything. - Source: Internet The idea behind this technique is to get your brain to stop thinking and over analyzing.

It may seem like you would still struggle with artist’s block trying to design products.
