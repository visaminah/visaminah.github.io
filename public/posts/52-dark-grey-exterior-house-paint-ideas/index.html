If you have a black or neutral gray, you don’t have to worry as much about color clashing. Unfortunately, I have a dark brown roof with slight red undertones, so colors like shades of green or blues wouldn’t work for me and would clash.

First, let me tell you when it comes to choosing trim and accent colors, less is more! I can’t tell you how often I work with clients who have a lot of architecture detail on the exterior of their home (shake, shutters, lots of changes in roof angles) who want to paint every detail a different color/shade because they think it will accentuate the architectural details. However, too much contrast and change of color/shades actually has the opposite effect and the eye stops at each color and the architectural details no longer stand out. - Source: Internet Stepping out of the neutral zone is the addition of brighter and different colors onto the grey facade. The addition of a light blue door onto a similar undertone of light grey, adds in a contrast of color keeping the neutrality intact. This makes it one among modern grey house exterior color schemes. - Source: Internet Starting strong with the classic combination of Grey exterior walls with white trimming.

Achieving the perfect look is more deliberate and frankly, difficult, than just choosing a color paint for the front door. You have to consider not only the stain but how it’ll look on the type of wood you have. That’s because the same stain on different wood types results in a completely different final color. It’s a little more complicated to work with stains than it is with paints. - Source: Internet Here are some recommendations for locating information about Light Gray Exterior House Paint Colors to get you started:\r- Research Modern Grey House Exterior Color Schemes-related information from credible sources.

This particular brand of orange can be a bit difficult to design with. Luckily for us, we’re talking about gray <strong>paint</strong>. Which, like I said before, can be paired with just about anything. White gutters, downspouts, and window framing are another effortless pairing on this home’s exterior. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What is it about brown and natural stains? Every designer we know is obsessed with them. Could it be their depth and elegance? That sensuous quality that few other colors can equal. It’s hard if not impossible to get the same effect from a man made fiberglass finish or solid <strong>paint</strong> color. Natural tones comes from within the wood making each door one of a kind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sitting right in the middle of minimalistic colors such as black and white is <strong>grey</strong>. It takes the edge off of black in combination with the purity of white to be something thats muted in a way that is not harsh on the eye.

However, it can also make a great color for the exterior of your house!

With so many shades of gray, there are a number of looks you can achieve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When I choose exterior trim and accent colors for my clients, 95% of the time I will work off of one <strong>paint</strong> color strip. Because the sunlight will pull out undertones that is impossible to see on a <strong>paint</strong> card, this is the safest way to guarantee that the undertones in the trim and accent colors play well and work together harmoniously. I will veer off the color strip if a client wants a completely different door color but for everything else, I stick with one color strip when it comes to exterior colors. You have everything you need color-wise on one strip; main body color, windows and trim and contrasting door color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Along with the white trim around the windows, a blue-gray fascia skirts the edge of the roof. It has a very sweet and delicate design that contrasts the hardness of the stone and dark <strong>grey</strong> color. The same color is also used to frame the door. Who knows, maybe they’ll make it the trim color, too! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You’ll also notice a pop of color in this picture: the blue door.

Once again, the honey stained planks have been installed on the underneath of this patio roof. This particular color has served its purpose in adding a little life and light to the undeniably dark exterior <strong>paint</strong> colors chosen for this house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wooden textures and colors combine well with most of the shades of <strong>grey</strong>. Pairing it up with a darker shade gives it a more contemporary and modern aesthetic. You can choose to give it a balance with these modern <strong>grey</strong> house exterior color schemes. On the other hand, giving smaller wooden features onto a bigger <strong>grey</strong> space will also work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Giving dark blue tones to <strong>grey</strong> gives it the ability to be paired up with browns and whites. The palette here is shades like browns for shingle roofing and off-white for the exterior surface base blended with an equal base of the blue-<strong>grey</strong>. The <strong>grey</strong> can be extended to the framing of the windows as well, making it a modern <strong>grey</strong> house exterior color scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We’re considering <strong>paint</strong>ing our house this year. When we moved in 9 years ago, it was an awful shade of muddy purple/brown with stained doors and white plastic shutters. We <strong>paint</strong>ed it aqua exterior with mustard yellow doors and kept the white trim and shutters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It also becomes an all-around combination when it comes to the different shades of <strong>grey</strong> that are available in the market at this point. In traditional ways, this combination is best seen in sloped roof houses with front porches and multiple rooms. Given that, It sits well with the change in the architectural style of the building as well making it one of the modern <strong>grey</strong> house exterior color schemes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grey is a neutral shade that is a direct descendant of black, pairs well with the same when used smartly. In modern <strong>grey</strong> house exterior color schemes, contrasting the two colors by subtly using black will give a well-constructed facade. The black shade can be used for the main door and shutters of the windows on a bigger base color of <strong>grey</strong>, giving it the edge it needs to stand out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re like me, you’ve probably been thinking about <strong>paint</strong>ing your house <strong>grey</strong>. But you’ve also probably been wondering what shade of gray, and what color palette to choose that will go with it. It can be a hassle to scroll through all the thousands of photos of <strong>grey</strong> houses just to find the right exterior <strong>paint</strong> color for your own home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Not that there is anything wrong with choosing exterior <strong>paint</strong> colors that are dark – of course there isn’t!

That’s right: you won’t be seeing any white trim here! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We’re very close to choosing an exterior <strong>paint</strong> color.

This time it has been used for the bottom section of the house, showing where the basement or lower floor is since the home sits on an uneven hill, and for the base of the columns of the porch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>From elegant and classic darker shades to light and airy barely grays, you&rsquo;re sure to find one that will work for your home.

I recently added board and batten gables and dormers to our own home so I’m partial to this board and batten portico gable. It’s so pretty..bold yet classic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Rose gold is also a nice metallic to add with blue and works well with the red brick. BUY ME ON AMAZON Rust-Oleum Ultra Matte Chalked Paint This <strong>paint</strong> has a soft, matte chalky finish for use on wood, metal, and fiberglass doors. If you’ve never seen chalked <strong>paint</strong> in person it has an aged, antique quality to it. For added protection we’d recommend a Rust-Oleum Chalked Clear Protective Topcoat brush-on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before you can go much further in your color decision-making, you will need to consider the color of your roof. If you have a black or neutral gray, you don’t have to worry as much about color clashing. Unfortunately, I have a dark brown roof with slight red undertones, so colors like shades of green or blues wouldn’t work for me and would clash. For those of you that have a roof with red, tan, green or blue gray undertones in your shingles, you will for sure need to factor in your roof color as you choose your exterior <strong>paint</strong> color palette. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In recent times these modern <strong>grey</strong> house exterior color schemes have led <strong>grey</strong> to be one of the most chosen colors for a structure. The muted environment gives us a canvas where other elements and colors can be added to make the whole picture better. Here are some examples to refer to for <strong>grey</strong> house exterior color schemes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Though your immediate neighbors shouldn’t dictate what color you choose for your home, you should keep them in mind. If you plan to sell your home one day, you don’t want your home to stand out for all of the wrong reasons. A color that stands out, but that also complements the homes beside yours, will make your home seem more harmonious with your neighborhood. It’s also a good idea to check with your Homeowners Association as they could have rules about which colors you can <strong>paint</strong> your house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Textured stucco walls that carry a <strong>grey</strong> with features of dark <strong>grey</strong> on the doors and windows give a minimalistic look to the exterior. With only the two shades one can achieve to make the <strong>grey</strong>s stand out in the present-day context. Other smaller features of dark wood can also be added to elevate it further. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once you have made a firm decision on the main exterior body <strong>paint</strong> color, you’re ready to move on and choose your exterior trim and accent colors. First, let me tell you when it comes to choosing trim and accent colors, less is more! I can’t tell you how often I work with clients who have a lot of architecture detail on the exterior of their home (shake, shutters, lots of changes in roof angles) who want to <strong>paint</strong> every detail a different color/shade because they think it will accentuate the architectural details. However, too much contrast and change of color/shades actually has the opposite effect and the eye stops at each color and the architectural details no longer stand out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Stepping out of the neutral zone is the addition of brighter and different colors onto the <strong>grey</strong> facade. The addition of a light blue door onto a similar undertone of light <strong>grey</strong>, adds in a contrast of color keeping the neutrality intact. This makes it one among modern <strong>grey</strong> house exterior color schemes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Starting strong with the classic combination of Grey exterior walls with white trimming. Now, just because it is a classic doesn’t mean it is boring. When it comes to <strong>grey</strong> exterior color schemes you need something extra to tie the facade and the addition of the clean white trim pairs perfectly with the not-so-overpowering <strong>grey</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Painting your home is a big investment and there are a lot of exterior house colors to choose from. Because of this, it can be hard to choose what color to <strong>paint</strong> your home. But we’re here to help. We’ve compiled this list to not only get you excited about <strong>paint</strong>ing your home’s exterior, but to also help guide your thinking process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s impossible to deny the beauty of the perfect stain on just the right type of wood. Achieving the perfect look is more deliberate and frankly, difficult, than just choosing a color <strong>paint</strong> for the front door. You have to consider not only the stain but how it’ll look on the type of wood you have. That’s because the same stain on different wood types results in a completely different final color. It’s a little more complicated to work with stains than it is with <strong>paint</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/1e/02/54/1e02544aa15b8fe85638c33787c4c24f.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Dark Grey Exterior House Paint Ideas - Light Grey House Exterior Color Schemes">
