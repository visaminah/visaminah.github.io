It’s an eye-catching pair that could be used for almost any industry. Royal blue offers a sense of trust and longevity, it’s a stable reliable color for any brand. While soft purple lightens the mood and provides a sense of balance to the logo. - Source: Internet Like the smiling monkey symbol in this logo, the bright yellow used is full of energy and delight. The almost-black shade of grey, popular within the entertainment industry (especially nightclubs), has an air of mystery and intrigue. Black and yellow are two colors that go really nicely together. - Source: Internet Cyan and hot pink are two vibrant colors that make an excellent logo color combination. It’s cyberpunk and pop princess all in one! These bright, high-contrast colors embody an excitement that is ideal for more playful brands. Think scene/punk branding. - Source: Internet This logo uses a triadic color scheme to create a soft, yet dynamic effect. Lavender purple looks great with yellow, and the green accent color adds the perfect flair. This is a beautiful pastel logo with very spring-inspired colors! - Source: Internet Some colors seem to have endless pairings (think: sky blue, hunter green, and stormy gray), while others may seem to constrain our decorating scheme when using them. Purple can often be one of those colors for design enthusiasts, though many designers have found myriad ways to incorporate the color into their projects. This may need to begin with expanding our knowledge of purple shades as the word often conjures up a classic Crayola crayon color (and possibly an endearing boy named Harold to go with it). - Source: Internet Triadic color combinations are spaced evenly throughout the color wheel and tend to be more rich or vibrant in color. This color combination is typically dynamic, creating a harmonious visual contrast that pops when combined. Create a triangle on the color wheel and you’ll find your 3 triadic colors. Examples: red, yellow, and blue; green, orange, and blue-violet; red-orange, yellow-green, and blue-violet. - Source: Internet The primary colors of RYB are red, yellow, and blue. You can use those colors to make the secondary colors, which are green, orange, and purple. If you mix all three primary colors together, you’ll usually get a type of brown. - Source: Internet Per Nelums, the versatility of the colors extends beyond a limited set of styles and stereotypical gender preferences—fellas, don’t be afraid of the shade. Pair plum with teal or navy for a rich, luxurious statement, or go with violet and golden hues to connote royalty and wisdom. Then there’s lilac, lavender, and the lighter ends of the purple spectrum—those can go minimalist, modern, or cozy and country depending on the accents you choose. - Source: Internet If you ask designer Marissa Nelums, purple does not deserve the bad reputation it sometimes has. “In client questionnaires, we ask which colors they don’t like, and I have seen purple come up quite a bit,” she says. “People think it’s too harsh, too bright, and can get gaudy. But, to me, it’s like the perfect dress—the one you can wear with sneakers and high heels.” - Source: Internet If you run out of purple or black paint, there’s no need to panic. Most colors can be made from scratch by using other paint colors. Purple is an easy color to make because it’s a secondary color created with 50% red and 50% blue. - Source: Internet Complementary color combinations are the colors that sit on opposite sides of the color wheel. Combining these colors creates an effect of high contrast, catching the eye and leaving quite an impact. Examples: red and green, yellow and purple, orange and blue. - Source: Internet Our brains are hardwired to react to and remember color combinations. If you close your eyes right now and think of three famous brands, chances are you’ll be able to conjure up the company’s logo colors right away. Starbucks: green and white. Ikea: blue and yellow. FedEx: purple and orange. - Source: Internet Sitting on the color spectrum between blue and red, purple is historically associated with royalty and rarity. In recent times, designers have rediscovered purple’s more intriguing and creative affiliations with spirituality, mystery and originality. From Byzantine emperors to the lyrics of a Prince song, purple has a diverse and fascinating cultural history, and its mystique and drama continue to inspire designers today. - Source: Internet The only downside is that black and purple don’t make a vibrant dark purple, but instead, the result looks a little muddy. It could even look more black than purple. Thus, it’s not commonly used in art pieces. - Source: Internet Magenta is a dark yet vibrant shade of pink that’s incredibly versatile. Its purple undertones work really well with lavender to give you a warm, inviting color combo that works great for any room. Of course, you could also throw in a few pops of gold or silver for a fun added touch. - Source: Internet Cyan can be a tricky shade of blue to pair, but the hot pink and cyan color combination really works. It’s bubblegum pop meets cyberpunk dystopia — a twist on the classic baby pink and baby blue. These bright, high contrast colors embody an excitement that is ideal for an alternative take on more playful brands. Think vape juice labels or scene/punk branding. - Source: Internet Scientific evidence, however, points to a much clearer definition of both purple and violet. While purple is a mix of red and blue, violet is considered to be a ‘spectral’ color. This means that violet occupies its own place at the end of the spectrum of light and has its own wavelength as a result. - Source: Internet Designer Renvy Graves Pittman says at the far end of the spectrum, you have rich aubergines—which Mario Buatta was famous for using in his work. At the opposing end is lavender, while mid-range colors like amethyst establish a base point even better than a true, royal purple. Designer Henry Prideaux notes that it is quite a versatile, “sometimes regal” color, which makes purple a great option when designing traditional and contemporary interiors alike. - Source: Internet Once you get purple, you can use that to dive into the assortment of shades from lighter tones to darker ones. Just take care not to mix too much of any color. This can cause you to blot out the purple, leaving you with a completely different color. - Source: Internet This bold color combination immediately draws your eye to the center of the logo. The vibrant red and unique layout of the company name pops against the happy shade of yellow, creating a sense of energy and playfulness. We love this color pairing for its versatility - Source: Internet This one’s an unconventional color palette, but teal and purple look great together so long as one remains the dominant color. Here, we’ve used a soft lavender to create contrast against a darker background. This color combination is moody and magical. - Source: Internet Purple’s complementary color is yellow because purple sits opposite yellow on the color spectrum. This means that citrus shades are the perfect balancing color contrast for purple. Look to yellow’s close neighbors, orange and lime green, for more color palette options that bring out the best in purple. - Source: Internet With primary colors, you get your usual red, yellow, and blue. Once you move onto the secondary colors, you’re looking at orange, green, and purple. The tertiary colors come into play when you mix the primary and secondary colors, and these include yellow-orange, yellow-green, blue-green, blue-violet, red-violet and red-orange. - Source: Internet Purple is also associated historically with femininity, sensuality, and sometimes vanity. This link has been given new ownership and a radical reshaping by the feminist movement, which has adopted purple as its symbolic color. The color is also often associated with the LGBTQ community. It’s the symbolic color of Spirit Day, an annual event that shows support for young people who are bullied because of their sexual orientation. - Source: Internet Unfortunately, it’s not possible to mix purple and black in lights because lights cannot be black. Lights are mixed using RGB, which is an additive color model. Red, green, and blue are the primary colors, and they can all combine to make white. Yet, black isn’t present on this color model. - Source: Internet To find the colors and exact hex codes that go with purple, use our color combinations tool. It shows you monochromatic, analogous, triadic, and contrasting color palettes for a variety of purple shades. Try a scheme with purple, violet, mauve, or lilac. - Source: Internet This is a very royal color palette. Yellow and purple are the perfect complementary color scheme, but the gradient here adds a new level of dimension to this logo design. This is a very warm gradient, blending yellow and orange to make a rich, honey-colored gold. Very uplifting and perfect for a wellness business! - Source: Internet A delicate pink paired with navy blue gives off a playful yet trustworthy vibe. The navy pops against the light background, creating a beautiful contrast. Consider this pairing for a logo if you’re in the beauty, blogging, or wedding industries. - Source: Internet The soft reddish tone of terra cotta evokes intense feelings of nature and earth. It’s also the most popular material for flower pots. If you have lavender décor, consider adding a few terra cotta pots, perhaps planted with lavender plants, to liven up the room. - Source: Internet Purple symbolizes mystery, royalty, and imagination. It’s meant to enlighten, inspire, and encourage. It has many positive meanings like compassion, wisdom, and creativity, but it can also have negative characteristics like sensitive, vigilant, or immature. It depends on the context you use dark purple in. - Source: Internet Dark purple is already a shade of purple, which means black was added to make it look darker. So, you probably won’t need to make it darker, but if you do, you can add a little more black. A little black paint can go a long way, so only use it sparingly. - Source: Internet Once you’ve determined the feel you’re going for—a lively spot for entertaining or a soothing retreat from it all—that can navigate your decision to finding the right shade of purple. From there, it’s all about finding the right color pairings that will make the color sing, whether it’s used in the form of accent pillows or lacquered onto the walls.

(See below for notes on blue’s true neighbor color, violet.) - Source: Internet You won’t have to look much further than sage green and dark purple to create color harmony. Green is one of those colors that goes well with purple. These two can be extremely complementary colors when selected in contrasting shades. - Source: Internet If it’s intelligence, confidence, and trust that you’re after for your logo, try combining blue and turquoise. The colors are from the same color family but are different enough to create a striking duo, with the turquoise used sparingly. Tasteful use of bright colors can really make a design pop! Bright teal pairs well with almost any darker, muted color. - Source: Internet Let’s take yellow, for instance. Adding just the right amount of the main yellow tone or even one of the many shades of yellow can help you change purple to a different tint. These purples are usually more muted and can work out quite well. - Source: Internet Easily capture anyone’s attention with a bright purple gradient. Purple communicates royalty, luxury, and power as well as creativity, fun, and wisdom. When paired with a lighter color of a similar shade, your logo will feel balanced and luxurious. Pink and purple might seem like a youthful color combination, but a gradient helps to mature the visual impact and add a modern flair. - Source: Internet Purple has ancient roots as a color that was linked directly to royalty and rarity.

It was reserved for Roman magistrates, Byzantine emperors and, later, by Roman Catholic bishops. - Source: Internet There are many historical sources pointing to purple as an exclusive color for the noble sectors of society. In Japan, it’s associated with the Emperor and the aristocracy.

Understanding the relationship between colors and how they interact on the color wheel is the key to successful design. - Source: Internet Black and purple are two dark colors, but they can evoke very different emotions. Purple is a color of imagination and mystery, while black is related to power and sophistication. Yet, they can work well together in designs. - Source: Internet purple color scheme uses tints, tones, and shades to create an entirely purple palette. A complementary purple color scheme incorporates yellow. Purple’s cousins, magenta and violet, are complementary to yellow-green and yellow-orange respectively. - Source: Internet Pale gray is a soft, soothing color with muted tones that are perfect alongside a pale lavender. You can go for gray furniture with a few lavender accents or go all out and paint your walls your favorite pale purple. Choose a gray with cool undertones for the best look. - Source: Internet Why is purple divisive? Perhaps in part because purple has long been associated with ambiguity, mystery, and magic. Treading the line between aggressive red and restrained blue, purple occupies a cryptic middle ground. While light purple can evoke feelings of romance and nostalgia, darker purples can feel gloomier, moodier, and provoke feelings of sadness and frustration. - Source: Internet Light purple can be an uplifting color related to romance and nostalgia, but dark purple isn’t quite as delicate. Dark purple is a symbol of frustration and sad feelings, so it could be a great addition to an emotional piece of art. Yet, a shade of purple could also have the meanings of regular purple instead. - Source: Internet The most obvious standout difference between them is that purple isn’t actually on the electromagnetic spectrum, but violet is. In fact, violet has the shortest wavelength of visible light that the human eye can detect. Purple is a manipulated color since you have to combine two colors to get there. - Source: Internet Purple and black are both dark colors, so they can give off a serious or eerie tone when used together in designs. The best way to make the design look more appealing is to add some lighter colors. You can also try using tints of purple to make the two colors less intimidating. - Source: Internet This may be confusing because there’s a type of light called a “black light.” However, it’s an ultraviolet light that gives off a purple glow, so it’s not actually black. There are several reasons why black can’t exist in lights even though it’s a color we see regularly. - Source: Internet You can make tints of a color by adding white paint, which will make it look lighter. However, adding a lot of white will also make the purple look paler. It’s best to add white to regular purple rather than dark purple because otherwise the black and white would clash and make the mixture look duller. - Source: Internet Following are some suggestions on where to begin your search for data on 23 Colors That Go Perfectly with Purple, Approved by Designers:\rYou should try to find Deep Purple Color-related information from reputable places.

If you mix all three primary colors together, you’ll usually get a type of brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Per Nelums, the versatility of the colors extends beyond a limited set of styles and stereotypical gender preferences—fellas, don&rsquo;t be afraid of the shade. Pair plum with teal or navy for a rich, luxurious statement, or go with violet and golden hues to connote royalty and wisdom. Then there’s lilac, lavender, and the lighter ends of the <strong>purple</strong> spectrum—those can go minimalist, modern, or cozy and country depending on the accents you choose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you ask designer Marissa Nelums, <strong>purple</strong> does not deserve the bad reputation it sometimes has. “In client questionnaires, we ask which colors they don’t like, and I have seen <strong>purple</strong> come up quite a bit,” she says. “People think it’s too harsh, too bright, and can get gaudy. But, to me, it’s like the perfect dress—the one you can wear with sneakers and high heels.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you run out of <strong>purple</strong> or black paint, there’s no need to panic. Most colors can be made from scratch by using other paint colors. Purple is an easy color to make because it’s a secondary color created with 50% red and 50% blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Complementary color combinations are the colors that sit on opposite sides of the color wheel. Combining these colors creates an effect of high contrast, catching the eye and leaving quite an impact. Examples: red and green, yellow and <strong>purple</strong>, orange and blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Our brains are hardwired to react to and remember color combinations. If you close your eyes right now and think of three famous brands, chances are you’ll be able to conjure up the company’s logo colors right away. Starbucks: green and white. Ikea: blue and yellow. FedEx: <strong>purple</strong> and orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sitting on the color spectrum between blue and red, <strong>purple</strong> is historically associated with royalty and rarity. In recent times, designers have rediscovered <strong>purple</strong>’s more intriguing and creative affiliations with spirituality, mystery and originality. From Byzantine emperors to the lyrics of a Prince song, <strong>purple</strong> has a diverse and fascinating cultural history, and its mystique and drama continue to inspire designers today. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The only downside is that black and <strong>purple</strong> don’t make a vibrant dark <strong>purple</strong>, but instead, the result looks a little muddy. It could even look more black than <strong>purple</strong>. Thus, it’s not commonly used in art pieces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Magenta is a dark yet vibrant shade of pink that’s incredibly versatile. Its <strong>purple</strong> undertones work really well with lavender to give you a warm, inviting color combo that works great for any room. Of course, you could also throw in a few <strong>pop</strong>s of gold or silver for a fun added touch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cyan can be a tricky shade of blue to pair, but the hot pink and cyan color combination really works. It’s bubblegum <strong>pop</strong> meets cyberpunk dystopia — a twist on the classic baby pink and baby blue. These bright, high contrast colors embody an excitement that is ideal for an alternative take on more playful brands. Think vape juice labels or scene/punk branding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Scientific evidence, however, points to a much clearer definition of both <strong>purple</strong> and violet. While <strong>purple</strong> is a mix of red and blue, violet is considered to be a ‘spectral’ color. This means that violet occupies its own place at the end of the spectrum of light and has its own wavelength as a result. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Designer Renvy Graves Pittman says at the far end of the spectrum, you have rich aubergines—which Mario Buatta was famous for using in his work. At the opposing end is lavender, while mid-range colors like amethyst establish a base point even better than a true, royal <strong>purple</strong>. Designer Henry Prideaux notes that it is quite a versatile, &ldquo;sometimes regal&rdquo; color, which makes <strong>purple</strong> a great option when designing traditional and contemporary interiors alike. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once you get <strong>purple</strong>, you can use that to dive into the assortment of shades from lighter tones to darker ones. Just take care not to mix too much of any color. This can cause you to blot out the <strong>purple</strong>, leaving you with a completely different color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This bold color combination immediately draws your eye to the center of the logo. The vibrant red and unique layout of the company name <strong>pop</strong>s against the happy shade of yellow, creating a sense of energy and playfulness. We love this color pairing for its versatility - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This one’s an unconventional color palette, but teal and <strong>purple</strong> look great together so long as one remains the dominant color. Here, we’ve used a soft lavender to create contrast against a darker background. This color combination is moody and magical. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple’s complementary color is yellow because <strong>purple</strong> sits opposite yellow on the color spectrum. This means that citrus shades are the perfect balancing color contrast for <strong>purple</strong>. Look to yellow’s close neighbors, orange and lime green, for more color palette options that bring out the best in <strong>purple</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With primary colors, you get your usual red, yellow, and blue. Once you move onto the secondary colors, you’re looking at orange, green, and <strong>purple</strong>. The tertiary colors come into play when you mix the primary and secondary colors, and these include yellow-orange, yellow-green, blue-green, blue-violet, red-violet and red-orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple is also associated historically with femininity, sensuality, and sometimes vanity. This link has been given new ownership and a radical reshaping by the feminist movement, which has adopted <strong>purple</strong> as its symbolic color. The color is also often associated with the LGBTQ community. It’s the symbolic color of Spirit Day, an annual event that shows support for young people who are bullied because of their sexual orientation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Unfortunately, it’s not possible to mix <strong>purple</strong> and black in lights because lights cannot be black. Lights are mixed using RGB, which is an additive color model. Red, green, and blue are the primary colors, and they can all combine to make white. Yet, black isn’t present on this color model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To find the colors and exact hex codes that go with <strong>purple</strong>, use our color combinations tool. It shows you monochromatic, analogous, triadic, and contrasting color palettes for a variety of <strong>purple</strong> shades. Try a scheme with <strong>purple</strong>, violet, mauve, or lilac. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a very royal color palette. Yellow and <strong>purple</strong> are the perfect complementary color scheme, but the gradient here adds a new level of dimension to this logo design. This is a very warm gradient, blending yellow and orange to make a rich, honey-colored gold. Very uplifting and perfect for a wellness business! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A delicate pink paired with navy blue gives off a playful yet trustworthy vibe. The navy <strong>pop</strong>s against the light background, creating a beautiful contrast. Consider this pairing for a logo if you’re in the beauty, blogging, or wedding industries. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The soft reddish tone of terra cotta evokes intense feelings of nature and earth. It’s also the most <strong>pop</strong>ular material for flower pots. If you have lavender décor, consider adding a few terra cotta pots, perhaps planted with lavender plants, to liven up the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple symbolizes mystery, royalty, and imagination. It’s meant to enlighten, inspire, and encourage. It has many positive meanings like compassion, wisdom, and creativity, but it can also have negative characteristics like sensitive, vigilant, or immature. It depends on the context you use dark <strong>purple</strong> in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dark <strong>purple</strong> is already a shade of <strong>purple</strong>, which means black was added to make it look darker. So, you probably won’t need to make it darker, but if you do, you can add a little more black. A little black paint can go a long way, so only use it sparingly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once you&rsquo;ve determined the feel you&rsquo;re going for—a lively spot for entertaining or a soothing retreat from it all—that can navigate your decision to finding the right shade of <strong>purple</strong>. From there, it&rsquo;s all about finding the right color pairings that will make the color sing, whether it&rsquo;s used in the form of accent pillows or lacquered onto the walls. We asked top designers to share their favorite colors that go with <strong>purple</strong> to inspire a <strong>purple</strong> room of your own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><strong>purple</strong> color scheme incorporates yellow. Purple’s cousins, magenta and violet, are complementary to yellow-green and yellow-orange respectively. An analogous <strong>purple</strong> color scheme uses the colors bordering <strong>purple</strong> on either side of the color wheel, in this case magenta and violet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The two colors that make <strong>purple</strong> are red and blue. If you look at a traditional painter’s color wheel, you’ll see that <strong>purple</strong> sits between red and blue. (See below for notes on blue’s true neighbor color, violet.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You won’t have to look much further than sage green and dark <strong>purple</strong> to create color harmony. Green is one of those colors that goes well with <strong>purple</strong>. These two can be extremely complementary colors when selected in contrasting shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If it’s intelligence, confidence, and trust that you’re after for your logo, try combining blue and turquoise. The colors are from the same color family but are different enough to create a striking duo, with the turquoise used sparingly. Tasteful use of bright colors can really make a design <strong>pop</strong>! Bright teal pairs well with almost any darker, muted color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Let’s take yellow, for instance. Adding just the right amount of the main yellow tone or even one of the many shades of yellow can help you change <strong>purple</strong> to a different tint. These <strong>purple</strong>s are usually more muted and can work out quite well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Easily capture anyone’s attention with a bright <strong>purple</strong> gradient. Purple communicates royalty, luxury, and power as well as creativity, fun, and wisdom. When paired with a lighter color of a similar shade, your logo will feel balanced and luxurious. Pink and <strong>purple</strong> might seem like a youthful color combination, but a gradient helps to mature the visual impact and add a modern flair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple has ancient roots as a color that was linked directly to royalty and rarity. This is because as early as the 15th century BC <strong>purple</strong> dye (known as Tyrian <strong>purple</strong>) was sourced from a certain type of mollusk, making it a rare and special color. It was reserved for Roman magistrates, Byzantine emperors and, later, by Roman Catholic bishops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are many historical sources pointing to <strong>purple</strong> as an exclusive color for the noble sectors of society. In Japan, it’s associated with the Emperor and the aristocracy. In the 20th century modern monarchs continued to use the color symbolically, such as the British royal family, who chose it for their ceremonial dress and stationery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Working with the color theory wheel is the best way to start when choosing your logo colors. The color wheel contains warm colors (red, yellow, orange) on the left side and cool colors (blue, green, and <strong>purple</strong>) on the right. Understanding the relationship between colors and how they interact on the color wheel is the key to successful design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Black and <strong>purple</strong> are two dark colors, but they can evoke very different emotions. Purple is a color of imagination and mystery, while black is related to power and sophistication. Yet, they can work well together in designs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><strong>purple</strong> color scheme uses tints, tones, and shades to create an entirely <strong>purple</strong> palette. A complementary <strong>purple</strong> color scheme incorporates yellow. Purple’s cousins, magenta and violet, are complementary to yellow-green and yellow-orange respectively. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pale gray is a soft, soothing color with muted tones that are perfect alongside a pale lavender. You can go for gray furniture with a few lavender accents or go all out and paint your walls your favorite pale <strong>purple</strong>. Choose a gray with cool undertones for the best look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Why is <strong>purple</strong> divisive? Perhaps in part because <strong>purple</strong> has long been associated with ambiguity, mystery, and magic. Treading the line between aggressive red and restrained blue, <strong>purple</strong> occupies a cryptic middle ground. While light <strong>purple</strong> can evoke feelings of romance and nostalgia, darker <strong>purple</strong>s can feel gloomier, moodier, and provoke feelings of sadness and frustration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Light <strong>purple</strong> can be an uplifting color related to romance and nostalgia, but dark <strong>purple</strong> isn’t quite as delicate. Dark <strong>purple</strong> is a symbol of frustration and sad feelings, so it could be a great addition to an emotional piece of art. Yet, a shade of <strong>purple</strong> could also have the meanings of regular <strong>purple</strong> instead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The most obvious standout difference between them is that <strong>purple</strong> isn’t actually on the electromagnetic spectrum, but violet is. In fact, violet has the shortest wavelength of visible light that the human eye can detect. Purple is a manipulated color since you have to combine two colors to get there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple and black are both dark colors, so they can give off a serious or eerie tone when used together in designs. The best way to make the design look more appealing is to add some lighter colors. You can also try using tints of <strong>purple</strong> to make the two colors less intimidating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This may be confusing because there’s a type of light called a “black light.” However, it’s an ultraviolet light that gives off a <strong>purple</strong> glow, so it’s not actually black. There are several reasons why black can’t exist in lights even though it’s a color we see regularly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can make tints of a color by adding white paint, which will make it look lighter. However, adding a lot of white will also make the <strong>purple</strong> look paler. It’s best to add white to regular <strong>purple</strong> rather than dark <strong>purple</strong> because otherwise the black and white would clash and make the mixture look duller. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c7/e9/16/c7e916473838b1217e3b58f8f203f3d9--phone-backgrounds-planets.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="What Color Makes Purple Pop - Purple Color Palette">
