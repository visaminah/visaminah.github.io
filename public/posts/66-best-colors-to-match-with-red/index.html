We’ve all heard it… most likely more than once…. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=2><li>Turquoise. Yes, yes and yes! This may seem oddly specific. I mean, why didn’t I just say blue?

Throw in some additional <strong>red</strong> accents (a necklace or bold <strong>red</strong> lips) and you’ll have a show stopper look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Wear <strong>red</strong> with bravery. Certain color pairings can tone the charge of <strong>red</strong> down, making it look relatively subtle, while other <strong>colors</strong> enhance its warmth.

The same rules for finding the right shade of <strong>red</strong> lipstick apply. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li><ol start=28><li>Secondary Colors.

Try adding in a <strong>red</strong> book, blanket, or a few pillows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Whilst baby blue and bright <strong>red</strong> are very much opposites on the color spectrum, there’s a definite and somewhat surprising harmony when pai<strong>red</strong> together, and crimson really is one of the <strong>colors</strong> that go with blue. To get the <strong>colors</strong> really right then consider the finish of the paint you use. The trick is to select a matt and chalky powder blue finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Forget thinking about only Christmas when dealing with <strong>red</strong> and green.

Something like a little <strong>red</strong> eucalyptus in a vase is a great start. Test swatches – if painting your walls <strong>red</strong>, always do test swatches. You want to make sure you get the right shade you are after. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Mint green, Listerine, and sage, which are also unexpected choices, bring the depth and heat of <strong>red</strong> out, and create high contrast looks that work. Think an aqua green top, worn with a matcha green bracelet, and a bright <strong>red</strong> handbag. Tuck a mint green tank top into a dressy <strong>red</strong> skirt. Or make a minty silk dress more interesting with a show-stopping <strong>red</strong> accessory. A little <strong>red</strong> goes a long way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=26><li>Red Kitchen Cabinetry. With an elegant muted tone, this <strong>red</strong> kitchen makes a remarkable statement. The walls and built-in shelves follow the same monochrome concept. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li><ol start=14><li>Coral Red and Minty Green.

The mint green c<strong>red</strong>enza contrasts the gorgeous hue while standing out with the charming design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Colors that go with <strong>red</strong> are tricky to pin down - <strong>red</strong> is one of the punchiest <strong>colors</strong> in the color wheel. Danger, fire, love, and anger. These are just a few of the things which, throughout life and for better or worse, we are told the color <strong>red</strong> represents and because of this it is often deemed too strong for decorating certain rooms at home - the very opposite of all the soothing <strong>colors</strong> that go with grey. But is that always the case, we ask? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pink is the perfect complementary color to <strong>red</strong>. It is <strong>red</strong>&rsquo;s closest color friend, and as a result, the combination makes for a well-matched decorating scheme. For best results opt for a softer Etruscan or earthy <strong>red</strong> tone when thinking about <strong>colors</strong> to go with pink, as it tends to pair together more tonally than brights. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=18><li>Red Color Accents. When the neutral color scheme looks too flat, it is time to add bold accents. Adding cozy throw pillows in a rich <strong>red</strong> tone will instantly update the space. It pairs perfectly with bright white and creamy tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Which direction does your bedroom face? If the window faces south, then you’re onto a winner. South-facing rooms have an ever-glow characteristic. They sit facing south, and as such have the best placement towards natural - warm - sunlight. Match a south-facing window bedroom with the right color of <strong>red</strong>. Ideally, this is a chalky, matt color of <strong>red</strong>, such as this Sang De Boeuf shade from paint brand Edward Bulmer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pink is an unexpected choice, and yet it works—especially a light pink. Try a pale pink dress, or one that combines both hues for a simpler choice. If you’re just foraying into wearing <strong>red</strong>, adding a <strong>red</strong> handbag is a great option. You can even bring a powerful punch to your work wardrobe with a <strong>red</strong> tote bag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>– if you’re just starting out and want to add <strong>red</strong> but are a little leary, don’t go too big.

Try foliage – on that same note, you can add in <strong>red</strong> foliage as a non-committal way to see if you will like <strong>red</strong>. Something like a little <strong>red</strong> eucalyptus in a vase is a great start. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Lilac greys work well with <strong>red</strong> in a living room. Red can look particularly sumptuous in a living room, but “avoid teaming with white”, says Farrow & Ball color creator Joa Studholme. This contradicts the general inclination and move that most people make when forming living room ideas, which is to try and balance a strong <strong>red</strong> with the most popular neutral - white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Modern Homes: pretty much any shade of <strong>red</strong> will do. Classic shades to deep and dark shades and everything in between. Think modern art with bright shades of <strong>red</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Like a classic <strong>red</strong> lipstick, the color <strong>red</strong> in an interior design scheme is timeless, bold, and undeniably sexy.

Something as simple as a piece of modern art on the wall or a little pop of <strong>red</strong> in a blanket or pillow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Red and purple aren’t usually the first two <strong>colors</strong> you would think to pair together given that they are located on opposite ends of the spectrum—but they can deliver quite the punch. It really all comes down to picking the right hues. You will want to make sure that the <strong>colors</strong> you choose are in the same tone range. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“Powder blue is actually the perfect partner for a bright and bold pillar box <strong>red</strong> shade," says paint and decorating guru Annie Sloan. “It instantly cools the fiery tendencies of the <strong>red</strong> and has connotations of fun and playful mid-century decor. Think American Diner, or indeed those beautifully playful blue and <strong>red</strong> Italian kitchens and cafe schemes of the 1950s era - powder blue and pillar box <strong>red</strong>? It’s tried and tested!” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=12><li>Pairing Red Violet and Green. A gorgeous violet <strong>red</strong> is a bold color choice for an elegant bedroom. A bright green will help it stand out while letting the <strong>red</strong> remain the dominant color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Denim is spectacular with <strong>red</strong>—it makes it casual and cool. Keep it simple in a <strong>red</strong> sweater, an inc<strong>red</strong>ible turtleneck, a silk button-down, or a cherry-and-white classic Breton shirt with a pair of jeans, or, for work, a pair of denim trousers. Any fade will work, from very washed to navy blue. Elevate denim and <strong>red</strong> with a chic black or camel handbag. If you’re wearing an all-<strong>red</strong> outfit, tone it down with a pair of playful and chic denim sneakers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You know how people always say it&rsquo;s important to find your power color? Essentially, the idea is to pinpoint that one color (or a few) that you can count on to look best on you no matter what. Well, that decision comes down to how well a shade complements your natural coloring.
