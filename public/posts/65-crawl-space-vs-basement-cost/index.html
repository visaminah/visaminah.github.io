We’d advise staying well away from these tasks, as well as those relating to the installation of your electrical panels, removal of hazardous materials (like asbestos), and digging out a basement if you don’t already have one. Consider money spent here as an investment- now’s not the time to save a few bucks. - Source: Internet When soil freezes (due to its moisture contents), it can expand and heave, putting pressure on a foundation, which can cause it to crack or shift. In order to stabilize any foundation, its footings must lie beneath the frost level: the depth to which the ground will freeze in any given region. In southern states like Florida, the ground rarely freezes, and if it does, it’s only to a depth of an inch or two, so a slab foundation with typical footings 24 inches below grade is sufficient for stability. In a state such as Kansas, however, where the frost level is 34 inches below grade, a crawl space foundation is more suitable, and its support walls will have footings constructed below the 34-inch mark to stabilize the foundation. - Source: Internet Foundations serve the incredibly important function of keeping your home in place when the ground beneath it moves, keeping moisture out, providing insulation, and keeping your house level. This article should provide you with a good idea regarding what basement foundations can offer. Basement foundations are sunken below the ground, making this type of foundation ideal for homeowners looking to maximize their living space. While the basement foundation may not be perfect for every building, any homebuilder should consider this type of foundation as they plan out the construction of their home. - Source: Internet Crawl space foundations must be vented to reduce moisture accumulation, but that ventilation also permits frigid air to blow beneath the house. Cold temperatures in a crawl space can transfer through the floor joists and subflooring to the living areas above, so owners of houses on crawl space foundations will spend more to keep their homes comfortable. To combat this problem, most building codes require insulation to be installed on the interior of foundation walls and also between the floor joists. While this reduces cold transfer, it doesn’t completely eliminate it, and in cold regions, plumbing that lies within crawl spaces may also have to be insulated or require the application of electrical heat tape to keep pipes from freezing. - Source: Internet When constructed correctly, both types of foundation can be expected to last 50 years or more, but crawl space foundations tend to require more maintenance to prevent mold and insect infestations. Crawl space walls are also more likely to require structural repairs, especially in regions where the soil is high in clay content. (Clay-type soil swells when it becomes saturated and puts lateral pressure on foundation walls, which can lead to cracks and foundation shifts.) - Source: Internet A partial basement is one where only a portion of the basement is a space big enough to stand in. The rest might be similar to a crawl space. None: Structures with no basement at all can be built on a slab foundation (like a garage), directly onto the ground (like a shed), or sit on stilts/pylons (like a cabin or mobile home). - Source: Internet In regions that see a lot of rain, the area within a crawl space can retain a measure of water, creating a moist, soggy environment that leads to mold growth and increased the risk of wood rot in floor joists and subflooring. Being constructed from solid concrete, slab foundations are impervious to moisture. Additionally, during construction, a vapor barrier (typically polyethylene or polyolefin sheeting) is placed beneath the slab to prevent the concrete from absorbing ground moisture and becoming damp. This is important because while concrete can’t be damaged by water, without a barrier it can absorb and transfer moisture through the slab, which could then affect the flooring above. Vapor barriers make slab foundations a better option in damp climates where the ground is often saturated. - Source: Internet Not to be confused with ”finished”, a full basement refers to the space being big enough to stand in. This type of basement can be used for living space or storage and typically increases the value of a home. Partial: A partial basement is one where only a portion of the basement is a space big enough to stand in. The rest might be similar to a crawl space. - Source: Internet Unfortunately, if you talk to just about any foundation repair expert, you’re probably going to hear that this is a bad idea. Many homeowners don’t know why this could be a bad idea and want to understand why their crawl space is fine the way it is. Here’s a complete rundown of the process so you can understand why digging out your crawl space is a bad idea. - Source: Internet A basement foundation secures a house a floor below the ground. It can be unfinished or finished to add living space. Basement foundations tend to suffer from moisture problems and sometimes mold. A sump pump can help address moisture issues. - Source: Internet Adding a basement foundation comes with a significant cost and it can escalate should you choose to finish the basement. But a finished basement can increase living space and increase your home’s value so you’ll have to weigh the cost vs. reward. - Source: Internet While the final cost of any foundation depends on the size and complexity of the home’s floor plan and the average cost of construction in a specific community, an average slab foundation runs approximately $7,500 to $12,000, while a crawl space foundation will cost approximately $8,000 to $21,000. In addition to higher excavation costs for crawl space walls, additional digging is required in order to bury water and sewer lines below the frost level. In a slab foundation, plumbing is located within the slab itself, so less work is required during installation and fewer labor costs are incurred. - Source: Internet Basement foundations are a popular choice for a variety of home builders these days. Unlike pier and beam foundations or concrete foundations, basement foundations sink deep into the ground, making it ideal for homeowners trying to squeeze extra living space into their new homes. Keep reading to learn more about the pros and cons of basement house foundations, the different types of basements, and the cost of repairing basement foundations. Plus, you’ll also get to see how basement foundations stack up against other foundation types. - Source: Internet Unfortunately, it is very common for crawl spaces to have moisture issues. But on the bright side, it is not hard or expensive to fix problems of dampness. However, if your basement or crawl space is completely flooded, you may have some far bigger issues to deal with. - Source: Internet This process definitely isn’t one you should pursue in your home just because you’re looking for extra storage space. The risk associated with digging out your crawl space is immense, even if you don’t recognize it at first. You could essentially give your home foundation problems even if it doesn’t have those problems right now, and why would you want to disrupt a perfectly good foundation? - Source: Internet The first problem is that digging out a crawl space is immensely expensive. The process is very long and very difficult. Plus, it requires a lot of expertise. When digging out a crawl space, the building crew needs to know how to do every part perfectly. You’re not just paying for the work the crew is doing; you’re also paying for their knowledge and dedication surrounding the process of digging out the crawl space. - Source: Internet A walk-out basement is exactly what it sounds- a basement with its own entrance that you can walk out of. These are most often seen in homes that are built into a hill- whether natural or artificially landscaped. Due to their aesthetically pleasing design, this type of basement can add significant value to a home. Walk-up: A walk-up basement is different from a walk-out basement in that most walk-up basements contain dug-in stairs that go from the ground level down to the basement level as an entry/exit. - Source: Internet For some homeowners, the concept of turning a crawl space into a basement is a very interesting one. This might occur because you have a crawl space right now that you don’t use very often, and you’re wondering whether you would use a basement more frequently. Many call the process of turning a crawl space into a basement “digging out” the crawl space, and you might wonder whether digging out your crawl space is a good idea. - Source: Internet Crawl spaces can work well in dry climates, climates prone to flooding and in slopped regions. These foundations work better in earthquake regions and with soils that are more prone to sliding. In addition, crawl space foundations provide easy access to plumbing and wiring and a way to easily check for terminate and other vermin. A well-insulated crawl space can provide good ventilation and offer a storage area. In addition, wood is typically the material of choice for crawl space foundations, making them more comfortable to walk on. - Source: Internet Most basements have a height of around eight feet, like most homes, which means there’s going to be a lot of dirt the construction crew has to dig out. That means this is typically a very long and involved process. Plus, the construction crew has to make sure the basement has the right proportions and preparation to ensure maximum structural stability. - Source: Internet When you first embark on the process of digging out your crawl space, you’ll have a foundation repair expert come in and inspect the foundation. They should be able to tell whether your foundation and the rest of your home’s structure have any problems. If that initial inspection comes back completely clear, you may be a “good candidate” for digging out your crawl space. However, the initial inspection doesn’t necessarily tell the whole story. - Source: Internet Some people wonder whether a basement may be easier to take care of than a crawl space. After all, a basement allows for someone to go down into it, whereas crawl spaces often don’t have enough space for home residents to go into on a regular basis. Plus, if you have a dirt crawl space, you probably don’t want to go down there. Dirt crawl spaces can also have serious health concerns, including pests and moisture rising up from the ground. - Source: Internet If your building’s floors begin to sink or settle, a number of different issues may develop that pose a threat to its structure. It is quite common for foundations to sink and settle when temperature changes cause soil to move beneath a home’s foundation and excessive moisture to get into crawl spaces and beam structures. Sometimes, poorly constructed homes can also fall victim to adverse weather events, leading to increased foundation sinking. - Source: Internet Full basement foundations are as large as the house’s perimeter, and the entire basement floor is submerged below the ground. This type of basement lacks windows, and if it has them, they’ll be small and at ground level. Full basements can be unfinished or finished with drywall, flooring, and storage space. Finished basements will obviously cost builders quite a bit more. Aside from being the most expensive foundation, this type of basement is often more susceptible to dampness and mold. - Source: Internet Plenty of people want more living space in their homes. You may be thinking that a basement could be the perfect place to add more living space. While this is a great added bonus of a basement, the difficulties of digging out a crawl space make it the wrong choice for anyone who’s looking for more square footage in their home. - Source: Internet Slabs are solid and thick (24 inches compared to eight-inch-thick crawl space walls), making slabs stronger than crawl spaces. In addition, since slab foundations are not built in regions where the soil freezes, owners of homes on slabs have very little to worry about when it comes to soil movement. However, homeowners with slabs should not plant trees with invasive root systems, such as willows, less than 50 feet away from the foundation. Planted too close to the house, large roots could easily develop under the slab and push it upward, which can cause a slab to crack. - Source: Internet A properly encapsulated crawl space can be a great place for you to store things. In fact, when you encapsulate your crawl space, you can typically go in and out of the crawl space on your own, rather than only having an expert enter your crawl space for inspections. Encapsulating the crawl space is a great way to maximize your home’s storage space without having to dig into the basement. - Source: Internet This is exactly why the process is so expensive. It’s hard to estimate how expensive the process is because the price will vary from crew to crew and from home to home. However, it will certainly be extremely expensive — typically even more expensive than adding a room onto your home. If you enter into this process, you should expect that you’re going to have to pay a lot of money to accomplish your goal of eventually having a basement in your home. - Source: Internet When designing your basement, consider the principal source of heat. Many consider a gas fireplace to be a great option for a basement. Besides the obvious aesthetic advantages- who doesn’t love a fireplace? – there are some benefits to placing a fireplace in the basement as opposed to elsewhere in the house. For example, the heat produced will be recycled as it rises through the rest of the house. And you may also be able to vent the chimney directly through the side wall instead of through the roof. - Source: Internet Unfortunately, there may be hidden problems that haven’t made themselves known yet. They certainly will make themselves known if you continue to go through the process of digging out the crawl space, however. When you run into those problems throughout the process, it will increase the risk, cost, and time associated with the project. - Source: Internet This is just the average. It can cost less, like $30 or more, about $70 per square foot. This means that if you want to build a 1,500-square-foot basement, it’ll cost you anywhere between $45,000 and $112,500. - Source: Internet It’s also important to inform your home insurance provider if you use your basement as a source of income, as there are different risks associated with renting out a portion of your home. And, if you plan on finishing or renovating your basement, be sure to let your insurance provider know before you start work. Most home insurance policies contain a requirement that you notify your insurance provider before modifying the home. Advance notice will allow your home insurance provider to confirm that your coverage will stay in place during the work, and that building materials and completed finishes will be covered in case anything goes wrong along the way. - Source: Internet As the term implies, a slab foundation is a thick concrete slab on top of which a house is built. A crawl space foundation features exterior concrete walls that elevate the bottom of the house 18 inches or higher above grade (ground level), providing an accessible area to reach plumbing and wiring should it need maintenance in the future. Crawl space foundations usually require additional support walls beneath the interior of the house as well. - Source: Internet Structures with no basement at all can be built on a slab foundation (like a garage), directly onto the ground (like a shed), or sit on stilts/pylons (like a cabin or mobile home). Walk-out: A walk-out basement is exactly what it sounds- a basement with its own entrance that you can walk out of. These are most often seen in homes that are built into a hill- whether natural or artificially landscaped. Due to their aesthetically pleasing design, this type of basement can add significant value to a home. - Source: Internet Your home insurance provider will require more details than simply the number of floors in your home. They’ll likely ask whether you have a full or partial basement, and ask the degree to which it’s finished. Insurers will also want to know if there are any signs of pooling water or leaks coming from the doors or window wells in your basement. For homeowners with a crawl space, you may find that the minimum requirement for insurance is a ground covering. - Source: Internet Basement foundations are a type of foundation that supports the structural integrity of your house or building. Like most standard foundations, basements distribute a building’s weight evenly, secure the building to the ground, and stop moisture from getting in. However, unlike other foundations, basement foundations are fully submerged in the ground to create space for underground living space. There are three main types of basement foundations: full basement foundations, daylight basement foundations, and crawl space foundations. The differences between these types of basement foundations are explained below. - Source: Internet Although you won’t be able to finish crawl spaces, they do provide easier access to piping or plumbing than standard foundations. Crawl spaces also encourage greater airflow beneath the house, helping to keep the building cooler in warm climates. Many homeowners ultimately decide to build crawl space basement foundations because they are among the least expensive and least time-consuming to build. - Source: Internet Crawl spaces are so named because they are spaces accessible only through crawling – with roughly 18 inches of clearance, they are not large enough to use as a livable space. They may, therefore, seem like a poor compromise between a full basement and a concrete slab foundation. However, they actually combine many of the benefits of both – as well as providing a solid, durable base to your home, they also provide for space to store plumbing systems and the electric panel. - Source: Internet Finishing a basement requires a significant investment, both in terms of time and money. That said, a fully finished basement is a great addition to your home. It adds value and gives you the option to rent a part of your home for additional income. So, how do you go about finishing your basement? Here are 3 key points to keep in mind. - Source: Internet The crawl space typically goes throughout the entire home and utilizes the home’s foundation. On the contrary, a basement typically has the home’s foundation underneath it. From there, you’re going to have to move your home’s current foundation to the new one, which means for some amount of time, the home will essentially have no foundation. - Source: Internet Lastly, the construction crew will need to build up the basement. Basements have walls just like the rest of the home, which means the construction crew will need to put up those walls. Additionally, if you’re planning on finishing the basement, the construction crew may need to run electricity and plumbing into the basement, the same as they would if you were finishing an already-existing basement. - Source: Internet It’s difficult to change the floor plan of a house with a slab foundation. In a slab home, plumbing is embedded in the concrete itself, so changing its configuration requires breaking out portions of the slab, which can compromise the structural integrity of the entire slab. In a home on a crawl space, however, the kitchen and bathroom location can be moved from one side of the house to the other, and the plumbing can be reconfigured within the crawl space below. - Source: Internet Next, the construction crew will pour a brand-new concrete foundation. This will form the floor of the new basement. When they pour this concrete, they need to make sure the concrete has enough strength to hold up the weight of the entire home and that the concrete won’t crack or start to slide out of place after a while. - Source: Internet As you can hopefully see, digging out your crawl space is much more trouble than it’s worth. It can take a long time, cause a lot of damage to your home, and even result in irreversible damage if the building crew does it improperly. Mistakes can even cause a lasting impact in a way they often don’t in other scenarios. - Source: Internet Crawl space stem wall foundations are short foundations that have walls on concrete footings or stem walls that serve as the foundations of a house. Crawl spaces create a small area underneath a house that is just big enough to crawl through. Many homeowners keep storage or furnaces in their crawl spaces. Because crawl spaces are not as deep in the ground as full basement foundations, it is much less expensive to build houses with crawl space foundations. - Source: Internet Basements tend to be one of the best places for people to store things. If you have a home that already has a basement, it’s true that you can use this basement as a storage solution. However, this usefulness in storage may be something that you don’t have to wait for. Instead of turning your crawl space into a basement and taking on all the risks associated with that process, why not just encapsulate your crawl space? - Source: Internet Pier and beam foundations are typically found with older homes and elevate the home, which makes it less prone to flooding. But since it’s elevated, pests and critters can gain entry to the crawl space. They can cause damage to the beams over time. - Source: Internet To allow for proper airflow, prevent moisture or keep critters out, many homeowners will opt to add foundation insulation like skirting and vents around the crawl space or pier and beam foundation. Some will even add spray foam, foam board, or batts between or across the bottom of the joists to add more insulation under the floor. On average, foundation installation costs about $2,000. - Source: Internet While both foundation types are used extensively, each one is best suited to specific situations and conditions. Keep reading to find out the seven biggest differences between two popular foundation types—slab vs. crawl space—so you can make the best decision when you have a new home built. - Source: Internet Daylight basements, also known as walkout basements, are common for houses built on a slope. One side of this type of basement is submerged, and the other is aboveground. This type of basement lets in some natural light and are less susceptible to mold or moisture. For homeowners who want patios or entrances in their basements, daylight basements are ideal. - Source: Internet Instead, you may want to consider converting your patio or part of your backyard to a room in your home. Although converting a patio to a home room is an extended project and one that can be fairly difficult, it’s still much easier than trying to dig out your crawl space. This can be a great way to add to your home without having to dig underneath it. - Source: Internet Next, you need to dig out your current crawl space. Whether you have an encapsulated or unencapsulated crawl space, this process is basically the same. Typically, the construction crew will bring in power tools that can help them move large amounts of dirt out of the hole. They’ll monitor the home stilts and move them to shift the home’s weight as they dig out the crawl space. - Source: Internet Lastly, digging out your crawl space is very risky. You’re basically leaving your home with an unstable foundation for some time while the construction crew works on the new foundation and tries to shift over your home’s current weight. If there are any problems or mistakes, your home could basically collapse. - Source: Internet To handle this problem, the construction crew will typically craft a stilt-like structure underneath the home. It will support the entirety of the home while the crew handles the rest of the steps to turn the crawl space into the basement. However, this does mean that you won’t be able to live in the home during this period. - Source: Internet Regardless of the reason you were considering digging out your crawl space, it’s often better to encapsulate the crawl space instead. An encapsulated crawl space can serve as a storage space that’s just as effective as a basement, especially when you have a thick vapor barrier to keep it safe. Complete Basement Systems can give you a free estimate for crawl space encapsulation in your own home today. - Source: Internet According to data from the Survey of Construction, roughly 15% of new single-family homes have a crawl space foundation installed. The majority (54%) have a slab foundation, meaning that it is still the most popular choice. However, there are multiple reasons why architects and contractors may still suggest a crawl space foundation. - Source: Internet Crawl space foundations are placed several feet off footings, leaving a small protected area between the ground and the base of the house. The walls of a crawl space foundation are built partially underground and shorter than basement foundation walls. This type of foundation offers a happy medium between standard foundations and basement foundations. - Source: Internet The exception is if the house lies in a flood plain. In that case, a home on slab foundation has a greater chance of taking on water when floodwaters rise than a house that is elevated at least 18 inches on a crawl space. Fortunately, most communities enact strict building regulations that do not allow the construction of homes within designated flood plains. - Source: Internet Mold can and will eat away at your foundation until it is weak and likely to collapse under the weight of your home. Although mold can appear for many different reasons, water damage and moisture are usually the primary causes. Mold will appear if dampness remains present for too long in your foundation’s crawl space. - Source: Internet Building a basement foundation requires more effort and is more costly than building a standard foundation. Heavy-duty machines such as excavators, cranes, rollers, and forklifts are required to dig and reposition soil to make way for a basement. Sometimes, if the ground below is hard to break up, drills and specialized hammers are needed. Once the hole in the ground is big enough, the basement is created by pouring concrete or laying precast concrete slabs. - Source: Internet If you live in the Greater Chicago area and your slab or crawl space foundation is failing, who should you call?

But for more severe dampness issues, you may have to consult a foundation drainage correction service. You should also consider basement waterproofing, as this is a great way to prevent future dampness in your crawl space. While the costs of these repair jobs vary, you can get a more accurate picture by seeking a quote from professionals that have expertise in the area of basement dampness. - Source: Internet Digging out a crawl space is a huge intrusion into your life if you’re already living in a home. Although it may not be as much of an intrusion if you’re preparing a home that you haven’t moved into yet, it will still lengthen the amount of time you’re waiting to move in. Digging out the crawl space is a delicate and difficult procedure that requires plenty of man-hours. Plus, you almost certainly won’t be able to live in the home while the process is happening. - Source: Internet In the simplest terms, an unfinished basement is one that’s not designed to be lived in. Often the walls and flooring are the bare concrete of your foundation and the space may contain electrical systems, water pipes, wires and your hot water heater. A finished basement is a below-grade living space that becomes part of your home, just like any other floor. - Source: Internet However, turning a crawl space into a basement isn’t the answer for people who have issues with health concerns in the crawl space. In fact, you may have even stronger issues with the health concerns if you turn the crawl space into a basement because of the issues with basement waterproofing.

We’d advise staying well away from these tasks, as well as those relating to the installation of your electrical panels, removal of hazardous materials (like asbestos), and digging out a <strong>basement</strong> if you don’t already have one. Consider money spent here as an investment- now’s not the time to save a few bucks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When soil freezes (due to its moisture contents), it can expand and heave, putting pressure on a foundation, which can cause it to crack or shift. In order to stabilize any foundation, its footings must lie beneath the frost level: the depth to which the ground will freeze in any given region. In southern states like Florida, the ground rarely freezes, and if it does, it’s only to a depth of an inch or two, so a slab foundation with typical footings 24 inches below grade is sufficient for stability. In a state such as Kansas, however, where the frost level is 34 inches below grade, a <strong>crawl</strong> space foundation is more suitable, and its support walls will have footings constructed below the 34-inch mark to stabilize the foundation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Foundations serve the incredibly important function of keeping your home in place when the ground beneath it moves, keeping moisture out, providing insulation, and keeping your house level. This article should provide you with a good idea regarding what <strong>basement</strong> foundations can offer. Basement foundations are sunken below the ground, making this type of foundation ideal for homeowners looking to maximize their living space. While the <strong>basement</strong> foundation may not be perfect for every building, any homebuilder should consider this type of foundation as they plan out the construction of their home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Crawl space foundations must be vented to reduce moisture accumulation, but that ventilation also permits frigid air to blow beneath the house. Cold temperatures in a <strong>crawl</strong> space can transfer through the floor joists and subflooring to the living areas above, so owners of houses on <strong>crawl</strong> space foundations will spend more to keep their homes comfortable. To combat this problem, most building codes require insulation to be installed on the interior of foundation walls and also between the floor joists. While this reduces cold transfer, it doesn’t completely eliminate it, and in cold regions, plumbing that lies within <strong>crawl</strong> spaces may also have to be insulated or require the application of electrical heat tape to keep pipes from freezing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When constructed correctly, both types of foundation can be expected to last 50 years or more, but <strong>crawl</strong> space foundations tend to require more maintenance to prevent mold and insect infestations. Crawl space walls are also more likely to require structural repairs, especially in regions where the soil is high in clay content. (Clay-type soil swells when it becomes saturated and puts lateral pressure on foundation walls, which can lead to cracks and foundation shifts.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A partial <strong>basement</strong> is one where only a portion of the <strong>basement</strong> is a space big enough to stand in. The rest might be similar to a <strong>crawl</strong> space. None: Structures with no <strong>basement</strong> at all can be built on a slab foundation (like a garage), directly onto the ground (like a shed), or sit on stilts/pylons (like a cabin or mobile home). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In regions that see a lot of rain, the area within a <strong>crawl</strong> space can retain a measure of water, creating a moist, soggy environment that leads to mold growth and increased the risk of wood rot in floor joists and subflooring. Being constructed from solid concrete, slab foundations are impervious to moisture. Additionally, during construction, a vapor barrier (typically polyethylene or polyolefin sheeting) is placed beneath the slab to prevent the concrete from absorbing ground moisture and becoming damp. This is important because while concrete can’t be damaged by water, without a barrier it can absorb and transfer moisture through the slab, which could then affect the flooring above. Vapor barriers make slab foundations a better option in damp climates where the ground is often saturated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Not to be confused with ”finished”, a full <strong>basement</strong> refers to the space being big enough to stand in. This type of <strong>basement</strong> can be used for living space or storage and typically increases the value of a home. Partial: A partial <strong>basement</strong> is one where only a portion of the <strong>basement</strong> is a space big enough to stand in. The rest might be similar to a <strong>crawl</strong> space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Unfortunately, if you talk to just about any foundation repair expert, you’re probably going to hear that this is a bad idea. Many homeowners don’t know why this could be a bad idea and want to understand why their <strong>crawl</strong> space is fine the way it is. Here’s a complete rundown of the process so you can understand why digging out your <strong>crawl</strong> space is a bad idea. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A <strong>basement</strong> foundation secures a house a floor below the ground. It can be unfinished or finished to add living space. Basement foundations tend to suffer from moisture problems and sometimes mold. A sump pump can help address moisture issues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Adding a <strong>basement</strong> foundation comes with a significant cost and it can escalate should you choose to finish the <strong>basement</strong>. But a finished <strong>basement</strong> can increase living space and increase your home’s value so you’ll have to weigh the cost vs. reward. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While the final cost of any foundation depends on the size and complexity of the home’s floor plan and the average cost of construction in a specific community, an average slab foundation runs approximately $7,500 to $12,000, while a <strong>crawl</strong> space foundation will cost approximately $8,000 to $21,000. In addition to higher excavation costs for <strong>crawl</strong> space walls, additional digging is required in order to bury water and sewer lines below the frost level. In a slab foundation, plumbing is located within the slab itself, so less work is required during installation and fewer labor costs are incurred. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Basement foundations are a popular choice for a variety of home builders these days. Unlike pier and beam foundations or concrete foundations, <strong>basement</strong> foundations sink deep into the ground, making it ideal for homeowners trying to squeeze extra living space into their new homes. Keep reading to learn more about the pros and cons of <strong>basement</strong> house foundations, the different types of <strong>basement</strong>s, and the cost of repairing <strong>basement</strong> foundations. Plus, you’ll also get to see how <strong>basement</strong> foundations stack up against other foundation types. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Unfortunately, it is very common for <strong>crawl</strong> spaces to have moisture issues. But on the bright side, it is not hard or expensive to fix problems of dampness. However, if your <strong>basement</strong> or <strong>crawl</strong> space is completely flooded, you may have some far bigger issues to deal with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This process definitely isn’t one you should pursue in your home just because you’re looking for extra storage space. The risk associated with digging out your <strong>crawl</strong> space is immense, even if you don’t recognize it at first. You could essentially give your home foundation problems even if it doesn’t have those problems right now, and why would you want to disrupt a perfectly good foundation? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The first problem is that digging out a <strong>crawl</strong> space is immensely expensive. The process is very long and very difficult. Plus, it requires a lot of expertise. When digging out a <strong>crawl</strong> space, the building crew needs to know how to do every part perfectly. You’re not just paying for the work the crew is doing; you’re also paying for their knowledge and dedication surrounding the process of digging out the <strong>crawl</strong> space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A walk-out <strong>basement</strong> is exactly what it sounds- a <strong>basement</strong> with its own entrance that you can walk out of. These are most often seen in homes that are built into a hill- whether natural or artificially landscaped. Due to their aesthetically pleasing design, this type of <strong>basement</strong> can add significant value to a home. Walk-up: A walk-up <strong>basement</strong> is different from a walk-out <strong>basement</strong> in that most walk-up <strong>basement</strong>s contain dug-in stairs that go from the ground level down to the <strong>basement</strong> level as an entry/exit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For some homeowners, the concept of turning a <strong>crawl</strong> space into a <strong>basement</strong> is a very interesting one. This might occur because you have a <strong>crawl</strong> space right now that you don’t use very often, and you’re wondering whether you would use a <strong>basement</strong> more frequently. Many call the process of turning a <strong>crawl</strong> space into a <strong>basement</strong> “digging out” the <strong>crawl</strong> space, and you might wonder whether digging out your <strong>crawl</strong> space is a good idea. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Crawl spaces can work well in dry climates, climates prone to flooding and in slopped regions. These foundations work better in earthquake regions and with soils that are more prone to sliding. In addition, <strong>crawl</strong> space foundations provide easy access to plumbing and wiring and a way to easily check for terminate and other vermin. A well-insulated <strong>crawl</strong> space can provide good ventilation and offer a storage area. In addition, wood is typically the material of choice for <strong>crawl</strong> space foundations, making them more comfortable to walk on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most <strong>basement</strong>s have a height of around eight feet, like most homes, which means there’s going to be a lot of dirt the construction crew has to dig out. That means this is typically a very long and involved process. Plus, the construction crew has to make sure the <strong>basement</strong> has the right proportions and preparation to ensure maximum structural stability. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you first embark on the process of digging out your <strong>crawl</strong> space, you’ll have a foundation repair expert come in and inspect the foundation. They should be able to tell whether your foundation and the rest of your home’s structure have any problems. If that initial inspection comes back completely clear, you may be a “good candidate” for digging out your <strong>crawl</strong> space. However, the initial inspection doesn’t necessarily tell the whole story. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some people wonder whether a <strong>basement</strong> may be easier to take care of than a <strong>crawl</strong> space. After all, a <strong>basement</strong> allows for someone to go down into it, whereas <strong>crawl</strong> spaces often don’t have enough space for home residents to go into on a regular basis. Plus, if you have a dirt <strong>crawl</strong> space, you probably don’t want to go down there. Dirt <strong>crawl</strong> spaces can also have serious health concerns, including pests and moisture rising up from the ground. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your building’s floors begin to sink or settle, a number of different issues may develop that pose a threat to its structure. It is quite common for foundations to sink and settle when temperature changes cause soil to move beneath a home’s foundation and excessive moisture to get into <strong>crawl</strong> spaces and beam structures. Sometimes, poorly constructed homes can also fall victim to adverse weather events, leading to increased foundation sinking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Full <strong>basement</strong> foundations are as large as the house’s perimeter, and the entire <strong>basement</strong> floor is submerged below the ground. This type of <strong>basement</strong> lacks windows, and if it has them, they’ll be small and at ground level. Full <strong>basement</strong>s can be unfinished or finished with drywall, flooring, and storage space. Finished <strong>basement</strong>s will obviously cost builders quite a bit more. Aside from being the most expensive foundation, this type of <strong>basement</strong> is often more susceptible to dampness and mold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Plenty of people want more living space in their homes. You may be thinking that a <strong>basement</strong> could be the perfect place to add more living space. While this is a great added bonus of a <strong>basement</strong>, the difficulties of digging out a <strong>crawl</strong> space make it the wrong choice for anyone who’s looking for more square footage in their home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Slabs are solid and thick (24 inches compared to eight-inch-thick <strong>crawl</strong> space walls), making slabs stronger than <strong>crawl</strong> spaces. In addition, since slab foundations are not built in regions where the soil freezes, owners of homes on slabs have very little to worry about when it comes to soil movement. However, homeowners with slabs should not plant trees with invasive root systems, such as willows, less than 50 feet away from the foundation. Planted too close to the house, large roots could easily develop under the slab and push it upward, which can cause a slab to crack. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A properly encapsulated <strong>crawl</strong> space can be a great place for you to store things. In fact, when you encapsulate your <strong>crawl</strong> space, you can typically go in and out of the <strong>crawl</strong> space on your own, rather than only having an expert enter your <strong>crawl</strong> space for inspections. Encapsulating the <strong>crawl</strong> space is a great way to maximize your home’s storage space without having to dig into the <strong>basement</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is exactly why the process is so expensive. It’s hard to estimate how expensive the process is because the price will vary from crew to crew and from home to home. However, it will certainly be extremely expensive — typically even more expensive than adding a room onto your home. If you enter into this process, you should expect that you’re going to have to pay a lot of money to accomplish your goal of eventually having a <strong>basement</strong> in your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When designing your <strong>basement</strong>, consider the principal source of heat. Many consider a gas fireplace to be a great option for a <strong>basement</strong>. Besides the obvious aesthetic advantages- who doesn’t love a fireplace? – there are some benefits to placing a fireplace in the <strong>basement</strong> as opposed to elsewhere in the house. For example, the heat produced will be recycled as it rises through the rest of the house. And you may also be able to vent the chimney directly through the side wall instead of through the roof. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Unfortunately, there may be hidden problems that haven’t made themselves known yet. They certainly will make themselves known if you continue to go through the process of digging out the <strong>crawl</strong> space, however. When you run into those problems throughout the process, it will increase the risk, cost, and time associated with the project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is just the average. It can cost less, like $30 or more, about $70 per square foot. This means that if you want to build a 1,500-square-foot <strong>basement</strong>, it’ll cost you anywhere between $45,000 and $112,500. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s also important to inform your home insurance provider if you use your <strong>basement</strong> as a source of income, as there are different risks associated with renting out a portion of your home. And, if you plan on finishing or renovating your <strong>basement</strong>, be sure to let your insurance provider know before you start work. Most home insurance policies contain a requirement that you notify your insurance provider before modifying the home. Advance notice will allow your home insurance provider to confirm that your coverage will stay in place during the work, and that building materials and completed finishes will be covered in case anything goes wrong along the way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As the term implies, a slab foundation is a thick concrete slab on top of which a house is built. A <strong>crawl</strong> space foundation features exterior concrete walls that elevate the bottom of the house 18 inches or higher above grade (ground level), providing an accessible area to reach plumbing and wiring should it need maintenance in the future. Crawl space foundations usually require additional support walls beneath the interior of the house as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Structures with no <strong>basement</strong> at all can be built on a slab foundation (like a garage), directly onto the ground (like a shed), or sit on stilts/pylons (like a cabin or mobile home). Walk-out: A walk-out <strong>basement</strong> is exactly what it sounds- a <strong>basement</strong> with its own entrance that you can walk out of. These are most often seen in homes that are built into a hill- whether natural or artificially landscaped. Due to their aesthetically pleasing design, this type of <strong>basement</strong> can add significant value to a home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Your home insurance provider will require more details than simply the number of floors in your home. They’ll likely ask whether you have a full or partial <strong>basement</strong>, and ask the degree to which it’s finished. Insurers will also want to know if there are any signs of pooling water or leaks coming from the doors or window wells in your <strong>basement</strong>. For homeowners with a <strong>crawl</strong> space, you may find that the minimum requirement for insurance is a ground covering. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Basement foundations are a type of foundation that supports the structural integrity of your house or building. Like most standard foundations, <strong>basement</strong>s distribute a building’s weight evenly, secure the building to the ground, and stop moisture from getting in. However, unlike other foundations, <strong>basement</strong> foundations are fully submerged in the ground to create space for underground living space. There are three main types of <strong>basement</strong> foundations: full <strong>basement</strong> foundations, daylight <strong>basement</strong> foundations, and <strong>crawl</strong> space foundations. The differences between these types of <strong>basement</strong> foundations are explained below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although you won’t be able to finish <strong>crawl</strong> spaces, they do provide easier access to piping or plumbing than standard foundations. Crawl spaces also encourage greater airflow beneath the house, helping to keep the building cooler in warm climates. Many homeowners ultimately decide to build <strong>crawl</strong> space <strong>basement</strong> foundations because they are among the least expensive and least time-consuming to build. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Crawl spaces are so named because they are spaces accessible only through <strong>crawl</strong>ing – with roughly 18 inches of clearance, they are not large enough to use as a livable space. They may, therefore, seem like a poor compromise between a full <strong>basement</strong> and a concrete slab foundation. However, they actually combine many of the benefits of both – as well as providing a solid, durable base to your home, they also provide for space to store plumbing systems and the electric panel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Finishing a <strong>basement</strong> requires a significant investment, both in terms of time and money. That said, a fully finished <strong>basement</strong> is a great addition to your home. It adds value and gives you the option to rent a part of your home for additional income. So, how do you go about finishing your <strong>basement</strong>? Here are 3 key points to keep in mind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>crawl</strong> space typically goes throughout the entire home and utilizes the home’s foundation. On the contrary, a <strong>basement</strong> typically has the home’s foundation underneath it. From there, you’re going to have to move your home’s current foundation to the new one, which means for some amount of time, the home will essentially have no foundation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Lastly, the construction crew will need to build up the <strong>basement</strong>. Basements have walls just like the rest of the home, which means the construction crew will need to put up those walls. Additionally, if you’re planning on finishing the <strong>basement</strong>, the construction crew may need to run electricity and plumbing into the <strong>basement</strong>, the same as they would if you were finishing an already-existing <strong>basement</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s difficult to change the floor plan of a house with a slab foundation. In a slab home, plumbing is embedded in the concrete itself, so changing its configuration requires breaking out portions of the slab, which can compromise the structural integrity of the entire slab. In a home on a <strong>crawl</strong> space, however, the kitchen and bathroom location can be moved from one side of the house to the other, and the plumbing can be reconfigured within the <strong>crawl</strong> space below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Next, the construction crew will pour a brand-new concrete foundation. This will form the floor of the new <strong>basement</strong>. When they pour this concrete, they need to make sure the concrete has enough strength to hold up the weight of the entire home and that the concrete won’t crack or start to slide out of place after a while. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As you can hopefully see, digging out your <strong>crawl</strong> space is much more trouble than it’s worth. It can take a long time, cause a lot of damage to your home, and even result in irreversible damage if the building crew does it improperly. Mistakes can even cause a lasting impact in a way they often don’t in other scenarios. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Crawl space stem wall foundations are short foundations that have walls on concrete footings or stem walls that serve as the foundations of a house. Crawl spaces create a small area underneath a house that is just big enough to <strong>crawl</strong> through. Many homeowners keep storage or furnaces in their <strong>crawl</strong> spaces. Because <strong>crawl</strong> spaces are not as deep in the ground as full <strong>basement</strong> foundations, it is much less expensive to build houses with <strong>crawl</strong> space foundations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Basements tend to be one of the best places for people to store things. If you have a home that already has a <strong>basement</strong>, it’s true that you can use this <strong>basement</strong> as a storage solution. However, this usefulness in storage may be something that you don’t have to wait for. Instead of turning your <strong>crawl</strong> space into a <strong>basement</strong> and taking on all the risks associated with that process, why not just encapsulate your <strong>crawl</strong> space? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pier and beam foundations are typically found with older homes and elevate the home, which makes it less prone to flooding. But since it’s elevated, pests and critters can gain entry to the <strong>crawl</strong> space. They can cause damage to the beams over time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To allow for proper airflow, prevent moisture or keep critters out, many homeowners will opt to add foundation insulation like skirting and vents around the <strong>crawl</strong> space or pier and beam foundation. Some will even add spray foam, foam board, or batts between or across the bottom of the joists to add more insulation under the floor. On average, foundation installation costs about $2,000. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While both foundation types are used extensively, each one is best suited to specific situations and conditions. Keep reading to find out the seven biggest differences between two popular foundation types—slab vs. <strong>crawl</strong> space—so you can make the best decision when you have a new home built. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Daylight <strong>basement</strong>s, also known as walkout <strong>basement</strong>s, are common for houses built on a slope. One side of this type of <strong>basement</strong> is submerged, and the other is aboveground. This type of <strong>basement</strong> lets in some natural light and are less susceptible to mold or moisture. For homeowners who want patios or entrances in their <strong>basement</strong>s, daylight <strong>basement</strong>s are ideal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Instead, you may want to consider converting your patio or part of your backyard to a room in your home. Although converting a patio to a home room is an extended project and one that can be fairly difficult, it’s still much easier than trying to dig out your <strong>crawl</strong> space. This can be a great way to add to your home without having to dig underneath it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Next, you need to dig out your current <strong>crawl</strong> space. Whether you have an encapsulated or unencapsulated <strong>crawl</strong> space, this process is basically the same. Typically, the construction crew will bring in power tools that can help them move large amounts of dirt out of the hole. They’ll monitor the home stilts and move them to shift the home’s weight as they dig out the <strong>crawl</strong> space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Lastly, digging out your <strong>crawl</strong> space is very risky. You’re basically leaving your home with an unstable foundation for some time while the construction crew works on the new foundation and tries to shift over your home’s current weight. If there are any problems or mistakes, your home could basically collapse. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To handle this problem, the construction crew will typically craft a stilt-like structure underneath the home. It will support the entirety of the home while the crew handles the rest of the steps to turn the <strong>crawl</strong> space into the <strong>basement</strong>. However, this does mean that you won’t be able to live in the home during this period. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Regardless of the reason you were considering digging out your <strong>crawl</strong> space, it’s often better to encapsulate the <strong>crawl</strong> space instead. An encapsulated <strong>crawl</strong> space can serve as a storage space that’s just as effective as a <strong>basement</strong>, especially when you have a thick vapor barrier to keep it safe. Complete Basement Systems can give you a free estimate for <strong>crawl</strong> space encapsulation in your own home today. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>According to data from the Survey of Construction, roughly 15% of new single-family homes have a <strong>crawl</strong> space foundation installed. The majority (54%) have a slab foundation, meaning that it is still the most popular choice. However, there are multiple reasons why architects and contractors may still suggest a <strong>crawl</strong> space foundation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Crawl space foundations are placed several feet off footings, leaving a small protected area between the ground and the base of the house. The walls of a <strong>crawl</strong> space foundation are built partially underground and shorter than <strong>basement</strong> foundation walls. This type of foundation offers a happy medium between standard foundations and <strong>basement</strong> foundations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The exception is if the house lies in a flood plain. In that case, a home on slab foundation has a greater chance of taking on water when floodwaters rise than a house that is elevated at least 18 inches on a <strong>crawl</strong> space. Fortunately, most communities enact strict building regulations that do not allow the construction of homes within designated flood plains. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Mold can and will eat away at your foundation until it is weak and likely to collapse under the weight of your home. Although mold can appear for many different reasons, water damage and moisture are usually the primary causes. Mold will appear if dampness remains present for too long in your foundation’s <strong>crawl</strong> space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Building a <strong>basement</strong> foundation requires more effort and is more costly than building a standard foundation. Heavy-duty machines such as excavators, cranes, rollers, and forklifts are required to dig and reposition soil to make way for a <strong>basement</strong>. Sometimes, if the ground below is hard to break up, drills and specialized hammers are needed. Once the hole in the ground is big enough, the <strong>basement</strong> is created by pouring concrete or laying precast concrete slabs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you live in the Greater Chicago area and your slab or <strong>crawl</strong> space foundation is failing, who should you call?

But for more severe dampness issues, you may have to consult a foundation drainage correction service. You should also consider <strong>basement</strong> waterproofing, as this is a great way to prevent future dampness in your <strong>crawl</strong> space. While the costs of these repair jobs vary, you can get a more accurate picture by seeking a quote from professionals that have expertise in the area of <strong>basement</strong> dampness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Digging out a <strong>crawl</strong> space is a huge intrusion into your life if you’re already living in a home. Although it may not be as much of an intrusion if you’re preparing a home that you haven’t moved into yet, it will still lengthen the amount of time you’re waiting to move in. Digging out the <strong>crawl</strong> space is a delicate and difficult procedure that requires plenty of man-hours. Plus, you almost certainly won’t be able to live in the home while the process is happening. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In the simplest terms, an unfinished <strong>basement</strong> is one that’s not designed to be lived in. Often the walls and flooring are the bare concrete of your foundation and the space may contain electrical systems, water pipes, wires and your hot water heater. A finished <strong>basement</strong> is a below-grade living space that becomes part of your home, just like any other floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, turning a <strong>crawl</strong> space into a <strong>basement</strong> isn’t the answer for people who have issues with health concerns in the <strong>crawl</strong> space. In fact, you may have even stronger issues with the health concerns if you turn the <strong>crawl</strong> space into a <strong>basement</strong> because of the issues with <strong>basement</strong> waterproofing. Instead, you may want to turn to <strong>crawl</strong> space encapsulation, which will make your <strong>crawl</strong> space healthier without having to turn your <strong>crawl</strong> space into a <strong>basement</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src="https://media.angieslist.com/s3fs-public/styles/widescreen_large/s3/s3fs-public/encapsulationcost.jpg?3.HyhHabOhV5pAjyTvwIY_qYFSntReKz&itok=rAvblIA3" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Crawl Space Vs Basement Cost - What Is A Crawl Space Basement">
