Almost everyone has a few reliable eyeliner pencils in basic black, and for the most part that’s a go-to color — but it doesn’t have to be.

Browns can also work well on those with a medium skin tone, while those with darker skin can look good in silver, blue or a variety of other colors. - Source: Internet If you’re going for a night out and want colors outside the spectrum of black and brown, choose something that complements your eyes. Brown eyeliner is always a safe bet with brown eyes, but dark blues or greens can make the right eye shape pop.

Try purple, green or gold until you find your style. - Source: Internet 4 Strong Contender REVLON ColorStay Ultra-Fine Tip 24 Hour Eyeliner Pencil Check Price These pencils resist all kinds of moisture from light rain to an oily complexion.
