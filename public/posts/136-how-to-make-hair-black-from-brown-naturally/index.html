The ingredients and the type of water you use will all vary, resulting in slightly different outcomes. - Source: Internet If you want to go for a more dramatic change from your natural black hair, try Auburn.

Hair dyes available in the market today are increasingly making use of natural ingredients such as henna and amla. But if you’re still averse to taking the risk, here’s how to dye hair naturally at home. - Source: Internet Do you know what’s worse than premature greying? Browning! Brown hair may be in vogue if you’ve coloured your hair on purpose, but it could the opposite if you didn’t.

There are several reasons for this, and today, we will get to the root of the problem. - Source: Internet Heat a cup of coconut oil.

Natural remedies like green tea, coffee, and other organic lighteners have to be used regularly. You can also try swimming and stay under the sun to lighten your hair naturally. - Source: Internet A dark brown natural hair dye is relatively easier to obtain. Make strong black tea or a decoction from coffee beans (the darker, the better). You can even make tea using herbs such as sage, rosemary or nettle. The use of sage is pretty common when it comes to covering up those greying strands. It is important to remember that you need to allow the brew to cool down properly before pouring it through your hair, lest you damage it. - Source: Internet Lighten your hair gradually, if possible. This is usually easier to do with DIY solutions if you’re avoiding bleach. But, it’s also the healthier way to go for your hair. If you drastically remove as much color from your hair as possible all at once, it could cause a lot of damage including breakage, split ends, and frizz.

This helps to reduce dryness and breakage caused by the chemicals. - Source: Internet The best remedy for dry, frizzy hair is hair oil. Oiling your hair at bedtime at least once or twice a week followed by shampoo the next morning can significantly improve your hair texture. It also keeps your hair protected, so the color lasts longer. - Source: Internet One more reddish-brown hair color that’s perfect for black hair is Mahogany. The red here is a little more striking. Mahogany hair may also sometimes have a purple hue, depending on which brand of hair color you’re using. The final color you achieve will be very similar to the deep brown of the Mahogany wood it is named after. - Source: Internet There are several stages your hair goes through when you bleach it. The first and one of the most important is that it begins to swell. This swelling is what allows so much damage to occur in the first place. Swelling causes the cuticles of your hair to open up.

You can also try swimming and stay under the sun to lighten your <strong>hair</strong> naturally. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A dark <strong>brown</strong> natural <strong>hair</strong> dye is relatively easier to obtain. Make strong black tea or a decoction from coffee beans (the darker, the better). You can even make tea using herbs such as sage, rosemary or nettle. The use of sage is pretty common when it comes to covering up those greying strands. It is important to remember that you need to allow the brew to cool down properly before pouring it through your <strong>hair</strong>, lest you damage it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Lighten your <strong>hair</strong> gradually, if possible. This is usually easier to do with DIY solutions if you’re avoiding bleach. But, it’s also the healthier way to go for your <strong>hair</strong>. If you drastically remove as much color from your <strong>hair</strong> as possible all at once, it could cause a lot of damage including breakage, split ends, and frizz.

My roots are about an inch or inch and half showing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Lemon juice is known to be one of the best effective methods to lighten your <strong>hair</strong> without bleach.

No matter the color you’re going for, you could be putting yourself at risk. Lightening your <strong>hair</strong> to a different shade may seem like the easiest process for a professional stylist, but it’s not any less harmful than dyeing your <strong>hair</strong> pink or purple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You must be aware of bleaching if you had dyed your <strong>hair</strong> earlier. Bleaching is a method used for lightening <strong>hair</strong>. It involves the use of heavy chemicals that results in stripping the earlocks of your <strong>hair</strong> pigment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, one of the best ‘protection methods’ that is consistently used by people who bleach their <strong>hair</strong> at home is a coconut oil application. By applying a thin layer of coconut oil all over your <strong>hair</strong> before bleaching it, you can still get the lightening effects. The coconut oil will add moisture into the exposed cuticle. This helps to reduce dryness and breakage caused by the chemicals. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best remedy for dry, frizzy <strong>hair</strong> is <strong>hair</strong> oil.

The final color you achieve will be very similar to the deep <strong>brown</strong> of the Mahogany wood it is named after. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are several stages your <strong>hair</strong> goes through when you bleach it. The first and one of the most important is that it begins to swell. This swelling is what allows so much damage to occur in the first place. Swelling causes the cuticles of your <strong>hair</strong> to open up. While this can make it look fuller and give more volume, it also makes your <strong>hair</strong> more susceptible to damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Even if you are not bleaching your black <strong>hair</strong> before coloring, <strong>hair</strong> dye itself can do some damage to your <strong>hair</strong>. The chemicals in the dye can make your rough and frizzy, making it prone to breakage. Caring for color-treated <strong>hair</strong> is extremely important, not only to keep your <strong>hair</strong> healthy but also to retain the <strong>hair</strong> color for longer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Use color-safe products . Even though you haven’t technically added any dyes or chemicals to your <strong>hair</strong> with these lightening methods, you should protect your <strong>hair</strong> by using the right products to preserve the lighter shade. Many color-safe shampoos and conditioners will contain things like UV protection. This is essential for lighter <strong>hair</strong>, as it helps it to avoid sun damage and additional breaking and drying. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>– To retain your <strong>hair</strong>’s natural black colour, rinse it with white vinegar. Mix 1 cup of vinegar with 2 cups of water and then pour it on your <strong>hair</strong>. Wait for about 10-15 minutes and then wash it off with lukewarm water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So vinegar, like raw apple cider vinegar, will leave reddish highlights in the same <strong>hair</strong> color. To start, mix apple cider vinegar 50/50 with distilled water. Next, spray it on all over to lighten all of your <strong>hair</strong>, or apply it with a cotton ball or brush for strands of highlights. Lastly, leave on for 30 minutes, rinse out, and dry as usual.on - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Not all oils are equally beneficial for making light and dull <strong>hair</strong> darker. But certain oils can do wonders for your <strong>hair</strong> color while enhancing its health, texture, and beauty to a great extent. Let’s take a look at a few oils to darken your <strong>hair</strong> naturally: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With time, the synthetic variations of Indigo Hair Colour have also gained popularity.

Well, it is not the truth. The most crucial norm for dyeing your <strong>hair</strong> is to keep a balance between your <strong>hair</strong>’s health and colour moisture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sometimes it could be more of an internal factor than an external factor. Made from special cells called melanocytes, the melanin pigment is located at the bottle of the <strong>hair</strong> follicle. In the case of Indian <strong>hair</strong>, if the cells produce more melanin, the <strong>hair</strong> strands appear darker.

You can use these natural dyes every month without worrying about <strong>hair</strong> damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Boil 3 tablespoons of cold-pressed coconut oil in a small saucepan and add a bunch of fresh henna leaves to it.
