As for further searchable items pertaining to Stihl Electric Weed Eater, they will likewise have anything to do with Best Battery Powered Weed Eater. 143 Reference List: What Is The Best Lightweight Weed Eater | Best Weed Eaters 2022: Obliterate Those Weeds With 12 Wonderful Weed Eaters Weed eaters are known as string cutters because they use nylon string instead of a conventional steel blade. This is what makes them such versatile machines. A blade is easily damaged by stones and it’s impossible to cut up to a wall or any solid surface with a blade. The nylon string is flexible so it can handle most hard objects and if the string breaks, no big deal. It’s cheap and easy to replace. - Source: Internet The difference between a commercial weed eater and a consumer-grade weed eater is the overall build quality is higher as it needs to withstand endless hours of usage and accidental bumps and knocks, day-in and day-out. Homeowner weed eaters are designed for intermittent usage and the quality of the components are not as robust or durable. Thicker metals cost more money. - Source: Internet The shaft can be curved or straight. Machines with a straight shaft usually cost more and, while this doesn’t make the machine perform better, it does offer better reach. As a tall guy, I definitely prefer a straight shaft. A weed eater with a straight shaft is also safer because you are further away from the cutter and this means that you’re further from the flying debris. - Source: Internet Best Lightweight Weed Eater under $200 WORX 40V Power Share 13″ GT Only 8.6lbs including battery, a very effective lightweight weed eater for home use. 40min battery run-time. Check Price - Source: Internet A weed eater is exactly what it sounds like because of what it caters to. It’s a lawn tool that cuts grass, low foliage, or weeds in the smaller nooks and crannies of one’s yard. You may not know this device by this name, though, as it has plenty of other variations of names, including a string trimmer, weed-whacker, brush cutter, and whipper-snipper. What makes this so different from its mower counterpart is the blade in which it uses to cut; usually made from a very fine line of monofilament, nylon, and other times a chain. - Source: Internet After installing new string, hold the weed eater in the air before engaging the throttle. Make sure that the cutting head is as far away from you as possible. This is because a blade inside the cutting guard will cut off the excess string and this flies off at high speed. - Source: Internet The size and terrain of your lawn determine what kind of weed eater you need. Smaller lawns and those with mostly grass and very few weeds need less powerful intervention. If you have a large lawn or live in an area with lots of brush and thick weeds, a more powerful trimmer can handle the chore. How often you use a trimmer also plays a role since weekly use may require a more powerful motor built to last over a long, hot summer. - Source: Internet For those that are looking for a weed eater to get some of the harder jobs, then you may need to go with a high-powered gas weed eater. These designs are made to get through the thickest of shrubbery and other foliage. Some gas-powered whackers can even get through some trees. - Source: Internet Milwaukee’s 2825-21ST Quik-Lok is another professional quality weed eater that holds bags of power and 6200 rpm. I would put it very close to the DeWalt FelxVolt on power but just slightly behind on balance, feel and flow. It glides a little bit less and I can’t ignore the handle quality on the DeWalt. - Source: Internet Check out the type of shaft your new weed eater too. The shaft is the portion of the trimmer that extends from the engine to the blade, and it’s where the transfer of power happens. Curved shafts are known to be lighter and easier to maneuver around tough-to-reach spots, whereas straight shafts will always have a longer reach. Again, this is totally dependent on your personalized needs and your particular lawn. - Source: Internet There are plenty to choose from and plenty of different features to sift through. But, again, we’ve done the dirty work for you. Below you’ll find 7 of the best weed eaters that get the job done. Sift through our finds and, while you’re at it, you may learn a thing or two about those string trimmers, what types there are as well as a few other interesting odds and ends. - Source: Internet Among the homeowners, a tool that is becoming more and more popular is the electric weed eater. The “green” alternatives of their gas-powered counterparts, these weed eaters are not only environmentally-friendly but also more lightweight, easier to use and need a little maintenance. This guide will help you in selecting the best electric weed eater. - Source: Internet Environment: A battery powered weed eater emits no pollutants. The power is provided by a lithium-ion battery pack which you simply plug into the wall to recharge. Using the same battery repeatedly helps make the best battery-powered weed trimmers a very eco-friendly tool. Energy consumption tends to be lower as well because you can easily turn the trimmer off when moving. - Source: Internet Another characteristic I particularly like about the electric weed eaters is their lightweight. In fact, these tools often weigh only a few pounds, generally under 10. This characteristic increases the maneuverability and these tools can be easily handled even by those who have less physical force. - Source: Internet When it comes to the weed eater heads, there are a few different kinds. Every head will spin in a circle to get the job done, but there are different ways of feeding that line to the blade. Here are the options: - Source: Internet We looked at 15 gas-powered weed eaters and gave you our honest perspective of each. We also looked at where they are made or said to have been made. Here is what stand out for me: - Source: Internet The MIBLOB string trimmer offers a 6″ cutting path and works fairly quietly at 95dB. It weighs just 3.2 lbs, and best of all can be converted from a weed eater to a push lawn mower. - Source: Internet the Hitachi CG22EAP2SL boasts a 60-inch long straight shaft that will improve the maneuverability and will allow you to easily reach in all the angles of your lawn. Wide cutting swath: this weed eater has a 17-inch cutting width. Combined with the .095-inches line, this makes it perfect for medium size and large lawns. - Source: Internet The Black \u0026 Decker String Timmer is a classic weed eater with an automatic feed system the ensures convenience and stress-free yard work. This is a corded model, so it will also provide continuous power without worry of gas or charging. And it features a 6.5-amp motor with high torque transmission providing maximum performance. - Source: Internet Using a weed eater should not be a strenuous endeavor. It should feel light and comfortable in your hands. Many trimmers come with adjustable shafts, heads and handles that give you the flexibility to find a comfortable fit. - Source: Internet What’s the Best Commercial Weed Eater for 2022? Well, let me rephrase that: What’s the best professional-grade string trimmer? Back in the early eighties, When I was a kid, we referred to “string trimmers” as “weed eaters” for some reason. It turns out that the latter is a brand name and it’s actually owned by Husqvarna.These terms are used interchangeably in the same way we use “Kleenex” as a generic term, but it’s actually a brand as well. - Source: Internet The Dompou cordless commercial weed eater features an adjustable aluminum pole that can be adjusted from 33.7 inches to 46.25 inches, making this tool a great fit for short and tall users. - Source: Internet Fortunately, we’ve taken the guesswork out the equation for you by choosing three of the best commercial weed eaters that have been put through their paces. Some models (Husqvarna 324L) have 4-stroke engines and the rest have 2-stroke engines. The cheaper Hitachi CG23ECPSL has a slightly smaller engine than the other two and is not quite as sophisticated. - Source: Internet Now it’s time to learn a little more about the other parts that make your gas weed eater do what it does. Your particular gas weed eater should have most if not all of these items. Bear in mind that the names of these parts may vary from brand to brand. - Source: Internet As far as quality goes, this is a good trimmer. It’s lightweight at 5.35 pounds and fully adjustable for height and positioning with the pivot handle. - Source: Internet It’s just a fact – weed eaters can be incredibly noisy. If you’re looking for something quieter, steer away from gas-powered models. The higher the power level of the engine, the more noise that will ensue. Even with electric or battery-powered options, the noise level will vary. - Source: Internet Weed eaters come in many variations. You get small electric corded models that are really only suitable for small lawns. Larger electric machines (battery or corded) are okay for most residential gardens but for commercial landscapers and those of us who have bigger than average yards, a commercial weed eater is the best tool for the job. - Source: Internet Pro Tip: If neighbors or lawn crews are in short supply, call your local small engine shop. They’ve got the inside scoop on which brands they never see, and which ones come in all the time for repairs. 3. Which is the best residential weed eater? - Source: Internet Gas-powered string trimmers are the “old guard” of the string trimmer world. They’ve been around much longer than battery or electric weed eaters and have a good track record of reliable performance. Here are some pros and cons of these machines. - Source: Internet 【3-IN-1 Compact Cordless Grass Trimmer】An all-in-one cordless push lawn mower, trimmer and edger. Easily converts from weed eater to wheeled Lawn Mower. Make your lawn the envy of the neighborhood. - Source: Internet A. Yes, weed eaters come with limited warranties that cover unexpected breakdowns during a set period. Check your manufacturer’s warranty specifications as each weed eater has a different warranty period, usually one to four years. - Source: Internet Mobility: Cordless weed eaters are light and have no cords. Without the cord, you are free to move about your yard while working with a cordless string trimmer. Lithium-ion batteries provide power to your trimmer head. - Source: Internet As much as I’m loyal to the Husqvarna brand, I have to say that the Tanaka TCG27EBSP is the superior machine and takes first prize for the best commercial weed eater. They cost about the same and both are extremely durable machines. But the Tanaka is a fair deal more powerful without adding any extra weight. There are a few small details in the design and construction of Tanaka that indicate a more robust approach to the engineering behind it. This is certainly evident in the incredible warranty that they offer – 7-years for residential use and 2-years for commercial use. - Source: Internet What Should I Look for in an Electric Weed Wacker? You should look for an adjustable handle, blade guard, lightweight design, and versatility. You’ll want to be comfortable holding one of these tools for hours, so pick a model that fits your height and isn’t too heavy. Being able to switch the string with other attachments can also save space and money. Are Electric Weed Eaters Worth It? Electric weed eaters are worth the investment since you won’t need to purchase pricey gas to fuel them. You can use them anywhere there’s an electrical outlet and extension cable, and you’ll never have to recharge or refuel them. - Source: Internet Heavy-duty vs. light-duty use: If you have a small, postage-stamp-sized lawn, don’t go all out. A simple, lightweight machine will do fine. If, on the other hand, you have a standard yard, a large yard, or a backyard that looks like a jungle if you let it go, you may want to opt for a more powerful model. - Source: Internet It turns out that the answer is not very much. Electric trimmers can chew through the typical grass and weeds you’ll face in the garden, so power is no issue. They’re also much more lightweight without a heavy gas-powered motor and full fuel tank, meaning you can go for longer. - Source: Internet Before we get into the heart of this article let’s go over the variety of ways you can refer to a weed eater. It seems that everyone has their own name for it. When I was a kid, growing up in the 70’s, our family called it a ‘weed eater.’ The following names are also common: string trimmer, weed wacker, line trimmer, whipper-snipper, line-trimmer and even strimmer (UK/Ireland). - Source: Internet Weed Eaters use small lightweight gas engines. The weight is important because you’re carrying the entire weight of the engine and all the other components that make up the weed eater. You need to be able to maneuver the weed eater freely and a heavy machine is not going to be practical. - Source: Internet It’s a lightweight power tool at just under 8 pounds – even when compared to most other battery-powered string trimmers. That’s great; it won’t tire you out as quickly as some of the heavier cordless string trimmer models. I’m not looking for a workout when I use my battery-powered string trimmer – I just want to destroy some weeds and be on my way. The 13-inch cutting width is great for my needs. I personally think cutting width is overrated – you aren’t using your cordless string trimmer to make successive passes like a lawn mower. - Source: Internet There is a wide variety of trimmer line for your gas weed eater. Most trimmer string is made of nylon, although there are some more durable varieties. Each type of string is designed for a fairly specific situation. - Source: Internet All that power doesn’t come with guaranteed safety. You’ll want to make sure those blades are exposed when you’re not working with them. Follower the instructions and use caps when it’s not in use. And make double sure that your weed eater comes with those protective caps. If not, you should be able to purchase them separately. - Source: Internet 3-year warranty The Worx WG184 Trimmer is a fantastic medium-use product. Like the Makita, it runs on double battery, giving you double the voltage for extra cutting power, and is the only other weed eater with a 60-minute fast charger. Due to the smaller capacity of both batteries compared to the top-of-the-line battery-powered models, however, you only get 30-45 minutes of weed cutting time before you need to recharge, but that should be sufficient for the needs of the average suburban home with minimal lawn care. Check Price on Amazon - Source: Internet If you’re looking for an absolute steal, check out Greenworks 15-Inch 5.5 Amp Corded String Trimmer. It’s lightweight, it’s budget-friendly, and completely user-friendly as well. For those looking to trim up their small or medium size yards, this is a great choice for you! - Source: Internet It appears that it is a good choice if you don’t use it to cut down a bamboo forest. If you want a reliable, sturdy machine with a sling and double handles, this would be a good option for the price. COOCHEER weed eater powers through thick grass and dense undergrowth. The offset U-handle feature provides unprecedented operational control and user comfort while operating this trimmer/grass cutter. - Source: Internet On the market, there are available 2-cylinder and 4-cylinder gas-powered weed eaters. In general, the 2-cylinder engines run with a mix of gas and oil, while the 4-cylinder only need the right type of gas. For this reason, it is advisable to search for a 4-cylinder model. - Source: Internet Best commercial weed eater for the money. Excellent value and power. Built to endure years of punishment. - Source: Internet We review several excellent industrial-grade weed eaters that are suitable for landscapers or homeowners. Many homeowners invest a little extra money and purchase a weed eater that will last. Unfortunately, there’s no shortage of cheap string trimmers, but you can be certain that they won’t last very long if you intend to use it on a regular basis. - Source: Internet Ordinarily, The Husqvarna 324L would be my first choice when buying a quality weed eater. This is because I’m a creature of habit and I know from years of experience that Husqvarna make some of the best garden tools. It’s only after reviewing the Tanaka TCG27EBSP that I placed the Husky in second place. That’s not to say that I’ wouldn’t hesitate to buy the Husqvarna – it’s a fantastic weed eater and has all the heavy-duty attributes to make it one of the best commercial weed eaters. - Source: Internet Cost Effective: A great battery-powered weed eater can cost less upfront than gas string trimmers and still provide plenty of power to cut thick grass. Depending on the model, it might come with a 2, 3, 5 or lifetime warranty – so these aren’t disposable battery-operated tools. When you add the savings in fuel and materials, cordless string trimmers are a great choice for most yards. - Source: Internet As great as the bump head is, I’ve been through a few with different brands of weed eaters. Cheap bump heads are more trouble than they’re worth. If it’s not made of quality materials and designed well, the mechanisms jam and basically don’t function like they should. So you end up spending more time opening the bump head assembly and fixing it than you do working. - Source: Internet The secret to achieving an award-winning lawn is in the details. Crisply defined edges; no stray weeds congregating around flower beds, trees, yard ornaments, or sewer vents; and no undesirable scruffiness spilling out from beneath your fence. Keeping your green pristine is what makes your neighbors take notice and compliment you on your landscaping expertise. The tool that can best accomplish these many tasks is a gasoline-powered weed eater, also called a Weedwacker or trimmer. - Source: Internet The Black+Decker model is a bit more powerful than the Craftsman, and it also has longer battery life. Deciding between the two will likely come down to the size of your yard. Both are lightweight and great for quick clean-up tasks. While neither is up to snuff for professional operations, both are worthy of consideration for the average homeowner. - Source: Internet The WEEDWACKER’s Easy-Winding head feeds a. 095″ line, allowing you to refill your cutting head for easy engagement swiftly. This brush cutter is powerful, portable, and lightweight, making it ideal for even the most difficult tasks. A 2-year limited guarantee is included with the CMXGTAMD30SA. - Source: Internet No, a battery powered weed eater shouldn’t get wet. Remember, this wireless yard tool is not waterproof or water resistant. So, avoid using string trimmers when it’s raining – regardless if it’s a light drizzle or heavy pour. Moisture and water can affect its mechanical parts, including the battery. Whenever you are planning to do yard work, always do it when the sun is out. - Source: Internet The weed eater is one of the many tools that are used for the regular maintenance of the garden. It can be used to cut the grass and weeds, it can manicure the aspect of the lawn or it can even be used to cut or shape the bushes present in your garden. In some cases, it can even completely replace the lawn mower, especially if you have a rather small lawn. - Source: Internet Corded weed eaters work best for small yards with sparser weeds. They are lighter, start easier, and are friendlier for the environment. Cordless trimmers- powered by gas or batteries- can be noisy and heavy (even requiring a shoulder strap for some), and yet they go anywhere and can cut through much thicker overgrowth. - Source: Internet However, 40v tools do have their downsides. Compared to a 20v model, they carry a heavier battery and are more typically expensive. So, if you’re just looking at getting rid of weeds around your backyard, a 20v weed eater should be enough. If you have a bigger area to tackle, think about investing in 40v or more. - Source: Internet Cordless weed eaters are light and have no cords. Without the cord, you are free to move about your yard while working with a cordless string trimmer. Lithium-ion batteries provide power to your trimmer head. Easy to Use: It’s almost unanimous: The best battery powered string trimmers are way easier to use and maintain than a gas string trimmer. There’s also no annoying extension cord to worry about as you get with corded electric string trimmers. - Source: Internet Correct usage and maintenance of your weed eater is going to mean that it will last as it should, work properly, and ensure that you’re safe. I’m going to share some of my experience in this regard. Even the best commercial weed eaters need to be cared for correctly, so there’s some important stuff in this section of the article. - Source: Internet The best commercial weed eaters are designed to eliminate vibration as much as possible. Engines and gearboxes are designed to operate as smoothly as modern engineering will allow. Even with the best technology, weed eaters vibrate quite a lot. This causes strain on your arms and fatigue will reduce the amount of time that you’re able to spend doing what you intended – trimming the lawn and cutting back weeds. - Source: Internet One of the main disadvantages of the gas-powered weed eaters is the weight. Because you have to add fuel to the tank, you will have to consider at least a couple of extra pounds in addition to the weight stated by the manufacturer. For this reason, you should consider the use of a shoulder strap. - Source: Internet The Black+Decker LST136 and Craftsman V20 Weedwacker are both very simple to pick up and use right away, scoring quite equally in their user-friendliness. Both are very lightweight, making them easiest to handle and finesse in tight areas around obstacles. They’re fairly comfortable to use for long periods, even without a shoulder strap, and their grips are easy to hold. Line replacement is also very straightforward. - Source: Internet Having concluded what to look for in a commercial weed eater, let’s put this into practice by reviewing your best options. These machines meet the criteria I’ve mentioned above and can, therefore, all be considered as being among the best commercial weed eaters. They differ somewhat but are all great machines. - Source: Internet A well-manicured lawn catches the eye. Crisply cut grass without weeds encroaching on surrounding bushes and sidewalks gives every home curb appeal. Weed eaters make trimming weeds and landscaping easy and efficient. - Source: Internet Used indiscriminately over wide swathes of grass, lawn mowers are the brute force of the lawn care world. But when it comes to more detailed work, you need a weed wacker—or line trimmer, weed eater, string trimmer, or whatever else you want to call it. These slim, handheld power tools are designed to make short work of garden and lawn maintenance. They’re adept at nitty gritty details, like the weeds around edges and ledges of patios, walkways, bushes, and flower beds. - Source: Internet At a really fantastic price for a tough commercial weed eater, the Hitachi CG23ECPSL is an incredible deal. If you don’t need the most powerful weed eater, it makes a lot of sense to buy this machine. You’ll be saving quite a bit and it’s going to work hard for years. Coming from the Hitachi stable means that it’s up there with the best of them with a warranty to match. Like the Tanaka, which comes from the same company, you’re getting a 7-year residential warranty and a 2-year commercial warranty. - Source: Internet this weed eater has a 17-inch cutting width. Combined with the .095-inches line, this makes it perfect for medium size and large lawns. Optional blade attachment: although not included in the purchase price, Hitachi also manufactures a blade for this model, that will allow you to trim your lawn faster. - Source: Internet When the string comes into contact with walls, fences, and other solid surfaces, it will wear down very quickly and will easily break. To avoid this from happening, use the blade guard as a guide. Run the weed eater along the wall with blade guard pressing against the wall (or other solid objects). This prevents the string from making direct contact with the hard surface. - Source: Internet We have arranged the 15 weed eaters (line trimmers) in our review alphabetically by brand name. There are so many variations that comparing them is like comparing apples and pears – it all depends on what is essential to the individual user. Let’s have a look. - Source: Internet Lightweight aluminum and very durable plastics mean that Husqvarna 324L is a breeze to use and incredibly rugged. It weighs only 11.24 LBS, so you can swing it around with ease and you know it can handle what you throw at it. They make a great harness for this weed eater that is adjustable and fit’s over both shoulders, this makes the Husqvarna really comfortable to use and you’ll work for hours without feeling it. Though this harness is sold as an optional extra, you’ll need to haul out some extra cash, but it will be money well-spent. - Source: Internet In terms of weight, it’s about average for a corded weed eater, coming in at 6.5 pounds. Thankfully, this corded string trimmer has a D-ring handle, which makes precision work straightforward. - Source: Internet One thing I’ve seen with all bump heads is that they will become damaged by the heat that results from friction on the shaft and gearbox. The best way to eliminate this is by using a flange disc. There are cheaper, low tech ways of doing this, but a flange disc is the best way of doing this. The three weed eaters that were reviewed here all use this method, so I’ll explain the details. - Source: Internet As stated earlier, this cordless electric weed eater can also be used as an edger.

After an hour of weed eating, you’ll be sorry if you have a handle that’s just made of metal without a cushion. Callouses will ensure, and blood blisters may come in full force. This is a must for heavier weed eaters, making sure the entire piece is comfortable to maneuver is key. - Source: Internet Wheeled or walk-behind weed eaters are also quite powerful.

This weed eater upholds their fine reputation. It has power in spades, has been exceptionally well made and the battery and charger is so far ahead of its competition it is unreal. The best battery powered trimmer on the market. - Source: Internet If you’re cutting long grass or weeds, start near the top. You should never cut more about 5” at a time. If you start at the ground when the grass or weeds are more than 5” tall, you’ll place excessive strain on the engine and gearbox. This will end up damaging the weed eater. Long grass and weeds can also wrap around the shaft as it rotates, this also ends up harming your weed eater. - Source: Internet While you’re working, occasionally check that nothing has wound around the shaft. Sometimes there can be rope, string, or wire that you’re unaware of and this can work its way around the shaft, impairing the weed eater’s performance. This is likely to damage the machine in the long run. Clean the buildup of grass clippings from the machine regularly. This should be done every time after you’re done working, more frequently is even better. - Source: Internet You should also check the length of the shaft. Ideally, you should choose a weed eater with a telescopic shaft, so you can adjust its length to your own height. This is an essential aspect to consider especially if you have a large lawn or if you plan to use the tool often. - Source: Internet Another thing I like is the versatility of this tool. By simply investing in a few accessories you will be able to transform the weed eater into a series of useful garden care tools. This will surely save you some money, as you will not have to buy the actual tools, which definitely cost more. - Source: Internet A lightweight gas-powered weed eater designed for a comfortable handling and for multiple purposes is the Husqvarna 128LD.

In this way, starting this weed eater is a breeze. View price - Source: Internet In a nutshell, I can’t see any reason to pick a gas-powered string trimmer over an electric weed eater. Gas is pricey, worse for the environment, and challenging to keep in stock. Electricity is cheap, and it is much more sustainable than gas. - Source: Internet The main difference is how it derives the power. While electric is convenient, quieter, and you don’t have gas fumes, they simply don’t have the power to meet the needs of landscapers and people with large gardens. So if we’re going to be talking about the best commercial weed eaters, we need to look at gas-powered machines. - Source: Internet It is equipped with a pivoting trimmer head, which can be adjusted up to 90° for precise lawn edge trimming. This battery weed eater offers commercial-grade performance yet tips the scales at just 8.42 lbs, making it a joy to use over extended periods of time. - Source: Internet While you can’t see inside the gearbox and probably have no idea of how it works, this is just as important as the engine itself. The gearbox delivers the power to the cutting head and needs to be tough and well-designed. When looking at the machine, we can get some clues as to how they’ve built the weed eater. A larger gearbox with a cast aluminum housing is an indication that the engineers have done their job properly. Again, we’ve ensured that you’re getting what you pay for and all three of the weed eaters in this review have gearboxes to match the power that the engine delivers. - Source: Internet This great weed eater is built for larger lots you might find in a traditional suburb. The lithium-ion battery is bigger than most, and the brushless motor delivers more power to the cutting head through the power drive transmission. The cutting width is larger than average. – coming in at 16 inches. That makes this battery weed eater versatile enough to handle both heavy weeds and delicate situations. - Source: Internet Although they are both powerful and maneuverable, they do have some drawbacks. They are very expensive, loud, very heavy, and require a bit more muscle power to control. Gas-powered weed eaters are known for regular issues with start-up, as well as being messy and smelly. Refilling them with gas multiple times per job usually results in spillage or simply running out of fuel. Read Best Gas Weed Eaters. - Source: Internet Cordless varieties are also more cost-effective than battery-powered weed eaters since batteries may need replacement after a few years of use. How Powerful Should an Electric String Trimmer Be? Your electric string trimmer should be powerful enough to cut through stalky weeds and dense grass. 5 amp models can easily cut through tough plants, while 3 amp corded weed eaters can only manage in thin grass with few delicate weeds. - Source: Internet 【Powerful \u0026 Lightweight】 One 40V Li-Ion battery and 10 Inches strong blade cutting system increases the mowing efficiency (normal no-load speed: 9000 rpm); Only measuring 5.3 lbs, this string trimmer combines lightweight and superior power to keep your garden neat and tidy; The max. Working time reaches an impressive 70 min at a full charge. - Source: Internet Similar to the BLACK+DECKER LST136W, the GreenWorks 2101602 is powered by a 40-volt battery and boasts a 12-inch cutting swath, slightly narrower than the LST136W.This weed eater is using a .065-inch auto feed twisted dual line, providing excellent results on almost all types of grass and weeds.What I really like about the GreenWorks 2101602 is the three-position pivoting head, that increases the versatility of this tool by allowing the trimming from multiple angles. View price - Source: Internet The real selling point is the bundling of the leaf blower in this purchase. Neither tool will break power records, and using 20V batteries isn’t future-proofing yourself in this day and age. But it’s cheap, and both products will get the job done. Considering you get both a blower and a weed eater for almost half the price of some other trimmers alone, it’s definitely a good value. It’s so inexpensive that if I bought this package, I’d probably spend some of the savings on the extended warranty just for peace of mind. - Source: Internet Every engine needs oxygen to run. This foam-like insert keeps unwanted particles, dirt, and debris from entering your engine. It’s essential to keep this item clean so your gas weed eater runs at optimum levels. - Source: Internet If your runtime needs are greater, look for a string trimmer that balances the efficiency of a brushless motor, uses 0.095-inch line, and possibly comes with a higher-capacity battery. Of course, you can always carry multiple batteries. - Source: Internet These devices operate simply and with zero emissions (yay for the environment!). It’s nice not to have to deal with gassing up your weed eater or dealing with the potential mess. You will have to remember to charge them before you get to work, though, but the start-up is easy with just the push of a button. - Source: Internet I have a very large garden with acres of lawn to maintain. This makes my weed eater one of the most important garden tools in the shed. They go by many names: string cutter, brush cutter, bush whacker, or edge trimmer, to name a few. Though weed eater is the best name of the lot, it really describes these versatile garden tools to a tee. They do, literally, eat through weeds like no other. - Source: Internet The WORX WG119 is our second pick for the best corded electric weed eater due to its great value and powerful, lightweight design. It features a 5.5-Amp motor and can be converted from a string trimmer to an edger in a single click. - Source: Internet A. After shutting off your weed eater, let it cool for a few minutes.

The engine whirls a monofilament string round and round with sufficient velocity to slice through grass and weeds, trimming away the chaff until your property is the cream of the crop. - Source: Internet There are a lot of reasons why you’d choose a cordless battery-powered weed eater. It’s why so many people are shopping for the best battery-powered weedeater. Here are the main benefits of the class: - Source: Internet You can choose from two main types of handles: loop handles or bicycle (AKA “bullhorn”) handles. Loop handles are most common on residential weed eaters. Bicycle handles may be more comfortable for larger, longer, brush clearing jobs. Try both types to see which feels more comfortable for you. - Source: Internet Most weed eaters use a nylon string mounted on a rotary head to cut the grass and the weeds. However, the more advanced models are also equipped with metallic or plastic blades.The string weed eaters can use a fixed line system, that require you to replace the line each time it is damaged. Usually, you should replace the line each ½ acres. - Source: Internet They do, however, have their benefits, such as a constant flow of power, they don’t run out of juice. Once you are set up and ready to go, you won’t be interrupted. They also tend to be much lighter and cheaper than cordless strimmers, so if good value and a lightweight tool are high on your list of priorities then consider a corded model. - Source: Internet There’s an automatic feed option that works by sending our more line whenever it feels the line is becoming too short. You don’t have to worry about remembering to feed more line yourself; instead, you just keep doing your job, and the weed eater uses its own intelligence to send the line along. It’s definitely convenient, but in the event of an issue, it is a bit harder to fix since the feed line is hidden by the head and may cost more for repair. - Source: Internet This guide will help you determine if a battery-powered weed eater is right for you. We lay out all the pros and cons and describe what features you need to look for when buying a weed wacker. We also have a list of the best battery-powered trimmers on the market to make your buying decision even easier. - Source: Internet The throttle lock is a feature that, as the name suggests, allows you to lock the trigger into place. If your weed eater has a throttle lock, you won’t have to tire your fingers out by holding it continuously. To disengage the throttle lock, you simply give the trigger a squeeze. - Source: Internet —Pull start vs. battery start: With a gas model, the pull start may be an issue for some seniors. You have to put the weed eater on the ground and quickly pull up on the string. A spring-assist pull start may make starting the machine easier if you prefer a gas weeder. However, if you’re considering a battery-powered model, push a button, squeeze the trigger, and you’re good to go. - Source: Internet Indeed, Black+Decker LCC420 String Trimmer has what it takes to be ranked as one of the best within the product category. It has an exceptional battery that holds the charge for a long time. It also has excellent transmission for better cutting power, even in tough applications. It is also a plus that it has a lightweight body, which makes it easy to use. - Source: Internet Many weed eaters feature an adjustable head that pivots at a right angle to become an edger. It uses the same trimmer line but cuts vertically instead of horizontally. The cover turns to protect the person from the spinning line. - Source: Internet As with all gas engines, you need to do some routine maintenance. Your instruction manual will give you all the particulars, though there are few basic things that you should do every time you use the weed eater. Before starting the engine, remove the air filter and blow it clean. If you’re using a 4-stroke machine, check the engine oil level and top it up if required. It’s really important to do this every time you use it. - Source: Internet Whether you opt for corded or cordless, select a cutting swath (10 to 16 inches) that makes sense for what range you need. A curved shaft is best for light trimming, while a straight shaft is better for heavy-duty work. Credit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar Select a cutting swath (10 to 16 inches) that makes sense for what range you need. A curved shaft is best for light trimming, while a straight shaft is better for heavy-duty work. Quiet motors or engines are obviously preferred, as are lightweight, balanced, and low vibration models as far as comfort goes. - Source: Internet Adding to its list of features is its wide 12-inch cutting swath and 0.065-inch line diameter.

View price - Source: Internet Weed eaters come with curved shafts or straight shafts. Curved shafts are for light use on a residential property, and they are great for beginners. Straight shafts are for more strenuous commercial work and sometimes come with the option to buy a blade or other accessories. Straight shaft trimmers are also easier to get under bushes. Curved-shaft models are less expensive overall. - Source: Internet The two more expensive weed eaters are closely matched in terms of engine size and their power output is very similar. What they all have in common is that they all come highly recommended by both homeowners and landscapers alike. So you can be assured that the engines used in all of these weed eaters are up to the task of cutting through thick weeds and tall grass. - Source: Internet Because bump heads are an important, and very handy feature of modern weed eaters, I want to take the time to explain these mechanisms properly. I’ve tried a few over the years and, being the technical go-to guy for most of my friends and family, I’ve had the opportunity to see a lot of different types. Some of the cheap machines have a very nasty way of doing things. Though if you choose correctly, and buy one of the best commercial weed eaters (like the three in this review), you’ll get excellent use from your bump head. There are few things to know about these components though. - Source: Internet This is a really well-made and sturdy trimmer, make no mistake about that. The only drawback is that it is slightly heavier than some others that made the shortlist. If you’re looking purely for a portable weed eater you can get around quickly with, there are lighter models out there. If, however, the extra weight doesn’t phase you too much, this is a real beast and the build quality is incredible…that’s why I have one…flex, GRRRR! - Source: Internet You will find weed eaters are an array of price points. Know going into your venture that the average price for a quality trimmer is around $200, with prices dipping far below that or reaching near $1,000. It’s all dependent on your particular needs, brands you trust, and the features you want. - Source: Internet Basic corded and battery-powered weed eaters are priced between $30-$50, but they work best for small yards where you may only trim several times a year. Between $50-$100, weed eaters are built for regular use and trimming small to medium weeds. Taller brushes and longer-lasting battery charges are found in combination weed eaters and weed edgers priced between $100-$200. Above $200 are commercial-grade weed eaters with two- and four-stroke engines meant for heavy-duty use. - Source: Internet Battery powered weed eaters are justifiably becoming more popular. The WORX WG154 is another that is at a great price, very light and incredibly comfortable to use. I love it. - Source: Internet Here’s another combination design! The Black + Decker Combination Kit: Lack+Decker String Trimmer \u0026 Edgercomes with a sweeper option to help keep sidewalks, garages, and decks clear of trimming debris. The trimmer features an automatic feed spool to ensure continued progress in the yard. It’s also incredibly lightweight (right under 4 pounds!), easy to maneuver, and keeps noise levels at a minimum. - Source: Internet However, you’ll have to extend your patience with charging – like really. If our best trimmer choice will only take 45 minutes to charge, this DeWALT trimmer can take 240 minutes or 4 hours. Yes, that long. So, in case your weed situation is minimal or you prefer something lightweight, this DeWalt model is the right trimmer for you. Check Price on Amazon - Source: Internet Our next metric focused on the battery system of each string trimmer, and this accounts for 25% of each product’s final score. We based the bulk of this score on the maximum runtime for each product and awarded extra points to models with different speed settings because it allows you to maximize the battery life by throttling down when extra speed is unnecessary. We measured the runtime for these weed eaters when they weren’t actually eating weeds, so you’ll probably get lower numbers if you’re chewing through dense vegetation or particularly stubborn weeds. - Source: Internet This line of straight shaft trimmers also has a 16-inch cutting width. This simply means that you will be able to do more within a single pass with this weed eater. It’s not sooo big that you’ll have trouble controlling it in tight spots either. It’s easy to guide while trimming. - Source: Internet Another type of string weed eaters are the bump-feed heads. The line is placed on a spool that is fixed in the weed eater’s head and advances each time you bump the tool on the ground.Finally, the automatic feed heads use the same spool system as the bump heads, but the line advances automatically without requiring any action on your part. - Source: Internet Now, if we’ve already sold you on one of those particular weed eaters and your search is done, excellent.

With more power than 18V/20V models, it’s a good fit for budget-minded individuals. It also carries a 5-year limited warranty. - Source: Internet Firstly, electric weed eaters have cords. Although this may seem inconvenient, the electric run models have so many advantages. They’re usually light-weight and easy to maneuver, and the runtime never ends because they’re consistently in contact with their power source. But, if you’re working with a traditional size residential lawn, there may be no negative effects on your experience. - Source: Internet A.

Not adding oil, or not adding enough to create the proper ratio (as called for in your owner’s manual), will cause the engine to seize. - Source: Internet This is a really solid performer but is very lightweight at 5.5lbs. This is an ideal choice if you maybe are physically slightly weaker but still want something that does a good job and has a considerable amount of power. - Source: Internet If you’re interested in a true professional-grade cordless string trimmer then you need to seriously consider the Makita 40V model as seen above. Makita created their XGT tools to replace their gas-powered power equipment without compromising on power or torque. This isn’t just another disappointing cordless tool. It is one of the best commercial weed eater/string trimmer your money can buy.

This is what makes them such versatile machines. A blade is easily damaged by stones and it’s impossible to cut up to a wall or any solid surface with a blade. The nylon string is flexible so it can handle most hard objects and if the string breaks, no big deal. It’s cheap and easy to replace. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The difference between a commercial weed <strong>eater</strong> and a consumer-grade weed <strong>eater</strong> is the overall build quality is higher as it needs to withstand endless hours of usage and accidental bumps and knocks, day-in and day-out. Homeowner weed <strong>eater</strong>s are designed for intermittent usage and the quality of the components are not as robust or durable. Thicker metals cost more money. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The shaft can be curved or straight. Machines with a straight shaft usually cost more and, while this doesn’t make the machine perform better, it does offer better reach. As a tall guy, I definitely prefer a straight shaft. A weed <strong>eater</strong> with a straight shaft is also safer because you are further away from the cutter and this means that you’re further from the flying debris. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Best Lightweight Weed Eater under $200 WORX 40V Power Share 13″ GT Only 8.6lbs including battery, a very effective <strong>lightweight</strong> weed <strong>eater</strong> for home use. 40min battery run-time. Check Price - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A weed <strong>eater</strong> is exactly what it sounds like because of what it caters to. It’s a lawn tool that cuts grass, low foliage, or weeds in the smaller nooks and crannies of one’s yard. You may not know this device by this name, though, as it has plenty of other variations of names, including a string trimmer, weed-whacker, brush cutter, and whipper-snipper. What makes this so different from its mower counterpart is the blade in which it uses to cut; usually made from a very fine line of monofilament, nylon, and other times a chain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After installing new string, hold the weed <strong>eater</strong> in the air before engaging the throttle. Make sure that the cutting head is as far away from you as possible. This is because a blade inside the cutting guard will cut off the excess string and this flies off at high speed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The size and terrain of your lawn determine what kind of weed <strong>eater</strong> you need. Smaller lawns and those with mostly grass and very few weeds need less powerful intervention. If you have a large lawn or live in an area with lots of brush and thick weeds, a more powerful trimmer can handle the chore. How often you use a trimmer also plays a role since weekly use may require a more powerful motor built to last over a long, hot summer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For those that are looking for a weed <strong>eater</strong> to get some of the harder jobs, then you may need to go with a high-powered gas weed <strong>eater</strong>. These designs are made to get through the thickest of shrubbery and other foliage. Some gas-powered whackers can even get through some trees. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Milwaukee’s 2825-21ST Quik-Lok is another professional quality weed <strong>eater</strong> that holds bags of power and 6200 rpm. I would put it very close to the DeWalt FelxVolt on power but just slightly behind on balance, feel and flow. It glides a little bit less and I can’t ignore the handle quality on the DeWalt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Check out the type of shaft your new weed <strong>eater</strong> too. The shaft is the portion of the trimmer that extends from the engine to the blade, and it’s where the transfer of power happens. Curved shafts are known to be lighter and easier to maneuver around tough-to-reach spots, whereas straight shafts will always have a longer reach. Again, this is totally dependent on your personalized needs and your particular lawn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are plenty to choose from and plenty of different features to sift through. But, again, we’ve done the dirty work for you. Below you’ll find 7 of the best weed <strong>eater</strong>s that get the job done. Sift through our finds and, while you’re at it, you may learn a thing or two about those string trimmers, what types there are as well as a few other interesting odds and ends. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Among the homeowners, a tool that is becoming more and more popular is the electric weed <strong>eater</strong>. The “green” alternatives of their gas-powered counterparts, these weed <strong>eater</strong>s are not only environmentally-friendly but also more <strong>lightweight</strong>, easier to use and need a little maintenance. This guide will help you in selecting the best electric weed <strong>eater</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Environment: A battery powered weed <strong>eater</strong> emits no pollutants. The power is provided by a lithium-ion battery pack which you simply plug into the wall to recharge. Using the same battery repeatedly helps make the best battery-powered weed trimmers a very eco-friendly tool. Energy consumption tends to be lower as well because you can easily turn the trimmer off when moving. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another characteristic I particularly like about the electric weed <strong>eater</strong>s is their <strong>lightweight</strong>. In fact, these tools often weigh only a few pounds, generally under 10. This characteristic increases the maneuverability and these tools can be easily handled even by those who have less physical force. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to the weed <strong>eater</strong> heads, there are a few different kinds. Every head will spin in a circle to get the job done, but there are different ways of feeding that line to the blade. Here are the options: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We looked at 15 gas-powered weed <strong>eater</strong>s and gave you our honest perspective of each. We also looked at where they are made or said to have been made. Here is what stand out for me: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The MIBLOB string trimmer offers a 6″ cutting path and works fairly quietly at 95dB. It weighs just 3.2 lbs, and best of all can be converted from a weed <strong>eater</strong> to a push lawn mower. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>the Hitachi CG22EAP2SL boasts a 60-inch long straight shaft that will improve the maneuverability and will allow you to easily reach in all the angles of your lawn. Wide cutting swath: this weed <strong>eater</strong> has a 17-inch cutting width. Combined with the .095-inches line, this makes it perfect for medium size and large lawns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Black & Decker String Timmer is a classic weed <strong>eater</strong> with an automatic feed system the ensures convenience and stress-free yard work. This is a corded model, so it will also provide continuous power without worry of gas or charging. And it features a 6.5-amp motor with high torque transmission providing maximum performance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Using a weed <strong>eater</strong> should not be a strenuous endeavor. It should feel light and comfortable in your hands. Many trimmers come with adjustable shafts, heads and handles that give you the flexibility to find a comfortable fit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What’s the Best Commercial Weed Eater for 2022? Well, let me rephrase that: What’s the best professional-grade string trimmer? Back in the early eighties, When I was a kid, we referred to “string trimmers” as “weed <strong>eater</strong>s” for some reason. It turns out that the latter is a brand name and it’s actually owned by Husqvarna.These terms are used interchangeably in the same way we use “Kleenex” as a generic term, but it’s actually a brand as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Dompou cordless commercial weed <strong>eater</strong> features an adjustable aluminum pole that can be adjusted from 33.7 inches to 46.25 inches, making this tool a great fit for short and tall users. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fortunately, we’ve taken the guesswork out the equation for you by choosing three of the best commercial weed <strong>eater</strong>s that have been put through their paces. Some models (Husqvarna 324L) have 4-stroke engines and the rest have 2-stroke engines. The cheaper Hitachi CG23ECPSL has a slightly smaller engine than the other two and is not quite as sophisticated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now it&rsquo;s time to learn a little more about the other parts that make your gas weed <strong>eater</strong> do what it does. Your particular gas weed <strong>eater</strong> should have most if not all of these items. Bear in mind that the names of these parts may vary from brand to brand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As far as quality goes, this is a good trimmer. It’s <strong>lightweight</strong> at 5.35 pounds and fully adjustable for height and positioning with the pivot handle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s just a fact – weed <strong>eater</strong>s can be incredibly noisy. If you’re looking for something quieter, steer away from gas-powered models. The higher the power level of the engine, the more noise that will ensue. Even with electric or battery-powered options, the noise level will vary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Weed <strong>eater</strong>s come in many variations. You get small electric corded models that are really only suitable for small lawns. Larger electric machines (battery or corded) are okay for most residential gardens but for commercial landscapers and those of us who have bigger than average yards, a commercial weed <strong>eater</strong> is the best tool for the job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pro Tip: If neighbors or lawn crews are in short supply, call your local small engine shop. They’ve got the inside scoop on which brands they never see, and which ones come in all the time for repairs. 3. Which is the best residential weed <strong>eater</strong>? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gas-powered string trimmers are the “old guard” of the string trimmer world. They’ve been around much longer than battery or electric weed <strong>eater</strong>s and have a good track record of reliable performance. Here are some pros and cons of these machines. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>【3-IN-1 Compact Cordless Grass Trimmer】An all-in-one cordless push lawn mower, trimmer and edger. Easily converts from weed <strong>eater</strong> to wheeled Lawn Mower. Make your lawn the envy of the neighborhood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A. Yes, weed <strong>eater</strong>s come with limited warranties that cover unexpected breakdowns during a set period. Check your manufacturer’s warranty specifications as each weed <strong>eater</strong> has a different warranty period, usually one to four years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Mobility: Cordless weed <strong>eater</strong>s are light and have no cords. Without the cord, you are free to move about your yard while working with a cordless string trimmer. Lithium-ion batteries provide power to your trimmer head. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As much as I’m loyal to the Husqvarna brand, I have to say that the Tanaka TCG27EBSP is the superior machine and takes first prize for the best commercial weed <strong>eater</strong>. They cost about the same and both are extremely durable machines. But the Tanaka is a fair deal more powerful without adding any extra weight. There are a few small details in the design and construction of Tanaka that indicate a more robust approach to the engineering behind it. This is certainly evident in the incredible warranty that they offer – 7-years for residential use and 2-years for commercial use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What Should I Look for in an Electric Weed Wacker? You should look for an adjustable handle, blade guard, <strong>lightweight</strong> design, and versatility. You’ll want to be comfortable holding one of these tools for hours, so pick a model that fits your height and isn’t too heavy. Being able to switch the string with other attachments can also save space and money. Are Electric Weed Eaters Worth It? Electric weed <strong>eater</strong>s are worth the investment since you won’t need to purchase pricey gas to fuel them. You can use them anywhere there’s an electrical outlet and extension cable, and you’ll never have to recharge or refuel them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Heavy-duty vs. light-duty use: If you have a small, postage-stamp-sized lawn, don’t go all out. A simple, <strong>lightweight</strong> machine will do fine. If, on the other hand, you have a standard yard, a large yard, or a backyard that looks like a jungle if you let it go, you may want to opt for a more powerful model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It turns out that the answer is not very much. Electric trimmers can chew through the typical grass and weeds you’ll face in the garden, so power is no issue. They’re also much more <strong>lightweight</strong> without a heavy gas-powered motor and full fuel tank, meaning you can go for longer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before we get into the heart of this article let’s go over the variety of ways you can refer to a weed <strong>eater</strong>. It seems that everyone has their own name for it. When I was a kid, growing up in the 70’s, our family called it a ‘weed <strong>eater</strong>.’ The following names are also common: string trimmer, weed wacker, line trimmer, whipper-snipper, line-trimmer and even strimmer (UK/Ireland). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Weed Eaters use small <strong>lightweight</strong> gas engines. The weight is important because you’re carrying the entire weight of the engine and all the other components that make up the weed <strong>eater</strong>. You need to be able to maneuver the weed <strong>eater</strong> freely and a heavy machine is not going to be practical. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s a <strong>lightweight</strong> power tool at just under 8 pounds – even when compared to most other battery-powered string trimmers. That’s great; it won’t tire you out as quickly as some of the heavier cordless string trimmer models. I’m not looking for a workout when I use my battery-powered string trimmer – I just want to destroy some weeds and be on my way. The 13-inch cutting width is great for my needs. I personally think cutting width is overrated – you aren’t using your cordless string trimmer to make successive passes like a lawn mower. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There is a wide variety of trimmer line for your gas weed <strong>eater</strong>. Most trimmer string is made of nylon, although there are some more durable varieties. Each type of string is designed for a fairly specific situation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>All that power doesn’t come with guaranteed safety. You’ll want to make sure those blades are exposed when you’re not working with them. Follower the instructions and use caps when it’s not in use. And make double sure that your weed <strong>eater</strong> comes with those protective caps. If not, you should be able to purchase them separately. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>3-year warranty The Worx WG184 Trimmer is a fantastic medium-use product. Like the Makita, it runs on double battery, giving you double the voltage for extra cutting power, and is the only other weed <strong>eater</strong> with a 60-minute fast charger. Due to the smaller capacity of both batteries compared to the top-of-the-line battery-powered models, however, you only get 30-45 minutes of weed cutting time before you need to recharge, but that should be sufficient for the needs of the average suburban home with minimal lawn care. Check Price on Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re looking for an absolute steal, check out Greenworks 15-Inch 5.5 Amp Corded String Trimmer. It’s <strong>lightweight</strong>, it’s budget-friendly, and completely user-friendly as well. For those looking to trim up their small or medium size yards, this is a great choice for you! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It appears that it is a good choice if you don’t use it to cut down a bamboo forest. If you want a reliable, sturdy machine with a sling and double handles, this would be a good option for the price. COOCHEER weed <strong>eater</strong> powers through thick grass and dense undergrowth. The offset U-handle feature provides unprecedented operational control and user comfort while operating this trimmer/grass cutter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>On the market, there are available 2-cylinder and 4-cylinder gas-powered weed <strong>eater</strong>s. In general, the 2-cylinder engines run with a mix of gas and oil, while the 4-cylinder only need the right type of gas. For this reason, it is advisable to search for a 4-cylinder model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Best commercial weed <strong>eater</strong> for the money. Excellent value and power. Built to endure years of punishment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We review several excellent industrial-grade weed <strong>eater</strong>s that are suitable for landscapers or homeowners. Many homeowners invest a little extra money and purchase a weed <strong>eater</strong> that will last. Unfortunately, there’s no shortage of cheap string trimmers, but you can be certain that they won’t last very long if you intend to use it on a regular basis. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ordinarily, The Husqvarna 324L would be my first choice when buying a quality weed <strong>eater</strong>. This is because I’m a creature of habit and I know from years of experience that Husqvarna make some of the best garden tools. It’s only after reviewing the Tanaka TCG27EBSP that I placed the Husky in second place. That’s not to say that I’ wouldn’t hesitate to buy the Husqvarna – it’s a fantastic weed <strong>eater</strong> and has all the heavy-duty attributes to make it one of the best commercial weed <strong>eater</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cost Effective: A great battery-powered weed <strong>eater</strong> can cost less upfront than gas string trimmers and still provide plenty of power to cut thick grass. Depending on the model, it might come with a 2, 3, 5 or lifetime warranty – so these aren’t disposable battery-operated tools. When you add the savings in fuel and materials, cordless string trimmers are a great choice for most yards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As great as the bump head is, I’ve been through a few with different brands of weed <strong>eater</strong>s. Cheap bump heads are more trouble than they’re worth. If it’s not made of quality materials and designed well, the mechanisms jam and basically don’t function like they should. So you end up spending more time opening the bump head assembly and fixing it than you do working. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The secret to achieving an award-winning lawn is in the details. Crisply defined edges; no stray weeds congregating around flower beds, trees, yard ornaments, or sewer vents; and no undesirable scruffiness spilling out from beneath your fence. Keeping your green pristine is what makes your neighbors take notice and compliment you on your landscaping expertise. The tool that can best accomplish these many tasks is a gasoline-powered weed <strong>eater</strong>, also called a Weedwacker or trimmer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Black+Decker model is a bit more powerful than the Craftsman, and it also has longer battery life. Deciding between the two will likely come down to the size of your yard. Both are <strong>lightweight</strong> and great for quick clean-up tasks. While neither is up to snuff for professional operations, both are worthy of consideration for the average homeowner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The WEEDWACKER’s Easy-Winding head feeds a. 095″ line, allowing you to refill your cutting head for easy engagement swiftly. This brush cutter is powerful, portable, and <strong>lightweight</strong>, making it ideal for even the most difficult tasks. A 2-year limited guarantee is included with the CMXGTAMD30SA. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>No, a battery powered weed <strong>eater</strong> shouldn’t get wet. Remember, this wireless yard tool is not waterproof or water resistant. So, avoid using string trimmers when it’s raining – regardless if it’s a light drizzle or heavy pour. Moisture and water can affect its mechanical parts, including the battery. Whenever you are planning to do yard work, always do it when the sun is out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The weed <strong>eater</strong> is one of the many tools that are used for the regular maintenance of the garden. It can be used to cut the grass and weeds, it can manicure the aspect of the lawn or it can even be used to cut or shape the bushes present in your garden. In some cases, it can even completely replace the lawn mower, especially if you have a rather small lawn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Corded weed <strong>eater</strong>s work best for small yards with sparser weeds. They are lighter, start easier, and are friendlier for the environment. Cordless trimmers- powered by gas or batteries- can be noisy and heavy (even requiring a shoulder strap for some), and yet they go anywhere and can cut through much thicker overgrowth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, 40v tools do have their downsides. Compared to a 20v model, they carry a heavier battery and are more typically expensive. So, if you’re just looking at getting rid of weeds around your backyard, a 20v weed <strong>eater</strong> should be enough. If you have a bigger area to tackle, think about investing in 40v or more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cordless weed <strong>eater</strong>s are light and have no cords. Without the cord, you are free to move about your yard while working with a cordless string trimmer. Lithium-ion batteries provide power to your trimmer head. Easy to Use: It’s almost unanimous: The best battery powered string trimmers are way easier to use and maintain than a gas string trimmer. There’s also no annoying extension cord to worry about as you get with corded electric string trimmers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Correct usage and maintenance of your weed <strong>eater</strong> is going to mean that it will last as it should, work properly, and ensure that you’re safe. I’m going to share some of my experience in this regard. Even the best commercial weed <strong>eater</strong>s need to be cared for correctly, so there’s some important stuff in this section of the article. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best commercial weed <strong>eater</strong>s are designed to eliminate vibration as much as possible. Engines and gearboxes are designed to operate as smoothly as modern engineering will allow. Even with the best technology, weed <strong>eater</strong>s vibrate quite a lot. This causes strain on your arms and fatigue will reduce the amount of time that you’re able to spend doing what you intended – trimming the lawn and cutting back weeds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the main disadvantages of the gas-powered weed <strong>eater</strong>s is the weight. Because you have to add fuel to the tank, you will have to consider at least a couple of extra pounds in addition to the weight stated by the manufacturer. For this reason, you should consider the use of a shoulder strap. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Black+Decker LST136 and Craftsman V20 Weedwacker are both very simple to pick up and use right away, scoring quite equally in their user-friendliness. Both are very <strong>lightweight</strong>, making them easiest to handle and finesse in tight areas around obstacles. They&rsquo;re fairly comfortable to use for long periods, even without a shoulder strap, and their grips are easy to hold. Line replacement is also very straightforward. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Having concluded what to look for in a commercial weed <strong>eater</strong>, let’s put this into practice by reviewing your best options. These machines meet the criteria I’ve mentioned above and can, therefore, all be considered as being among the best commercial weed <strong>eater</strong>s. They differ somewhat but are all great machines. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A well-manicured lawn catches the eye. Crisply cut grass without weeds encroaching on surrounding bushes and sidewalks gives every home curb appeal. Weed <strong>eater</strong>s make trimming weeds and landscaping easy and efficient. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Used indiscriminately over wide swathes of grass, lawn mowers are the brute force of the lawn care world. But when it comes to more detailed work, you need a weed wacker—or line trimmer, weed <strong>eater</strong>, string trimmer, or whatever else you want to call it. These slim, handheld power tools are designed to make short work of garden and lawn maintenance. They&rsquo;re adept at nitty gritty details, like the weeds around edges and ledges of patios, walkways, bushes, and flower beds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At a really fantastic price for a tough commercial weed <strong>eater</strong>, the Hitachi CG23ECPSL is an incredible deal. If you don’t need the most powerful weed <strong>eater</strong>, it makes a lot of sense to buy this machine. You’ll be saving quite a bit and it’s going to work hard for years. Coming from the Hitachi stable means that it’s up there with the best of them with a warranty to match. Like the Tanaka, which comes from the same company, you’re getting a 7-year residential warranty and a 2-year commercial warranty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>this weed <strong>eater</strong> has a 17-inch cutting width. Combined with the .095-inches line, this makes it perfect for medium size and large lawns. Optional blade attachment: although not included in the purchase price, Hitachi also manufactures a blade for this model, that will allow you to trim your lawn faster. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When the string comes into contact with walls, fences, and other solid surfaces, it will wear down very quickly and will easily break. To avoid this from happening, use the blade guard as a guide. Run the weed <strong>eater</strong> along the wall with blade guard pressing against the wall (or other solid objects). This prevents the string from making direct contact with the hard surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We have arranged the 15 weed <strong>eater</strong>s (line trimmers) in our review alphabetically by brand name. There are so many variations that comparing them is like comparing apples and pears – it all depends on what is essential to the individual user. Let’s have a look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Lightweight aluminum and very durable plastics mean that Husqvarna 324L is a breeze to use and incredibly rugged. It weighs only 11.24 LBS, so you can swing it around with ease and you know it can handle what you throw at it. They make a great harness for this weed <strong>eater</strong> that is adjustable and fit’s over both shoulders, this makes the Husqvarna really comfortable to use and you’ll work for hours without feeling it. Though this harness is sold as an optional extra, you’ll need to haul out some extra cash, but it will be money well-spent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In terms of weight, it’s about average for a corded weed <strong>eater</strong>, coming in at 6.5 pounds. Thankfully, this corded string trimmer has a D-ring handle, which makes precision work straightforward. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One thing I’ve seen with all bump heads is that they will become damaged by the heat that results from friction on the shaft and gearbox. The best way to eliminate this is by using a flange disc. There are cheaper, low tech ways of doing this, but a flange disc is the best way of doing this. The three weed <strong>eater</strong>s that were reviewed here all use this method, so I’ll explain the details. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As stated earlier, this cordless electric weed <strong>eater</strong> can also be used as an edger. The string trimmer head rotates 90 degrees which allow you to use it to edge your lawn and garden. I personally would rather get the best edger for the job rather than use this feature, but in a pinch, it will work fine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Greenworks cordless weed <strong>eater</strong> uses a 0.065″ dual quiet line, making it easy to power through tough grass. It is backed by a 4-year warranty against any manufacturer defects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are also many cordless weed <strong>eater</strong>s that have batteries compatible with other tools , or batteries with fast recharge characteristics. In the first case, you will be able to change the drained battery with a recharged one from another tool. In the second, you will have to wait for up to one hour for the battery to recharge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You should always wear long pants when operating a weed <strong>eater</strong> because debris constantly gets tossed around as you work, which can result in injury. It’s also recommended that you wear eye and ear protection. Gas engines are loud and ear protection not only makes things more comfortable, they also protect your ears from damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Still, at 9.9 pounds, this corded weed <strong>eater</strong> is also nearly double the weight of other trimmers I’ve looked at, so you’ll need that handle to keep control. Annoyingly, even with the bolt tightened, it never feels entirely secure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Equipped with a 25cc 2-cycle engine and with a 15-inch cutting swath, this Weed<strong>eater</strong> W25SFK represents another reliable alternative when it comes to choosing the best gas-powered weed <strong>eater</strong>. This tool is really easy to start thanks to its simple starting system and it is fairly <strong>lightweight</strong>.You will also not have the hassle of replacing or reloading the spool because the Weed<strong>eater</strong> W25SFK works with a dual-exit fixed line. In addition, this tool also seems to be quiet. View price - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As technology advances weed <strong>eater</strong>s are becoming lighter and lighter. But they don’t come much lighter than the Black & Decker BESTA510.

After an hour of weed eating, you’ll be sorry if you have a handle that’s just made of metal without a cushion. Callouses will ensure, and blood blisters may come in full force. This is a must for heavier weed <strong>eater</strong>s, making sure the entire piece is comfortable to maneuver is key. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wheeled or walk-behind weed <strong>eater</strong>s are also quite powerful. For larger yards that have thicker foliage, look into these designs as well. They’re particularly nice (although more expensive) when you don’t want to carry around heavy gas-powered trimmers, but instead, these wheeled models make the experience and a bit more manageable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>– Lithium Ion batteries are the preferred/most common type of battery because of their superior energy storage capabilities. Your phone, laptop, and tools are probably all Li-Ion because you can store more power in a smaller space.

Like so many things, you get what you pay for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This brushcutter is <strong>lightweight</strong>, portable, and powerful. It has been battle-tested and is ready to take on even the most difficult chores. It’s small, powerful, and simple to operate.

For right or left-handed use, the adjustable handle gives enhanced comfort, ergonomic comfort, and control. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The bump head is great and very durable. It fits onto a cast aluminum housing which is also a very durable item. The 69.6” straight shaft gives you really good working length, so this weed <strong>eater</strong> doesn’t fall short of the bigger machines. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Look at any of my other Buyers Guides and you will see that EGO Power+ nearly always feature in them. This weed <strong>eater</strong> upholds their fine reputation. It has power in spades, has been exceptionally well made and the battery and charger is so far ahead of its competition it is unreal. The best battery powered trimmer on the market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re cutting long grass or weeds, start near the top. You should never cut more about 5” at a time. If you start at the ground when the grass or weeds are more than 5” tall, you’ll place excessive strain on the engine and gearbox. This will end up damaging the weed <strong>eater</strong>. Long grass and weeds can also wrap around the shaft as it rotates, this also ends up harming your weed <strong>eater</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While you’re working, occasionally check that nothing has wound around the shaft. Sometimes there can be rope, string, or wire that you’re unaware of and this can work its way around the shaft, impairing the weed <strong>eater</strong>’s performance. This is likely to damage the machine in the long run. Clean the buildup of grass clippings from the machine regularly. This should be done every time after you’re done working, more frequently is even better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You should also check the length of the shaft. Ideally, you should choose a weed <strong>eater</strong> with a telescopic shaft, so you can adjust its length to your own height. This is an essential aspect to consider especially if you have a large lawn or if you plan to use the tool often. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another thing I like is the versatility of this tool.

This will surely save you some money, as you will not have to buy the actual tools, which definitely cost more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A <strong>lightweight</strong> gas-powered weed <strong>eater</strong> designed for a comfortable handling and for multiple purposes is the Husqvarna 128LD. Powered by a 28cc 2-stroke engine, this trimmer weighs only 11 pounds and comes with a straight, detachable shaft.Designed to start fast, the engine is equipped with a Smart Start starter system and with a stop switch that automatically resets the starter to the ON position when you switch off the tool.

View price - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In a nutshell, I can’t see any reason to pick a gas-powered string trimmer over an electric weed <strong>eater</strong>. Gas is pricey, worse for the environment, and challenging to keep in stock. Electricity is cheap, and it is much more sustainable than gas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The main difference is how it derives the power. While electric is convenient, quieter, and you don’t have gas fumes, they simply don’t have the power to meet the needs of landscapers and people with large gardens. So if we’re going to be talking about the best commercial weed <strong>eater</strong>s, we need to look at gas-powered machines. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It is equipped with a pivoting trimmer head, which can be adjusted up to 90° for precise lawn edge trimming. This battery weed <strong>eater</strong> offers commercial-grade performance yet tips the scales at just 8.42 lbs, making it a joy to use over extended periods of time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While you can’t see inside the gearbox and probably have no idea of how it works, this is just as important as the engine itself. The gearbox delivers the power to the cutting head and needs to be tough and well-designed. When looking at the machine, we can get some clues as to how they’ve built the weed <strong>eater</strong>. A larger gearbox with a cast aluminum housing is an indication that the engineers have done their job properly. Again, we’ve ensured that you’re getting what you pay for and all three of the weed <strong>eater</strong>s in this review have gearboxes to match the power that the engine delivers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This great weed <strong>eater</strong> is built for larger lots you might find in a traditional suburb. The lithium-ion battery is bigger than most, and the brushless motor delivers more power to the cutting head through the power drive transmission. The cutting width is larger than average. – coming in at 16 inches. That makes this battery weed <strong>eater</strong> versatile enough to handle both heavy weeds and delicate situations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although they are both powerful and maneuverable, they do have some drawbacks. They are very expensive, loud, very heavy, and require a bit more muscle power to control. Gas-powered weed <strong>eater</strong>s are known for regular issues with start-up, as well as being messy and smelly. Refilling them with gas multiple times per job usually results in spillage or simply running out of fuel. Read Best Gas Weed Eaters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cordless varieties are also more cost-effective than battery-powered weed <strong>eater</strong>s since batteries may need replacement after a few years of use. How Powerful Should an Electric String Trimmer Be? Your electric string trimmer should be powerful enough to cut through stalky weeds and dense grass. 5 amp models can easily cut through tough plants, while 3 amp corded weed <strong>eater</strong>s can only manage in thin grass with few delicate weeds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>【Powerful & Lightweight】 One 40V Li-Ion battery and 10 Inches strong blade cutting system increases the mowing efficiency (normal no-load speed: 9000 rpm); Only measuring 5.3 lbs, this string trimmer combines <strong>lightweight</strong> and superior power to keep your garden neat and tidy; The max. Working time reaches an impressive 70 min at a full charge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Similar to the BLACK+DECKER LST136W, the GreenWorks 2101602 is powered by a 40-volt battery and boasts a 12-inch cutting swath, slightly narrower than the LST136W.This weed <strong>eater</strong> is using a .065-inch auto feed twisted dual line, providing excellent results on almost all types of grass and weeds.What I really like about the GreenWorks 2101602 is the three-position pivoting head, that increases the versatility of this tool by allowing the trimming from multiple angles. View price - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The real selling point is the bundling of the leaf blower in this purchase. Neither tool will break power records, and using 20V batteries isn’t future-proofing yourself in this day and age. But it’s cheap, and both products will get the job done. Considering you get both a blower and a weed <strong>eater</strong> for almost half the price of some other trimmers alone, it’s definitely a good value. It’s so inexpensive that if I bought this package, I’d probably spend some of the savings on the extended warranty just for peace of mind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Every engine needs oxygen to run. This foam-like insert keeps unwanted particles, dirt, and debris from entering your engine. It’s essential to keep this item clean so your gas weed <strong>eater</strong> runs at optimum levels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your runtime needs are gr<strong>eater</strong>, look for a string trimmer that balances the efficiency of a brushless motor, uses 0.095-inch line, and possibly comes with a higher-capacity battery. Of course, you can always carry multiple batteries. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>These devices operate simply and with zero emissions (yay for the environment!). It’s nice not to have to deal with gassing up your weed <strong>eater</strong> or dealing with the potential mess. You will have to remember to charge them before you get to work, though, but the start-up is easy with just the push of a button. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I have a very large garden with acres of lawn to maintain. This makes my weed <strong>eater</strong> one of the most important garden tools in the shed. They go by many names: string cutter, brush cutter, bush whacker, or edge trimmer, to name a few. Though weed <strong>eater</strong> is the best name of the lot, it really describes these versatile garden tools to a tee. They do, literally, eat through weeds like no other. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The WORX WG119 is our second pick for the best corded electric weed <strong>eater</strong> due to its great value and powerful, <strong>lightweight</strong> design. It features a 5.5-Amp motor and can be converted from a string trimmer to an edger in a single click. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A.

Then, before putting it away, simply brush the clippings and debris off the unit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Your gas weed <strong>eater</strong> is not only one of the most versatile tools in your outdoor power equipment arsenal but it is also one of the easiest to use.

The engine whirls a monofilament string round and round with sufficient velocity to slice through grass and weeds, trimming away the chaff until your property is the cream of the crop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are a lot of reasons why you’d choose a cordless battery-powered weed <strong>eater</strong>. It’s why so many people are shopping for the best battery-powered weed<strong>eater</strong>. Here are the main benefits of the class: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can choose from two main types of handles: loop handles or bicycle (AKA “bullhorn”) handles. Loop handles are most common on residential weed <strong>eater</strong>s. Bicycle handles may be more comfortable for larger, longer, brush clearing jobs. Try both types to see which feels more comfortable for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most weed <strong>eater</strong>s use a nylon string mounted on a rotary head to cut the grass and the weeds. However, the more advanced models are also equipped with metallic or plastic blades.The string weed <strong>eater</strong>s can use a fixed line system, that require you to replace the line each time it is damaged. Usually, you should replace the line each ½ acres. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>They do, however, have their benefits, such as a constant flow of power, they don’t run out of juice. Once you are set up and ready to go, you won’t be interrupted. They also tend to be much lighter and cheaper than cordless strimmers, so if good value and a <strong>lightweight</strong> tool are high on your list of priorities then consider a corded model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There’s an automatic feed option that works by sending our more line whenever it feels the line is becoming too short. You don’t have to worry about remembering to feed more line yourself; instead, you just keep doing your job, and the weed <strong>eater</strong> uses its own intelligence to send the line along. It’s definitely convenient, but in the event of an issue, it is a bit harder to fix since the feed line is hidden by the head and may cost more for repair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This guide will help you determine if a battery-powered weed <strong>eater</strong> is right for you. We lay out all the pros and cons and describe what features you need to look for when buying a weed wacker. We also have a list of the best battery-powered trimmers on the market to make your buying decision even easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The throttle lock is a feature that, as the name suggests, allows you to lock the trigger into place. If your weed <strong>eater</strong> has a throttle lock, you won&rsquo;t have to tire your fingers out by holding it continuously. To disengage the throttle lock, you simply give the trigger a squeeze. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>—Pull start vs. battery start: With a gas model, the pull start may be an issue for some seniors. You have to put the weed <strong>eater</strong> on the ground and quickly pull up on the string. A spring-assist pull start may make starting the machine easier if you prefer a gas weeder. However, if you’re considering a battery-powered model, push a button, squeeze the trigger, and you’re good to go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Indeed, Black+Decker LCC420 String Trimmer has what it takes to be ranked as one of the best within the product category. It has an exceptional battery that holds the charge for a long time. It also has excellent transmission for better cutting power, even in tough applications. It is also a plus that it has a <strong>lightweight</strong> body, which makes it easy to use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Many weed <strong>eater</strong>s feature an adjustable head that pivots at a right angle to become an edger. It uses the same trimmer line but cuts vertically instead of horizontally. The cover turns to protect the person from the spinning line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As with all gas engines, you need to do some routine maintenance. Your instruction manual will give you all the particulars, though there are few basic things that you should do every time you use the weed <strong>eater</strong>. Before starting the engine, remove the air filter and blow it clean. If you’re using a 4-stroke machine, check the engine oil level and top it up if required. It’s really important to do this every time you use it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Whether you opt for corded or cordless, select a cutting swath (10 to 16 inches) that makes sense for what range you need. A curved shaft is best for light trimming, while a straight shaft is better for heavy-duty work. Credit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar Select a cutting swath (10 to 16 inches) that makes sense for what range you need. A curved shaft is best for light trimming, while a straight shaft is better for heavy-duty work. Quiet motors or engines are obviously preferred, as are <strong>lightweight</strong>, balanced, and low vibration models as far as comfort goes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Adding to its list of features is its wide 12-inch cutting swath and 0.065-inch line diameter. The Black+Decker weed <strong>eater</strong> features an easy line feed system that allows you to advance your line with the push of a button with no bumping required, saving you a considerable amount of time on commercial tasks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Very similar to the Hitachi CG22EAP2SL, this weed <strong>eater</strong> is also powered by a 21.2cc PureFire engine. This is an excellent residential use weed <strong>eater</strong> that boasts a commercial-grade design, being <strong>lightweight</strong> and easily maneuverable.To reduce fatigue and improve the user experience, the Tanaka TCG22EAP2SL is equipped with an anti-vibration system and the D-grip handle is designed to improve balance so you will be able to reach in all the corners of your lawn, regardless of the topography. View price - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Weed <strong>eater</strong>s come with curved shafts or straight shafts. Curved shafts are for light use on a residential property, and they are great for beginners. Straight shafts are for more strenuous commercial work and sometimes come with the option to buy a blade or other accessories. Straight shaft trimmers are also easier to get under bushes. Curved-shaft models are less expensive overall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The two more expensive weed <strong>eater</strong>s are closely matched in terms of engine size and their power output is very similar. What they all have in common is that they all come highly recommended by both homeowners and landscapers alike. So you can be assured that the engines used in all of these weed <strong>eater</strong>s are up to the task of cutting through thick weeds and tall grass. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Because bump heads are an important, and very handy feature of modern weed <strong>eater</strong>s, I want to take the time to explain these mechanisms properly. I’ve tried a few over the years and, being the technical go-to guy for most of my friends and family, I’ve had the opportunity to see a lot of different types. Some of the cheap machines have a very nasty way of doing things. Though if you choose correctly, and buy one of the best commercial weed <strong>eater</strong>s (like the three in this review), you’ll get excellent use from your bump head. There are few things to know about these components though. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a really well-made and sturdy trimmer, make no mistake about that. The only drawback is that it is slightly heavier than some others that made the shortlist. If you’re looking purely for a portable weed <strong>eater</strong> you can get around quickly with, there are lighter models out there. If, however, the extra weight doesn’t phase you too much, this is a real beast and the build quality is incredible…that’s why I have one…flex, GRRRR! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You will find weed <strong>eater</strong>s are an array of price points. Know going into your venture that the average price for a quality trimmer is around $200, with prices dipping far below that or reaching near $1,000. It’s all dependent on your particular needs, brands you trust, and the features you want. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Basic corded and battery-powered weed <strong>eater</strong>s are priced between $30-$50, but they work best for small yards where you may only trim several times a year. Between $50-$100, weed <strong>eater</strong>s are built for regular use and trimming small to medium weeds. Taller brushes and longer-lasting battery charges are found in combination weed <strong>eater</strong>s and weed edgers priced between $100-$200. Above $200 are commercial-grade weed <strong>eater</strong>s with two- and four-stroke engines meant for heavy-duty use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Battery powered weed <strong>eater</strong>s are justifiably becoming more popular. The WORX WG154 is another that is at a great price, very light and incredibly comfortable to use. I love it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Here’s another combination design! The Black + Decker Combination Kit: Lack+Decker String Trimmer & Edgercomes with a sweeper option to help keep sidewalks, garages, and decks clear of trimming debris. The trimmer features an automatic feed spool to ensure continued progress in the yard. It’s also incredibly <strong>lightweight</strong> (right under 4 pounds!), easy to maneuver, and keeps noise levels at a minimum. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, you’ll have to extend your patience with charging – like really. If our best trimmer choice will only take 45 minutes to charge, this DeWALT trimmer can take 240 minutes or 4 hours. Yes, that long. So, in case your weed situation is minimal or you prefer something <strong>lightweight</strong>, this DeWalt model is the right trimmer for you. Check Price on Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Our next metric focused on the battery system of each string trimmer, and this accounts for 25% of each product&rsquo;s final score. We based the bulk of this score on the maximum runtime for each product and awarded extra points to models with different speed settings because it allows you to maximize the battery life by throttling down when extra speed is unnecessary. We measured the runtime for these weed <strong>eater</strong>s when they weren&rsquo;t actually eating weeds, so you&rsquo;ll probably get lower numbers if you&rsquo;re chewing through dense vegetation or particularly stubborn weeds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This line of straight shaft trimmers also has a 16-inch cutting width. This simply means that you will be able to do more within a single pass with this weed <strong>eater</strong>. It’s not sooo big that you’ll have trouble controlling it in tight spots either. It’s easy to guide while trimming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another type of string weed <strong>eater</strong>s are the bump-feed heads. The line is placed on a spool that is fixed in the weed <strong>eater</strong>’s head and advances each time you bump the tool on the ground.Finally, the automatic feed heads use the same spool system as the bump heads, but the line advances automatically without requiring any action on your part. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now, if we’ve already sold you on one of those particular weed <strong>eater</strong>s and your search is done, excellent. You are welcome. Our whole purpose here is for you to be able to make the most informed choice possible. Thank you for coming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Do not allow yourself to become overwhelmed with yard work this season. Instead, stay ahead of the curve by making sure every tool in your shed is working, ready, and exactly what you need to get the job done in the more efficient and easy of ways. And one of those must-have tools is a weed <strong>eater</strong> – or sometimes referred to as a string trimmer. Get every nook, cranny, and narrow strip of lawn clipped and ready to level up your curbside appeal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There’s such a variety of styles, designs, combination devices, and other features to keep in mind when shopping for your new weed <strong>eater</strong>. You’ll find more simplified models and more powerful models. You’ll find ones that can easily cut thick shrubbery too. You’ll even find designs that do a combination of jobs. It’s important to know what you need before you take the plunge into the shopping journey. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This battery-powered trimmer really fills a need for a capable weed <strong>eater</strong> that doesn’t go overboard on weight or price. With more power than 18V/20V models, it’s a good fit for budget-minded individuals. It also carries a 5-year limited warranty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Firstly, electric weed <strong>eater</strong>s have cords. Although this may seem inconvenient, the electric run models have so many advantages. They’re usually light-weight and easy to maneuver, and the runtime never ends because they’re consistently in contact with their power source. But, if you’re working with a traditional size residential lawn, there may be no negative effects on your experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A. The oil you add to the fuel is the only thing that lubricates your gas weed <strong>eater</strong>. Not adding oil, or not adding enough to create the proper ratio (as called for in your owner&rsquo;s manual), will cause the engine to seize. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a really solid performer but is very <strong>lightweight</strong> at 5.5lbs. This is an ideal choice if you maybe are physically slightly weaker but still want something that does a good job and has a considerable amount of power. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re interested in a true professional-grade cordless string trimmer then you need to seriously consider the Makita 40V model as seen above. Makita created their XGT tools to replace their gas-powered power equipment without compromising on power or torque. This isn’t just another disappointing cordless tool. It is one of the best commercial weed <strong>eater</strong>/string trimmer your money can buy. In fact, it it’s equal in power to a 30cc string trimmer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41YIFsZlUcL._SL500_.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="What Is The Best Lightweight Weed Eater - Best Lightweight Weed Eater For A Woman">
