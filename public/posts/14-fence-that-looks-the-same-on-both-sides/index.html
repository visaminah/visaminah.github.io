They are a tongue and groove picket system sandwiched between 1” x 4” boards. They are what we call in the industry a “neighbor friendly “ section. All double sided sections are pool code compliant. - Source: Internet A shadowbox fence is a specific style of privacy fencing. Contractors use tall pickets to create a fence that resembles a standard picket or dog-ear fence when you look at it head on. However, rather than attach the pickets all on one side of the rail, they alternate the boards. The pickets are two to three inches apart, and the construction creates spaces in the fence. - Source: Internet Frustrated? We’re on your side 100%. After all, you’re paying to turn your yard into a backyard oasis for you and your family—not your neighbors. So why should they get to see the clean, attractive side of your fence? - Source: Internet But we understand the need for the rule, too. Privacy fences can be a contentious issue between neighbors. Forcing a new neighbor to look at the back of a fence can raise tensions—something nobody wants. - Source: Internet The exact construction of a shadow box fence features the standard posts with three rails spanning in between. Contractors affix a picket to one side of the rails then another picket on the other side of the rails, with a slight overlap to obscure the view. They keep up this alternating pattern, and it yields just that - a pattern. Wood and light work together to create an attractive interplay. - Source: Internet Vinyl fences provide the same level of privacy as a wooden fence and are much lower maintenance in the long run. Vinyl fences are becoming increasingly popular—it’s easy to see why. These sturdy, showpiece fences are perfect for creating a clean and elegant modern style. Finally, even though vinyl has the reputation for being the most deluxe fence on the market, the price is still comparable to a quality wooden fence. - Source: Internet Facing the wrong side of the fence towards your neighbor, either when installing your fence on your own or working with a contractor, can lead to you being legally forced to switch the fence—at your own expense. This rule applies for all manner of wooden privacy fences, whether or not you paint or stain either or both sides of the fence. The nice side of the fence needs to face outwards for almost every type of common wooden privacy fence, including: - Source: Internet For those who love the rustic look of real wood, a shadow box fence—also known as a good neighbor fence—is exactly what you need. These stylish wooden fences feature a stringer around the fence post on both sides. Just like a vinyl privacy fence, a shadowbox fence looks identical on both sides—problem solved. - Source: Internet While there’s a good reason for this rule, we understand if you don’t want to see an unfinished fence when you look out over your picturesque backyard. We may have the best solution, too. Check out some of our fences that get around this rule—by looking gorgeous on both sides! - Source: Internet Picture the above construction from your side. Now, imagine the same fence from your neighbor’s side. The view will be virtually the same on both sides. The only real difference is in the posts. - Source: Internet The finished side of a fence is often called the “face” while the unfinished side is called the “back.” Regardless of whether you paint it or dress it up, the back of the fence is the one that contains the horizontal fence supports (also called stringers) and the in-ground fence posts. The fence posts and stringers are the supports that keep your fence sturdy, but they aren’t as aesthetically appealing as the clean face of a fence. - Source: Internet Indeed, what makes shadowboxes most appealing is the fact that there’s no front or back of the fence. Your neighbor gets the same pleasing view you do. This feature is also ideal for the yard itself. Homeowners often orient a privacy fence so the front faces the street to enhance curb appeal, leaving the yard looking at the backside. You don’t have to look at the back of the fence when you have a shadowbox fence. - Source: Internet One of the main advantages of privacy fencing, beyond hiding your yard, is that your fence is longlasting. With proper maintenance, any privacy fence can last for years. However, shadowbox fences are especially durable because of the alternating pickets. They distribute the weight evenly between the rails, so you don’t have to worry about sagging or falling pickets. - Source: Internet Head-on, shadowbox fences are just as opaque as a standard privacy fence. However, if you’re up close, you can peer through the spaces to the other side. This aspect is ideal for curious pets and children, thus discouraging climbing or jumping. - Source: Internet Here are a few tips to help you find information about Which Side of My Fence Should Face the Neighbor?:\nLook for good places to get information about fence that looks the same on both sides.
