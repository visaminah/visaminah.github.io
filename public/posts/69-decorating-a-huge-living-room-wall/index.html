Also, you can install artwork of different sizes to maintain a sense of contrast. - Source: Internet In this modern living room, we can see many interesting ideas working together on the same wall space in a cohesive way. From framed prints to surface expanding shelf space above the television.

Not all decorations will look good on every wall; make sure you pick something that will complement the existing architecture of your home. Don’t be afraid to get creative!

These wood panel canvases are a fun way to decorate your living room walls in a cool way. They’re minimal and can also make a fun project for DIY enthusiasts. Or alternatively, you could find them online. 😉 - Source: Internet When it comes to oversized wall art, a large print will set the tone for your entire space. Be mindful of what you want to convey. If you’re looking to create a contemporary space, consider pairing it with a modern trend. - Source: Internet Remember that wall in our dining room with the large floral art piece? Well, this is the same wall with a gallery of four art pieces and layered decor on the table below it. I love to use wall decor as the base for a beautifully styled table. The key here is to add decorative elements that are tall enough to relate to the artwork on the wall and give it a cohesive look. - Source: Internet Also, you can add a sculptural dimension to your otherwise bare living room by installing sconces having unique and interesting shapes. What’s more, wall lighting can help open up space in your living room and brighten it up.

Above is a fabulous example by Maura Endres. In addition, there are numerous posts that feature art walls and art wall templates you can copy. - Source: Internet Hanging decor has become a popular way to cover up and decorate a large wall, apart from paintings and photographs. Wall hangings include any piece of fabric, such as wall tapestries, rugs, or flags. They can be a perfect solution for decorating a huge wall that can’t be covered with only paintings or photos. - Source: Internet To that end, I made several boards for sharing some ideas for a big living room wall. At the top and left side, of some of them, you’ll see some boxes. Those represent one foot. Most of these walls are about 18 to 20 feet. If your wall is bigger, you’ll probably need larger furniture, or it’s also okay to have a little breathing space. - Source: Internet I need to get this off my chest: I have, historically, never really known how to decorate those big, blank walls that lurk around the corner in every home. As a design writer and former interior decorator, I feel like I should have had the answers for this long ago. What do you want from me, Wall?! How am I to adorn you? - Source: Internet There are very few wall decors that can substitute the visual impact and versatility of a beautifully designed wallpaper. Even if you have a small living room, the wallpaper adds a dramatic tone and becomes the focal point of the room. As such, you can pick any wallpaper based on your personal style and preferences. - Source: Internet A: If you’re lucky enough to have a living room with high ceilings, make sure to choose a piece of wall art that won’t look stunted in comparison. A large vertical print will stretch across a tall wall and create visual dimension. Even if your ceilings are high, don’t make the mistake of hanging your wall art too far up. It’s better to choose an oversized print that can cover a wide area, but hang it at an appropriate height. - Source: Internet A folding screen can act as a statement piece while decorating the blank wall in your living room. A traditional folding screen might sound a bit odd, but it works beautifully as a wall decor without requiring any installation. Simply place it in the corner or line it along an empty wall, and the folding screen will become the main attraction of the room. - Source: Internet Store and flaunt your collection of hardcovers and paperbacks with a beautiful bookcase system that can be the focal point of the living room.

Also, when it comes to home decor ideas, a bookcase system is ideal both in terms of practicality and style. - Source: Internet Curtain panels go beautifully in living rooms and bedrooms for decorating and covering up any large wall space. If you have a blank wall that’s idly standing in the room, give it a new curtain makeover. Add some huge curtain panels using long rods and hang some curtains that go well with the entire interior decor of the room. - Source: Internet Oversized mirrors are wonderful solutions to decorate big blank walls and are a great base for a layered look. In our living room, I placed a mirror and a favorite smaller painting on a table to add texture to the wall while still allowing me to decorate with florals and other decorative pieces around it. In this case, I did not hang the mirror, but it could be hung, low above the table. - Source: Internet Sometimes a painted accent wall is more than enough to turn the whole place around. No heavy artwork or wall hangings, just some fresh paint, will do the trick of decorating a large living room wall. But, before you start painting the wall, be careful about choosing the right color scheme. - Source: Internet Not only that, but a mirror centerpiece also helps to reflect light across the entire living room space and brightens it up. Thus, the space automatically opens up with this wall decor idea and looks bigger. Always go for a mirror having a unique and bold shape so that it can stand out and be the central attraction of the room. - Source: Internet Here’s a really cool mosaic of fun messages that can look great on your living room wall. Fun subtle reminders for the family to laugh and show love in your home. They’re a great way to set the mood for a cosy evening in the living room. - Source: Internet “Instead of [committing to a full-blown renovation,] you can simply look for a piece of wall art in the right size and color palette. If you want to focus on wall art instead of [more complex upgrades,] it may be worth it to install something large and impactful. Just be mindful to pick a color palette to complement the rest of the space.” Easy-peasy! - Source: Internet Plus, installing some glass sconces, such as the Murano Glass Chandelier and some floating shelves, can transform the entire space and brighten up the room. They’ll add a dramatic visual dimension to the room along with the sleek TV design. So, creating a TV wall can be an excellent way to use the empty space. - Source: Internet Well, yes, and no. Usually, it’s not a good idea to line up the furniture along a long wall. We discussed this in one of my favorite posts about 21 Interior Design Mistakes. - Source: Internet When it comes to filling up the bare walls in your living room, you can also choose to create a well-organized and finely tailored gallery wall. A themed grid gallery wall works beautifully if you’re planning to have modern and sophisticated living room decor. Also, this gallery wall decor fits perfectly with classic-style and posh living rooms. - Source: Internet A: While you might not be able to hang a massive piece of wall art on your half wall, you can still find a statement piece that will fit. For a wall that’s cut by a window or doorway, go with a vertical-style piece of wall art. If you have a half wall that’s open to your kitchen or another space, you can paint a different shade on each side to emphasize separation between each area. - Source: Internet If you can’t find (or afford) any large-scale artwork to hang on your wall, Klugh says creating a salon-style display with smaller pieces is the next best thing. “Filling up your living room wall with a collage allows you to bring multiple pieces together to create one big art piece,” she explains. “Depending on the sizes you are working with, the collage can be linear or organic-just remember to plan it out before putting it on the wall to ensure you achieve the desired effect.” - Source: Internet A: You can use a variety of wall décor to fill your empty living room wall. One of our top picks is (evidently) an oversized piece of wall art. If you want to add more detail, you can also surround your large wall art with smaller pieces of art to create a dynamic gallery wall. Add mirrors or floating shelves if you want more texture and visual dimension - just make sure not to overwhelm your space! - Source: Internet Fortunately, with a little prep work and the right decorations, interior designer Beth Diana Smith says you can turn any partition into a curated display. “Without proper planning, there can be awkward gaps in the placement when you hang wall art or decor,” she warns. “To avoid putting numerous holes in your wall, I recommend tracing out each art piece on kraft paper, laying everything out with kraft tape, and then moving the kraft paper around as needed until you get the placement just right.” Stuck with an expansive space that you just aren’t sure how to decorate? From wallpapering ideas to tips for integrating accent furniture into the scene, here’s how interior designers advise decorating your living room. - Source: Internet To introduce depth and dimension, Klugh recommends adding an architectural element, like baseboards or crown moulding. “Buy some wood planks from your local home improvement store and install them on the wall in the pattern of your choice to add a layer of interest,” she advises. “Adding an architectural element to your wall will help infuse some character into your space.” If you can’t add trims or mouldings to your wall, Smith says floating shelves are a smart (and storage-savvy) alternative. - Source: Internet You could also do different colors and styling. This would be for a slightly smaller wall. I think it’s best if there’s a little breathing room, like 6″-12″, on either side of the piece of furniture. But, if it’s tighter than that, it should be okay. But the moulding of the piece of furniture should not touch the wall. - Source: Internet Low-cost meets significant impact. The major benefit of large wall art is its ability to elevate your living space with little effort. Plus, you can swap styles depending on changing trends. Large artwork doesn’t take up any floor space, so it’s also the perfect solution for improving small spaces. All you need is a blank wall to host a stunning print. - Source: Internet The grid gallery wall follows a theme and offers a streamlined and symmetrical artwork display. If you own any favorite art collection or series, the grid-themed style is the best way to decorate the gallery wall. Or, you can also arrange some botanical prints for creating a beautiful grid gallery wall in your living room. - Source: Internet I hope this gives you a few ideas about how to decorate a big blank wall in your home. The key is to choose artwork, mirrors or decor that you love, first and foremost. Remember that you can paint or change frames to match your decor or make a gallery wall look cohesive if necessary. - Source: Internet It’s best to go for any large art piece that’s vibrant and colorful that can fill large blank walls. Plus, a large-scale art piece will add more visual texture and color to your living room, enhancing its aesthetic appeal. You can consider installing an oversized and beautifully framed photograph or painting on the empty wall behind your living room sofa for the wall decor. - Source: Internet LED light walls are a unique way to make living room walls look unique. We’re fans of these draped walls with panels and lights in between the panels. They look sophisticated and elegant too. - Source: Internet For an alternative approach, Smith says you can always count on accent furniture to help fill a wall space. “Adding in a sculptural table, an accent chair, or even a decorative ladder is a great way to break up the space,” she says. “In my own home, I have a wooden ladder that I use to layer woven blankets, creating a stylish storage solution that minimises clutter.” - Source: Internet A large, empty living room wall can quickly turn into an eyesore, but a nuanced artfully arranged one can upgrade the space as a whole. “A thoughtfully decorated wall in a living room is essential,” says interior designer Nikki Klugh of Nikki Klugh Design Group. “An especially large wall can serve as the focal point, so it’s crucial to make sure it’s designed in a way that makes an impact.” - Source: Internet Use a blank wall as a place to put your special finds or interests on display. Hang your instruments, show off a collection of mirrors you’ve found while antiquing, or finally display those vintage maps you’ve been hoarding over the years. If you’ve got something quirky in your life that you love, go ahead and let your freak flag fly. - Source: Internet We love classic frames of vintage pictures and elegant drawings. Having a picture wall is an age-old idea that we absolutely adore and can never get enough of. The great thing about picture frames on your walls is that they can be customized to fit any specific aesthetic. - Source: Internet If you aren’t comfortable with a cluster of artwork on one wall but like the idea of hanging multiple works, create an organized gallery by hanging framed art in perfect alignment. Be sure to take exact measurements, so there is equal space between each frame. Whether you choose a small or larger amount of art to work with, it will be a perfect solution to take up some empty space. - Source: Internet Moreover, a console table goes well with both modern and traditional styles of interior decoration. So, no matter the style of your living room space, a console table can be perfect for decorating the large empty wall. However, if you don’t have enough space to set up a large console table, you can also go for a set of benches or small stools. - Source: Internet If wall hangings and other artworks cannot fill up the entire space in your living room, you can always go for a full-length bookcase installation. A bookcase system with tall bookshelves with a floor-to-ceiling design can be ideal for decorating large walls. You don’t need to worry about installing costly paintings or artwork if you go for this wall decor idea. - Source: Internet When it comes to living room wall decor, there are endless possibilities. You can choose to go with a simple look, or you can add in some eclectic touches to make your space stand out. One of the easiest go-to ways to make your walls look elegant in no time is by mounting Displates onto your walls. They’re available in a wide range of designs from minimalistic posters to abstract posters if that’s what you’re going for. - Source: Internet A large and oversized floor mirror can be a great way to decorate your large living room wall while adding an incredible visual texture to the room. It’s simple, it’s beautiful, and it’s so much more practical than going for large-scale artwork. Simply place it on the floor to brighten up the entire living room space. - Source: Internet If you think that a large painting or photo will be too much for the living room, you can go for a curated gallery wall. It’s one of the most popular ideas of wall art decor that go well in any living room, small or big. Start collecting eclectic and unique art pieces, including paintings, drawings, or photos, for decorating the huge wall in your living room. - Source: Internet If you’re looking for a piece of décor for your living room, with an extra punch, you can’t go wrong with oversized wall art. When it comes to taking your living room to the next level, you don’t have to redo your entire interior to make an impression. By adding large wall art (and a few simple accessories,) you can give your living space a whole new look. Whether your style is trendy or traditional, canvas prints are an excellent way to showcase your personality and sense of style. - Source: Internet For instance, if you have a white living room wall, a cylindrical chandelier can help in enhancing the visual dimension and filling up the empty space in the room. However, it’s best to install sculptural lighting only if you plan to keep the living room wall bare. If you pair such a heavy lighting piece with large artworks or wall hangings, the room might look overcrowded. - Source: Internet Creating a wall of curtains will help you fill up any large and empty space in your living room and amp up the room’s aesthetic appeal. Just make sure that the color of your curtains goes perfectly well with the color of the walls. So, carefully consider the color scheme before choosing the curtains for your new curtain panels. - Source: Internet Hanging a paper mural can be just as mesmerizing and captivating as any wallpaper.

With enough wall space, you can take advantage of different parts of your living room to let your fun decor ideas run wild. - Source: Internet Industrial-style homes can use this technique as well. Paint the wall a forest green or dark olive color to perfectly match your metal and leather accents. It’s a great way to bring additional texture and bold colors to your space. - Source: Internet A little wallpaper can go a long way. “Patterned wallpaper turns the entire wall into an art piece,” Smith explains. “If you don’t want to commit to wallpaper, my favourite solution is to buy some funky or fun gift wrap and then frame pieces of it in a series, which gives you the flexibility to change your wall dÃ©cor often and play around with new aesthetics without breaking the bank.” - Source: Internet One option that can go a long way is to add applied wall moulding. In this example, the chair rail would be better as a solid piece, but you get the idea.

So, it can be a great way to fill up the empty space in your living room and add some lush greenery. - Source: Internet If you’re stumped on which layout suits your living room best, consider whether you want a framed or unframed print. Framed prints come in several single panel shapes, and they give your space a super classic look. However, you can add a modern twist by going beyond the simple rectangle.

Or are you starting fresh with a new decorative theme, and need a place to begin? Let this post inspire you. We&rsquo;ve collected smart and stylish living room <strong>wall</strong> decorations from across the web – from budget friendly selections to highly collectible accents from renowned designers. Whether your style leans glamorous, rustic, industrial, or natural, there&rsquo;s something here for every decor style. Let your living room <strong>wall</strong>s come to life as a canvas for your one-of-a-kind decorative style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>wall</strong> art decor can add a multidimensional visual impact to the living room with different art pieces. It’s best to follow an asymmetric pattern while arranging the art pieces on the large empty <strong>wall</strong>s to create an eclectic appeal. Also, you can install artwork of different sizes to maintain a sense of contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In this modern living room, we can see many interesting ideas working together on the same <strong>wall</strong> space in a cohesive way. From framed prints to surface expanding shelf space above the television. Don’t be afraid to boldly go all out on your living room <strong>wall</strong> decor, a lot of ideas can sometimes work perfectly all at the same time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Think about your overall style. What type of vibe do you want your living room to give off? Once you have an idea in mind, it will be easier to start narrowing down your options. Consider the size and shape of your <strong>wall</strong>s. Not all decorations will look good on every <strong>wall</strong>; make sure you pick something that will complement the existing architecture of your home. Don’t be afraid to get creative! Add a few unexpected elements to your space, and you’ll be amazed at how quickly it comes to life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Here’s something fun! These wood panel canvases are a fun way to decorate your living room <strong>wall</strong>s in a cool way. They’re minimal and can also make a fun project for DIY enthusiasts. Or alternatively, you could find them online. 😉 - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to oversized <strong>wall</strong> art, a large print will set the tone for your entire space. Be mindful of what you want to convey. If you’re looking to create a contemporary space, consider pairing it with a modern trend. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Remember that <strong>wall</strong> in our dining room with the large floral art piece? Well, this is the same <strong>wall</strong> with a gallery of four art pieces and layered decor on the table below it. I love to use <strong>wall</strong> decor as the base for a beautifully styled table. The key here is to add decorative elements that are tall enough to relate to the artwork on the <strong>wall</strong> and give it a cohesive look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Also, you can add a sculptural dimension to your otherwise bare living room by installing sconces having unique and interesting shapes. What’s more, <strong>wall</strong> lighting can help open up space in your living room and brighten it up. A pair of sconces also goes perfectly well with modern and traditional living room styles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We could also fill a long unbroken <strong>wall</strong> with art. Above is a fabulous example by Maura Endres. In addition, there are numerous posts that feature art <strong>wall</strong>s and art <strong>wall</strong> templates you can copy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hanging decor has become a popular way to cover up and decorate a large <strong>wall</strong>, apart from paintings and photographs. Wall hangings include any piece of fabric, such as <strong>wall</strong> tapestries, rugs, or flags. They can be a perfect solution for <strong>decorating</strong> a huge <strong>wall</strong> that can’t be covered with only paintings or photos. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To that end, I made several boards for sharing some ideas for a big living room <strong>wall</strong>. At the top and left side, of some of them, you’ll see some boxes. Those represent one foot. Most of these <strong>wall</strong>s are about 18 to 20 feet. If your <strong>wall</strong> is bigger, you’ll probably need larger furniture, or it’s also okay to have a little breathing space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I need to get this off my chest: I have, historically, never really known how to decorate those big, blank <strong>wall</strong>s that lurk around the corner in every home. As a design writer and former interior decorator, I feel like I should have had the answers for this long ago. What do you want from me, Wall?! How am I to adorn you? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are very few <strong>wall</strong> decors that can substitute the visual impact and versatility of a beautifully designed <strong>wall</strong>paper. Even if you have a small living room, the <strong>wall</strong>paper adds a dramatic tone and becomes the focal point of the room. As such, you can pick any <strong>wall</strong>paper based on your personal style and preferences. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A: If you’re lucky enough to have a living room with high ceilings, make sure to choose a piece of <strong>wall</strong> art that won’t look stunted in comparison. A large vertical print will stretch across a tall <strong>wall</strong> and create visual dimension. Even if your ceilings are high, don’t make the mistake of hanging your <strong>wall</strong> art too far up. It’s better to choose an oversized print that can cover a wide area, but hang it at an appropriate height. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A folding screen can act as a statement piece while <strong>decorating</strong> the blank <strong>wall</strong> in your living room. A traditional folding screen might sound a bit odd, but it works beautifully as a <strong>wall</strong> decor without requiring any installation. Simply place it in the corner or line it along an empty <strong>wall</strong>, and the folding screen will become the main attraction of the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Store and flaunt your collection of hardcovers and paperbacks with a beautiful bookcase system that can be the focal point of the living room. It’s one of the easiest and most effective ways to decorate a large living room <strong>wall</strong>. Also, when it comes to home decor ideas, a bookcase system is ideal both in terms of practicality and style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Curtain panels go beautifully in living rooms and bedrooms for <strong>decorating</strong> and covering up any large <strong>wall</strong> space. If you have a blank <strong>wall</strong> that’s idly standing in the room, give it a new curtain makeover. Add some huge curtain panels using long rods and hang some curtains that go well with the entire interior decor of the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Oversized mirrors are wonderful solutions to decorate big blank <strong>wall</strong>s and are a great base for a layered look. In our living room, I placed a mirror and a favorite smaller painting on a table to add texture to the <strong>wall</strong> while still allowing me to decorate with florals and other decorative pieces around it. In this case, I did not hang the mirror, but it could be hung, low above the table. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sometimes a painted accent <strong>wall</strong> is more than enough to turn the whole place around. No heavy artwork or <strong>wall</strong> hangings, just some fresh paint, will do the trick of <strong>decorating</strong> a large living room <strong>wall</strong>. But, before you start painting the <strong>wall</strong>, be careful about choosing the right color scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Not only that, but a mirror centerpiece also helps to reflect light across the entire living room space and brightens it up. Thus, the space automatically opens up with this <strong>wall</strong> decor idea and looks bigger. Always go for a mirror having a unique and bold shape so that it can stand out and be the central attraction of the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Here’s a really cool mosaic of fun messages that can look great on your living room <strong>wall</strong>. Fun subtle reminders for the family to laugh and show love in your home. They’re a great way to set the mood for a cosy evening in the living room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“Instead of [committing to a full-blown renovation,] you can simply look for a piece of <strong>wall</strong> art in the right size and color palette. If you want to focus on <strong>wall</strong> art instead of [more complex upgrades,] it may be worth it to install something large and impactful. Just be mindful to pick a color palette to complement the rest of the space.” Easy-peasy! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Plus, installing some glass sconces, such as the Murano Glass Chandelier and some floating shelves, can transform the entire space and brighten up the room. They’ll add a dramatic visual dimension to the room along with the sleek TV design. So, creating a TV <strong>wall</strong> can be an excellent way to use the empty space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Well, yes, and no. Usually, it’s not a good idea to line up the furniture along a long <strong>wall</strong>. We discussed this in one of my favorite posts about 21 Interior Design Mistakes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to filling up the bare <strong>wall</strong>s in your living room, you can also choose to create a well-organized and finely tailored gallery <strong>wall</strong>. A themed grid gallery <strong>wall</strong> works beautifully if you’re planning to have modern and sophisticated living room decor. Also, this gallery <strong>wall</strong> decor fits perfectly with classic-style and posh living rooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A: While you might not be able to hang a massive piece of <strong>wall</strong> art on your half <strong>wall</strong>, you can still find a statement piece that will fit. For a <strong>wall</strong> that’s cut by a window or doorway, go with a vertical-style piece of <strong>wall</strong> art. If you have a half <strong>wall</strong> that’s open to your kitchen or another space, you can paint a different shade on each side to emphasize separation between each area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you can’t find (or afford) any large-scale artwork to hang on your <strong>wall</strong>, Klugh says creating a salon-style display with smaller pieces is the next best thing. “Filling up your living room <strong>wall</strong> with a collage allows you to bring multiple pieces together to create one big art piece,” she explains. “Depending on the sizes you are working with, the collage can be linear or organic-just remember to plan it out before putting it on the <strong>wall</strong> to ensure you achieve the desired effect.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A: You can use a variety of <strong>wall</strong> décor to fill your empty living room <strong>wall</strong>. One of our top picks is (evidently) an oversized piece of <strong>wall</strong> art. If you want to add more detail, you can also surround your large <strong>wall</strong> art with smaller pieces of art to create a dynamic gallery <strong>wall</strong>. Add mirrors or floating shelves if you want more texture and visual dimension - just make sure not to overwhelm your space! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fortunately, with a little prep work and the right decorations, interior designer Beth Diana Smith says you can turn any partition into a curated display. “Without proper planning, there can be awkward gaps in the placement when you hang <strong>wall</strong> art or decor,” she warns. “To avoid putting numerous holes in your <strong>wall</strong>, I recommend tracing out each art piece on kraft paper, laying everything out with kraft tape, and then moving the kraft paper around as needed until you get the placement just right.” Stuck with an expansive space that you just aren’t sure how to decorate? From <strong>wall</strong>papering ideas to tips for integrating accent furniture into the scene, here’s how interior designers advise <strong>decorating</strong> your living room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To introduce depth and dimension, Klugh recommends adding an architectural element, like baseboards or crown moulding. “Buy some wood planks from your local home improvement store and install them on the <strong>wall</strong> in the pattern of your choice to add a layer of interest,” she advises. “Adding an architectural element to your <strong>wall</strong> will help infuse some character into your space.” If you can’t add trims or mouldings to your <strong>wall</strong>, Smith says floating shelves are a smart (and storage-savvy) alternative. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You could also do different colors and styling. This would be for a slightly smaller <strong>wall</strong>. I think it’s best if there’s a little breathing room, like 6″-12″, on either side of the piece of furniture. But, if it’s tighter than that, it should be okay. But the moulding of the piece of furniture should not touch the <strong>wall</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Low-cost meets significant impact. The major benefit of large <strong>wall</strong> art is its ability to elevate your living space with little effort. Plus, you can swap styles depending on changing trends. Large artwork doesn’t take up any floor space, so it’s also the perfect solution for improving small spaces. All you need is a blank <strong>wall</strong> to host a stunning print. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The grid gallery <strong>wall</strong> follows a theme and offers a streamlined and symmetrical artwork display. If you own any favorite art collection or series, the grid-themed style is the best way to decorate the gallery <strong>wall</strong>. Or, you can also arrange some botanical prints for creating a beautiful grid gallery <strong>wall</strong> in your living room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I hope this gives you a few ideas about how to decorate a big blank <strong>wall</strong> in your home. The key is to choose artwork, mirrors or decor that you love, first and foremost. Remember that you can paint or change frames to match your decor or make a gallery <strong>wall</strong> look cohesive if necessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s best to go for any large art piece that’s vibrant and colorful that can fill large blank <strong>wall</strong>s. Plus, a large-scale art piece will add more visual texture and color to your living room, enhancing its aesthetic appeal. You can consider installing an oversized and beautifully framed photograph or painting on the empty <strong>wall</strong> behind your living room sofa for the <strong>wall</strong> decor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>LED light <strong>wall</strong>s are a unique way to make living room <strong>wall</strong>s look unique. We’re fans of these draped <strong>wall</strong>s with panels and lights in between the panels. They look sophisticated and elegant too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For an alternative approach, Smith says you can always count on accent furniture to help fill a <strong>wall</strong> space. “Adding in a sculptural table, an accent chair, or even a decorative ladder is a great way to break up the space,” she says. “In my own home, I have a wooden ladder that I use to layer woven blankets, creating a stylish storage solution that minimises clutter.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A large, empty living room <strong>wall</strong> can quickly turn into an eyesore, but a nuanced artfully arranged one can upgrade the space as a whole. “A thoughtfully decorated <strong>wall</strong> in a living room is essential,” says interior designer Nikki Klugh of Nikki Klugh Design Group. “An especially large <strong>wall</strong> can serve as the focal point, so it’s crucial to make sure it’s designed in a way that makes an impact.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Use a blank <strong>wall</strong> as a place to put your special finds or interests on display. Hang your instruments, show off a collection of mirrors you’ve found while antiquing, or finally display those vintage maps you’ve been hoarding over the years. If you’ve got something quirky in your life that you love, go ahead and let your freak flag fly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We love classic frames of vintage pictures and elegant drawings. Having a picture <strong>wall</strong> is an age-old idea that we absolutely adore and can never get enough of. The great thing about picture frames on your <strong>wall</strong>s is that they can be customized to fit any specific aesthetic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you aren&rsquo;t comfortable with a cluster of artwork on one <strong>wall</strong> but like the idea of hanging multiple works, create an organized gallery by hanging framed art in perfect alignment. Be sure to take exact measurements, so there is equal space between each frame. Whether you choose a small or larger amount of art to work with, it will be a perfect solution to take up some empty space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Moreover, a console table goes well with both modern and traditional styles of interior decoration. So, no matter the style of your living room space, a console table can be perfect for <strong>decorating</strong> the large empty <strong>wall</strong>. However, if you don’t have enough space to set up a large console table, you can also go for a set of benches or small stools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If <strong>wall</strong> hangings and other artworks cannot fill up the entire space in your living room, you can always go for a full-length bookcase installation. A bookcase system with tall bookshelves with a floor-to-ceiling design can be ideal for <strong>decorating</strong> large <strong>wall</strong>s. You don’t need to worry about installing costly paintings or artwork if you go for this <strong>wall</strong> decor idea. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to living room <strong>wall</strong> decor, there are endless possibilities. You can choose to go with a simple look, or you can add in some eclectic touches to make your space stand out. One of the easiest go-to ways to make your <strong>wall</strong>s look elegant in no time is by mounting Displates onto your <strong>wall</strong>s. They’re available in a wide range of designs from minimalistic posters to abstract posters if that’s what you’re going for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A large and oversized floor mirror can be a great way to decorate your large living room <strong>wall</strong> while adding an incredible visual texture to the room. It’s simple, it’s beautiful, and it’s so much more practical than going for large-scale artwork. Simply place it on the floor to brighten up the entire living room space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you think that a large painting or photo will be too much for the living room, you can go for a curated gallery <strong>wall</strong>. It’s one of the most popular ideas of <strong>wall</strong> art decor that go well in any living room, small or big. Start collecting eclectic and unique art pieces, including paintings, drawings, or photos, for <strong>decorating</strong> the huge <strong>wall</strong> in your living room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re looking for a piece of décor for your living room, with an extra punch, you can’t go wrong with oversized <strong>wall</strong> art. When it comes to taking your living room to the next level, you don’t have to redo your entire interior to make an impression. By adding large <strong>wall</strong> art (and a few simple accessories,) you can give your living space a whole new look. Whether your style is trendy or traditional, canvas prints are an excellent way to showcase your personality and sense of style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For instance, if you have a white living room <strong>wall</strong>, a cylindrical chandelier can help in enhancing the visual dimension and filling up the empty space in the room. However, it’s best to install sculptural lighting only if you plan to keep the living room <strong>wall</strong> bare. If you pair such a heavy lighting piece with large artworks or <strong>wall</strong> hangings, the room might look overcrowded. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Creating a <strong>wall</strong> of curtains will help you fill up any large and empty space in your living room and amp up the room’s aesthetic appeal. Just make sure that the color of your curtains goes perfectly well with the color of the <strong>wall</strong>s. So, carefully consider the color scheme before choosing the curtains for your new curtain panels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hanging a paper mural can be just as mesmerizing and captivating as any <strong>wall</strong>paper. But, what is a <strong>wall</strong> mural? It’s a large <strong>wall</strong> art piece that’s pretty cheap because you don’t have to frame it to hang it on the big <strong>wall</strong> in your living room. Also, these <strong>wall</strong> murals are perfect for filling up the large space in any room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Boho <strong>wall</strong> decor has become somewhat of a favourite for a lot of people and we’re all for it. We like these woven baskets blended into a fun <strong>wall</strong> piece that is to die for. Your living rooms can stand out in many fun ways. This is certainly a great one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can go for murals with natural patterns that add visual textures and dimensions to the room. Moreover, the best thing about <strong>wall</strong> murals is that they’re not permanent and very easy to remove. So, you can easily change the <strong>wall</strong> mural if you decide to spruce up the <strong>wall</strong> decor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are a gardening enthusiast, you can transform the large blank living room <strong>wall</strong> into a unique plant <strong>wall</strong> that’ll add greenery to the room. Install planters with a wood pallet for hanging plants on the empty <strong>wall</strong>. The plant offers a natural and organic touch to the living room, enhancing its aesthetic appearance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Here’s a fun bohemian style shelving with little trinkets, crystals and a diffuser. A fun way to add a touch of personality to your living room with little sculptures and other decorative items that would otherwise be taking up space on other surfaces. With enough <strong>wall</strong> space, you can take advantage of different parts of your living room to let your fun decor ideas run wild. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Industrial-style homes can use this technique as well. Paint the <strong>wall</strong> a forest green or dark olive color to perfectly match your metal and leather accents. It’s a great way to bring additional texture and bold colors to your space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A little <strong>wall</strong>paper can go a long way. “Patterned <strong>wall</strong>paper turns the entire <strong>wall</strong> into an art piece,” Smith explains. “If you don’t want to commit to <strong>wall</strong>paper, my favourite solution is to buy some funky or fun gift wrap and then frame pieces of it in a series, which gives you the flexibility to change your <strong>wall</strong> dÃ©cor often and play around with new aesthetics without breaking the bank.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One option that can go a long way is to add applied <strong>wall</strong> moulding. In this example, the chair rail would be better as a solid piece, but you get the idea. Imagine how the art would like more random if the moulding wasn’t there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The mood board above is from the paint and palette collection. It’s one of my favorite boards. Plus, this is a reasonably long <strong>wall</strong> in a dining room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While <strong>decorating</strong> large <strong>wall</strong>s and filling up the blank space in your living room, installing artwork is not always necessary. You can also install a new piece of furniture, like a console table, to decorate the large <strong>wall</strong> space. Set up a large console table against the big blank <strong>wall</strong> to change the entire look of your living room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One common option is to do a <strong>wall</strong> of built-in cabinets or bookcases. However, they are usually the most expensive option. If you are thinking of doing built-in cabinetry, consider if doing so will add value to your home. Or, maybe the subsequent owners might want to rip it all out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Choose an oversized <strong>wall</strong> art that measures 68 inches by 45 inches in height and width. If you want to cover the entire <strong>wall</strong> above your couch or bed, this is the right size selection for your canvas. It makes your space look dramatic and appealing while adding a luxurious touch to your space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Plus, it’s quite easy to maintain the plant <strong>wall</strong> without worrying about water dripping from the built-in planters. You can also add some visual textures to the living room by installing the plant <strong>wall</strong> and hanging different indoor plants on this empty <strong>wall</strong>. So, it can be a great way to fill up the empty space in your living room and add some lush greenery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re stumped on which layout suits your living room best, consider whether you want a framed or unframed print. Framed prints come in several single panel shapes, and they give your space a super classic look. However, you can add a modern twist by going beyond the simple rectangle. Explore long <strong>wall</strong> art with panoramic prints, or a narrow, vertical piece. If you’re curious about more of the benefits of framed artwork, check out this rundown from our article on framed vs unframed <strong>wall</strong> art: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Who said living room <strong>wall</strong>s had to be draped in many different items every time. We’ve included this sleek, minimalist geometric shaped <strong>wall</strong> idea to show that decor can sometimes be so subtle that it’s pretty much non-existent at all.
