For the best look, try to pair a cool-toned shade of green with your <strong>teal</strong> instead of a warm one since most <strong>teal</strong>s tend to be on the cooler end of the spectrum. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The key to pairing all of these shades is to choose options with all of the deep intensity jewel tones are known for.

As such, many people have become more interested in exploring this color and incorporating it into their homes and even wardrobes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Black, white, or gray pants are all excellent choices for <strong>teal</strong> shirts. Another good option is blue pants, including a trusty pair of blue jeans.

White countertops and walls will lighten the scheme and add a bit of contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most people know that certain <strong>colors</strong> go well together.

Take notes on the ratios and paint you use and make samples of the <strong>colors</strong> for future reference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In terms of other common pants <strong>colors</strong>, the ones you’ll want to avoid are brown pants or other shades of tan or khaki.

Brown <strong>colors</strong> are very warm, while blues and greens tend to be much cooler in tone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For most people, this is the color that they think of when they hear the name, <strong>teal</strong>.

This is where referring back to the color wheel comes in handy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;ve been dreaming of an ultra-moody living room, take note of this drama-filled design belonging to Amelia from Audenza and paint your walls, trim, and ceiling a rich shade of <strong>teal</strong>.

The adjacent white walls and flood of natural light keep the tonal scheme from feeling too dark and moody. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Beyond its appeal as a current fashion trend, <strong>teal</strong> has remained a popular choice because it is a versatile “jewel-toned” color.

Hence, the name <strong>teal</strong> was used in reference to this duck and the name became synonymous with the color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We’ve already discussed that <strong>teal</strong> is considered to be one of the jewel tones.
