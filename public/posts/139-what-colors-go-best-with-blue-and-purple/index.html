The other version is more of a light periwinkle and is also commonly used. This is a lesser periwinkle color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple and brown clothing combinations are one of the few that rarely seem to work. This is mostly because it is difficult to find tones of <strong>purple</strong> and brown that work well with each other. Brown tends to be much more warm-toned than most <strong>purple</strong>s are, given that <strong>purple</strong> has strong influences of blue within it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, maybe you like to blend your own <strong>colors</strong> so that you can get more accurate <strong>colors</strong> from the paints you have. To blend a periwinkle color, you should first experiment and create a color palette, where you can record the <strong>colors</strong> and amounts of paint you use. This helps if you create a color you like by accident, you can always refer back to your color palette and see how you created it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Burgundy doesn’t just pair well with other standard <strong>colors</strong>. It also looks lovely with metallics like gold. Pairing gold with burgundy results in a lush, expensive-looking combo that is altogether timeless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yet, at first, let me get this straight: any vibrant color is beautiful, but it all comes down to a matter of how we perceive <strong>colors</strong> because not all people see the right <strong>colors</strong> the same way. Why do certain people like certain hues and others don’t? To my mind, it’s all about the associations that these <strong>colors</strong> evoke. Some people might associate light cyan with the color of the clear sky; equally, for some, it’s just a color of the hospital walls. Also, the important factor is how we use the <strong>colors</strong> and how we combine them, as some of the combinations might have an opposite effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You might be wondering, how come cool and warm <strong>colors</strong> make a bad combination. We all know the rules of complementary <strong>colors</strong> and how they look good together. Green goes well with magenta and blue looks great with yellow. And I agree with that – complementary <strong>colors</strong> make a great base for color palettes if you know how to use them properly. However, let’s move to a more specific sphere – interior design and see how complementary <strong>colors</strong> react in the environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Besides the color combinations, when it comes to choosing periwinkle paint for the home, there are some things you need to take into consideration first. We have already established that periwinkle is a blend of lavender <strong>purple</strong> with slight blue undertones. However, you need to check out your paint color first, as the lighting can affect the color. Remember, you should always test the paint before you purchase it. Periwinkle has so many variations, with some being slightly bluer and others pinker, so you have a great variety to choose from, with the example below leaning a little more towards blue while maintaining that periwinkle sparkle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grayish blue and brown <strong>colors</strong> feel beautiful naturally. Warm browns offer diverse hues with a thick, velvety glow, while light brown <strong>colors</strong> feel at ease. As the Earth and skies, the grayish blue and browns are made for each other. The color combinations which include cinnamon, bronze, mahogany, chocolate, coffee, beige, and other browns <strong>colors</strong> look gorgeous with the trendy light blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The color <strong>purple</strong> exudes mystery. It is a rich and mysterious color. It has a lot of shades that range from light to dark and it is set to cater to the designer and the wearer’s message and sense of style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to matching <strong>colors</strong>, many designers and artists turn to the color wheel and basic color theory for choosing coordinating options. The color wheel contains all of the main <strong>colors</strong> of the rainbow, ranging from shades of red to shades of <strong>purple</strong>. By looking at the <strong>colors</strong> next to the color, you wish to match and the <strong>colors</strong> across from it, you should be able to choose <strong>colors</strong> that pair well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As you explore the color blue, you will soon discover that each shade or tint has its characteristics. Below you will find a table that makes this a lot easier to follow and understand. For this example, we have only taken three of the best-known <strong>colors</strong> of blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Shades of <strong>purple</strong> vary widely, and some are more appropriate than others for the changing seasons. Pastel <strong>purple</strong>s are popular in the spring, bright <strong>purple</strong>s in summer, and earthy warm-toned <strong>purple</strong>s in the fall. Winter is an excellent time for cool, blue-toned <strong>purple</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Often the best way to pair blue and <strong>purple</strong> is to match the shades between the two. You can pair bright <strong>purple</strong> and bright blue together or a pastel <strong>purple</strong> and pastel blue. Alternatively, you can mix shades and pair light <strong>purple</strong> with dark blue or dark <strong>purple</strong> with light blue <strong>colors</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>That color combination makes the environment more fresh, funky & modern. It can also make the environment more refreshing & cool. The <strong>purple</strong> color combination with mustered is a great symbol of royalty & strength. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For example, you could combine velvety burgundy drapes with rich chestnut leather furniture to make a warm and cozy study. Accenting dark brown furniture with burgundy pillows or accent chairs will also help the neutrals pop. From a fashion standpoint, these <strong>colors</strong> are best for a fall look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Light <strong>purple</strong> clothes go with many different <strong>colors</strong>, depending on your mood. White, beige, and gray neutrals are all good color options as long as they have similar undertones to the <strong>purple</strong> you are wearing. For a pop of color, pair your light <strong>purple</strong> clothing with light yellow, light blue, or dark <strong>purple</strong> options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In dressing up, it’s never limited to black and white. There are always in-betweens, so you can always explore the style that is comfortable and good for you. Experiment with <strong>colors</strong> and you might discover a new color combination that might work very well with your aesthetic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wouldn’t it be fun to mix <strong>colors</strong>? The answer is - absolutely. The joy of playing with <strong>colors</strong> is often celebrated through festivals like Holi. The blending of <strong>colors</strong> together creates beautiful scenery for those watching. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Overall, it’s not only painful to look at these saturated color combos, but also the moving sensation might be very disorienting. Especially in web design, where convex shapes might signify a button or other system elements. More than that, legibility plays a pivotal role in navigation and overall understanding in any type of design, so having these bright <strong>colors</strong> that make you look away is not the way to go. Thus, I would suggest changing one of the <strong>colors</strong> completely if it’s impossible to omit the duo altogether. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Light grayish blue provides an attractive background color. The combination of grayish-blue with other hues creates beautiful contrasts. Bleached blue is a versatile color. It is balancing the warm <strong>colors</strong> and enhancing the calming effects of cool tones in color schemes. Pale grayish-blue is an excellent color design choice for creating relaxing, bright, and modern interiors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Many people are comfortable with traditional color-pairing combinations such as black and white or tan and blue, but are not as familiar with another attractive match; <strong>purple</strong> with dark grey. Together, grey and <strong>purple</strong> merge the serious and fun sides of your personality. Traditional decor is frequently defined by a simple and clean look. A full palette of royal grays maintains this aesthetic while <strong>purple</strong> brings in a bit of glamor and mystique. It’s the perfect color combination for a large living room that inspires. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Disclaimer: This article is just an opinion piece only, and it’s not intended to offend somebody’s taste or choice of color. The way you see <strong>colors</strong> might be different from the way we see them. Thank you for understanding! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The color combinations made by mixing blue and <strong>purple</strong> together are different shades of lavender or periwinkle. Since <strong>purple</strong> and blue make a pretty similar shade, the combination of these two <strong>colors</strong> will also be close to these <strong>colors</strong>. Though indigo looks like a combination of blue and <strong>purple</strong>, it is actually a combination between blue and red. The color periwinkle is made in different ways too. If it&rsquo;s to make a paint, the color is made with the help of red and white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>On the color wheel, <strong>purple</strong> and Mustard <strong>colors</strong> are opposites, which is make them complementary.

For vogue looking to incorporate more <strong>purple</strong> into their wardrobe, consider this winning combo. Purple and mustard balance each other out, making you look and feel like a king. The hex code of Mustard and the <strong>purple</strong> color is (Mustard #FFDB58). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The color blue can make excellent dark <strong>colors</strong>. Ultramarine, for example, is already a dark blue color, and by using it, you can create outstanding shades of dark blue. By mixing dioxazine <strong>purple</strong> with ultramarine blue, you create a brilliant dark blue. The dioxazine <strong>purple</strong> tends to make the ultramarine blue much darker, and also adds a slight <strong>purple</strong> shade to it. When taking the dark blue, you created with the dioxazine <strong>purple</strong> and the ultramarine blue, and you add phthalo green, you make the color even darker, with a slight green tint to it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you create a dark blue color, take your blue, and mix it with another color.

Violet hues consist of blue and red undertones and can warm up the interior design. Light <strong>purple</strong> and blue color combinations are charming. Deep <strong>purple</strong>, violet, amethyst, grape, and pale blue tones look sophisticated and elegant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Periwinkle is not a color option that naturally springs to mind like many others, but it does provide a gentler color when compared to vibrant <strong>purple</strong>s and blues. Periwinkle can be a color that forms the base for other more brilliant <strong>colors</strong> like orange. The color can also work well with other <strong>colors</strong> from the same family, namely your blues. However, periwinkle can also work well with neutrals, and it can be used as a neutral itself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It adds to your fashion statement quite relevantly. Pearl earrings and ear crawlers can go very well with a <strong>purple</strong> dress on a formal occasion. A fun and street style would also allow for larger sizes of hoop earrings.

It looks good with neutrals and cool <strong>colors</strong>. It also looks good when included in bright patterns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Light blue and orange color combinations produce strong contrasts. White decorating ideas soften the blue-orange color schemes and harmonize modern interiors. Light peach, yellow-orange shades, pinkish orange, tangerine, reddish-orange, and all orange-brown <strong>colors</strong> are perfect matching color shades for bleached blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Neon <strong>colors</strong> are known for being eye-catching, bold, and daring. However, with such distinct qualities, they are also referred to as disturbing and reckless. Because of these two contradicting sides, having two or three neon <strong>colors</strong> alongside each other is not the best of options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In fashion, color combinations, or mix and matches, are integral parts of completing a specific look. Fashion is expression and an excellent way to express this is through <strong>colors</strong>. Assessing what <strong>colors</strong> belong together is part of the fun process of fashion. What <strong>colors</strong> go with <strong>purple</strong> clothes? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bringing these <strong>colors</strong> into your space or personal style is easy. This color scheme translates well to patterns as well. Don’t be afraid to have fun mixing pops of burgundy with patterned fabrics like black and white stripes or polka dots. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best solution would be to use a toned-down right shade of one of the <strong>colors</strong>. As you can see in the picture, the neon cyan color was switched to dark indigo blue. In this way, you will be able to use neon pink as a statement color and don’t overstimulate the viewer. Moreover, in such vibrant color combinations, the neon would be powered by the lightness or, in our case, the darkness of other <strong>colors</strong> to make use of its best qualities. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Elegant cool-green pastels which are another way of matching the blue color. Green pastel tones add volume and create depth while making modern interiors feel calming and peaceful. Hues associated with green water, jade, emerald green <strong>colors</strong> are beautiful matching <strong>colors</strong> for the trendy light blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>On the whole, it’s not about the color itself; it’s about the things that are associated with this color and how it works in specific color combinations. As we have discussed, neon pairs and vibrating color combos are just too aggressive to the viewers’ eyes, so that instead of attracting their attention, these <strong>colors</strong> put them off. As for the only dark color combinations, the associations, and feelings that these <strong>colors</strong> evoke come into the play. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You’ll want to stick to a pure white color, however. Off-white shades can have yellowish tones, which won’t always work with all shades of <strong>purple</strong>. If you stray into the off-white range, try to pair it with <strong>purple</strong> <strong>colors</strong> with warmer tones – like plum, mauve, or shades with a reddish hue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The first step is to print out a copy of the color wheel. When choosing which color wheel to print out, rather choose a tertiary color wheel that has 12 <strong>colors</strong> that include various shades, hues, and tints. Apply some of the original blue paint to a piece of white paper and allow it to dry. Now compare that color with the color on your color wheel and make an accurate match. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grayish blue color tones are the latest trends in decorating modern interiors. Bleached Coral in Pantone palette is light, bright, and gentle.

It works great with pastels. Here are new color combinations you can use for your interior decorating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Infuse your home with a color that is unexpected and makes a statement.

Whether you want plum walls or lilac accent pillows, you’re free to explore and find a decor style all your own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A lot of people think that <strong>purple</strong> is quite a challenging color to pair and match with.

However, in reality, <strong>purple</strong> is a relatively easy color to style and pair with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In styling, it’s not just about the clothes but everything involved, including the accessories and makeup. It’s even how you bring yourself. When you wear <strong>purple</strong> clothes, you need to pair them with something that will emphasize your style and get your messages through. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yes, pairing <strong>purple</strong> with <strong>purple</strong> can be a creative and nice combination with the right choice of shade. The same shade paired with the same shade needs more work as you would need to make sure the accessories make up for the lack of diversity. A safe choice would be pairing a slightly dark <strong>purple</strong> shade with a lighter one (twice lighter) would be a good choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The effect of disturbance and disarrangement as if something is wrong, but you are not sure what exactly. On the one hand, it has no distinct mood, and it’s hard to notice something. On the other hand, when you do notice the <strong>colors</strong>, it has no point of visual interest. You would probably want to skim the piece and move on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The most recommended way to create a periwinkle color is to begin with a white base. Place some white paint onto your palette surface. Then choose blue and red paint to use with this blend. Add some blue paint a short distance from the white and begin using small amounts to mix with the white. Then begin adding small amounts of red, or you can also try using <strong>purple</strong> if you do not have red. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=http://www.flowershopnetwork.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/blues-300x99.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="What Colors Go Best With Blue And Purple - Orange Blue What Color">
