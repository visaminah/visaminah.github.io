You’re all done with this DIY <strong>closet</strong> organizer with drawers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After picking up some 2x2s I took my measurements. Take note: whenever you’re measuring for doors, give them some breathing room to swing about. Make sure you don’t build them so tall that they will ever catch on the floor etc. I took my measurements and my bundles of 2x2s to the garage and got to cutting. I built two sets of doors at once, one set for my entry/coat/shoe <strong>closet</strong> and one set for my laundry room <strong>closet</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>These DIY <strong>closet</strong> shelves are easy to <strong>make</strong>.

It’s simple for them. The manufacturers take a 4’ wood or laminate board and cuts it into 4 equal pieces. Or to really drive costs down they use cheap 12” deep wire shelves which leave their ‘lovely’ (sarcasm intended) lines along the bottom of your favorite sweaters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I’m very picky when it comes to <strong>closet</strong> doors, I don’t really like any of the options out there. First you have the rolling <strong>closet</strong> doors that, always, cover half the <strong>closet</strong> half the time and are a bit of a nightmare to install, hate em. Then you have the old fashioned kind of <strong>closet</strong> doors where its basically just two interior doors side by side that open out, I like this idea but they’re usually really heavy. Bi-fold <strong>closet</strong> doors are probably my favorite kind (if I had the choice) but they’re also rather a pain to install and complicated to <strong>make</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Closets don’t have to be ugly. Closets can go beyond being strictly an efficient storage place. Closets can become wardrobe rooms with a sense of beauty. They can be a place you want to use, not a place you dread. However, you’ll need a game-plan to <strong>make</strong> your <strong>closet</strong> an ‘experience,’ not a chore. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The size of the organizer depends on the space available in the <strong>closet</strong> and the length of the rods you need. Once you decide on these, start creating your plan. Here’s what mine looked like: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This project was mainly done with two types of plywood. I used ½” plywood for the drawer boxes and ¾” plywood for the shelves and front of the drawer. It’s very important that this <strong>closet</strong> system is attached to studs inside the wall because of its weight. You will need to use a stud finder to locate the studs accurately. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you live in Columbus, New Albany, Upper Arlington, Worthington, Westerville (or anywhere in Central Ohio) and need help with a <strong>closet</strong> design we’d love to help.

What do you have to lose (except the mess and your frustration)? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To install the drawers so that they work properly, it’s important to have the same 1/4″ gap between each drawer going up. Starting from the bottom, install the drawer so that it’s flush with the bottom of the DIY <strong>closet</strong> organizer sides. You could temporarily attach a guide board from the bottom and remove it once the bottom drawer is attached. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At first glance a wood or painted MDF <strong>closet</strong> cut on site and installed by your trim carpenter and finished by the painting crew looks beautiful. However, there are several problems with this approach. Here’s 3 things you won’t like: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;re tired of seeing your <strong>closet</strong> as a cluttered mess, this easy DIY is for you! Just leave the hanging rod and install two shelves at each <strong>closet</strong> corner. This <strong>make</strong>s it easy to tidy up even if you don&rsquo;t have any extra room in your bedroom. Installing shelves in your <strong>closet</strong> is a great DIY project! It won&rsquo;t cost too much, and you can do it on the weekend. This is an excellent solution if you have a small <strong>closet</strong> and want to maximize the space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The very top shelf will lay down on the top of the <strong>closet</strong> system spanning the whole width of the <strong>closet</strong>. This shelf needs to be 12″ wide. The length of each shelf piece might be different depending on how big your <strong>closet</strong> is. But for my <strong>closet</strong>, the top shelf was 72 1/2″ in width, and the smaller shelves on the sides were 25 3/4″. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But I can’t guarantee this will work for every hollow <strong>closet</strong> door. If your sliding doors overlap more than usual, you would need to trim off quite a bit to <strong>make</strong> them work as hinged doors. Cutting off a large amount could get into the hollow area and cause an issue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=2><li>Vary the height and depth of your cabinetry. If you have a 9’ tall <strong>closet</strong>, consider a center <strong>closet</strong> section which is 8’ tall and deeper than the cabinetry on the left and right sides. You’ll create a cool look – and get more storage simultaneously. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>913 Likes, 16 Comments.

The most logical shelving to use is shoe shelving (which extends 12” to 14” from the wall). Since shoes are put on and taken off by the <strong>closet</strong> door, installing them in the front of the <strong>closet</strong> is logical location. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can get the wood look without the maintenance, but with the adjustability, you’ll need. The way to do this happen is using a laminate <strong>closet</strong> system. New textured laminates feel like wood without the need to repaint or refinish. Sounds like the best of both worlds to me. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Again using a stud finder, locate the studs on the left and right <strong>closet</strong> walls and mark them on a wall.

I placed four sturdy objects under the organizer to give it the support we needed underneath. You can install it without but you will need three people to <strong>make</strong> that easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you walk into a <strong>closet</strong> system made of wood, or multi-density fiberboard (MDF) which is painted, and they have a mix of shelves and double hanging space you may think (at first) – this will work fine. However, what you may not consider is the fact that you’re 5’2” tall and your husband is 6’1”. You may not think about where you’re going to put your longer dresses. You may not know (yet) your husband suit coats are going to be curled at the bottom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Oh, is sooooo unfortunate when your grand visions of a custom <strong>closet</strong> came face to face with the reality of your smaller-than-you’d-like budget! But, you’ve got to face your fears about custom <strong>closet</strong> budgets sometime, and now is as good a time as any. But the challenge is, how can you get your arms around cost when it seems NO <strong>closet</strong> companies (that would be zero, nada etc.) share information about cost on their sites? Well – I’m here to break this stereotype for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://cdn.designbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3d-geometrical-halloween-masks-steve-wintercroft-10.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="How To Make Your Own Closet - how to make your own closet system">
