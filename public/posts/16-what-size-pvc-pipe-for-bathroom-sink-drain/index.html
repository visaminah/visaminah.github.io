If old galvanized pipes and gate valves cause low water pressure, you might need to change them in order to supply new pipes with enough pressure. Here, a ball valve has replaced a gate valve. - Source: Internet Use this chart to count the number of fixture units that will be connected to a drain line and for the minimum drain****pipe size. If a toilet connects to a drain****pipe, the pipe must be at least 3 inches. Check local building codes. - Source: Internet Once drain lines are assembled, an inspector will probably test to make sure they do not leak. Some inspectors will simply pour water through the pipes. Other inspectors require that the line be plugged with an inflatable drain plug and the system filled with water. - Source: Internet Valves, fixture controls, cleanouts, and compression pipe fittings must not be covered by a wall or floor surface in case you need to work on them in the future. If necessary, install an access panel. The most common location for an access panel is behind a tub or shower. - Source: Internet These pipes run from the distribution pipes to the fixtures. As a general rule, you can run ½-inch pipe to most fixtures; run ¾-inch pipe to a hose bib or a water heater. Different fixtures place different demands on supply pipes. Each fixture has a demand rating based on fixture units (see chart). - Source: Internet Common codes mainly focus on venting. After all, drain****pipes that are not properly vented will run sluggishly and could release noxious fumes into the house. Here are some other important plumbing code considerations to keep in mind during your remodel: - Source: Internet A drain cleanout provides a convenient access point to a pipe. Plumbing codes call for cleanouts at various points so drains can be easily augered in case of a clog. You can simply remove the cap to access the blockage or debris inside the pipe. To be safe, install a cleanout whenever you tap into a drain line unless there is already one nearby. - Source: Internet When changing pipe materials, use the correct transition fitting. Without a dielectric union (shown above), the joint between galvanized and copper pipe would quickly corrode. Use the approved fitting when changing from plastic to copper, cast iron to plastic, and ABS to PVC. - Source: Internet List fittings in detail on your plumbing plan so you will be sure to purchase the right ones. Be sure to use special drain fittings, such as a closet bend, so wastewater can flow smoothly. Inspectors will have specific fitting requirements for different fixtures. - Source: Internet In most cases, drain****pipes must slope at least 1/4 inch per running foot. Running a drain across a room that does not have a basement or crawlspace might call for careful calculations. Codes might require that vent pipes slope 1/8 inch per foot. Some codes allow level vents. - Source: Internet Water hammer arresters might be required for appliances such as a washing machine. Supply pipes could need to be cushioned wherever they run through or against a framing member. This helps prevent pipes from shaking or clanging against each other when the water flow suddenly stops. A water hammer arrester ($16, The Home Depot) creates a cushion of air that helps absorb the shock. - Source: Internet Cutting a notch in a joist greatly weakens it. Whenever possible, bore holes through joists instead. This calls for careful work as holes for a drain****pipe must be at slightly different levels so the pipe will slope. Whether notched or bored, long spans will likely need doubled joists. - Source: Internet The installation of plumbing must not weaken the structure of a house. The inspector can require that you reinforce joists that have been cut to accommodate pipes. Other requirements include the use of fire caulking around pipes and placement of protective plates over pipes. - Source: Internet Use approved clamps or straps to secure pipes. According to most codes, copper supply pipe must be supported every 6 feet, galvanized or black steel pipe every 12 feet, PVC or ABS drain****pipe every 4 feet, and cast-iron pipe every 5 feet. To be safe, install more supports than are required. - Source: Internet A bathroom sink uses a 1¼-inch trap. Showers and floor drains use 2-inch traps. All other fixtures and appliances use 1½-inch traps. - Source: Internet Pipes that are glued without primer eventually will leak. Apply primer when joining PVC pipes to ensure a secure hold. Some plumbing codes require you to verify that primer was used. Choose a purple-colored primer ($10, The Home Depot) so the inspector can quickly tell that the pipes have been sufficiently primed. - Source: Internet Here are a few tips to help you find information about What Size Pipes For Bathroom Plumbing:\nLook for good places to get information about How To Measure Sink Drain Pipe Size.
