If you wish to have a two-sided, L-shape sectional sofa, you must decide if you prefer a “right-arm facing” or “left-arm facing” arrangement. Left-arm facing simply means that when you face the sofa, the piece of the sectional that extends toward you mirrors your left arm and vice versa. That piece is typically the shorter side of the L. - Source: Internet The sectional couch is the quintessential piece of family furniture, providing ample space for parents, siblings, and pets to cuddle up with or to sit apart. Shop Slumberland Furniture to find a wide selection of sectionals in all shapes, sizes, and configurations to accommodate your entire family, large or small. A reclining chaise sectional makes any space the perfect spot to relax. - Source: Internet Once you’ve decided to add a sectional sofa to your living room or family room furniture, there are some things to consider to get it right. The first consideration, as with any piece of furniture, is the room’s layout and size. Do you have enough room for a full-size sectional sofa with a left chaise or a sofa bed? Or does your living room require a smaller sectional sofa? It’s also important to know the direction of the L. If you choose an L-shaped sectional, you’ll need to know if it’s a left-facing couch or a right-facing sectional couch. - Source: Internet Other shapes include U-shaped and curved sections. With three sides of similar length, the U-shaped sectional couch offers maximum capacity and is especially great for group conversation. Curved sectionals fall somewhere between the others, and their rounded anchoring center section brings people together in an informal way conducive to more intimate or entertainment-driven settings. Design experts suggest when taking furniture measurements for a curved sectional, consider the dimensions of the outward curves to ensure you have enough space for traffic areas and the inward curves if you’re combining it with coffee tables. - Source: Internet Many modern sectionals are designed with today’s lifestyle in mind. That means that they’re made of safe material, such as poly-fiber or other premium stain-resistant performance fabrics that require little maintenance. If you prefer a leather sectional couch, use water-free cleaning solvents designed for leather. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions, but with occasional care and periodic cushion fluffing, you should be able to enjoy your sectional for years to come. - Source: Internet Living spaces are all unique. When choosing the size of your sectional, it’s good to know what the sectional measurements mean. The average sectional is about 130 inches wide. A smaller, two-piece sectional would be about 112 inches wide, and a large, three-piece sectional measures about 160 inches or more. But what does wide mean? What does length mean?
