As for further searchable items pertaining to do yellow blue and green go together, they will likewise have anything to do with Blue + Green + Yellow = What Color. 12 Interesting Facts Does Yellow Green And Blue Go Together | do yellow blue and green go together So some people say yellow and blue make green. And you will find other answers that say that yellow and blue make black. How can this be? - Source: Internet It’s a complicated subject, which seems to be changing all the time, but only because fashion designers like to introduce new key fashion colors each season. Sometimes these are successful, like the time when emerald green was daringly paired with deep blue in lots of women’s outfits. And in recent years, we’ve seen lots of pretty pink attractively matched with soft green in fabric patterns. - Source: Internet But don’t be fooled by this lovely subtractive colour mixing diagram. You might not get such lovely blue, green and red colours when you mix real CMY primaries (either on your printer or with inks/paints). Why not? Because of the unwanted absorptions. - Source: Internet For example, red can have orange undertones and it can also have deep pink undertones, which would make a terrible mis-match. And the reason is that orange is a warm color, but deep pink is a cool color. Similarly, green can have so many different shades – some of which include yellow and others which include blue. So if you put different shades of green together, you can get an unpleasant clash between the yellow and blue undertones, even though they are both cool colors! - Source: Internet For instance, black can have a variety of undertones, including brown, green, blue and purple. So you wouldn’t want to wear a brown blouse with a black skirt or trousers, if the black fabric had a blue or purple undertone. This is because brown is a warm color, which would not look good with blue or purple, which are cool colors. - Source: Internet Another important thing to consider is your own natural skin, hair and eye color. Because you must wear warm colors if your own skin undertones are warm, or cool colors if you have cool skin undertones. In general, warm natural coloring shows up as brown or honey-colored eyes, and cool as either black eyes or blue, green or gray eyes and cool skin undertones. - Source: Internet The figure below shows what happens when you mix an ideal yellow dye with an ideal blue dye. The blue dye reflects light perfectly in about a third of the spectrum (and absorbs perfectly in the other two thirds). The yellow pigment reflects light perfectly in about two thirds of the spectrum (and absorbs perfectly in the other third). - Source: Internet Natural earth tones always look classy and they include soft versions of orange, warm browns, soft turmeric yellow, moss-green, and gentle reds. In the brighter colors, Biscay green is a gentle yellow-green, that’s lighter than moss-green, can be worn with deep-blue. So for a trendy look this could be dark-blue jeans with a fresh-looking light green top. And black, white and gray shades are fashionable again this season. - Source: Internet The key to deciding which colors you should not wear together is to have a full-length mirror and try on clothes in as much natural daylight as possible. Too much brown or swampy green will make you look frumpy. And too many bright shades could leave you looking like a fairground attraction! The colors you wear together can totally change your image, so take note of your first impression – good or bad – when you look in the mirror at any color combination! - Source: Internet So finally you can see that the best subtractive primaries are cyan, magenta and yellow because the cyan is red absorbing, the magenta is green absorbing and the yellow is blue absorbing. And what is more, you now understand why this is the case (rather than accepting dogma). You also understand why there is a relationship between the CMY of subtractive mixing and the RGB of additive mixing. - Source: Internet That’s right. Mixing cyan and magenta makes blue. The cyan absorbs in one third (the red third) and the magenta absorbs in one third (the green third) but neither absorb the short wavelengths. - Source: Internet Have you ever seen this happen. Of course, you have. Whenever you use a printer (which typically uses cyan, magenta and yellow primaries) to get a green, the printer is using cyan and yellow to make the green. - Source: Internet To begin started, here are some tips for finding information about do yellow blue and green go together:\r- Research What Is The Color Scheme Used In The Blue And Orange Combination?-related information from credible sources.
