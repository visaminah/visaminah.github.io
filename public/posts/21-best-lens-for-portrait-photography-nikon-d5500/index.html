As for other things that need to be looked up, they are about Nikon D5500 Lens Mount and have something to do with Nikon D5500 Telephoto Lenses. 21 Tips to Best Lens For Portrait Photography Nikon D5500 | Best Wildlife Lens For “Nikon D5500” For less than the price of the two previous Nikon lenses, you can have one lens that does it all. Time is money, and for the commercial portrait photographer versatility in your gear is a premium. Throw this lens on and get the job done! - Source: Internet But, if your focus is high-end art portraiture then Nikon does offer a version of the 50mm lens with a maximum aperture of f/1.4. This will allow more background blurring and a smaller area of sharp focus. Think photographs where the eyes of your subject are in focus, but the tip of the nose, the ears and the rest of the head are blurry. - Source: Internet I will choose to take a zoom lens over a prime lens for any commercial job where I am on the clock. The confidence in knowing that the one lens on my camera can get it all done is key. When working with a family, especially one with young children, you don’t have all the time in the world to change lenses and restage shoots. You need to be able to capture those candid moments, and the Tamron 24-70mm won’t let you down. - Source: Internet Each lens has a maximum aperture. This is the lowest aperture you can use with that particular lens. In order to obtain apertures between f/1.2 and f/2.8, you’ll need a lens that is capable of getting that low. - Source: Internet If you are working in a studio with a flash unit, then your shutter speed will likely be synced at 1/200 of a second, and your aperture much smaller to compensate, making wide maximum apertures a moot point in the decision to purchase. Furthermore, I wouldn’t be concerned about shooting in low light with this lens. The f/2.8 aperture is still acceptable, and modern camera bodies are capable of handling higher ISO levels with little noticeable grain. - Source: Internet The beauty of the Nikon 50mm lens is in its simplicity and time tested usability. Prime lenses are simple and easy to use – you move around until your frame is desirably filled, then you shoot. Want more space around the subject? Take a few steps back. Want your subject to fill the frame a little more? Take a few steps forward. It’s really that simple. - Source: Internet Typically, as focal length increases the maximum aperture decreases (a larger f-stop), and less light makes its way through your lens to the camera sensor. Nikon has managed to overcome this, equipping the 85mm lens with a wide f/1.4 aperture, making it highly capable of producing high-quality images in low light, and beautiful background bokeh. - Source: Internet For example, the D5100 kit lens can only go down to f/3.5 when shooting towards the wide end (18mm) and f/5.6 when shooting towards the long end (55mm). - Source: Internet The Tamron 24-70mm similarly fits into this category, but with the added versatility of zoom capabilities. No longer do you have to take a few steps back to fit the whole family in the frame, but just a little twist of the wrist, and a click of the shutter. You can go out on the job with only this lens and be confident in getting all the shots you need, and getting it done with ease. - Source: Internet Distortion is not so problematic when shooting landscapes, but becomes obvious when shooting photographs of people and faces. You might notice straight lines (such as a fence) appearing curved towards the edges of an image, or the appearance of bulging noses and facial features of images taken with a wide-angle lens. This is distortion. - Source: Internet At 35mm, this lens is great for capturing wide shots. You can feel confident getting the whole family in the frame when shooting in tighter spaces. And, while not as compressing as the Nikon 50mm or 85mm, image distortion will appear minimal with good distance to your subjects. But get up close and you will notice the bulging features and less attractive qualities associated with wide-angle photography. - Source: Internet This lens is great for shooting single portraits, but when considering this lens as an ideal candidate for shooting family portraits, its long focal length becomes less ideal. Getting an entire family framed nicely in a shot with an 85mm lens will mean having to move quite far from the subjects. If you are shooting inside, or in a studio, it might be impossible to back up far enough. If it were your only lens you would be in trouble. But for grabbing beautiful headshots and close-ups, this is your go-to. - Source: Internet As I mentioned before, there is a distinction between the needs and desires of the art and commercial photographer. This lens is truly geared towards the commercial family portrait photographer. The f/2.8 aperture may appear less desirable than its Nikon prime lens counterparts, but in a commercial setting, it is unlikely to be running the aperture that wide anyway. - Source: Internet The Sigma 35mm is a high-quality lens, and it is obvious in the images it produces. You will notice a distinct sharpness in the photos you take, and good contrast, even with your aperture wide open. As I mentioned, the lens is a niche product, and not necessarily one I would recommend to the photographer beginning to dabble in family portraiture. But for the professionals looking for a high-quality product to add to their arsenal, the Sigma 35mm has what it takes to inspire a new photographic direction. - Source: Internet If you want to capture portraits, where the subject is sharp and the background is out of focus, it’s best to use a “bright” lens with a maximum aperture between f/1.2 and f/2.8. Lower f-numbers reduce the area in focus, giving you a shorter area in focus. - Source: Internet If you are shooting commercial family portraits, then maximum aperture may not be as important as versatility, or usability. You’re going to want something that you can rely on to get the job done. The Nikon 50mm lens is a tried and true classic – a wide enough angle to capture an entire scene, yet just narrow enough to avoid significant lens distortion. It’s so easy to use and capture great images, it’s almost a crime! - Source: Internet The large aperture value of the Nikon 50mm is certainly a selling point, and another reason to have this lens in your camera bag. Being able to really open the aperture up makes this lens invaluable when shooting in low light. Maintaining a higher shutter speed will help reduce motion blur, giving sharp, well-exposed images of your subjects. - Source: Internet If the majority of your portraits will be indoors or in low light, it would be best to use an external speedlight in addition to one of the “bright” lenses mentioned above. An external speedlight will allow you to bounce light off a ceiling, rather than directly at your subject. This spreads the light evenly throughout the room, giving you more natural looking portraits indoors. - Source: Internet One of the main selling points of the Sigma 35mm is the large f/1.4 aperture. This lens excels in low light conditions. Shoot confidently, with crisp focus and beautiful background bokeh without having to crank the ISO. When wide open you can achieve an extremely shallow depth of field – a trademark effect for the professional art-portrait photographer. - Source: Internet Portrait mode will automatically adjust in-camera settings to capture soft, natural looking skin tones. With a proper lens, it will also blur the background to make the subject pop. See how to enable portrait mode or refer to page 30 of the manual. - Source: Internet When photographing people the longer your focal length, the more compresses, and therefore more attractive your subjects will appear. Nikon 85mm really plays into this, producing sharp, attractive images, with very little noticeable distortion. Again, this is a prime lens (fixed focal length), so it is simple and easy to use – slap it on and what you see is what you get. Move around, fill the frame, take the shot. - Source: Internet Here are a few tips to help you find information about Best Nikon Lens For Family Portraits:\nLook for good places to get information about Nikon D5100 Portrait Tips, Tricks \u0026 Lenses.

It’s so easy to use and capture great images, it’s almost a crime! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The large aperture value of the Nikon 50mm is certainly a selling point, and another reason to have this <strong>lens</strong> in your camera bag. Being able to really open the aperture up makes this <strong>lens</strong> invaluable when shooting in low light. Maintaining a higher shutter speed will help reduce motion blur, giving sharp, well-exposed images of your subjects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If the majority of your portraits will be indoors or in low light, it would be best to use an external speedlight in addition to one of the “bright” <strong>lens</strong>es mentioned above. An external speedlight will allow you to bounce light off a ceiling, rather than directly at your subject. This spreads the light evenly throughout the room, giving you more natural looking portraits indoors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the main selling points of the Sigma 35mm is the large f/1.4 aperture. This <strong>lens</strong> excels in low light conditions. Shoot confidently, with crisp focus and beautiful background bokeh without having to crank the ISO. When wide open you can achieve an extremely shallow depth of field – a trademark effect for the professional art-portrait photographer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Portrait mode will automatically adjust in-camera settings to capture soft, natural looking skin tones. With a proper <strong>lens</strong>, it will also blur the background to make the subject pop. See how to enable portrait mode or refer to page 30 of the manual. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When photographing people the longer your focal length, the more compresses, and therefore more attractive your subjects will appear. Nikon 85mm really plays into this, producing sharp, attractive images, with very little noticeable distortion. Again, this is a prime <strong>lens</strong> (fixed focal length), so it is simple and easy to use – slap it on and what you see is what you get. Move around, fill the frame, take the shot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MAIN-Moonrise-over-Blea-Tarn-and-the-Langdales-scaled.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Best Lens For Portrait Photography Nikon D5500 - Best Lens For Nikon D5500"><p>Here are a few tips to help you find information about Best Nikon Lens For Family Portraits:</p><ul><li>Look for good places to get information about Nikon D5100 Portrait Tips, Tricks & Lenses.
