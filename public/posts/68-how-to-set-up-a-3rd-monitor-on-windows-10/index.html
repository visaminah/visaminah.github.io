As for other things that need to be looked up, they are about Windows 10 Multiple Displays and have something to do with how to set up a 3rd monitor on windows 10. 68 Reference List: How To Set Up A 3Rd Monitor On Windows 10 | How To Have 3 Monitors On Laptop Most commonly when people want to build a multi-display environment, they start with one monitor, and then later add another one. Ideally, it’s best to purchase multiple monitors of the same model in the beginning. This way the screen size and resolution can be aligned, but also the color and aesthetics will match. But perhaps more importantly, because the monitors are the same age, any defects in the screen such as color variations can be found early-on by comparing the two monitors next to each other. - Source: Internet If you scroll down to the bottom of the “Display” menu there is an “advanced display settings” link. If you click on this, you can set the resolutions of the display monitors. Additionally, if you click on the “Advanced sizing of text and other items” link, you can change the settings for more detailed things like the size of items and text. - Source: Internet Another note for those who might be thinking about trying to build a multi-display environment, is that the more monitors you align, the wider your viewing angle will need to be. In order to be able to see each monitor clearly without having to move, you need to buy a product that has wide viewing angles. Furthermore, the more screens you have the harder it is to avoid light reflecting on your screen and into your eyes. To prevent this, we recommend buying a monitor with a glare reducing surface, which will make the screens easier to see and will be easier on your eyes. Additionally, as mentioned above we recommend a monitor with a narrow bezel and black border as it is space-saving and increases visibility among other advantages. - Source: Internet Many people want to add a second monitor to their computer. While dual screen setup can increase productivity and flexibility, it’s not always plug-and-play. First, you need a graphics card capable of handling multiple displays and enough ports for all of them. Adding multiple external displays to a laptop can also be difficult, so you need to learn how to set up your computer for multiple monitors. - Source: Internet Version 1.80 Fixed bug: In some monitor configurations, MultiMonitorTool displayed the same monitor more than once. The monitor ID of every monitor is now saved into the monitors configuration file. Added ‘Use Monitor ID In Load Config’ option, If you turn it on, MultiMonitorTool will use the monitor ID to detect the correct monitors when you load a monitors configuration file. - Source: Internet MultiMonitorTool.exe /MoveWindow Primary Process “iexplore.exe” Move all windows of Firefox to the next monitor: - Source: Internet An example of how the multi-display environment can help with photo re-touching. Rotating one monitor to the vertical position can help with retouching portrait photos, or editing long documents and websites. If you want to take advantage of a vertical screen, you need to choose a monitor that can be rotated or buy a separate rotating mount to attach your monitor to. - Source: Internet Version 1.95 When disabling and then enabling a monitor on a system with 3 monitors or more, MultiMonitorTool tries to put it back in the original position. Currently, this feature works only when you do the disable and enable without exit from MultiMonitorTool and it doesn’t work from command-line. The ‘Use Monitor ID In Load Config’ option is now turned on by default. - Source: Internet An example of how a multi-display environment can be used in the business scene. The left display can display tables and calculations of statistical data, while comparing the graphs, and the right screen can be used to summarize the findings in a document. If this were just one monitor, you would be constantly switching between windows, but with two monitors you can see all the necessary data without needing to switch between windows; improving work efficiency and reducing transcribing errors. - Source: Internet Once the screen is extended, the auto-detect feature will detect the third monitor and show it as Disconnected. Once the 3rd monitor is detected, you can change the settings to make the third monitor visible. In Windows 10, you can extend the screen by selecting the option in the Display tab. After identifying the monitor, click Save. Next, select the location for three monitors in the Windows 10 settings. - Source: Internet To setup your triple monitors, first make sure that your computer is equipped with the right video ports and cables. Normally, you will need two HDMI cables and one DisplayPort cable. Make sure that the monitor you want to use has two HDMI inputs and one DisplayPort input. Then, connect all three monitors to your computer and enjoy multi-monitor use! It’s that simple. - Source: Internet MultiMonitorTool.exe /setmax \\.\\DISPLAY2 \\.\\DISPLAY3 /SetOrientation Set the orientation of the specified monitor. - Source: Internet An outdated or corrupt graphics card driver can trigger various issues like Windows not detecting third monitor. So, we highly recommend you check your display drivers. For that: - Source: Internet MultiMonitorTool.exe /SwitchOffOn \\.\\DISPLAY2 \\.\\DISPLAY3 /PreviewOnly {x} {y} {width} {height} Allows you to run MultiMonitorTool in monitor preview only mode. In this mode, only the monitor preview window is displayed. - Source: Internet MultiMonitorTool.exe /MoveWindow 2 Title “Hello World” Move all windows of Windows Explorer (with ‘CabinetWClass’ window class) to ‘\\.\\DISPLAY3’ monitor: - Source: Internet The serial number of the monitor, as it appears in the ‘Monitor Serial Number’ column. /disable Disables the specified monitors. You can specify a single monitor or multiple monitors. - Source: Internet Furthermore in Windows 10, if a window is moved to one of the four corners of the screen, it will shrink to 1/4 the size of the screen, so that four windows can be displayed at once. Additionally, in a multi-display environment, if you are displaying too many windows and your desktop has become messy, click and drag the window you want to view and quickly shake it to minimize all other windows. You can also press Windows and Home. - Source: Internet Your primary and secondary screens will mirror one another, displaying the same thing. This can be useful for presentations or for demos. Extend - This setting extends your desktop across all of the displays you have enabled. If you’re using a second monitor on your desk, this is probably the setting you want to use. - Source: Internet Example: The expanded display of two EIZO FlexScan EV2455 monitors connected to a desktop PC. Aligning two 24.1\" WUXGA (1920 x 1200 pixels) monitors side by side achieves a combined resolution of 3840 x 1200 pixels. - Source: Internet If the issue still persists, try disabling the graphics driver on the Intel side of the third monitor. Once done, restart your computer and reconnect the third monitor. The next step will enable Windows to recognize the new monitor. If you still have a problem with your third monitor, you may have to update your graphics driver. To do this, simply click the Update button on the driver’s settings window and follow the on-screen instructions. - Source: Internet If you need to disconnect an external monitor, the process is straightforward. You unplug the cable. While this is a simple enough solution, connecting and disconnecting a monitor can lead to cable problems, or you can damage the video port in the graphics cards and the monitor. - Source: Internet Version 1.45: Added /PreviewOnly command-line option, which allows you to run MultiMonitorTool in monitor preview only mode. In this mode, only the monitor preview window is displayed. Example: - Source: Internet I am having some issue creating a 3rd monitor for my laptop. I have an HP Pavilion 15-p080ca Notebook, with an attached AOC e1759fwu USB Monitor. The graphics card is an AMD Radeon HD 8610G. - Source: Internet MultiMonitorTool.exe /MoveWindow Next Process “firefox.exe” Move all windows that their title contains the ‘Hello World’ string to ‘\\.\\DISPLAY2’ monitor: - Source: Internet Version 1.83 Added ‘Show Duplicate Monitors’ option. On version 1.80, a bug that caused MultiMonitorTool to display the same monitor more than once was fixed, but it seems that on some systems, this bug fix may cause MultiMonitorTool to ignore a second monitor. So if you don’t see all monitors on your system, you should try to turn on the ‘Show Duplicate Monitors’ option… - Source: Internet Version 1.21: Added ‘Auto Size Columns+Headers’ option, which allows you to automatically resize the columns according to the row values and column headers. Fixed issue: The properties dialog-box and other windows opened in the wrong monitor, on multi-monitors system. Added ‘Mark Odd/Even Rows’ option, under the View menu. When it’s turned on, the odd and even rows are displayed in different color, to make it easier to read a single line. - Source: Internet Version 1.10: Added ‘Draw Cursor In Monitor Preview’ option. Fixed the /WindowLeft, /WindowTop, /WindowWidth, /WindowHeight command-line options to work even if the window remains in the same monitor. - Source: Internet Monitor Number - The number that appears in the monitor name. (1 for \\.\\DISPLAY1, 2 for \\.\\DISPLAY2, and so on…) - Source: Internet The FlexScan EV2455 has a narrow frame design of only 6.2 mm (1 mm bezel and 5.2 mm black border). This requires only 12.4 mm when two monitors are aligned, so the bezel doesn’t feel like it’s in the way. - Source: Internet Step 3. Scroll down the list of your displays and click on each one to check which is disconnected. Once you confirmed the monitor that is disconnected by default, click on it and select the Extend desktop to this display option from the Multiple displays drop-down menu. - Source: Internet In some cases, the problem can be solved by updating the graphics drivers on the monitor. You can try uninstalling the display adapter and reinstalling it by going to the device manager and clicking “uninstall.” Ensure that you click “OK” when asked to confirm the action. Once you’ve done that, your third monitor should start showing up in Windows 10. - Source: Internet You may be wondering how to set up triple monitors on your PC. Although most computers have two or three video ports, some models do not. If you are unsure if your computer has the right hardware, read our guide on how to set up triple monitors. You’ll also need additional hardware to connect your monitors. If you’re using a laptop, you’ll need to buy an adapter or a new graphics card. - Source: Internet In Windows 10, the Snap Assist function that sticks the window to the edge of the screen is available, and even more convenient. If you drag the window to the left or right of the screen, the window will expand to fill half of the screen. This is also possible in the extended desktop function where two windows can be placed onto the left and right sides of each monitor, making a total of four open windows. This can also be accomplished with the shortcut keys Windows + left or right arrow. - Source: Internet Version 1.31: When you run MultiMonitorTool, it now automatically selects the monitor that you selected in the previous time you used MultiMonitorTool. Added /SelectedMonitior command-line option, which allows you to open MultiMonitorTool with the selected monitor you need. For example: - Source: Internet Only your primary display will be enabled; all secondary screens, monitors, and projectors will be dark. This can be useful if you’re presenting and you don’t want participants to be able to see your screen. Duplicate - Your primary and secondary screens will mirror one another, displaying the same thing. This can be useful for presentations or for demos. - Source: Internet MultiMonitorTool.exe /MoveWindow 3 Class “CabinetWClass” Move all windows from ‘\\.\\DISPLAY3’ monitor to ‘\\.\\DISPLAY2’ monitor: - Source: Internet MultiMonitorTool.exe /TurnOn 3 2 /SwitchOffOn Switches the specified monitors between on and off state.

Next, find the Extend Desktop To This Display option and hit the button. Hope this will resolve your third monitor related problem. - Source: Internet If you’re using more than one screen, a triple monitor setup can be an extremely useful feature. You can use them for gaming, multitasking, research, and document viewing.

The “All taskbars” option will display the taskbar the same on both displays, with all the running program icons displayed on both display’s taskbars. The “Main taskbar and taskbar where window is open” will display all running program’s icons on the first display’s taskbar and also display the programs running on the second display in the second display’s taskbar. Finally if you select “Taskbar where window is open” the taskbar will be displayed on both displays, but a running program’s taskbar icon will only be displayed on the taskbar of the monitor that the program is displayed on. - Source: Internet You’ll have to change the physical arrangement of your displays before they’ll work properly.

Ideally, it’s best to purchase multiple <strong>monitor</strong>s of the same model in the beginning. This way the screen size and resolution can be aligned, but also the color and aesthetics will match. But perhaps more importantly, because the <strong>monitor</strong>s are the same age, any defects in the screen such as color variations can be found early-on by comparing the two <strong>monitor</strong>s next to each other. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you scroll down to the bottom of the “Display” menu there is an “advanced display settings” link. If you click on this, you can set the resolutions of the display <strong>monitor</strong>s. Additionally, if you click on the “Advanced sizing of text and other items” link, you can change the settings for more detailed things like the size of items and text. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another note for those who might be thinking about trying to build a multi-display environment, is that the more <strong>monitor</strong>s you align, the wider your viewing angle will need to be. In order to be able to see each <strong>monitor</strong> clearly without having to move, you need to buy a product that has wide viewing angles. Furthermore, the more screens you have the harder it is to avoid light reflecting on your screen and into your eyes. To prevent this, we recommend buying a <strong>monitor</strong> with a glare reducing surface, which will make the screens easier to see and will be easier on your eyes. Additionally, as mentioned above we recommend a <strong>monitor</strong> with a narrow bezel and black border as it is space-saving and increases visibility among other advantages. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Many people want to add a second <strong>monitor</strong> to their computer. While dual screen setup can increase productivity and flexibility, it’s not always plug-and-play. First, you need a graphics card capable of handling multiple displays and enough ports for all of them. Adding multiple external displays to a laptop can also be difficult, so you need to learn how to set up your computer for multiple <strong>monitor</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Version 1.80 Fixed bug: In some <strong>monitor</strong> configurations, MultiMonitorTool displayed the same <strong>monitor</strong> more than once. The <strong>monitor</strong> ID of every <strong>monitor</strong> is now saved into the <strong>monitor</strong>s configuration file. Added &lsquo;Use Monitor ID In Load Config&rsquo; option, If you turn it on, MultiMonitorTool will use the <strong>monitor</strong> ID to detect the correct <strong>monitor</strong>s when you load a <strong>monitor</strong>s configuration file. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>MultiMonitorTool.exe /MoveWindow Primary Process &ldquo;iexplore.exe&rdquo; Move all <strong>windows</strong> of Firefox to the next <strong>monitor</strong>: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>An example of how the multi-display environment can help with photo re-touching. Rotating one <strong>monitor</strong> to the vertical position can help with retouching portrait photos, or editing long documents and websites. If you want to take advantage of a vertical screen, you need to choose a <strong>monitor</strong> that can be rotated or buy a separate rotating mount to attach your <strong>monitor</strong> to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Version 1.95 When disabling and then enabling a <strong>monitor</strong> on a system with 3 <strong>monitor</strong>s or more, MultiMonitorTool tries to put it back in the original position. Currently, this feature works only when you do the disable and enable without exit from MultiMonitorTool and it doesn&rsquo;t work from command-line. The &lsquo;Use Monitor ID In Load Config&rsquo; option is now turned on by default. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>An example of how a multi-display environment can be used in the business scene. The left display can display tables and calculations of statistical data, while comparing the graphs, and the right screen can be used to summarize the findings in a document. If this were just one <strong>monitor</strong>, you would be constantly switching between <strong>windows</strong>, but with two <strong>monitor</strong>s you can see all the necessary data without needing to switch between <strong>windows</strong>; improving work efficiency and reducing transcribing errors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once the screen is extended, the auto-detect feature will detect the third <strong>monitor</strong> and show it as Disconnected. Once the 3rd <strong>monitor</strong> is detected, you can change the settings to make the third <strong>monitor</strong> visible. In Windows 10, you can extend the screen by selecting the option in the Display tab. After identifying the <strong>monitor</strong>, click Save. Next, select the location for three <strong>monitor</strong>s in the Windows 10 settings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To setup your triple <strong>monitor</strong>s, first make sure that your computer is equipped with the right video ports and cables. Normally, you will need two HDMI cables and one DisplayPort cable. Make sure that the <strong>monitor</strong> you want to use has two HDMI inputs and one DisplayPort input. Then, connect all three <strong>monitor</strong>s to your computer and enjoy multi-<strong>monitor</strong> use! It’s that simple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>MultiMonitorTool.exe /setmax \.\DISPLAY2 \.\DISPLAY3 /SetOrientation <monitor>&lt;Orientation [0, 90, 180, 270] > Set the orientation of the specified <strong>monitor</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>An outdated or corrupt graphics card driver can trigger various issues like Windows not detecting third <strong>monitor</strong>. So, we highly recommend you check your display drivers. For that: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>MultiMonitorTool.exe /SwitchOffOn \.\DISPLAY2 \.\DISPLAY3 /PreviewOnly <monitor>{x} {y} {width} {height} Allows you to run MultiMonitorTool in <strong>monitor</strong> preview only mode. In this mode, only the <strong>monitor</strong> preview window is displayed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>MultiMonitorTool.exe /MoveWindow 2 Title &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; Move all <strong>windows</strong> of Windows Explorer (with &lsquo;CabinetWClass&rsquo; window class) to &lsquo;\.\DISPLAY3&rsquo; <strong>monitor</strong>: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The serial number of the <strong>monitor</strong>, as it appears in the &lsquo;Monitor Serial Number&rsquo; column. /disable <monitors>Disables the specified <strong>monitor</strong>s. You can specify a single <strong>monitor</strong> or multiple <strong>monitor</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Furthermore in Windows 10, if a window is moved to one of the four corners of the screen, it will shrink to 1/4 the size of the screen, so that four <strong>windows</strong> can be displayed at once. Additionally, in a multi-display environment, if you are displaying too many <strong>windows</strong> and your desktop has become messy, click and drag the window you want to view and quickly shake it to minimize all other <strong>windows</strong>. You can also press Windows and Home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ul><li>Your primary and secondary screens will mirror one another, displaying the same thing. This can be useful for presentations or for demos. Extend - This setting extends your desktop across all of the displays you have enabled. If you&rsquo;re using a second <strong>monitor</strong> on your desk, this is probably the setting you want to use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul></li><li>Example: The expanded display of two EIZO FlexScan EV2455 <strong>monitor</strong>s connected to a desktop PC. Aligning two 24.1" WUXGA (1920 x 1200 pixels) <strong>monitor</strong>s side by side achieves a combined resolution of 3840 x 1200 pixels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If the issue still persists, try disabling the graphics driver on the Intel side of the third <strong>monitor</strong>. Once done, restart your computer and reconnect the third <strong>monitor</strong>. The next step will enable Windows to recognize the new <strong>monitor</strong>. If you still have a problem with your third <strong>monitor</strong>, you may have to update your graphics driver. To do this, simply click the Update button on the driver’s settings window and follow the on-screen instructions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you need to disconnect an external <strong>monitor</strong>, the process is straightforward. You unplug the cable. While this is a simple enough solution, connecting and disconnecting a <strong>monitor</strong> can lead to cable problems, or you can damage the video port in the graphics cards and the <strong>monitor</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Version 1.45: Added /PreviewOnly command-line option, which allows you to run MultiMonitorTool in <strong>monitor</strong> preview only mode. In this mode, only the <strong>monitor</strong> preview window is displayed. Example: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I am having some issue creating a 3rd <strong>monitor</strong> for my laptop. I have an HP Pavilion 15-p080ca Notebook, with an attached AOC e1759fwu USB Monitor. The graphics card is an AMD Radeon HD 8610G. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>MultiMonitorTool.exe /MoveWindow Next Process &ldquo;firefox.exe&rdquo; Move all <strong>windows</strong> that their title contains the &lsquo;Hello World&rsquo; string to &lsquo;\.\DISPLAY2&rsquo; <strong>monitor</strong>: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Version 1.83 Added &lsquo;Show Duplicate Monitors&rsquo; option. On version 1.80, a bug that caused MultiMonitorTool to display the same <strong>monitor</strong> more than once was fixed, but it seems that on some systems, this bug fix may cause MultiMonitorTool to ignore a second <strong>monitor</strong>. So if you don&rsquo;t see all <strong>monitor</strong>s on your system, you should try to turn on the &lsquo;Show Duplicate Monitors&rsquo; option&mldr; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Version 1.21: Added &lsquo;Auto Size Columns+Headers&rsquo; option, which allows you to automatically resize the columns according to the row values and column headers. Fixed issue: The properties dialog-box and other <strong>windows</strong> opened in the wrong <strong>monitor</strong>, on multi-<strong>monitor</strong>s system. Added &lsquo;Mark Odd/Even Rows&rsquo; option, under the View menu. When it&rsquo;s turned on, the odd and even rows are displayed in different color, to make it easier to read a single line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Version 1.10: Added &lsquo;Draw Cursor In Monitor Preview&rsquo; option. Fixed the /WindowLeft, /WindowTop, /WindowWidth, /WindowHeight command-line options to work even if the window remains in the same <strong>monitor</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Monitor Number - The number that appears in the <strong>monitor</strong> name. (1 for \.\DISPLAY1, 2 for \.\DISPLAY2, and so on&mldr;) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The FlexScan EV2455 has a narrow frame design of only 6.2 mm (1 mm bezel and 5.2 mm black border). This requires only 12.4 mm when two <strong>monitor</strong>s are aligned, so the bezel doesn’t feel like it’s in the way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Step 3. Scroll down the list of your displays and click on each one to check which is disconnected. Once you confirmed the <strong>monitor</strong> that is disconnected by default, click on it and select the Extend desktop to this display option from the Multiple displays drop-down menu. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In some cases, the problem can be solved by updating the graphics drivers on the <strong>monitor</strong>. You can try uninstalling the display adapter and reinstalling it by going to the device manager and clicking “uninstall.” Ensure that you click “OK” when asked to confirm the action. Once you’ve done that, your third <strong>monitor</strong> should start showing up in Windows 10. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You may be wondering how to set up triple <strong>monitor</strong>s on your PC. Although most computers have two or three video ports, some models do not. If you are unsure if your computer has the right hardware, read our guide on how to set up triple <strong>monitor</strong>s. You’ll also need additional hardware to connect your <strong>monitor</strong>s. If you’re using a laptop, you’ll need to buy an adapter or a new graphics card. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In Windows 10, the Snap Assist function that sticks the window to the edge of the screen is available, and even more convenient. If you drag the window to the left or right of the screen, the window will expand to fill half of the screen. This is also possible in the extended desktop function where two <strong>windows</strong> can be placed onto the left and right sides of each <strong>monitor</strong>, making a total of four open <strong>windows</strong>. This can also be accomplished with the shortcut keys Windows + left or right arrow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Version 1.31: When you run MultiMonitorTool, it now automatically selects the <strong>monitor</strong> that you selected in the previous time you used MultiMonitorTool. Added /SelectedMonitior command-line option, which allows you to open MultiMonitorTool with the selected <strong>monitor</strong> you need. For example: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ul><li>Only your primary display will be enabled; all secondary screens, <strong>monitor</strong>s, and projectors will be dark.

Follow the steps below and you should soon have your third <strong>monitor</strong> working in no time. If the problem persists, try one of these methods: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ul><li>This setting extends your desktop across all of the displays you have enabled. If you&rsquo;re using a second <strong>monitor</strong> on your desk, this is probably the setting you want to use. Second Screen Only- This will keep your primary display dark while only using your secondary display. This is useful if you have a closed laptop attached to a docking station, since you don&rsquo;t want Windows to use your laptop&rsquo;s screen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul></li><li>There are three options to choose how the taskbar can be viewed. The “All taskbars” option will display the taskbar the same on both displays, with all the running program icons displayed on both display’s taskbars. The “Main taskbar and taskbar where window is open” will display all running program’s icons on the first display’s taskbar and also display the programs running on the second display in the second display’s taskbar. Finally if you select “Taskbar where window is open” the taskbar will be displayed on both displays, but a running program’s taskbar icon will only be displayed on the taskbar of the <strong>monitor</strong> that the program is displayed on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You’ll have to change the physical arrangement of your displays before they’ll work properly. If the <strong>monitor</strong>s are connected improperly, you’ll have problems with the mouse and programs. To fix this, you can drag them over one another or update their drivers. Once done, simply close the <strong>windows</strong> window and restart your computer. You’ll need to install the latest version of your <strong>monitor</strong> drivers if your triple-<strong>monitor</strong> setup doesn’t work the first time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Even compared to a PC, a <strong>monitor</strong> is still a possible long-term investment. Therefore we recommend that you do not compromise on quality; in the medium to long term if you think of the comprehensive savings made through increased work productivity, reduced burdens on your body, and reduced power consumption, high-quality display products may offer higher value. Considering that, the FlexScan EV2455 that we used from EIZO’s “FlexScan EV” series meets all of these elements and includes a 5 year warranty, making it one of the best products suited to a multi-display environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After you’ve found the correct adapter, you can connect your laptop to the first one. For the second <strong>monitor</strong>, connect the second one using an HDMI cable. You can also use an adapter to connect the PC to the second <strong>monitor</strong>. Windows users can open the Project options window by pressing WIN+P. Once there, select the second <strong>monitor</strong> and change its resolution to WQHD or 4K. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Version 1.70: Added option to set the update rate of the <strong>monitor</strong> preview window (the default rate is 1000 milliseconds) in the Advanced Options window (Ctrl+O).
