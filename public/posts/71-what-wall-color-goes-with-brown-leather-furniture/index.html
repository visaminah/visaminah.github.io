Here, it joins forces with the dark <strong>furniture</strong> to bring a deep, urban feel to the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are eyeing an industrial design, there is nothing more like it than concrete gray. Throwing in a brown leather sofa in the middle, with a glass coffee table, hardwood floors, and black rugs are such a high-value arrangement. The rawness of concrete gray softens the bolder <strong>color</strong> of the sofa. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your sofa is medium brown, almost the same shade as wood, gray, or navy walls are your best options. These <strong>color</strong> combinations create a soft look and also balance brown. These wall <strong>color</strong>s are also fantastic for tables and other large items in the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Having an accent <strong>color</strong> makes a room stand out, and keeps it from looking purely monochromatic.

What better way to invite guests in and make them feel at home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Colors like teal and blue make fantastic curtains in a room with brown <strong>furniture</strong>. Deep teal should work nicely in a bright room, while navy blue and light blue are safe options for most shades of brown. You only need to check how these <strong>color</strong> curtains will complement the other accents in the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>How do you use red walls with brown <strong>furniture</strong>? Like any other paint <strong>color</strong>, you pick a <strong>color</strong> scheme with the same undertones. Pick a red <strong>color</strong> that has brown undertones. These are usually in the middle of the red spectrum. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A deep blue, such as navy, will ground a room. Navy and slate blues are masculine shades of blue. They pair well with gray and brown <strong>furniture</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Also take a good look at the rug. Not all warm <strong>color</strong>s work in harmony. Brown <strong>color</strong> rugs may be fighting your wall <strong>color</strong> or couch <strong>color</strong>. Interior design is about connecting the pieces to make a single statement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A punch of tan mixed with white gives a soft glow that accentuates dark-<strong>color</strong>ed <strong>furniture</strong> including a brown sofa.

If you want a cozy and warm nook in the home, a tannish-white wall is the best choice for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A lighter shade of purple can work with light brown <strong>furniture</strong>. This room has a distinctly mid-century feel until the purple walls come into play. The accents against the light brown couch add a pro’s touch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another <strong>color</strong> scheme that works wonderfully with brown <strong>furniture</strong> is a golden accent wall.

The darker-toned brown sofa should go with dark-<strong>color</strong>ed throw pillows too for a bolder statement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The living room should be a welcoming space and it’s the first impression you make on your guests. Don’t be afraid to express yourself through some <strong>color</strong>ful throw pillows or an interesting end table. It’s sure to grab your guest’s attention and make them want to sit down and stay awhile! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Use an ottoman of any <strong>color</strong> on the coffee table and throw in a <strong>color</strong>ful rug in the middle. Make the throw pillows as <strong>color</strong>ful as possible too. It is a bold take but the outcome will not disappoint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Rugs can make it break a colour palette. A slate blue rug adds the right amount of <strong>color</strong>. The industrial coffee table doubles as storage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can have a monochromatic brown <strong>color</strong> scheme. The key is how you use textures. Take a look at the far right corner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The easiest <strong>color</strong> curtain to match with your brown couch is white. White should enhance the brown shade and brighten up space. You can also go with creamy white or even something darker like a gray curtain for some shades of brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sage green or even some bolder green tones will match nicely with the white and brown, giving a bit of <strong>color</strong>, while still playing it safe. If you can’t get on board with the bold and brighter <strong>color</strong>s, sage green is a perfect alternative. These three <strong>color</strong>s put together look modern, sleek, and beautiful. Give them a try in your living room! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are going for a Tuscan design, mustard yellow is the best compliment for a light brown sofa. The brighter mustard yellow added with other bright decorations makes the room livid with <strong>color</strong>s. Add in bright-<strong>color</strong>ed rugs and throw pillows along with white lamps and you are good to go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another combination that evokes the fun of the outdoors is an emerald green wall and brown sofa. It is lighter than moss green and will work best with decoration details that come in white or macrame <strong>color</strong>s. You won’t even need indoor plants for this arrangement as it will look full in itself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You would not find it a common choice, but teal goes well with brown sofas. It works best with lighter <strong>color</strong>ed brown sofas (primarily caramel or tan sofas). This combination is a perfect fit for sophisticated living rooms. Use geometric pattern rugs and add in some indoor plants to complete the arrangement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For this, add softer accents of white and black or gold decorations to be hanged on the wall. Go for light-<strong>color</strong>ed rugs and throw pillows too. Instead of indoor plants, invest in lightwork. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>color</strong> combination can work well in both traditional and contemporary spaces. It’s imagined in the accent pieces. Here, we see the brown chair and wood <strong>furniture</strong> bringing the retro touch to this transitional room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Reds are not limited to bright and cool tone <strong>color</strong>s. Rusty and warm reds will be the best ones for a brown leather couch to make the space look cozy like a cabin. However, even placing an actual red item like a rug might work surprisingly well with a brown sofa. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Lighter gray and accents of dark brown wood are the combination of industrial and rustic.

Rustic lamps and other decorations would add to a beautiful arrangement too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Brown leather sofa will also work well with reds.

Both the <strong>color</strong>s are neutral in shade, so nothing overpowering. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Brown, especially the darker shades, will look great with grey. You can opt for a gray rug with your espresso brown leather sofa. Opt for accents that are reminiscent of nickel to help enhance the details of the <strong>furniture</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another match made in heaven would be orange and brown. Orange will accentuate the deep <strong>color</strong> of a brown sofa. Adding personality to this combination would be paintings and sculptures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Few combinations work so well with each other, it becomes tough to imagine even one of them as a standalone feature.

The subtle hues of blue with traditional brown <strong>furniture</strong> look an instant head turner! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A brown sofa and a peach wall are some of the most inviting combinations out there. Its warm vibe feels like Sundays in your grandmother’s home.
