The inside of the boat will get walked on, banged on and receive a beating from use. Choose a durable, exterior paint. It’s also a good idea to pick a neutral color like grey or tan that makes touch-ups easy. A textured paint helps hide imperfections and provides a slightly better non-slip surface. - Source: Internet You can paint over your boat every year or every four years. The difference lies in the steps you took to paint over your ship. If you want the best results for your boat, follow the steps without skipping them. - Source: Internet Today, you will find many paint options that can be used for an aluminum boat, the market offers a variety of materials from different manufacturers. But if you have decided to paint your boat on your own, it is always necessary to consult technical specialists. For any surface, it is vital to use high-quality and most appropriate paints. We hope this review had widened your knowledge of the materials that are fine for aluminum boat finishing, and it will be easier for you now to make a choice. - Source: Internet The hardest part about refinishing an aluminum boat is having the right expectations. Our boat is intended for fishing not to display in an art museum. You are more than welcome to be a perfectionist but don’t expect to turn a rough looking derelict into a high-end bass boat. - Source: Internet Keep in mind, you don’t have to paint the entire surface. If you like the look of the natural aluminum, you can leave it bare. Paint in Horizontal Strokes - Source: Internet I have a gallon of Dupont automotive zinc chromate primer that I have had for many years and it is still good can’t remember when or why I got it. I just had to have a new aluminum 18 gallon gas tank made for my boat that fits under the floor and is subjected to getting wet (previous tank developed holes after 15 years, tank was never painted ) My question is should I paint the tank with the zinc chromate primer. My neighbor who welds says don’t use zinc chromate as it will increase corrosion (I don’t believe him) Any opinions out there - Source: Internet This fast-drying primer is designed for metal, fiberglass, and wood boats. Its high-solid composition allows you to apply only one thin layer to get the boat ready for further painting. It sticks well even on top of the old paint, but you need to prepare the surface thoroughly. - Source: Internet Like my dad always said, “if you going to do something kid, do it right the first time, or don’t do it at all!” And he’s right. PATIENCE! This fish will always be biting. Happy painting. - Source: Internet After the inside paint dries, turn the boat upside down on a set of saw horses. You can place it on the ground but it’s easier to paint while standing. Also, make sure to lay down a drop cloth underneath. - Source: Internet Now the fun part begins. The final stages of refinishing an aluminum boat includes making new bench seats and adding accessories. The more time you put into details, the better your end product will be. - Source: Internet Never add a fresh coat of paint over an existing paint layer. The end result will look bumpy or worn and it will start peeling or chipping quickly. Removing the old paint will give you a fresh surface, which will make the new paint job look better and last longer. - Source: Internet When you buy a new aluminum boat these days, many have a baked-on enamel paint job that looks almost as slick as gel-coated fiberglass. But many older or less expensive aluminum rigs have a dull gray look that’s not very attractive. That’s because they oxidize on the exterior, as opposed to skipping right to the corrosion stage like many other metals. And while that’s certainly preferable, it’s not exactly appealing to the eye. You want to make that dull gray aluminum look better than it ever has before? Then it’s time to prepare for a paint job. - Source: Internet You can also get rid of old paint with a paint stripper. All you have to do is coat the paint stripper over the surface of the boat with a paintbrush then cover it in plastic to keep it from drying. It’s a good idea to work in small sections so the stripper doesn’t start to dry before you have a chance to lay the plastic. - Source: Internet Q. I just got a 14 ft aluminum Jon boat and I want to paint it but I need to know where to find some aluminum oxide primer. got any suggestions? - Source: Internet Preparation is the number one step you cannot miss if you want to repaint your boat. You need to clean the surface to ensure there is no dirt or unwanted debris on the boat. Dirt or dust can cause the paint to peel in a matter of days. - Source: Internet The last step in this process is curing. Curing is the process of letting the paint harden. Until the paint is fully bonded to the aluminum surface of the boat, it is yet to cure. (source) - Source: Internet Wet Edge is a great topside paint that can be used over the entire hull of a fiberglass Jon boat. It gives a glossy and clean finish to a well-prepared vessel. The paint offers an abrasive resistant surface and its formula makes it flexible enough to hold any flexing, expansion and contraction of the hull. - Source: Internet Either of the above mentioned paints would be a good choice if you want to cut your painting labor in half as there is no need to apply any primer to the boat. These paints, although marketed as topside paints, can be used below the waterline of the boat as well. The one paint will do the entire boat. - Source: Internet This fast-drying paint is an ideal solution for renovating an aluminum boat. The paint is environmentally-friendly as it does not contain chromates. It will work well both above and below the boat waterline. - Source: Internet Light stains probably won’t affect the color of the paint. For darker or larger stains, though, try mixing 50% warm water with 50% distilled vinegar. Spread the solution over the stain, let it sit for a minute or two, and wipe it away. - Source: Internet Follow up post from earlier tonight. This is on the Lowe boats website under the aluminum fishing boats section. This is where I learned what to use on my aluminum boat. - Source: Internet One of the most important things is to keep an eye on, is the paint. As soon as you start to see fading, cracking and peeling, it’s time to re-paint the boat before it looks too terrible. Nobody wants to be seen in a hunk of junk… well I don’t anyway! - Source: Internet Prepare yourself, your paint area and your boat for painting. Clean the boat before painting it. Make any necessary repairs. Apply the primer if using one. Once the primer has dried apply the correct paint for your specific Jon boat. - Source: Internet If you use a good, self-etching primer, you should be able to pick almost any type of paint you want. That said, there are a few things you should consider before choosing the paint. Ingredients - Source: Internet After that dries, you can paint it with whatever you like.I have done 4 boats this way…they turned out great! - Source: Internet Painting your boat isn’t just about colors. A fresh coat of paint can also give your boat an extra layer of protection against the elements (and some of the creatures underwater). We’ve put together this guide to help you learn how to paint an aluminum boat and give you a few tips that’ll help your paint job last as long as possible. - Source: Internet There are some very good generic paints on the market many of which have anti-corrosive and antifouling formulas. Marine Ablative boat bottom paint offers antifouling elements that effectively act as protection against weeds, algae and slime. This paint is versatile as it can be applied on aluminum, wood and fiberglass Jon boats. - Source: Internet All of that said, there’s nothing special about applying primer to an aluminum surface. Prior to application you’ll want to tape off the area(s) of the boat as applicable. The primer itself can be sprayed, brushed, or rolled on. After application a second coat may be recommended, but again, the specifics of multiple coats, dry times, and sanding between coats will vary from product to product. - Source: Internet Painting a boat is somewhat different from painting other products. It is a very responsible and important task. The fact is that the boat is constantly working in specific conditions. Therefore, the coating must be both stable and durable. - Source: Internet Painting an aluminum boat seems simple enough. Yet, after a quick Google search, it became apparent that helpful information is hard to find. After reading enough conflicting advice and watching some poorly filmed Youtube videos, we soon realized that we’d be figuring this out on our own. - Source: Internet What we’re looking for here is a shiny silver uncontaminated surface, to get the best possible paint adhesion. After sanding is complete, it’s helpful to wash down the aluminum boat with a pressure washer. Then, give it an old-fashioned scrub-down with a coarse-bristle brush and soapy water. Finally, rinse the boat down to remove all the soap and everything else left behind. After it’s been thoroughly washed down, allow the boat to dry completely before moving on to the next step. - Source: Internet You may have noticed that your aluminum boat isn’t looking as sharp as it used to. Fortunately, a little paint job will do just the trick and help turn things around. So how do you do paint over an aluminum boat? - Source: Internet In Ft.Lauderdale, a private tug named Hero still operates for over 30 years without any paint. She is all aluminum with an air-cooled diesel and no thru-hulls. Her entire hull covering exists of a wax coating on the inside and outside. Zero problems and no maintenance after the initial coat. - Source: Internet Large vessels cannot be finished with only one type of paint. One paint goes above the waterline, and the other is applied below the waterline. But as a rule, the aluminum boat can be finished with one paint as its size is not big. The choice of paints is quite large, therefore, it is recommended to study in detail the properties of the paint, and it is necessary to follow safety precautions when carrying out general work. You can use the following types of coating: - Source: Internet If you’ve got some extra bucks to spare, buy a can of paint thinner. When mixed with the primer, it will mask the small scratches I mentioned earlier. While this isn’t very important for the exterior, the interior aluminum boat paint will look significantly better with no cracks and scratches on the surface. Ok, go ahead and spray or paint the primer on the interior. The layer should be thin and even. - Source: Internet Aluminum boat paint jobs come out best when you use a primer that’s formulated specifically for use with aluminum. The primer will not only help the paint adhere to the boat, but will also provide an extra barrier layer that helps prevent corrosion or oxidation. Note: because oxidation begins shortly after bare aluminum is exposed to the air, you’ll want to apply the primer as soon as possible after the aluminum has been cleaned and dried. Many manufacturers recommend you do so just an hour after the boat has dried. - Source: Internet Many wooden Jon boats have been made as a DIY project. You can actually build a wooden Jon boat by following our simple 15 step process. However, after constructing a wooden boat, you are likely to be faced by a question of what paint you should use to give the boat a better finish and greater protection. - Source: Internet This oil-based paint is good for many surfaces including metal. It is not affected by severe weather conditions and UV light. It works well for all types of boats if you do not store them in the salty water. - Source: Internet You can choose any color for your boat. The most popular color is green, but if you want to get more creative or use your favorite shades, don’t hold back. Customizing the color will make the painting process much more enjoyable and you’ll have more fun riding your boat, too. - Source: Internet For this purpose, you can find all shades of paint. But this procedure requires a lot of effort. Paints do not stick well to any material. Therefore, you can fail the task without special knowledge and skills. - Source: Internet Warning: Never apply a coprous paint (any bottom paint including copper as the anti-fouling agent) to an aluminum boat. Any anti-fouling paint applied to an aluminum boat should be marked aluminum-safe, or it can set up a galvanic bath that will literally eat your boat alive, by causing the metal to corrode away. There are several types of anti-fouling paints that can be used on aluminum hulls without any problems – but check and check a second time, to be sure the paint you apply is safe for use on aluminum boats. - Source: Internet This is also the time to decide if you want to use aluminum polish with a polishing wheel to achieve a mirror-like finish. This was a step we skipped due to the added time and cost. Wet sanding with 400 grit provided a sufficiently attractive sheen. - Source: Internet After sanding, it’s time to clean your boat. Start by blasting debris away with a high-pressure hose, and then apply boat soap and begin washing each area. This will be quite time-consuming, but it’s absolutely essential for a high-quality paint job. - Source: Internet Q. Good advise. How did you apply the oxide primer? Wagner Sprayer [affil. link to info/product on Amazon]? I am a novice at this, so be real basic please. Thanks! I just bought an aluminum jon boat that needs a good paint job to bring some life to it… - Source: Internet Work in manageable sections along the boat. Avoid letting the gel dry out. Once you thoroughly coat a section of paint, place large pieces of plastic directly over the gel. You can either cut a plastic drop cloth or use plastic bags. - Source: Internet Ed. note: Apologies, Nathan! Please see the entry of May 15, 2007. You are looking for a primer designed for use on aluminum oxide surfaces, not a primer based on aluminum oxide chemistry In other words, a zinc phosphate primer for amateurs and (possibly) a zinc chromate primer for professionals. Sorry for the confusion! - Source: Internet A. Hi, Blaine. This acid wash probably contained hydrofluoric acid. You’ll see the same stuff used in some commercial truck washes for aluminum tankers. Hydrofluoric acid is really dangerous stuff – leave it to somebody else! - Source: Internet This paint is produced using copper-free technology. It can be used for all types of metal, fiberglass, and wood. Its most attractive quality is the ability to keep your boat clean from buildups of debris on the bottom. - Source: Internet Aluminum boats get used and abused. At some point, it’s time to breathe new life into a boat with a fresh coat of paint. Not everyone gets a shiny new fishing boat and if you’re like us, you may have recently acquired a well-used aluminum boat that has seen better days. - Source: Internet Okay: now your freshly-painted aluminum boat looks great on the outside. If the interior and other pieces-parts now look shabby in comparison, learn how to give things like vinyl, rubber, and plastic a face-lift, too. You’ll find some great tips on how to do so in Preparing Your Used Boat for Sale, whether you plan to sell that boat or not – and you probably won’t want to part with it, now that your aluminum boat has a completely new look. - Source: Internet offers a corrosion-resistant and non-reflective finish to the boat. This paint is great if you are looking to improve the boat’s discreet appearance especially for hunting or fishing activities, due to its available camo color options (see our camo painting guide here). This paint can be directly applied as a complete coat or can be used as primer. Aluma Hawk by Sea Hawk is also a corrosion-inhibiting coating that can be applied straightforward to your Jon boat. - Source: Internet Q. What is the fastest and easiest method to remove a water line from an aluminum boat hull? I have a new boat and recently put it into a lake for four days. When pulled it already had a “scum line” that I would like to remove as easily and quickly as possible. What are product choices that are effective for removal of the line? I would then like to coat the hull with some type of product/protectant that will keep scum lines from reoccurring. - Source: Internet Priming involves the use of a primer. You can procure a primer in the same place you bought the paint. Sometimes, they’ll come as a set, depending on the paint brand. Priming sets the scene for the paint and makes it easier for the paint to lay on the boat’s surface. - Source: Internet There are many difficult ways to accomplish simple tasks. That’s why we spent so much time figuring out an easy way to paint an aluminum boat. Hopefully, you find as much success as we did with your aluminum boat painting project! - Source: Internet Hi, read a number of postings re. painting alu boats. with ref to the costs being high to paint , just wondered if you have considered using bitumen on the outside under the waterline ? We use it on boats which are on drying moorings and /or get beached. Not the prettiest finish but self heals on scratches and deadens sound a little. Only needs 1 coat and sticks to anything so lessens prep time; doesn’t need etched alu. - Source: Internet My 91 year-old dad and I just restored, except surface finishing, a 1960 18 1/2 foot Crestliner. It was designed with visible wood strips connecting the deck to the sides of the boat (looks very distinctive). I would like to finish it without paint - only the aluminum and wood showing. I think I understand, from reading this letter thread, how to clean the aluminum, but how should I, or should I, treat the aluminum skin? - Source: Internet Painting over your aluminum boat is possible, though, and numerous boat owners have done it with incredible success. Today’s process is a culmination of experiences filled with failures and successes. According to multiple experts in the marine industry, this process is the correct way. (source) - Source: Internet How long does the curing process take? The curing process could take 7-30 days, depending on the paint you used. It would help if you painted over your boat during the off-season to give it time to cure before taking it out. (source) - Source: Internet Painting over an aluminum boat isn’t difficult if you follow the correct steps. The painting process will leave your boat with a paint coat that will last you at least a year or more. It would be in your best interest not to skip over the steps in an attempt to hasten the process. - Source: Internet Clean your boat from dirt, oil, peeling paint, and fouling below the waterline. Do not forget to repair areas with damages if necessary. Corrosion somewhere on the vessel will force you to postpone painting until the repair is complete. - Source: Internet Spray paint (rattle cans) simplified the process and cut the costs. The result was a reasonably smooth application for about $80 of paint for the inside and outside of the boat. It would be even cheaper if you’re only painting the outside. - Source: Internet Perhaps you should consider soda blasting your aluminium boats to clean,strip and prepare for painting. Works great. and is fast. - Source: Internet I also had my doubts about applying paint to the boat with a brush or roller without leaving unsightly brush marks. A smooth paint job with liquid paint would require a spray gun and air compressor. That adds significant costs and complexity to the project. - Source: Internet When painting the aluminum boat’s hull, be very thorough. And remember: if you only apply one coat, it won’t look very good. An extra layer will make wonders happen, though! In some cases, a third coat will also be required (if the boat is really old). Oh, and I want you to give the seams the attention they deserve. The reason: most folks forget how important it is to paint the seams, even though they usually chip very quickly and make the boat look rather bad. - Source: Internet Easy maintenance.

If you’re in that situation where your aluminum boat is in dire need of a repaint, you’re in the right place. Here’s what you need to know to give your boat the ultimate fix-up. - Source: Internet Some paints in the market work on multiple surfaces, such as fiberglass, wood, and aluminum. You can try these brands. There’s no harm in it, but it would help if you turned to paint suited for aluminum boats. Hopefully, you can utilize the list shared above. - Source: Internet Just like painting fiberglass or wood, painting an aluminum boat begins with sanding away old paint and oxidation until you’re left with clean, shiny metal. This usually requires 80 or 100 grit sandpaper, which will leave behind some scuff marks. Don’t worry – this is a good thing. The tiny scratches and scuffs will help the primer and paint adhere to the metal. In fact, an aluminum surface needs to be etched so the paint has something to hold on to. - Source: Internet Rustoleum Protective Enamel and Krylon Color Maxx are readily available paints that work well. Both have excellent spray nozzles for smooth application. We tested each brand and found that Rustoleum Enamel tends to cause an orange peel texture more readily. That was just our experience and your’s may differ. Automotive spray paints are another option but we did not test them. - Source: Internet Remove old paint. When working on major repairs of a metal boat, first completely remove the old coating using a synthetic cord-brush or an old paint remover. It is better to clean the surface gradually, covering small areas with a cloth soaked in a solution and tightly covering the top with polyethylene. When scraping off old paint, be careful not to damage the protective layer of the metal. - Source: Internet We’ve decided to share our trials of painting an aluminum boat with you. Hopefully, our experience will make your boat project easier.

If any oil or grease is left, it will mean the paint won’t stick properly to the aluminum and will create small little spots on your surface called fish eyes. Make sure you wipe the entire hull down in a well-ventilated area and use rubber gloves. - Source: Internet With the painting done the boat was left to dry over night. Once you are happy with how it looks, slowly peel off the tape and admire your handy work. Good painters tape leaves clean lines as you can see below. - Source: Internet After removing the paint, thoroughly wash the boat from the acid and paraffin that are usually available in the paint remover. Wash the boat 2-3 times using the appropriate cleanser. Even a small handful of dust can cause big trouble while painting. - Source: Internet When the surface is primed and ready, it’s time to paint the aluminum. This is actually the easy part –it’s really no different than painting any other surface. Almost all paints will recommend at least two coats, however, and often (but not always) with a light sanding between them. In most cases you’ll want to use both a roller (for longer, broader surfaces) and brushes (for tougher areas with lots of angles, like chines and transoms). - Source: Internet My dad works on a drilling rig, and the company lets him use some paint if he buys it from them. I was wondering if you could use it. the paint is called safety yellow and looks pretty cool on my aluminum boat (I just dabbed it on a small place). please help I’m in the 10th grade and bought the boat that had chipping paint from my uncle. - Source: Internet It’s always best if possible to strip the old paint off if possible. Use a good stripper, an automotive paint store, not shop, carries some nice choices, or, like I did. A wire wheel that attaches to a drill. If you have many coats, the main focus is to remove anything that is loose. New paint won’t stay on over areas that are not already bonded and your paint job will only be as good as the bond it is adhered to. - Source: Internet A. Self etching primer must be OK. You can test it on piece of aluminum scrap. Hope it helps and good luck! Goran Budija - Source: Internet Rust-Oleum’s Antifouling paint also gives the boat’s bottom better protection due to its antifouling elements. As mentioned previously, this coating is specifically designed to prevent damage to areas that are below the waterline of the vessel but it can be used all over the boat. However, you may want to use this paint only on the bottom of the Jon and use a cheaper topside paint for the rest of the boat. - Source: Internet Citristrip is worth its weight in gold but it can only do so much. On some areas of the boat we re-coated stubborn paint with a second layer of stripping gel. For difficult to reach areas and seams, a wire wheel on an electric drill was the fastest solution. - Source: Internet I recommend whenever painting an old boat, that if you know the paint types and there are no conflicts, that you sand the hull prior to painting. This way any loose paint will flake off and you will know for sure. Whenever I paint a boat, I like to ensure that I’m working with a fresh surface. - Source: Internet To paint a metal boat, you need to follow a certain technology. Only then the paint will last a long time. Correctly chosen paint will create a protective oxide film on top of the aluminum product. Therefore, this cover will perform both a protective and decorative function. In this review, we will discuss the 5 best finish options for aluminum boats. - Source: Internet After applying primer, you will begin painting your vessel. Take it one section at a time. If you’re using rollers or brushes, make sure to keep using even, unidirectional strokes to ensure a good finish, and avoid overloading the rollers or brushes – this can lead to drips. - Source: Internet Next up is the step we’ve all been waiting for: painting. Painting your aluminum boat requires you to use special paint manufactured solely for painting boats. In the case of aluminum boats, here are some boat paints you should check out: - Source: Internet The overall cost depends greatly on the materials and tools you already have. It also depends on the paint you choose. We went with spray paint cans for convenience, ease of use and the low cost. - Source: Internet Handy Hint: Spend a lot of time doing this part. The more of the old paint you can remove the better as the best result is achieved if the surface is bare aluminum. Areas that are not completely cleaned will result in paint peeling after painting. - Source: Internet PS - This stuff isn’t gonna resist every scratch or bump or rock you might run into, but it cures hard, holds up nice and flat for a good long while. And what’s best? It’s dirt cheap. I painted a 14 ft Jon boat inside and out with a quart of the primer, quart of green paint, and quart of their no slip rubber boat deck paint. Total cost was 50 dollars for all 3 cans. - Source: Internet type in “marine paint specialist” they will have any materials needed for the paint and preparation.paint on “any” surface can be treated using the right preparation method, therefore allowing you to paint over an existing finish. In regards to using an automotive paint after you have applied the correct primer\"I WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE USING MARINE PAINT\" as this is designed for that purpose, it may be more expensive, but it will be a lot more durable than a standard automotive paint. - Source: Internet The special due-biocide formula will allow you to protect your boat from fouling for the whole season. And at the same time, the paint will not bring any harm to the ecosystem. It will also protect the vessel from corrosion. - Source: Internet There are plenty of aluminum boat specific paints on the market like Aluma Hawk, Total Boat and Duralux Marine paint. We did not like the limited color choices and the cost of these paints. A single gallon of paint costs about $40 to $80. It adds up fast with a primer and two or more colors of paint. - Source: Internet Tape off any aluminum that you don’t want painted with a high quality painters tape like Frog Tape. We taped off the entire gunwale and painted everything else on the inside of the boat. Tape off any other parts as needed. - Source: Internet Most hardware stores sell wire wheels for a few bucks and one will last the duration of the project. Just be aware that using it aggressively on aluminum can cause minor pitting. Use just enough pressure to remove the paint. - Source: Internet This paint will look great on any boat, but it does not have enough properties the underwater part needs. Though its winning feature is that you may apply one thin layer of primer to achieve the desired effect. It also dries fast enough. The main idea to avoid thick coating as it will not dry properly. If you still see some drawbacks after drying, you can remove them with careful sanding. - Source: Internet Traditionally, the paint you use on your Jon boat will be dependent on the type of fabrication material it is constructed of. Nowadays, paint manufacturers have developed versatile generic paints that can be used on most types of boats though the paints used for specific construction materials have some major advantages over generic paints. Paints that have antifouling, anti-corrosion, and anti-abrasion elements are the most recommended paints for specific types of Jon boats. - Source: Internet A. You want to remove any non-adherent paint (because it does no good for your fresh paint to stick to non-adherent paint), and you want to scuff the surface of the remaining paint, Christopher. But there is little benefit in sanding away adherent factory paint. (Readers please note that this advise is for the owner of a 12-foot aluminum boat, not for a boat manufacturer). - Source: Internet I’m 17 a senior in high school and I recently purchased a boat in need of new paint. Guys have been saying that I need to clean the hull after sanding/stripping with a household cleaner or dewaxing solvent to make sure the paint adheres. I was wondering if it is important that all of the cleaner/dewaxing solvent is washed or wiped off before the primer goes on. thanks - Source: Internet For areas of the boat that you want to stay polished aluminum, wet sand with fine grit paper or sanding sponges. Start with 220 grit and work your way up to the desired level of polish. Sand in one direction. - Source: Internet I learnt how to paint an aluminum boat over 20 years ago with my late father. I am going now show you my straight forward process to doing so which has served me well multiple times. Just don’t miss any steps as you will end up wasting a lot of time, money and energy if you skip things. - Source: Internet I think Marshall was suggesting that you need to use a primer designed for use on aluminum oxide surfaces (whether that be zinc chromate, zinc phosphate, or otherwise). While some readers understood that, other readers misread this to mean a primer based upon aluminum oxide chemistry – and unfortunately the error went uncorrected. Sorry. We thank you for the clarification and recommendation, Michael! But the reason the site and this thread have survived so long is that we don’t print flames. Smug posts lead to flaming posts, so they’re best avoided as well :-) - Source: Internet In my earlier post, existing paint is best removed if possible but if it is in good condition, then break down the top gloss by lightly sanding. Also, you can use the Galv-alum aluminum primer instead of the Zinc Chromate primer. I don’t have a heat oven so the sun did just fine, and then of course as Lowe boats say themselves, a coat of high grade polyurethane enamel paint. There it is straight from one of the leading horse’s mouth. - Source: Internet A topside paint is applied on the upper waterline of a boat to protect the hull from corrosion and exposure damage. A below waterline paint is applied to the bottom of the boat to prevent the build-up of micro-organisms that can harm the vessel. A below waterline paint is usually advertised as having an antifouling formula. - Source: Internet Your post is much appreciated, Travis, but the idea that all West Marine employees are idiots while Cabela’s employees are wizards is ridiculous, and the kind of thing that starts a race to the bottom. I suspect there was a communication problem where you use your boat only in fresh water, or your boat is small enough that you always pull it out, and that wasn’t clear to them. In that case the anti-fouling paint they may have recommended is an extravagance. However, if a boat ever stays in salt water overnight, anti-fouling paint is absolutely required; it is not an option. Without it, it will become totally covered in very hard to remove barnacles in just a few days. - Source: Internet At this point, it becomes impossible to make blanket statements about the application of the primer and paint, because different types of products have different requirements. And you need to know this prior to applying the primer, because some primers should be painted over just an hour or two after application. Others need up to 48 hours to cure. Some should be sanded before the paint goes on, and others should not be sanded. The bottom line: you’ll need to read the instructions and follow them for each individual product. - Source: Internet I have a 40’ aluminum cruiser boat that was stripped to bare aluminum about ten years ago, at the time it had epoxy paint on it. now its time to repaint it and I would like to know what is the best way to prep it and and if epoxy is the best way to go. thanks - Source: Internet If there is one step you should not skip, it’s this one. Paint stripper saved us so much time and made removing the old paint so much easier. After several recommendations, we found that Citristrip stripping gel was an affordable and powerful product for removing old paint from aluminum. It also doesn’t produce noxious fumes. As the name implies, it smells nicely like oranges. - Source: Internet We use Aluma-wash then Alumiprep 33 [affil. link to info/product on Amazon] before the primer is applied. Awl-Grip is the preferred color paint involving a two part process that is expensive. All Aluminum starts corroding (rusting) once it hits the air while some have anodizing applied but if scratched or welded the erosion continues. Our boats range from 40 to 200 feet and few paint jobs last more than ten years. - Source: Internet You can paint an aluminum boat yourself by first sanding it down, using a mix of soap and water to then clean it up. You will then need to apply a primer before either painting with a roller, brush, or by spraying. You finish the paint job off with a clear coat of protectant. - Source: Internet Before you grab your favorite can of paint and get to work, it’s very important to prep it. Otherwise, the end result will be average at best, and the new paint will come off in a year or two. The first step is “parking” the boat. Ideally, find a smooth, even spot outdoors and cover it with some paper to absorb all the stains. A couple of layers of that paper will do (or, use plastic instead). - Source: Internet In our case, color was the deciding factor since not all brands have the same color palette. From our research, most quality exterior spray paints provide equally good protection for a fishing boat with standard use. It all depends on what the intended use is. - Source: Internet This latex aluminum primer is designed primarily for metal surfaces. Its main and foremost task is to stop rust appearance and spread on the metal surfaces. This cover can be applied over any finish, but be careful when using it over the epoxied paints. - Source: Internet The plastic prevents the gel from drying out which allows it to penetrate through every layer of paint to bare aluminum. Paint the gel in small sections and cover with plastic until the entire area of the boat is complete. The longer you let it sit, the better it works. Wait at least 2 to 4 hours before scraping. However, don’t wait too long to scrape as it’s easier when the gel is still wet. - Source: Internet The goal was simple. Turn an ugly, neglected, aluminum boat into a nice looking fishing boat that will last for many years. Most importantly, we wanted to accomplish the task easily and without spending a fortune. - Source: Internet If you had an older layer of paint on your vessel, choose an 80-grit sandpaper. You can sand by hand, but for larger vessels we highly recommend an electric sander. After you have sanded off the old paint, you can switch to a 40-grit sandpaper. - Source: Internet TextNext, lift the boat a bit. In my experience, sawhorses will be great for this. Plus, make sure there’s enough space around the boat for you to paint it from all four sides. You will need some equipment and tools, of course, but it won’t cost you a pretty penny. When painting an aluminum boat, get the following stuff: - Source: Internet Q. I have a old V hull aluminum boat that I want to refinish with my son, I have all the old paint off and am ready to do all the patching that will be needed to make the hull water tight. What is the best product to seal the hull? Glass…….or what. - Source: Internet 1 gallon of the paint is enough for processing of 500 square feet. For the best results, it is recommended to apply 2 coats of the product to your boat, and do not forget to allow each layer to dry out for 24 hours. The manufacturer specifies the antifouling property will be effective for a year, but the users say that it will be fine for a few years if a boat is used in freshwater. - Source: Internet We thank Marshall for this information – but please note that he is suggesting a primer designed for aluminum oxide (oxidized aluminum) surfaces – not a primer comprised of aluminum oxide. You will see the confusion running through this thread until the entry for May 15, 2007 which clarifies what James is speaking of. Sorry. - Source: Internet Q. I was fishing in Oregon last year near the Pacific Ocean where I met a mobile boat cleaning service. The owner sprayed a chemical compound on my aluminum boat, brushed it and washed it off leaving the boat looking like new. What type of compounds would he have used? - Source: Internet These main benefits made boats made of aluminum very popular. This versatile material will not need much of your attention. Aluminum alloy is not afraid of constant contact with water. But in order to extend the service life of boats, you need to further protect them from corrosion. And paint can help you a lot with this task. - Source: Internet We live in Phoenix Az. and want to go boating during hot summer months.We cannot touch the interior so we want to paint the interior white. This boat has never been in the water and is brand new. what kind of paint and where I can purchase the paint? Thank You. - Source: Internet You’ll need to start by spraying on a layer of primer. Don’t skip this step. Otherwise, the paint will have a hard time “gripping” the aluminum, and it will peel or chip off much sooner than expected. - Source: Internet Applying a clear coat after you paint the aluminum will go a long way in protecting the paint and adding a glossy shine. It prevents damage from UV rays, corrosion, staining, and numerous other problems. Many clear coats can be sprayed on, and some should be applied with a brush; in those cases, foam brushes often work better than bristle brushes. Again, multiple coats are usually recommended and we’d always suggest following the manufacturer’s specific instructions. - Source: Internet An easy way to reach every surface while painting the interior of your aluminum boat is to lean it on its side. Use a fence or side of a garage to support it. Find someone to help stand it up so you don’t get hurt or drop the boat. - Source: Internet Q. I’m currently building an aluminum boat and I would like to paint this boat once it is complete. I’ve talked to a few different people about the method used to paint aluminum but I don’t quite know what the correct method would be for painting aluminum? - Source: Internet Be warned though, it takes some practice to apply this paint. Use slow even coats to protect against drips and get the paint’s texture reaction to occur. Apply 2 or 3 coats and wait about 30 minutes between coats. - Source: Internet Let’s face it: no matter how big and spacious your boat is, if the paint isn’t nice and fresh, that boat isn’t going to look like much. That’s why today, we’ll learn how to properly paint a boat with an aluminum surface. First, we’ll prep the “sea vessel”. Next, we’ll get rid of the old paint and all the dirt along with it. - Source: Internet Needs spot repair. After sanding and necessary prep, is Rustoleum self etch primer adequate for bare aluminum? Is it compatible with sanded and scuffed surrounding existing polyurethane paint. Can it be sprayed over existing paint? Does self-etching primer need a top coat before repainting? Boat to be repainted afterward with one part marine polyurethane. - Source: Internet TotalBoat Aluminum Boat Paint offers a corrosion-resistant and non-reflective finish to the boat. This paint is great if you are looking to improve the boat’s discreet appearance especially for hunting or fishing activities, due to its available camo color options (see our camo painting guide here). This paint can be directly applied as a complete coat or can be used as primer. - Source: Internet The primer works perfectly for all types of metals and is especially good for aluminum boats. You will have to roll it on or use a brush as it is a bit too thick for a sprayer. But some users managed to thin it out with water and still apply it by spraying. Make sure you remove all the debris from the surface and sand the metal well to allow the paint to grip better. This primer will effectively prolong the service life of your aluminum boat. - Source: Internet Your boat spends a lot of time in the water, so it’s getting a lot of direct sunlight as well as reflections of the sun’s rays. UV rays can be harmful to your boat, especially the paint, so finding a paint with added UV protection will help it last longer. Color - Source: Internet Hi. I want to paint the inside of my 16 foot Aluminum boat. I know about the Aluminum Oxide Primer and the tack cloth. Now I can’t find the Scuff coat gray paint (or non skid Paint) to paint over the primer. - Source: Internet To start, find a dry location where you can work on the boat without fighting the weather. Most of the work can be done in a garage. Because of temperature requirements for painting with rattle cans (50° – 90°), we recommend you avoid starting in winter. Nothing puts a damper on a painting project like waiting for temperatures to warm. - Source: Internet If you decide to repaint your boat, you must know what paint was originally used for it. Old and new paints must be compatible. It is easy to find out if you carry the following experiment: - Source: Internet Take a wire wheel and a drill and clean up any patch work, burrs, chipping and cracking paint. Go over it with some of that synthetic steel wool stuff (coarse, the kind that’s not actually steel) Go over it with a light sandpaper. You do not have to knock it down to bare metal, just get it nice and coarse. - Source: Internet Naturally, some safety precautions are in order when you sand aluminum, which can release oxide dust into the air. Safety goggles are a must, as well as a dust mask or respirator. You should also wear gloves and clothing which can be washed immediately after you complete the sanding. - Source: Internet Q. Can anybody help with information re process and materials to be utilized in painting and protecting of new aluminium 5.6 m recreational vessel. - Source: Internet You should still spend some time sanding the surface.

But many older or less expensive <strong>aluminum</strong> rigs have a dull gray look that’s not very attractive. That’s because they oxidize on the exterior, as opposed to skipping right to the corrosion stage like many other metals. And while that’s certainly preferable, it’s not exactly appealing to the eye. You want to make that dull gray <strong>aluminum</strong> look better than it ever has before? Then it’s time to prepare for a <strong>paint</strong> job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can also get rid of old <strong>paint</strong> with a <strong>paint</strong> stripper. All you have to do is coat the <strong>paint</strong> stripper over the surface of the boat with a <strong>paint</strong>brush then cover it in plastic to keep it from drying. It’s a good idea to work in small sections so the stripper doesn’t start to dry before you have a chance to lay the plastic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Q.

Marine Ablative boat bottom <strong>paint</strong> offers antifouling elements that effectively act as protection against weeds, algae and slime. This <strong>paint</strong> is versatile as it can be applied on <strong>aluminum</strong>, wood and fiberglass Jon boats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>All of that said, there’s nothing special about applying primer to an <strong>aluminum</strong> surface. Prior to application you’ll want to tape off the area(s) of the boat as applicable. The primer itself can be sprayed, brushed, or rolled on. After application a second coat may be recommended, but again, the specifics of multiple coats, dry times, and sanding between coats will vary from product to product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Painting a boat is somewhat different from <strong>paint</strong>ing other products. It is a very responsible and important task. The fact is that the boat is constantly working in specific conditions. Therefore, the coating must be both stable and durable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Painting an <strong>aluminum</strong> boat seems simple enough. Yet, after a quick Google search, it became apparent that helpful information is hard to find. After reading enough conflicting advice and watching some poorly filmed Youtube videos, we soon realized that we’d be figuring this out on our own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What we’re looking for here is a shiny silver uncontaminated surface, to get the best possible <strong>paint</strong> adhesion. After sanding is complete, it’s helpful to wash down the <strong>aluminum</strong> boat with a pressure washer. Then, give it an old-fashioned scrub-down with a coarse-bristle brush and soapy water. Finally, rinse the boat down to remove all the soap and everything else left behind. After it’s been thoroughly washed down, allow the boat to dry completely before moving on to the next step. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You may have noticed that your <strong>aluminum</strong> boat isn’t looking as sharp as it used to.

Zero problems and no maintenance after the initial coat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Large vessels cannot be finished with only one type of <strong>paint</strong>. One <strong>paint</strong> goes above the waterline, and the other is applied below the waterline. But as a rule, the <strong>aluminum</strong> boat can be finished with one <strong>paint</strong> as its size is not big. The choice of <strong>paint</strong>s is quite large, therefore, it is recommended to study in detail the properties of the <strong>paint</strong>, and it is necessary to follow safety precautions when carrying out general work. You can use the following types of coating: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’ve got some extra bucks to spare, buy a can of <strong>paint</strong> thinner. When mixed with the primer, it will mask the small scratches I mentioned earlier. While this isn’t very important for the exterior, the interior <strong>aluminum</strong> boat <strong>paint</strong> will look significantly better with no cracks and scratches on the surface. Ok, go ahead and spray or <strong>paint</strong> the primer on the interior. The layer should be thin and even. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Aluminum boat <strong>paint</strong> jobs come out best when you use a primer that’s formulated specifically for use with <strong>aluminum</strong>. The primer will not only help the <strong>paint</strong> adhere to the boat, but will also provide an extra barrier layer that helps prevent corrosion or oxidation. Note: because oxidation begins shortly after bare <strong>aluminum</strong> is exposed to the air, you’ll want to apply the primer as soon as possible after the <strong>aluminum</strong> has been cleaned and dried. Many manufacturers recommend you do so just an hour after the boat has dried. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Many wooden Jon boats have been made as a DIY project.

Therefore, you can fail the task without special knowledge and skills. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Warning: Never apply a coprous <strong>paint</strong> (any bottom <strong>paint</strong> including copper as the anti-fouling agent) to an <strong>aluminum</strong> boat. Any anti-fouling <strong>paint</strong> applied to an <strong>aluminum</strong> boat should be marked <strong>aluminum</strong>-safe, or it can set up a galvanic bath that will literally eat your boat alive, by causing the metal to corrode away. There are several types of anti-fouling <strong>paint</strong>s that can be used on <strong>aluminum</strong> hulls without any problems – but check and check a second time, to be sure the <strong>paint</strong> you apply is safe for use on <strong>aluminum</strong> boats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is also the time to decide if you want to use <strong>aluminum</strong> polish with a polishing wheel to achieve a mirror-like finish.

Do not forget to repair areas with damages if necessary. Corrosion somewhere on the vessel will force you to postpone <strong>paint</strong>ing until the repair is complete. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Spray <strong>paint</strong> (rattle cans) simplified the process and cut the costs. The result was a reasonably smooth application for about $80 of <strong>paint</strong> for the inside and outside of the boat. It would be even cheaper if you’re only <strong>paint</strong>ing the outside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Perhaps you should consider soda blasting your aluminium boats to clean,strip and prepare for <strong>paint</strong>ing. Works great. and is fast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I also had my doubts about applying <strong>paint</strong> to the boat with a brush or roller without leaving unsightly brush marks. A smooth <strong>paint</strong> job with liquid <strong>paint</strong> would require a spray gun and air compressor. That adds significant costs and complexity to the project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When <strong>paint</strong>ing the <strong>aluminum</strong> boat’s hull, be very thorough. And remember: if you only apply one coat, it won’t look very good. An extra layer will make wonders happen, though! In some cases, a third coat will also be required (if the boat is really old). Oh, and I want you to give the seams the attention they deserve. The reason: most folks forget how important it is to <strong>paint</strong> the seams, even though they usually chip very quickly and make the boat look rather bad. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Easy maintenance.

Hopefully, you can utilize the list shared above. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Just like <strong>paint</strong>ing fiberglass or wood, <strong>paint</strong>ing an <strong>aluminum</strong> boat begins with sanding away old <strong>paint</strong> and oxidation until you’re left with clean, shiny metal. This usually requires 80 or 100 grit sandpaper, which will leave behind some scuff marks. Don’t worry – this is a good thing. The tiny scratches and scuffs will help the primer and <strong>paint</strong> adhere to the metal. In fact, an <strong>aluminum</strong> surface needs to be etched so the <strong>paint</strong> has something to hold on to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Rustoleum Protective Enamel and Krylon Color Maxx are readily available <strong>paint</strong>s that work well. Both have excellent spray nozzles for smooth application. We tested each brand and found that Rustoleum Enamel tends to cause an orange peel texture more readily. That was just our experience and your’s may differ. Automotive spray <strong>paint</strong>s are another option but we did not test them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Remove old <strong>paint</strong>. When working on major repairs of a metal boat, first completely remove the old coating using a synthetic cord-brush or an old <strong>paint</strong> remover. It is better to clean the surface gradually, covering small areas with a cloth soaked in a solution and tightly covering the top with polyethylene. When scraping off old <strong>paint</strong>, be careful not to damage the protective layer of the metal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We’ve decided to share our trials of <strong>paint</strong>ing an <strong>aluminum</strong> boat with you.

For difficult to reach areas and seams, a wire wheel on an electric drill was the fastest solution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I recommend whenever <strong>paint</strong>ing an old boat, that if you know the <strong>paint</strong> types and there are no conflicts, that you sand the hull prior to <strong>paint</strong>ing. This way any loose <strong>paint</strong> will flake off and you will know for sure. Whenever I <strong>paint</strong> a boat, I like to ensure that I’m working with a fresh surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To <strong>paint</strong> a metal boat, you need to follow a certain technology. Only then the <strong>paint</strong> will last a long time. Correctly chosen <strong>paint</strong> will create a protective oxide film on top of the <strong>aluminum</strong> product. Therefore, this cover will perform both a protective and decorative function. In this review, we will discuss the 5 best finish options for <strong>aluminum</strong> boats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After applying primer, you will begin <strong>paint</strong>ing your vessel. Take it one section at a time. If you’re using rollers or brushes, make sure to keep using even, unidirectional strokes to ensure a good finish, and avoid overloading the rollers or brushes – this can lead to drips. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Next up is the step we’ve all been waiting for: <strong>paint</strong>ing. Painting your <strong>aluminum</strong> boat requires you to use special <strong>paint</strong> manufactured solely for <strong>paint</strong>ing boats. In the case of <strong>aluminum</strong> boats, here are some boat <strong>paint</strong>s you should check out: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The overall cost depends greatly on the materials and tools you already have. It also depends on the <strong>paint</strong> you choose. We went with spray <strong>paint</strong> cans for convenience, ease of use and the low cost. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Handy Hint: Spend a lot of time doing this part. The more of the old <strong>paint</strong> you can remove the better as the best result is achieved if the surface is bare <strong>aluminum</strong>. Areas that are not completely cleaned will result in <strong>paint</strong> peeling after <strong>paint</strong>ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>PS - This stuff isn&rsquo;t gonna resist every scratch or bump or rock you might run into, but it cures hard, holds up nice and flat for a good long while. And what&rsquo;s best? It&rsquo;s dirt cheap. I <strong>paint</strong>ed a 14 ft Jon boat inside and out with a quart of the primer, quart of green <strong>paint</strong>, and quart of their no slip rubber boat deck <strong>paint</strong>. Total cost was 50 dollars for all 3 cans. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>type in &ldquo;marine <strong>paint</strong> specialist&rdquo; they will have any materials needed for the <strong>paint</strong> and preparation.<strong>paint</strong> on &ldquo;any&rdquo; surface can be treated using the right preparation method, therefore allowing you to <strong>paint</strong> over an existing finish. In regards to using an automotive <strong>paint</strong> after you have applied the correct primer"I WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE USING MARINE PAINT" as this is designed for that purpose, it may be more expensive, but it will be a lot more durable than a standard automotive <strong>paint</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The special due-biocide formula will allow you to protect your boat from fouling for the whole season. And at the same time, the <strong>paint</strong> will not bring any harm to the ecosystem. It will also protect the vessel from corrosion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are plenty of <strong>aluminum</strong> boat specific <strong>paint</strong>s on the market like Aluma Hawk, Total Boat and Duralux Marine <strong>paint</strong>. We did not like the limited color choices and the cost of these <strong>paint</strong>s. A single gallon of <strong>paint</strong> costs about $40 to $80. It adds up fast with a primer and two or more colors of <strong>paint</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Tape off any <strong>aluminum</strong> that you don’t want <strong>paint</strong>ed with a high quality <strong>paint</strong>ers tape like Frog Tape. We taped off the entire gunwale and <strong>paint</strong>ed everything else on the inside of the boat. Tape off any other parts as needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most hardware stores sell wire wheels for a few bucks and one will last the duration of the project. Just be aware that using it aggressively on <strong>aluminum</strong> can cause minor pitting. Use just enough pressure to remove the <strong>paint</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>paint</strong> will look great on any boat, but it does not have enough properties the underwater part needs. Though its winning feature is that you may apply one thin layer of primer to achieve the desired effect. It also dries fast enough. The main idea to avoid thick coating as it will not dry properly. If you still see some drawbacks after drying, you can remove them with careful sanding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Traditionally, the <strong>paint</strong> you use on your Jon boat will be dependent on the type of fabrication material it is constructed of. Nowadays, <strong>paint</strong> manufacturers have developed versatile generic <strong>paint</strong>s that can be used on most types of boats though the <strong>paint</strong>s used for specific construction materials have some major advantages over generic <strong>paint</strong>s. Paints that have antifouling, anti-corrosion, and anti-abrasion elements are the most recommended <strong>paint</strong>s for specific types of Jon boats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A. You want to remove any non-adherent <strong>paint</strong> (because it does no good for your fresh <strong>paint</strong> to stick to non-adherent <strong>paint</strong>), and you want to scuff the surface of the remaining <strong>paint</strong>, Christopher. But there is little benefit in sanding away adherent factory <strong>paint</strong>. (Readers please note that this advise is for the owner of a 12-foot <strong>aluminum</strong> boat, not for a boat manufacturer). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I&rsquo;m 17 a senior in high school and I recently purchased a boat in need of new <strong>paint</strong>. Guys have been saying that I need to clean the hull after sanding/stripping with a household cleaner or dewaxing solvent to make sure the <strong>paint</strong> adheres. I was wondering if it is important that all of the cleaner/dewaxing solvent is washed or wiped off before the primer goes on. thanks - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For areas of the boat that you want to stay polished <strong>aluminum</strong>, wet sand with fine grit paper or sanding sponges. Start with 220 grit and work your way up to the desired level of polish. Sand in one direction. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I learnt how to <strong>paint</strong> an <strong>aluminum</strong> boat over 20 years ago with my late father. I am going now show you my straight forward process to doing so which has served me well multiple times. Just don’t miss any steps as you will end up wasting a lot of time, money and energy if you skip things. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I think Marshall was suggesting that you need to use a primer designed for use on <strong>aluminum</strong> oxide surfaces (whether that be zinc chromate, zinc phosphate, or otherwise). While some readers understood that, other readers misread this to mean a primer based upon <strong>aluminum</strong> oxide chemistry &ndash; and unfortunately the error went uncorrected. Sorry. We thank you for the clarification and recommendation, Michael! But the reason the site and this thread have survived so long is that we don&rsquo;t print flames. Smug posts lead to flaming posts, so they&rsquo;re best avoided as well :-) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In my earlier post, existing <strong>paint</strong> is best removed if possible but if it is in good condition, then break down the top gloss by lightly sanding. Also, you can use the Galv-alum <strong>aluminum</strong> primer instead of the Zinc Chromate primer. I don&rsquo;t have a heat oven so the sun did just fine, and then of course as Lowe boats say themselves, a coat of high grade polyurethane enamel <strong>paint</strong>. There it is straight from one of the leading horse&rsquo;s mouth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A topside <strong>paint</strong> is applied on the upper waterline of a boat to protect the hull from corrosion and exposure damage. A below waterline <strong>paint</strong> is applied to the bottom of the boat to prevent the build-up of micro-organisms that can harm the vessel. A below waterline <strong>paint</strong> is usually advertised as having an antifouling formula. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Your post is much appreciated, Travis, but the idea that all West Marine employees are idiots while Cabela&rsquo;s employees are wizards is ridiculous, and the kind of thing that starts a race to the bottom. I suspect there was a communication problem where you use your boat only in fresh water, or your boat is small enough that you always pull it out, and that wasn&rsquo;t clear to them. In that case the anti-fouling <strong>paint</strong> they may have recommended is an extravagance. However, if a boat ever stays in salt water overnight, anti-fouling <strong>paint</strong> is absolutely required; it is not an option. Without it, it will become totally covered in very hard to remove barnacles in just a few days. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At this point, it becomes impossible to make blanket statements about the application of the primer and <strong>paint</strong>, because different types of products have different requirements. And you need to know this prior to applying the primer, because some primers should be <strong>paint</strong>ed over just an hour or two after application. Others need up to 48 hours to cure. Some should be sanded before the <strong>paint</strong> goes on, and others should not be sanded. The bottom line: you’ll need to read the instructions and follow them for each individual product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I have a 40&rsquo; <strong>aluminum</strong> cruiser boat that was stripped to bare <strong>aluminum</strong> about ten years ago, at the time it had epoxy <strong>paint</strong> on it. now its time to re<strong>paint</strong> it and I would like to know what is the best way to prep it and and if epoxy is the best way to go. thanks - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If there is one step you should not skip, it’s this one. Paint stripper saved us so much time and made removing the old <strong>paint</strong> so much easier. After several recommendations, we found that Citristrip stripping gel was an affordable and powerful product for removing old <strong>paint</strong> from <strong>aluminum</strong>. It also doesn’t produce noxious fumes. As the name implies, it smells nicely like oranges. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We use Aluma-wash then Alumiprep 33 [affil. link to info/product on Amazon] before the primer is applied. Awl-Grip is the preferred color <strong>paint</strong> involving a two part process that is expensive. All Aluminum starts corroding (rusting) once it hits the air while some have anodizing applied but if scratched or welded the erosion continues. Our boats range from 40 to 200 feet and few <strong>paint</strong> jobs last more than ten years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can <strong>paint</strong> an <strong>aluminum</strong> boat yourself by first sanding it down, using a mix of soap and water to then clean it up. You will then need to apply a primer before either <strong>paint</strong>ing with a roller, brush, or by spraying. You finish the <strong>paint</strong> job off with a clear coat of protectant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before you grab your favorite can of <strong>paint</strong> and get to work, it’s very important to prep it. Otherwise, the end result will be average at best, and the new <strong>paint</strong> will come off in a year or two. The first step is “parking” the boat. Ideally, find a smooth, even spot outdoors and cover it with some paper to absorb all the stains. A couple of layers of that paper will do (or, use plastic instead). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In our case, color was the deciding factor since not all brands have the same color palette. From our research, most quality exterior spray <strong>paint</strong>s provide equally good protection for a fishing boat with standard use. It all depends on what the intended use is. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This latex <strong>aluminum</strong> primer is designed primarily for metal surfaces. Its main and foremost task is to stop rust appearance and spread on the metal surfaces. This cover can be applied over any finish, but be careful when using it over the epoxied <strong>paint</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The plastic prevents the gel from drying out which allows it to penetrate through every layer of <strong>paint</strong> to bare <strong>aluminum</strong>. Paint the gel in small sections and cover with plastic until the entire area of the boat is complete. The longer you let it sit, the better it works. Wait at least 2 to 4 hours before scraping. However, don’t wait too long to scrape as it’s easier when the gel is still wet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The goal was simple. Turn an ugly, neglected, <strong>aluminum</strong> boat into a nice looking fishing boat that will last for many years. Most importantly, we wanted to accomplish the task easily and without spending a fortune. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you had an older layer of <strong>paint</strong> on your vessel, choose an 80-grit sandpaper. You can sand by hand, but for larger vessels we highly recommend an electric sander. After you have sanded off the old <strong>paint</strong>, you can switch to a 40-grit sandpaper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>TextNext, lift the boat a bit. In my experience, sawhorses will be great for this. Plus, make sure there’s enough space around the boat for you to <strong>paint</strong> it from all four sides. You will need some equipment and tools, of course, but it won’t cost you a pretty penny. When <strong>paint</strong>ing an <strong>aluminum</strong> boat, get the following stuff: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Q. I have a old V hull <strong>aluminum</strong> boat that I want to refinish with my son, I have all the old <strong>paint</strong> off and am ready to do all the patching that will be needed to make the hull water tight. What is the best product to seal the hull? Glass&mldr;&mldr;.or what. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>1 gallon of the <strong>paint</strong> is enough for processing of 500 square feet. For the best results, it is recommended to apply 2 coats of the product to your boat, and do not forget to allow each layer to dry out for 24 hours. The manufacturer specifies the antifouling property will be effective for a year, but the users say that it will be fine for a few years if a boat is used in freshwater. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We thank Marshall for this information &ndash; but please note that he is suggesting a primer designed for <strong>aluminum</strong> oxide (oxidized <strong>aluminum</strong>) surfaces &ndash; not a primer comprised of <strong>aluminum</strong> oxide. You will see the confusion running through this thread until the entry for May 15, 2007 which clarifies what James is speaking of. Sorry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Q. I was fishing in Oregon last year near the Pacific Ocean where I met a mobile boat cleaning service. The owner sprayed a chemical compound on my <strong>aluminum</strong> boat, brushed it and washed it off leaving the boat looking like new. What type of compounds would he have used? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>These main benefits made boats made of <strong>aluminum</strong> very popular. This versatile material will not need much of your attention. Aluminum alloy is not afraid of constant contact with water. But in order to extend the service life of boats, you need to further protect them from corrosion. And <strong>paint</strong> can help you a lot with this task. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We live in Phoenix Az. and want to go boating during hot summer months.We cannot touch the interior so we want to <strong>paint</strong> the interior white. This boat has never been in the water and is brand new. what kind of <strong>paint</strong> and where I can purchase the <strong>paint</strong>? Thank You. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You’ll need to start by spraying on a layer of primer. Don’t skip this step. Otherwise, the <strong>paint</strong> will have a hard time “gripping” the <strong>aluminum</strong>, and it will peel or chip off much sooner than expected. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Applying a clear coat after you <strong>paint</strong> the <strong>aluminum</strong> will go a long way in protecting the <strong>paint</strong> and adding a glossy shine. It prevents damage from UV rays, corrosion, staining, and numerous other problems. Many clear coats can be sprayed on, and some should be applied with a brush; in those cases, foam brushes often work better than bristle brushes. Again, multiple coats are usually recommended and we’d always suggest following the manufacturer’s specific instructions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>An easy way to reach every surface while <strong>paint</strong>ing the interior of your <strong>aluminum</strong> boat is to lean it on its side. Use a fence or side of a garage to support it. Find someone to help stand it up so you don’t get hurt or drop the boat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Q. I&rsquo;m currently building an <strong>aluminum</strong> boat and I would like to <strong>paint</strong> this boat once it is complete. I&rsquo;ve talked to a few different people about the method used to <strong>paint</strong> <strong>aluminum</strong> but I don&rsquo;t quite know what the correct method would be for <strong>paint</strong>ing <strong>aluminum</strong>? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Be warned though, it takes some practice to apply this <strong>paint</strong>. Use slow even coats to protect against drips and get the <strong>paint</strong>’s texture reaction to occur. Apply 2 or 3 coats and wait about 30 minutes between coats. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Let’s face it: no matter how big and spacious your boat is, if the <strong>paint</strong> isn’t nice and fresh, that boat isn’t going to look like much. That’s why today, we’ll learn how to properly <strong>paint</strong> a boat with an <strong>aluminum</strong> surface. First, we’ll prep the “sea vessel”. Next, we’ll get rid of the old <strong>paint</strong> and all the dirt along with it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Needs spot repair. After sanding and necessary prep, is Rustoleum self etch primer adequate for bare <strong>aluminum</strong>? Is it compatible with sanded and scuffed surrounding existing polyurethane <strong>paint</strong>. Can it be sprayed over existing <strong>paint</strong>? Does self-etching primer need a top coat before re<strong>paint</strong>ing? Boat to be re<strong>paint</strong>ed afterward with one part marine polyurethane. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>TotalBoat Aluminum Boat Paint offers a corrosion-resistant and non-reflective finish to the boat. This <strong>paint</strong> is great if you are looking to improve the boat’s discreet appearance especially for hunting or fishing activities, due to its available camo color options (see our camo <strong>paint</strong>ing guide here). This <strong>paint</strong> can be directly applied as a complete coat or can be used as primer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The primer works perfectly for all types of metals and is especially good for <strong>aluminum</strong> boats. You will have to roll it on or use a brush as it is a bit too thick for a sprayer. But some users managed to thin it out with water and still apply it by spraying. Make sure you remove all the debris from the surface and sand the metal well to allow the <strong>paint</strong> to grip better. This primer will effectively prolong the service life of your <strong>aluminum</strong> boat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Your boat spends a lot of time in the water, so it’s getting a lot of direct sunlight as well as reflections of the sun’s rays. UV rays can be harmful to your boat, especially the <strong>paint</strong>, so finding a <strong>paint</strong> with added UV protection will help it last longer. Color - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hi. I want to <strong>paint</strong> the inside of my 16 foot Aluminum boat. I know about the Aluminum Oxide Primer and the tack cloth. Now I can&rsquo;t find the Scuff coat gray <strong>paint</strong> (or non skid Paint) to <strong>paint</strong> over the primer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To start, find a dry location where you can work on the boat without fighting the weather. Most of the work can be done in a garage. Because of temperature requirements for <strong>paint</strong>ing with rattle cans (50° – 90°), we recommend you avoid starting in winter. Nothing puts a damper on a <strong>paint</strong>ing project like waiting for temperatures to warm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you decide to re<strong>paint</strong> your boat, you must know what <strong>paint</strong> was originally used for it. Old and new <strong>paint</strong>s must be compatible. It is easy to find out if you carry the following experiment: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=4><li>Take a wire wheel and a drill and clean up any patch work, burrs, chipping and cracking <strong>paint</strong>.

You do not have to knock it down to bare metal, just get it nice and coarse. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Naturally, some safety precautions are in order when you sand <strong>aluminum</strong>, which can release oxide dust into the air. Safety goggles are a must, as well as a dust mask or respirator. You should also wear gloves and clothing which can be washed immediately after you complete the sanding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Q. Can anybody help with information re process and materials to be utilized in <strong>paint</strong>ing and protecting of new aluminium 5.6 m recreational vessel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You should still spend some time sanding the surface.
