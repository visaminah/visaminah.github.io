You’d be better off learning the actual hues of each of your brown colors. In other words, where does each brown exist on the color wheel? - Source: Internet Locate some of the pre-made browns in your paint box. Some artists refer to these browns as earth tones. Why? These colors traditionally got their pigmentation via naturally occurring deposits in the earth. They’re typically various manifestations of iron oxides that were mined from the earth. - Source: Internet There’s plenty of ways to arrive at a brown color. I’ll certainly cover some of the more complex ways later (and answer any questions in the comments section too). But for now I’m going to explain putting together brown colors by using a warm hue with the addition of black and white paint. - Source: Internet By using this logic brown can be yellow. Some browns are yellow-orange. Many browns are red-orange and of course a brown can be orange in color too! - Source: Internet STEP FOUR: From here you can adjust the value of the newly created brown color. Simply add white to lighten it or black to make a dark brown. If at any time you feel your brown is becoming too gray (too little saturation) simply add some more orange paint into the mix! - Source: Internet I can, for example make a burnt sienna more saturated by adding red-orange to it. If I need to paint a dark, low-saturation yellow-yellow-orange I simply reach for my raw umber as a starting point. You guessed it… raw umber is a low-chroma, dark-valued yellow-ish color! - Source: Internet Flaw #1: Hue Shifts – Yep, your purple and yellow are probably not perfect complements and as such you will not only be altering your saturation (lowering yellow’s saturation) but you’ll inadvertently be shifting the brown’s hue as well. If the purple is more of a red-purple your yellow will become more yellow-orange. If the purple is more of a blue-purple, well then your yellow becomes more of a yellow green. - Source: Internet Just to recap… To make my own color that matched burnt sienna… I mixed cadmium red with cadmium orange to get the correct hue: red-orange. I controlled the saturation via the gray that I pre-mixed before adding it to the red orange. Finally I used black to darken the value of the final brown mixture. - Source: Internet I keep a full range of browns on my palette that span from yellow to red. These naturally occurring earth tones are my go to source when I need a brown paint. I have a knowledge of each brown’s hue, value and saturation level right from the start. As such I choose the color most suitable and alter it as needed. - Source: Internet Most of the brown mixing examples I use here use paint as the medium. Everything you learn here can be certainly be applied to drawing or even graphical media as well. If you’re into colored pencils, pastels, or even graphic design, stick around this all applies to you too! - Source: Internet Before you attempt to make brown paint you really should understand what brown is. Unfortunately the term brown is an extremely vague term. Every time somebody calls something “brown” they can be referring to any number of colors. - Source: Internet Flaw#3: How to Darken? – If you refuse to use black paint, how on earth are you going to darken your brown? Take the brown by means of yellow + purple for example. You’ll end up with a brown that’s more or less light in value. If you add more purple you’ll mix a color that looks too purple. Most artists try to solve this darkening problem by throwing a bunch of darker hues at the paint mixture but this leads to an awful lot of drastic hue shifts. - Source: Internet Browns can be light, dark, or even medium in value. Brown colors can also be considered cooler or warmer. I’ll refer to the color temperature of brown later. - Source: Internet For example, one might say that burnt umber is warmer than raw umber. This is because the burnt umber is closer to red as far as the color spectrum is concerned while raw umber sits closer to yellow. A similar case can be made for burnt sienna vs. raw sienna. - Source: Internet Here’s your challenge: Try to match each of your earth tones by starting with a pure, saturated color and only adding various amounts of white and black. You might even have to adjust your hue as well. For example, you might have to add a tiny amount of orange to your yellow if you need to adjust the yellow hue over to a yellow-yellow-orange hue! - Source: Internet To begin started, here are some tips for finding information about what color does yellow and brown mixed together make:\r- Research Brown And Red Make What Color-related information from credible sources.
