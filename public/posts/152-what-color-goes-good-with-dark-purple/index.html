A tan and purple combination will make the purple appear quite striking but also make it appear more elegant than it would with a zany orange, for instance.

By looking at the colors next to the color, you wish to match and the colors across from it, you should be able to choose colors that pair well. - Source: Internet Lauren Lerner, founder and principal designer at Living with Lolo, adores decorating with purple and uses it frequently in her designs. She agrees that a room can nod to the unique color without fully committing to it. “I love decorating with purple because it adds such richness to the space,” she says. “A great way to incorporate purple in your color scheme without being too overwhelming is to use it [in] accent pieces [within] neutral spaces, [with objects] like pillows, rugs, and curtains.” - Source: Internet A lot of people think that purple is quite a challenging color to pair and match with.

They had us with the multicolor wallpaper, but the design team didn’t stop there.

Quite the contrary. This unique hue requires a little extra creativity and a good eye in order to pair it with other shades.

We’ll also provide some tips on how to accessorize with purple. So if you’re looking for some inspiration, keep reading! - Source: Internet This is a great use of purple in a living room.

Prince, who was famously known as “The Purple One”, wrote many songs about love and heartbreak.

I think I’d prefer all white walls, but for people who like a bit of color, the purple accent wall works. - Source: Internet This example is an improvement over the above bathroom. While all the walls are purple, the black and white tub (which is awesome) along with black and white floors balance out nicely. The white gives the lightness the room needs. It’s still definitely a fairly dark room, but it has a regal aura about it. - Source: Internet Let’s say that you’re willing to try some daring ideas, but you’d rather dip your toe in the water when it comes to colors that go with purple. In that case, we recommend pairing a muted lavender shade with white surroundings. For instance, the team over at GRT Architects added lilac-colored wainscoting to anchor this bedroom and balance out the white walls and ceiling, making the room feel modern and airy. - Source: Internet Since purple is a very regal color, it only makes sense that gold would fit right into the palette.

It’s just the right amount of purple. The purple is combined with white, black and light brown flooring. - Source: Internet Rebecca purple is a CSS color name.

Just be sure to stick to similar undertones in the <strong>color</strong>s you choose. Keep cool-toned <strong>purple</strong>s separate from warm-tone <strong>purple</strong>s since they will look like entirely different <strong>color</strong>s when placed side-by-side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In styling, it’s not just about the clothes but everything involved, including the accessories and makeup. It’s even how you bring yourself. When you wear <strong>purple</strong> clothes, you need to pair them with something that will emphasize your style and get your messages through. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I know the <strong>purple</strong> I’m referring here is called brown, but it has a <strong>purple</strong> look to it. It’s the far back wall of the room. It’s a very subtle <strong>purple</strong>, but I think it works magnificently in this interior. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One <strong>color</strong> combination we haven’t talked about yet is <strong>purple</strong> and black, which can also make a striking combination. Black works well with dark <strong>color</strong>s of <strong>purple</strong> since it can make these dark shades pop. This can make dark <strong>purple</strong> <strong>color</strong>s look more intense than they normally would against other <strong>color</strong> shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As with light <strong>purple</strong>, dark <strong>purple</strong> clothes often go well with neutral <strong>color</strong>s like white or gray. Beige can be a bit trickier with dark <strong>purple</strong> but can work if you pair it with a warm-toned <strong>purple</strong> that has reddish hues. You’ll also want to avoid browns, oranges, and certain shades of red and green with dark <strong>purple</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In the case of <strong>purple</strong>, the <strong>color</strong>s on its immediate sides are blues and reds. Both blue and red are accent <strong>color</strong>s to <strong>purple</strong> and often pair well with the <strong>color</strong>. Looking across from <strong>purple</strong>, its direct opposite shade is yellow, which contrasts well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With a bright <strong>purple</strong> patterned area rug, dark gray walls, and a piece of abstract artwork that integrates shades of <strong>purple</strong>, Lauren Lerner of Living with Lolo has masterfully brought together dark and light in this space. To add to the luxe feel of this nook, a crystal and brass chandelier hangs overhead. The aesthetic is equal parts modern and elegant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Rust can be used as an accent <strong>color</strong> or as the main <strong>color</strong> in a room. It pairs well with other warm <strong>color</strong>s such as orange and yellow. It can also be used with cool <strong>color</strong>s like blue and green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For formal occasions, silver or gold accessories are also good matches with a <strong>purple</strong> dress. Silver often works best with cool-toned <strong>color</strong>s and gold with warm-toned <strong>color</strong>s. But realistically, either should work with a <strong>purple</strong> dress and you can find shoes, jewelry, and other accessories that all coordinate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Perhaps <strong>purple</strong> is feeling too brazen for your otherwise cool, calm, and collected space. If you want to experiment with just a hint of the hue, turn to light blue as a complementary <strong>color</strong>. The team over at Collins Interiors partnered a light blue window bench with lilac and blue Roman shades. The artwork, blue glassware, and lavender linens tie the whole look together seamlessly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple is a so-called secondary <strong>color</strong> because it is mixed from the primary <strong>color</strong>s red and blue. As a rough rule of thumb, all <strong>color</strong>s that harmonize with red and blue also go well with <strong>purple</strong>. However, when putting together outfits, it is also important to choose the right <strong>purple</strong>, because what looks good with dark eggplant <strong>purple</strong> does not necessarily also apply to light lavender <strong>purple</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Per Nelums, the versatility of the <strong>color</strong>s extends beyond a limited set of styles and stereotypical gender preferences—fellas, don&rsquo;t be afraid of the shade. Pair plum with teal or navy for a rich, luxurious statement, or go with violet and golden hues to connote royalty and wisdom. Then there’s lilac, lavender, and the lighter ends of the <strong>purple</strong> spectrum—those can go minimalist, modern, or cozy and country depending on the accents you choose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>These <strong>color</strong>s compliment each other so well in home decor. You can use them together in a room to create a dramatic and stylish look, or use them separately to achieve different effects. Here are some ideas for using charcoal and <strong>purple</strong> in your home: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It adds to your fashion statement quite relevantly. Pearl earrings and ear crawlers can go very well with a <strong>purple</strong> dress on a formal occasion. A fun and street style would also allow for larger sizes of hoop earrings. You can also mix different types of earrings, adding additional style and layers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple makeup can be quite out of the ordinary and daily looks and styles. However, applying it right and with creativity will surely help in elevating your overall look. Purple lipstick with a velvety and <strong>purple</strong> dress will look very classy and sophisticated with a whip of mystery and even magic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple and yellow are two <strong>color</strong>s that are not for the faint of heart. But if you&rsquo;re going for a glam, vibrant space, it&rsquo;s a mix that&rsquo;ll unquestionably turn heads. Consider adding splashes of yellow with the help of drapery, art, throw pillows, and a saturated <strong>purple</strong> rug à la this space belonging to Cassie from Hi Sugarplum! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;re into bright, bold <strong>color</strong> schemes, boy, do we have a pairing for you. Have you thought about a kitchen splashed in <strong>purple</strong> and orange? That&rsquo;s how interior designer Justina Blakeney brought so much life into this bohemian setup through light <strong>purple</strong> cabinets, an orange backsplash and wall, and a mint green refrigerator. A <strong>color</strong>ful runner and lots of greenery complete the vibrant scene. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you ask designer Marissa Nelums, <strong>purple</strong> does not deserve the bad reputation it sometimes has. “In client questionnaires, we ask which <strong>color</strong>s they don’t like, and I have seen <strong>purple</strong> come up quite a bit,” she says. “People think it’s too harsh, too bright, and can get gaudy. But, to me, it’s like the perfect dress—the one you can wear with sneakers and high heels.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple is a nice <strong>color</strong> that can accentuate any look you are trying to pull off. There are bold <strong>color</strong> choices and also the basics.

It adds a clean and soft finish and will pair well with any shade of <strong>purple</strong> you wish to match. Wear a <strong>purple</strong> top with your favorite white skirt or pants, or switch it up and pair a white blouse with <strong>purple</strong> bottoms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Colors combined in nature will almost always go well together in a home. For a bold <strong>color</strong> choice, you can choose a dark <strong>purple</strong> couch with green accents. The other way around also works great. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For example, if you have a lot of <strong>purple</strong> in your room already, use emerald as an accent <strong>color</strong> to add a touch of contrast. Or, if your room is mostly white, use <strong>purple</strong> to add some interest and brightness. No matter how you use them, these two <strong>color</strong>s are sure to make your space look great! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple is made up of red and blue and therefore comes in many different shades with both warm and cool undertones. Your best chance of matching <strong>purple</strong> clothing is to choose <strong>color</strong>s that share the same undertones as the <strong>purple</strong> you have. Stick to warm <strong>color</strong>s with red-toned <strong>purple</strong>s, and use cool <strong>color</strong>s with blue-toned <strong>purple</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple works quite well with warm neutrals like tan and taupe and these <strong>color</strong>s really provide the right kind of contrast for <strong>purple</strong> to work in a design. A tan and <strong>purple</strong> combination will make the <strong>purple</strong> appear quite striking but also make it appear more elegant than it would with a zany orange, for instance. If the <strong>purple</strong> you are using is also darker and more of an eggplant, a <strong>purple</strong> and tan palette begins to appear more rustic and harvest, like a Fall food tableau. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to matching <strong>color</strong>s, many designers and artists turn to the <strong>color</strong> wheel and basic <strong>color</strong> theory for choosing coordinating options. The <strong>color</strong> wheel contains all of the main <strong>color</strong>s of the rainbow, ranging from shades of red to shades of <strong>purple</strong>. By looking at the <strong>color</strong>s next to the <strong>color</strong>, you wish to match and the <strong>color</strong>s across from it, you should be able to choose <strong>color</strong>s that pair well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Lauren Lerner, founder and principal designer at Living with Lolo, adores decorating with <strong>purple</strong> and uses it frequently in her designs. She agrees that a room can nod to the unique <strong>color</strong> without fully committing to it. &ldquo;I love decorating with <strong>purple</strong> because it adds such richness to the space,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;A great way to incorporate <strong>purple</strong> in your <strong>color</strong> scheme without being too overwhelming is to use it [in] accent pieces [within] neutral spaces, [with objects] like pillows, rugs, and curtains.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A lot of people think that <strong>purple</strong> is quite a challenging <strong>color</strong> to pair and match with. This <strong>color</strong> is not so “naturally occurring,” unlike other <strong>color</strong>s like green and blue. However, in reality, <strong>purple</strong> is a relatively easy <strong>color</strong> to style and pair with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>How much fun is this whimsical kids&rsquo; bedroom by Chango & Co.? They had us with the multi<strong>color</strong> wallpaper, but the design team didn&rsquo;t stop there. Rather, they doubled down on the vibrant <strong>color</strong> scheme by adding pieces of decor flaunting the same vibrant hues seen in the wallpaper, such as the lavender canopy bed, fuchsia throw pillows, and even the yellow flowers on the nightstands. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dark <strong>purple</strong> is the <strong>color</strong> of luxury. It is the <strong>color</strong> of individuals who want to stand out, in a positive and powerful way. This is the type of <strong>color</strong> that triggers people and makes them want to find out more about you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re set on trying to find a combination that works, stick to earthy tones. Go for a warm-toned <strong>purple</strong> or mauve paired with a warm, medium brown <strong>color</strong>. Stick to brown <strong>color</strong>s commonly seen in leather handbags, especially those in a medium to the light <strong>color</strong> range. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Unlike white or cream — which can pretty much blend in with anything — <strong>purple</strong> is not a neutral <strong>color</strong>. Quite the contrary. This unique hue requires a little extra creativity and a good eye in order to pair it with other shades. While you could always go all-in and paint the walls <strong>purple</strong>, there are other ways to incorporate the plum shade — such as decor, appliances, tile, furniture, wallpaper, and lighting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple and taupe are <strong>color</strong>s that go together very well, especially if you&rsquo;re drawn to warm and inviting palettes. We love the combo used in this bedroom belonging to Chris and Julia&rsquo;s little girl from Chris Loves Julia. The dark <strong>purple</strong> walls are beautifully balanced by the beige accents used throughout, including the carpet, bedding, artwork, and the wallpaper on the ceiling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Do you have a favorite <strong>color</strong>? Mine is <strong>purple</strong>. There’s just something about the <strong>color</strong> that makes me feel happy and excited. I love using <strong>purple</strong> in my home decor, and I’ve found that it goes well with many different <strong>color</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another classic and almost universal <strong>color</strong>, white adds a soft touch of neatness to your <strong>purple</strong> getup. Whitetop, <strong>purple</strong> bottoms or reversed, you are good to go. Layering your <strong>purple</strong> top with something white or dirty white would be a nice <strong>color</strong> combination too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple and dark blue is a seriously stylish <strong>color</strong> combination that has an element of mystery and visual drama. The dark blue, especially if it’s cooler in tone, makes the <strong>purple</strong> appear more sophisticated. Both are traditional and royal <strong>color</strong>s and together they have a dark and impressive presence. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In this blog post, we’ll discuss which <strong>color</strong>s compliment <strong>purple</strong> and how to use them in your home decor. We’ll also provide some tips on how to accessorize with <strong>purple</strong>. So if you’re looking for some inspiration, keep reading! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a great use of <strong>purple</strong> in a living room. Everything is neutral – white, grey and black and then BAM! one wall bright <strong>purple</strong>. I like “BAM” in interior design so I think this works. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Others say that <strong>purple</strong> is the <strong>color</strong> of sadness because it is often associated with loss and mourning. Prince, who was famously known as “The Purple One”, wrote many songs about love and heartbreak. His music often reflected his dark and melancholy moods. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>On the other hand, you can match dark <strong>purple</strong> and taupe to bring a warm and welcoming feel. They are mixed interiors to balance each other, creating a favorable atmosphere. That’s why you might often see houses with <strong>purple</strong> walls that will come with blue furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To create a moody <strong>purple</strong> palette, rust-<strong>color</strong>ed elements can be incorporated into any space. This can come in accents like rugs or other neutral, earthy textured elements. You can also use rust furniture against a <strong>purple</strong> wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Tranquility is also a sense of this combination. It will be more defined with the two muted <strong>color</strong>s. On the other hand, pastel <strong>purple</strong> and blue give a clear feel of soothingness with both contemporary and casual feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While gray tones lend some contemporary flair to <strong>purple</strong>, <strong>purple</strong> can also help prevent the gray from being dreary and monotonous. Bold <strong>purple</strong> walls look balanced with gray furniture. Likewise, gray walls balance <strong>purple</strong> accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This works rather well. One wouldn’t think <strong>purple</strong> goes well with wood, but this light wood and the fact that the room is very simple in design, the <strong>purple</strong> works nicely. I think I’d prefer all white walls, but for people who like a bit of <strong>color</strong>, the <strong>purple</strong> accent wall works. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This example is an improvement over the above bathroom. While all the walls are <strong>purple</strong>, the black and white tub (which is awesome) along with black and white floors balance out nicely. The white gives the lightness the room needs. It’s still definitely a fairly dark room, but it has a regal aura about it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;re willing to try some daring ideas, but you&rsquo;d rather dip your toe in the water when it comes to <strong>color</strong>s that go with <strong>purple</strong>. In that case, we recommend pairing a muted lavender shade with white surroundings. For instance, the team over at GRT Architects added lilac-<strong>color</strong>ed wainscoting to anchor this bedroom and balance out the white walls and ceiling, making the room feel modern and airy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Since <strong>purple</strong> is a very regal <strong>color</strong>, it only makes sense that gold would fit right into the palette. You can choose to weave it in through picture frames, which is what Jenni of I Spy DIY did in this guest room. Or you could always integrate brass light fixtures, drapery hardware, accent pillows, or even a bed throw. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The colour chart above shows exactly which colours go well with <strong>purple</strong> and how they look against each other in a simple colour palette. So to answer the question &lsquo;What colours go with <strong>purple</strong>&rsquo;, according to colour theory, the answer is red, blue, yellow, green and orange. However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that other colours won&rsquo;t also work really well with various shades of <strong>purple</strong>, like violet and lilac. These are grey, silver and pink. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple has long been considered a regal hue since it was originally one of the rarest and most difficult hues to recreate. Showcasing a deep, dramatic mix of red and blue, <strong>purple</strong> — including its light and dark counterparts, lilac and aubergine — is always a confident <strong>color</strong> idea. According to ColorPsychology.org, the <strong>color</strong> elicits a myriad of feelings and vibes: luxury, power, mysticism, magic, and even calmness. But before you take the leap, have you thought about what <strong>color</strong>s actually go with <strong>purple</strong>? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple has always been associated with royalty. It is the <strong>color</strong> of luxury and wealth. Purple is also associated with wisdom, dignity, and independence. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Second, think about the mood you want to create. Yellow is often associated with happiness and cheerfulness, while <strong>purple</strong> is seen as more luxurious and elegant. If you want a bright and cheerful space, use lots of yellow accents with a few touches of <strong>purple</strong>. If you’re going for a more glam look, use mostly <strong>purple</strong> with a few bright yellow accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I love this small white kitchen with <strong>purple</strong> backsplash and stools. It’s just the right amount of <strong>purple</strong>. The <strong>purple</strong> is combined with white, black and light brown flooring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Rebecca <strong>purple</strong> is a CSS <strong>color</strong> name. It was added to the CSS4 official list of <strong>color</strong> names this year. I&rsquo;m sure there are people who are much more excited than I am that they can now use Rebecca Purple on their websites, but it&rsquo;s not something I see myself using all that often. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can also use these <strong>color</strong>s in accessories such as pillows, throws, or vases to add a pop of <strong>color</strong>. Experiment with different combinations of these <strong>color</strong>s to see what works best for you. With these <strong>color</strong>s, the possibilities are endless! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Or, use a lavender as an accent <strong>color</strong> against a rich <strong>purple</strong>. These <strong>color</strong>s can also be used in monochromatic schemes for a calming effect. When using mauve and <strong>purple</strong> together, remember that less is more. A little goes a long way with these <strong>color</strong>s, so don’t go overboard! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Here’s an example of strong royal <strong>purple</strong> living room via the <strong>purple</strong> sofa and curtains. Then the bright turquoise blue pillows add more splash to the space. The thing is, it works… two bright <strong>color</strong>s working together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to use <strong>purple</strong> and emerald together, try mixing them in small doses. A few throw pillows, a vase, or a painting are all great ways to add just a touch of both <strong>color</strong>s. If you’re using them on their own, use more of one <strong>color</strong> than the other to create a focal point in your room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There is no doubt about how wonderful the mixture of <strong>purple</strong> and brown is. The plum <strong>purple</strong> will become attractive when it appears with tan or coffee <strong>color</strong>s. When you combine these two <strong>color</strong>s in some outfit items, you can have a professional look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple has always been the representation of royalty. In addition, this <strong>color</strong> encourages imaginative and creative capacity. The secret will lie in the combination between <strong>purple</strong> and the <strong>color</strong>s it matches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another great <strong>color</strong> combo for <strong>purple</strong> is with pink. Pink has a softer, more romantic feel, which pairs well with the elegance of <strong>purple</strong>. Try using different shades of these <strong>color</strong>s to create a beautiful and unique <strong>color</strong> scheme in your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=http://www.greylikesweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/purple-groom-619x928.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="What Color Goes Good With Dark Purple - Colors That Go Well With Purple">
