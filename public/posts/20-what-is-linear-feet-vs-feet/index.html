So if you learned that in school, you can figure cubic feet. It is length times width times height. Here are a few things sold by the cubic foot. - Source: Internet Convert that number to feet, which is around 3×7. Do the same for windows. Let’s say you have two windows that are 3×5 for this example. Let’s use those three numbers to calculate our total in the next step. - Source: Internet This is completely different than square feet. For example, the square footage of a 10×10 room is 100. But the linear footage of a 10×10 room is forty because each wall is ten feet long. Make sure you don’t confuse the two. - Source: Internet There are two general measurements used to sell materials. Square foot and linear foot. But another important measurement is the cubic foot, which measures the length, width, and height, rather than just one or two measurements. - Source: Internet – another thing that is poured is water. Water is almost always measured in cubic feet if in large amounts. There isn’t any other good way to calculate how much water is needed or present. Stone – this is solid stone, as we already talked about gravel. Solid stone, marble, and other similar natural minerals are calculated in cubic feet because they are solid and surface area wouldn’t be useful knowledge. - Source: Internet – you may think that cabinets need to be measured by the square foot, and in some ways, they do. But they also need to be measured by linear foot because they go across the walls not in the center of the room. Trim – trim goes around the edge of walls and doors. So it needs to be calculated by the linear foot. Measure the perimeter of a room, door, or window to figure the linear foot of the trim that you need. - Source: Internet A linear foot is a measurement used in construction to determine how many certain construction materials you need. Calculating it is similar to calculating the surface area of a shape. There’s a reason this measurement is so important. - Source: Internet But in short, a linear foot is simply twelve inches that are in a straight line. Many construction materials are sold by linear foot. This includes boards and other oblong materials that depend on the length rather than the width. - Source: Internet – there it is! Of course, boxes and containers are calculated by cubic feet because you need to know how much they will hold. This is how moving vans and even shipping containers are calculated. Plaster – plaster and even cement are usually calculated in cubic feet. Because sometimes, you need to cover a thin surface, and other times you need to put it on feet thick. So it needs to be calculated by the cubic foot. - Source: Internet Square foot covers a surface area and is the most common type of measurement used in construction. It is two measurements, length times width. Here are a few things that are measured by square feet. - Source: Internet Gravel – gravel is usually sold by the load or cubic feet. This is because it is usually poured into ditches, gaps, and patios. So the easiest way to figure how much gravel you need is to measure the cubic feet. - Source: Internet When it comes to calculating the linear feet of a room’s walls, you need to get that measuring tape out. Learning how to measure linear feet is quite easy. You simply measure the length of a wall. then, measure the length of the opposite wall in the same room. - Source: Internet – flooring is usually sold by the box, but in general, it will show how much square footage it covers because you need to cover the entire floor, not just the perimeter. This is true for any type of floor. Paint – no matter what you’re painting, you will almost always calculate the square foot rather than the linear foot. This is because you need to cover a surface area. Even if it’s furniture, which is difficult to calculate. - Source: Internet – boards are always measured by linear foot. The width and depth are also calculated, but the linear foot of the board is most dominant and how the boards are sold. When shopping, you ask for them in linear footage Molding – molding is a lot like trim. It goes on the seam between the ceiling and the walls. It is measured just like trim and doesn’t have chunks taken out because windows and doors don’t reach the ceiling. - Source: Internet Most paint covers about 350 sq feet a gallon. But you want to make sure you do two coats in most cases. So this room needs two gallons of paint as one gallon will do one coat. You can also buy pints for cheaper. - Source: Internet To calculate how much paint you need for a wall, you don’t need to know linear footage. Instead, you need to know the square footage. Not of the room, because that would be the floor. You need to know the square footage of the walls. - Source: Internet You can generally assume that each opposite wall is the same. Finally, you measure the other two walls. Length only, not height. Now, add all four lengths together. This number is the linear foot of the room. - Source: Internet Measure the length of one wall first. For a 10×10 room, this will be ten feet. This is a linear measurement. Then, you take that same wall and measure the height. This is another linear foot measurement. - Source: Internet Linear foot measures length only and is the simples form of measurement used in construction. It is one measurement, which is just length. Here are a few things measured by linear foot. - Source: Internet – this is solid stone, as we already talked about gravel. Solid stone, marble, and other similar natural minerals are calculated in cubic feet because they are solid and surface area wouldn’t be useful knowledge. Boxes – there it is! Of course, boxes and containers are calculated by cubic feet because you need to know how much they will hold.
