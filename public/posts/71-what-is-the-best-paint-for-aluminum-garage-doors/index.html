This is true for vinyl garage doors and wooden garage doors. For metal garage doors, the best <strong>paint</strong> is oil-based exterior <strong>paint</strong>, but exterior latex <strong>paint</strong> will still work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Think of whites, tans, and grays.

If your garage door is attractive, then a dark color can make it a highlight. Reds, blues, and greens: When using these colors, you’ll probably want to do for a dark muted version of them. Like darks, these are bolder choices. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Your garage door can be an asset to your home’s look or a major hindrance.

You may need more than one gallon of <strong>paint</strong> if: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another option is to choose a color that coordinates with the rest of your home&rsquo;s exterior.

Make sure you specify that it&rsquo;s Colorbond Night Sky, not Night Sky, as apparently there is a grey colour called that. However, I don&rsquo;t believe that is the discrepancy with the colours here as the suppliers have labelled this grey CB Night Sky. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your metal garage door is faded or peeling, it can have a serious impact on the overall appearance (and even the value) of your home. Is it possible or advisable to <strong>paint</strong> a metal garage door? In this article, we answer this question and provide good advice and tips to help you make your metal garage door look its best. Read on to learn more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Garage doors are a feature that is often overlooked in home maintenance. They rarely need attention, let alone a makeover. However, if the time has come to give them a fresh coat of <strong>paint</strong>, you have a few decisions to make. One of the most important of which will be what finish to use in <strong>paint</strong>ing your doors. Fortunately, we have done extensive research to determine what finish will work best on your garage doors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You’ll notice that you can’t just choose based on brand. Every <strong>paint</strong> brand offers different levels of quality. If you pick the premium or highest quality <strong>paint</strong> of any brand, it is going to be better than the lowest quality <strong>paint</strong> of another brand. For example, high-quality Glidden is going to better than a low-quality Sherwin-Williams, even if Sherwin-Williams is generally considered a better brand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>paint</strong> at a home improvement store can be broken into two general categories: latex and oil-based. Latex <strong>paint</strong> isn’t necessarily latex, but it is the name given to most water-based <strong>paint</strong>s. The terms are used interchangeably, even though it is somewhat inaccurate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For businesses, image is key even when premises are closed on evenings and weekends. Whilst shutters help protect glass windows and doors from burglaries and anti-social behaviour in the early hours, tatty peeling <strong>paint</strong>work and flaking shutters look unsightly to passing traffic, harming your reputation as customers look to shop elsewhere. Even hidden away on industrial estates, premises that appear to be in disrepair can be an attractive for antisocial behaviour such as arson, graffiti and trespassing, which will disrupt the flow of your business and potentially increase insurance premiums. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To apply a clear coat, first make sure the <strong>paint</strong> is completely dry. Then, using a clean, dry cloth, apply a thin layer of clear coat to the door. Allow the clear coat to dry completely before opening the door. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For re<strong>paint</strong>ing existing doors, any existing <strong>paint</strong>/coatings need to be thoroughly abraded to provide a key and remove any loose and/or flaking material. Wash with appropriate detergents, providing a sound surface to coat. You can remove the old <strong>paint</strong>/coating entirely if desired using a <strong>paint</strong> stripper, but if sound and compatible our can be applied directly to existing <strong>paint</strong>ed surfaces, saving you the extra work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want your garage door color to match some aspect of your home, the front door may be the best choice. However, if your garage opens to the front of your house, be careful in your color choices. If your front door is <strong>paint</strong>ed a bright, bold color, it may be best to let the front door steal the show and choose a more neutral tone for the garage. However, matching white or black doors can be very attractive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>UV rays can inflict a lot of damage on <strong>paint</strong>, causing fading and deterioration. The amount of time that your <strong>paint</strong> job will last is directly correlated to the amount of absorbed UV light. You will want to consider this when choosing your <strong>paint</strong> finish. Ultimately, the higher the gloss, the more light will be reflected, the less UV light will be absorbed. Therefore, semi-gloss and gloss finishes will hold up best against UV rays. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If the door has not been previously primed, then apply at least one coat of metal primer to the entire metal door and frame. Use the metal primer according to the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions, which should be located somewhere on the tin. Allow the primer to dry before you continuing (this can take up to eight hours). If the door has been primed or it has been previously <strong>paint</strong>ed then you can skip this step. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There is a little more that goes into picking the perfect <strong>paint</strong> for your garage door than this, however. The type of <strong>paint</strong> that is already on the door matters. And what about primer? What about <strong>paint</strong>ing the inside? We’ve got everything you need to know about picking the best <strong>paint</strong> for the inside and outside of your garage door. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you aren’t far from a home improvement store, then you can get a gallon of <strong>paint</strong> to get the job done. If you have some leftover, that’s great because you might need to touch up later. If you need more, you can always run out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Garage doors need <strong>paint</strong> that can withstand weather as well as significant use. The best finish for garage doors is a gloss or semi-gloss finish. Both of these finishes dry hard and are not easily scratched. Additionally, glossy <strong>paint</strong>s hold up well to humidity and can be cleaned with ease. Although gloss and semi-gloss finishes tend to highlight imperfections, they are still the best overall finishes for garage doors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wood requires exterior latex <strong>paint</strong>. Oil-based <strong>paint</strong> will crack and peel over time. If <strong>paint</strong>ing bare wood, you will need to use a stain-blocking primer if you plan to <strong>paint</strong> your garage door a light color. If <strong>paint</strong>ing stained wood, TSP will be required to prep the door for primer and <strong>paint</strong>. Metal (steel and <strong>aluminum</strong>): Oil-based <strong>paint</strong> works better at protecting metal against rust than latex <strong>paint</strong> (which is water-based). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Don’t forget about <strong>paint</strong>ing the door frame. The <strong>paint</strong> you choose for this vital part of the door can impact its whole visual style. You might want to <strong>paint</strong> it the traditional way – in a clean, crisp white. Or perhaps complementary colour to provide a stylish contrast. Alternatively, some like <strong>paint</strong>ing the frame the same colour as the garage door for a cool, contemporary look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you needed to use a primer, then you might only need one coat of <strong>paint</strong>. You’re <strong>paint</strong>ing a surface that has never been <strong>paint</strong>ed before. Even with a primer, bare wood may need a second coat of <strong>paint</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Other garage doors when new are galvanized. Normal metal <strong>paint</strong> will not adhere properly to galvanized metal and after a few days it starts peeling off in flakes. It is not recommended that you <strong>paint</strong> these doors. What follows therefore, is a guide for <strong>paint</strong>ing either pre-primed new metal doors or doors that have been previously <strong>paint</strong>ed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Garage doors are often the face of a home. So, choosing the best <strong>paint</strong> for garage doors is a must if you’re a proud homeowner. To get it right, you’ll need some careful consideration about the right type of <strong>paint</strong> and the colour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your garage doors are wooden, there is little to worry about. However <strong>paint</strong>ing metal (steel or <strong>aluminum</strong>) doors can be a little more complicated. Most metal garage doors come with a coating of “baked enamel” or “powdercoat.” These coatings are very durable – they typically have a long life-span and require little maintenance. If you decide to <strong>paint</strong> over this factory-produced coating, the new <strong>paint</strong> job will need to be redone every five to ten years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Even factory finishes age over time given enough exposure to dirt, grass, debris and road salt. When older <strong>paint</strong> finishes fade and eventually starting dissolving you will notice chalk like powder or film covering the exterior. This is a good sign that your garage door needs a thorough washing, resurfacing and <strong>paint</strong> application. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We would expect that you get a colour that resembles black and not grey. I&rsquo;ve included the Dulux colour card below, which reflects the colour you should also get in White Knight Rust Guard. Just ask the team member to check that the <strong>paint</strong> they mix is black before taking it home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Remove all stains from the doors as they may alter the color of the finished <strong>paint</strong>. After scrubbing the entire surface, wipe with a clean cloth to remove any residue that may remain from cleaning. Then degrease the door with sugar soap and allow to dry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It can be easier to <strong>paint</strong> your metal garage door in a shade that is very like the existing color. Be sure to choose a color that matches or enhances the color of your house. This will add to your home’s curb appeal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Oil-based <strong>paint</strong> works better at protecting metal against rust than latex <strong>paint</strong> (which is water-based). Glass: Painting glass is not advisable as <strong>paint</strong> does not readily adhere to glass. You can use window films to garage windows. Glass garage doors usually have metal framing, which can be <strong>paint</strong>ed as long as you’re ready for the job of taping off the glass. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A factory applied steel door <strong>paint</strong> application and seal finish should last 15-20 years. External factors like exposure to weather, sunlight and man made elements can influence the lifespan. Road salts in cold climates along with exposure to dirt and grass clippings wear down <strong>paint</strong> finishes. To extend the lifespan of your <strong>paint</strong> finish you can wash your overhead door seasonally and apply a spray on wax finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;ve shopped for interior <strong>paint</strong>, you know that there are many different sheens to choose from. In contrast, exterior <strong>paint</strong>s are usually limited to four basic finishes. Different manufacturers use different terminology for their specific <strong>paint</strong>s, but you will find the four categories below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A bonding primer should be applied to your door surface first to help with the adhesion of the top coat of latex <strong>paint</strong>. Primers are recommended, but not always required so you will need to review the instructions and specifications on whatever <strong>paint</strong> products you choose. Here are some of the recommended primers: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Faded, peeling, or cracked <strong>paint</strong> on your garage doors can detract from curb appeal, dragging down the appearance of your entire home. If you have metal doors you may wonder if they can be <strong>paint</strong>ed, and if so, how to go about it. Painting a metal garage door involves some time and effort, but in the end it&rsquo;s a great way to give your home a fresh new look! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At Five Star Painting we know <strong>paint</strong>ing a metal garage door isn&rsquo;t for everyone.

Plus, <strong>paint</strong>ing is the perfect way to cover up chipped, oxidized doors that are ruining your home&rsquo;s curb appeal. For a high-quality appearance that will last for years to come, there are a few key steps to take when prepping and <strong>paint</strong>ing a garage door. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You&rsquo;ll find most digital samples of colours will vary from the actual <strong>paint</strong>. Though, if that&rsquo;s the case here, it&rsquo;s an exceptionally poor representation. I&rsquo;ve grabbed a few examples and shown them in the image below. As you can see, even Colorbond illustrates their own colour as two different variations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The finish provided by the manufacturer is going to be better quality than any <strong>paint</strong> application you decide to pursue. Factory finishes involve <strong>paint</strong> coats that are baked on to the metal surface. They also have precision <strong>paint</strong> quality through an industrial grade spray gun assembly – ensuring a consistent coat throughout the entire door section. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Garage doors are, typically, made from galvanized metal, which conventional <strong>paint</strong>s have trouble sticking to. When left out in the elements, these coatings have little protection and will soon yield, leaving the metal surface underneath exposed. They require adequate protection from all seasons and weather conditions: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cleaning the exterior surface of your garage door should be done seasonally, but is especially important if you intend to <strong>paint</strong> your overhead door. Garage doors can get stained by dirt and grass clippings getting thrown up against the bottom panel. They are also prone to mildew buildup if they are in a damp and shaded location. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Your home exterior is a great place to express your creativity, using exterior house <strong>paint</strong>s to personalize the look. Since the garage door makes up a large portion of the visible surface on many home exteriors, it makes sense to consider <strong>paint</strong>ing it. Is it a good idea, though? It can be! Let&rsquo;s discuss some of the main factors to keep in mind when you decide whether or not to <strong>paint</strong> your garage door. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Our <strong>paint</strong> suppliers, and those we don&rsquo;t deal with, digitally illustrate Colorbond Night Sky as a grey. I&rsquo;m not sure what is going on with this, and it would take further investigation to find an answer. It&rsquo;s obviously not an issue with accurately displaying the black colour on-screen, as these suppliers clearly show a mid-dark grey. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Above all else, remember that everyone has different tastes. Paint your garage in a colour which reflects your personal taste and style. If you’re <strong>paint</strong>ing your property to sell, it’s generally best to use neutral or timeless colours to add kerb appeal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The outer surface of your garage door can get very hot if exposed to direct sunlight. This is even more of a factor if your garage door is a dark color like black, brown or green. Depending on the door manufacturer and door model, the <strong>paint</strong> used on your garage door must have a light reflective value (LRV) of at least 50% to avoid voiding your warranty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most garage doors are made from <strong>aluminum</strong>, steel, vinyl, or wood. All of these materials are <strong>paint</strong>able, as long as you follow the correct process. However, only wooden garage doors are typically <strong>paint</strong>ed. Why is this? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If the door has not been primed in the past, you’ll need to apply at least one coat of specific metal primer to the entire door and the frame. Be sure to use the metal primer exactly as instructed. Let it dry thoroughly before <strong>paint</strong>ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Of course, <strong>paint</strong> adds aesthetic value to your home, but it does more than that. Paint protects and preserves the surface on which it is applied. Typically, garage doors made of metal have a very durable finish, right from the manufacturer. These finishes will long outlast any <strong>paint</strong> that could be applied, but there are situations when you should apply a new coat of <strong>paint</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>LRV is an abbreviation for Light Reflective Value. This rating describes the amount of light absorbed or reflected off a <strong>paint</strong>ed surface.
