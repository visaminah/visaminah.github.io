Behind my desk, on my clear leg white lacquered credenza, I placed clear Lucite trays to hold my files, magazine cuttings and latest tearsheets. The overall affect of these clear <strong>acrylic</strong> furnishings is one of organization, style and peace. Because the Lucite material is found in so many of my office pieces, the result is a serene and well <strong>design</strong>ed home office. By choosing from the Clear Home Design&rsquo;s Office selections, you too can create a home office worthy of your own magazine story. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For the <strong>acrylic</strong> flow technique you don’t need any previous drawing or painting skills.
