A small fraction of it comes from Michigan. - Source: Internet To gauge appropriate wetness, take a handful of peat moss and squeeze it. If this yields a drop or two of water, that’s perfect. If squeezing produces a water stream, add more peat moss until it passes the moisture test. - Source: Internet Yes, in two ways. One is using small quantities of peat. For example, mix it with potting soil for seed starting or container gardening. - Source: Internet Coconut fiber: Coconut fiber, called coir, is a byproduct of fiber processing and has become a favored alternative to peat moss over the past 20 years. India, Sri Lanka and Vietnam are centers of production. It has the same water holding and porosity of peat moss, though it is generally used as one ingredient in a mix. - Source: Internet fertilizing or feeding the soil is a waste of time unless it can hold on to the nutrients. Fibers absorb them and then release them slowly to the roots of your plants. Peat moss holds on to water; again because it is fibrous organic matter, it soaks with water and then releases it slowly. In fact, it can hold as much as 20 times of its weight in water. This quality, as well as its ability to retain nutrients, is helpful if your soil is sandy, which means that it does not hold on to moisture and nutrients. - Source: Internet It provides nooks and crannies where new, tender roots can grow. Peat moss also keeps humidity high, essential when plants have a new home. It also corrects the acidity of the soil and breaks down the consistency and texture of the soil, especially if it’s clay soil. - Source: Internet What you should know about peat moss is that it isn’t a renewable resource. In fact, it takes millennia for it to form. This is why mining peat moss is oftentimes surrounded by controversy. Even though this is a regulated activity, and only a small percent of the total amount of peat moss is open for harvest, some people are still concerned about it. - Source: Internet Peat moss has a natural ability to kill weed seeds and insects. When peat moss is added to the soil, it leaves no chance for mosquitoes and larvae to grow in your garden. This attribute can be very important if you want to avoid diseases such as malaria. - Source: Internet Coconut fiber comes in several forms — granules, pots, sheets, bricks, and bales. Whatever the type, you must soak the fibers before use.Additional names for coconut fiber are coco-peat, coir-peat, coir dust, coir fiber pith, and coco coir. - Source: Internet Non-renewable resource. As explained, the process of decomposing the peat moss take even thousands of years. So it’s really considered as non-renewable and not eco-friendly. That’s the main reasons that many environmental-aware growers are going away from it, and finding an alternative. - Source: Internet Peat moss can retain about 10x its weight in water. It then releases the water to plant roots as needed. This means less watering for you, saving you time, effort, and money. - Source: Internet The organisms that live in natural bogs are completely destroyed when peat moss is being cultivated or harvested from the bogs. Peat moss harvesting destroys local wildlife populations that live in the natural bogs. The process of draining peat moss from bogs releases carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, and this comes with serious environmental implications such as the destruction of the ozone layer. There has always been calls for bogs to be commercially grown to prevent further damage to the environment. - Source: Internet If you need to make your soil more substantial (e.g., in the case of sandy soil) and more acidic, peat humus might make a good choice. - Source: Internet Virtually all of the peat moss sold in the United States comes from the vast sphagnum moss bogs of Canada. Often mixed with a mineral named perlite, it is highly valued by horticulturists for its ability to retain moisture and oxygen without becoming waterlogged or heavy. It is generally sterile and naturally suppresses a fungal disease that can afflict seedlings, making it a natural choice for seed starting. - Source: Internet Peat moss is the main ingredient in many potting soils because it helps so much with drainage. Plants in containers often have problems with waterlogged soil, which peat moss helps prevent. Seed starting: Because it’s sterile, peat moss is one of the best seed-starting mediums. You can purchase small peat moss pellets to insert into the soil where you want to plant seeds. - Source: Internet Moreover, it takes a lot of millennia for the formation of peat moss to occur. Peat bogs also obtain less than one-millimeter depth annually. Due to this slow process, you can’t classify peat mosses as renewable and environmental resources. - Source: Internet Another significant drawback is that peat moss is not at all considered environmentally friendly, as it is a non-renewable resource that takes thousands of years to form. Additionally, according to the IUCN, the harvesting process of peat moss emits a lot of carbon into the air. In fact, it emits more than all other vegetation types in the world combined. - Source: Internet Peat moss sits well below live sphagnum. To reach the decayed material, harvesters must remove the sphagnum covering it. Then, they drain the bog and suction the peat with vacuum-type equipment. After harvesting, peat moss is dried, shredded, and chopped for consumer use. - Source: Internet Peatlands absorb carbon dioxide from the Earth’s atmosphere, markedly reducing air pollution. The live sphagnum presses against the peat below it, preventing carbon dioxide from escaping the bog. However, peat mining exposes the stored carbon dioxide, releasing it back into the atmosphere. - Source: Internet If you are new to gardening, you’ve probably heard of peat moss but don’t know a lot about it. Peat moss comes from decomposed sphagnum moss found underwater in peat bogs. Many gardeners add peat moss to their soil because it works wonders for some plants, but other gardeners avoid this common soil amendment like the plague. - Source: Internet because it has formed in an anaerobic environment and many bacteria need oxygen to live, it is free from pathogens that can harm the roots of your plants. Peat moss has long decomposition times; the fibers peat moss is made of decompose slowly, and because they have been “treated” underwater for a very, long time, they are even more difficult to break down. This means that it has a very long life in the ground. - Source: Internet Peat moss helps keep clay soil from drying up as easily as possible. The reason that is important is that you do not want the roots of your plants to get too dry. Using peat moss in clay soil helps to keep your plant moist. - Source: Internet Peat doesn’t have any nutrient content, unlike compost, animal manures, and other soil mixes. Therefore, it’s only good for consistency and water retention. Peat moss soil is never just peat moss. Mixing peat moss with soil is what creates these blends. If you’re growing plants in peat, you’ll always need some source of nutrients in addition to the moss. - Source: Internet Yes. Peat moss helps improve soil drainage and prevent soggy soil, which is great for succulents. 7. Is peat moss a fertilizer? - Source: Internet Peat moss and sphagnum moss differ in texture. Whereas peat moss is chopped, sphagnum fibers are fuzzy and long. Florists dress up potted plants by covering their topsoil with sphagnum. - Source: Internet Another one of the best peat moss uses is in soilless potting mixes. These are great for plants that don’t need a lot of nutrition to grow but do require air circulation and drainage. Most soils (even peat soils) host bugs, fungus, or bacteria. That’s why a soil-less mix is one of the best uses for peat moss. - Source: Internet Do you usually make your own compost? Adding some peat moss to it might help make it better. That’s because this compound is rich in carbon, and your compost needs carbon. Not to mention the fact that due to its ability to retain moisture, you won’t have to water the compost that often. For people who don’t have that much time to keep a constant eye on their compost, this is the perfect option. Just keep in mind that peat moss can be rather expensive, so adding it to compost might cost you more than you’re willing to invest in this DIY project. - Source: Internet Compost is inexpensive and readily available. Like peat moss, it helps the soil retain water and nutrients. It also adds nutrients, which gives it an advantage over peat moss. Coconut coir, aka coco coir: Coco coir is a byproduct of harvesting coconut fibers. It’s similar to peat moss in many ways: It retains moisture, loosens the soil, and takes a long time to break down. - Source: Internet If peat moss sounds too good to be true, that’s because it just might be. There are some things peat moss can’t do for your soil. Plus, many gardeners refuse to use it because peat moss mining is bad for the environment. - Source: Internet Peat moss helps retain moisture and nutrients for plant roots for sandy soil. If you intend to use it as a soil amendment, you should know that it changes soil pH levels. Ensure you measure and watch out if the pH level drifts too much by testing the soil pH. - Source: Internet You can correct the carbon to nitrogen ratio of your compost heap. When your compost heap smells a lot, it means that it has too much nitrogen. Peat moss has a fine texture and it is easy to mix it in to correct this. - Source: Internet under the pressure of water, peat moss becomes compact and thick, which means that it loses its aeration and absorption properties. This is remedied by mixing it with other media, especially perlite. Peat moss is poor in nutrients; it is not decomposing matter, which means that while you can use it to change the texture and properties of your soil, it is not the best choice if you have organic regeneration in mind. For example, earthworms are not attracted to peat moss, nor are many of the microorganisms that turn the soiled fertile. - Source: Internet Most of the growing materials are not clean. However, that’s not the case with peat moss. If you drop some wet moss, pick it up, get it dried or sweep it up. - Source: Internet – Make your own, or If you live in Arizona the compost from Arizona Worm Farm is great. If you use bagged, then a mix of several different types is best. 1 part peat moss * or washed coco coir - Source: Internet The fibers help the soil retain and release water. For this reason, peat moss balances sandy soil nicely. Sand quickly drains water from plant roots before they get a chance to drink. However, plants can easily draw water from peat, along with soil nutrients. - Source: Internet We’ve talked generally about how peat moss is created. Now let’s take a closer look. Sphagnum moss grows freely in peat bogs or wetland areas of cool-climate tundras and conifer forests. A look at the video posted in this article will give you an idea of just how lush this plant is. - Source: Internet This is organic material degraded by the action of moisture, oxygen, bacteria, and heat. Like peat moss, compost helps the soil retain water. It’s a rich source of plant nutrients. - Source: Internet This is where peat moss comes in, to serve as an amendment for clay-based or sandy soil. Peat moss tends to be quite fluffy, which means adding it to a sandy soil will create plenty of body. On the other hand, adding it to a clay soil will loosen it up, thanks to its lightweight consistency. This ensures the roots of your shrubs or trees will receive enough air to develop properly. - Source: Internet Peatlands store a third of the world’s soil carbon, and their harvesting and use releases carbon dioxide, the major greenhouse gas driving climate change. The biggest environmental risk from peatlands is if they catch fire, which happened spectacularly in 2015 in Indonesia on land cleared for plantations. Peatland fires account for up to 5 percent of human-caused carbon emissions, according to the United Nations, which last year launched a peatlands conservation initiative. - Source: Internet When soil becomes compacted, water and nutrients can’t get through to your plants’ roots. Your plants can die as a result. One way to solve this problem is lawn aeration. But with peat moss, your soil will be looser, and you won’t have to aerate as often. - Source: Internet In the 1940s, peat was recognized for its uses in gardening or horticulture. Gardeners started using it for their plants by that time. Presently, you can see peat moss being used as a soil amendment, mushroom casting, seed starting, and soilless mixture, among many others. - Source: Internet Most often, you’ll find peat moss sold in small quantities in bags. When in bulk, it usually comes in bales or bricks wrapped in plastic. Sometimes, the product label will read “sphagnum peat moss.” 3. Why is peat moss being banned? - Source: Internet Peat mining is controversial. Environmental watchdog organizations say that peat moss isn’t sustainable. However, harvesters maintain that it is renewable. - Source: Internet You also have to use it along with other nutrients to ensure that the soil, which is poor in nutrition, will not cause any damage to the plant structure. Aside from that, moss peat is incapable of attracting earthworms due to its lack of nutrition. It is crucial to attracting earthworms because they help in the soil aeration process. - Source: Internet Measure your soil’s pH. Before using peat moss, you should consider what you are growing and what your soil’s pH is. Because it is so acidic, it should only be used for acid-loving plants such as blueberries, or in soils that are naturally neutral or alkaline. - Source: Internet Castings are the waste products of farmed earthworms. Castings contain enzymes and minerals, providing crops with easily absorbed nutrients. Like peat moss, they enhance water retention, aerate the soil, and inhibit fungus. - Source: Internet In a wheelbarrow, measure out two parts of soil and one part peat moss. Thoroughly combine and spread over the raised bed. Then, mix to a 12-inch depth. - Source: Internet Scotland is also considered a home for peat moss and sphagnum moss. The reason is that around 23 percent of this country has peat covering it. Note, though, that the majority of the peat in Scotland is not commercialized but protected instead. - Source: Internet Peat moss is sphagnum moss that’s been dead and decomposing underwater for centuries. Through that decomposition process, it becomes useful for your soil. 2. Where can I find peat moss? - Source: Internet Sterility is a great quality in a seed starter. Seedlings are extremely vulnerable, and they need a clean, safe environment in which to establish themselves. Peat moss provides that environment. - Source: Internet It retains water, lightens soils, and adds better drainage. You can use it in place of peat moss as part of a seed starting or potting mix. It’s also a very renewable resource since it comes from the husks of coconuts. - Source: Internet One of the most effective and controversial materials to garden with is peat moss. Effective because it works well in tons of situations, and controversial because of how it is sourced. Many gardeners buy it on the regular without even knowing what it is or what it’s doing in their practice. - Source: Internet Another thing organic gardeners appreciate is all-natural sources. Not only is peat moss organic, but it’s also only one step removed from the plants in the peatlands it comes from. Bog moss is essentially organic matter used in soil mixes, and bulk peat moss is sold on its own too. Peat moss doesn’t have any chemicals in it either. It’s free of fungus, bacteria, harmful chemicals, and weed seeds. - Source: Internet So we’ve dedicated this piece to this interesting moss, what it is, and how to use it in the garden. We’ll also touch on why it has been looked down upon by gardeners who appreciate an ecologically sound practice. All this will help you as a gardener make the best possible decision about using it or an alternative. - Source: Internet The best way to transition from less sustainable peat pellets to a new way of starting seeds is to phase the plugs out gradually and double up. For example, gardeners wanting to start two tomato plants should start a few seeds in pellets and a few in the new medium the first time around until they learn the nuances of a new method. Finally, learning to compost is a highly sustainable alternative to peat as an outdoor soil amendment. - Source: Internet Some growers consider peat moss to be nutrient-poor. It doesn’t contain much nitrogen, potassium, or phosphorus, but it does have calcium and magnesium, which are essential nutrients for the growth of cannabis plants. Unlike other organic materials such as manure compost, peat moss is very poor in nutrients. - Source: Internet Peat moss prevents soil compaction. In dense soils, the particles are jammed together, making it hard for plant roots to breathe, drink, and grow. However, since peat moss is spongy, it loosens tight soils, such as those high in clay. As a result, air and water can circulate better, making roots less prone to rot and stunting. - Source: Internet In terms of its uses, one main aspect where you can use peat moss is as a form of soil amendment. It also works as a vital ingredient or component in potting soil. With its acid pH level, it is perfect for plants that love acid, including camellias and blueberries. - Source: Internet Many countries have strict rules when it comes to mining peat moss. For example, any peat harvested in Canada is carefully analyzed first whether it has any long-term effect on the environment. And it must be mined in sustainable and conservable ways. - Source: Internet it far exceeds the price of comparable mediums, like coconut coir. In fact, you are more likely to find it mixed in with other mediums already. Peat moss tends to compact over time; under the pressure of water, peat moss becomes compact and thick, which means that it loses its aeration and absorption properties. This is remedied by mixing it with other media, especially perlite. - Source: Internet For horticultural use, the extraction of peat requires the removal of a bog’s living surface to reach the partially decomposed layers beneath. It grows at a mere sixteenth of an inch a year, and its mining removes layers that take centuries to develop. “Peat is the best vegetative carbon sink we have on the planet,” Highland said. “Why dig it up?” - Source: Internet PittMoss has many of the properties of peat but without its ecological impact. For example, PittMoss enhances soil aeration, water retention, and nutrient availability. Regarding texture, it’s fluffy, lightweight, and drains well. - Source: Internet If you are building a brand new garden, use 1/3 topsoil, 1/3 compost and 1/3 peat moss to create a loose, well drained, healthy soil base for your backyard vegetable garden. If you are growing in pots/containers, use 2/3 high quality soil mix (I like to stick with ProMix or Sunshine Mix - also labelled Sungro. I also use this mix to start my indoor plants.) and 1/3 compost. This soil mix already contains peat moss so there is no need to add that. - Source: Internet Peat was dried and was used as a source of fuel in some countries for centuries. Because, like any fossil fuels, it is rich in carbon. It was only till the 1940s that peat has a place in horticulture. - Source: Internet Furthermore, coir supplies plants with minerals. Coir also differs from peat by being denser, costlier, and less acidic. Its pH ranges between 6.0 and 6.7, close to neutral. - Source: Internet If your soil is high in sand or clay, adding peat will make it suitable for your crops. To do this, spread peat moss over your plot in a 3-inch layer. Then, mix it to a 12-inch depth until evenly distributed. - Source: Internet Peat was dried and used as a source of fuel in some countries for centuries. This is because it’s rich in carbon dioxide, just like other fossil fuels. It was until the 1940s that peat had a place in horticulture. Today, it’s used as a soil amendment, soilless mix, seed starting, and mushroom casting. - Source: Internet If you’re somewhat familiar with the basics of gardening, then you’ve probably already heard of peat moss. That’s because it has multiple uses in the garden, and it’s quite sought after by many people who want to provide their plants with the best of care. If you don’t know what peat moss is and how you can use it in the garden, we’re here to clear that up for you. - Source: Internet First, “sphagnum moss” refers to a living plant. There are 120 species of this type of moss plant. Sphagnum moss is native to many countries across the globe, but it is especially prevalent in the Northern Hemisphere. “Peat moss” is not alive; it’s long dead. - Source: Internet When humans mine peat bogs for peat moss, they take away from that carbon sink effect. And since peat bogs gain less than a millimeter in depth every year, they’re considered a non-renewable resource. That means once we mine the last of them, they’re gone (at least for several human generations). - Source: Internet Peat moss has a lightweight and spongy texture. It has the uncanny ability to hold on to air and moisture while allowing excess water to drain freely. It’s generally pest and disease free. And it’s inexpensive. - Source: Internet Note that you cannot use peat moss dry, as it will repel water. Therefore, wet it well beforehand. To do this, pour the amount you need in a wheelbarrow or large bucket. - Source: Internet Peat Moss: This may come as a surprise. Peat moss is, however, not a sustainable material. It takes hundreds of years for peat to develop in peat bogs. - Source: Internet The use of peat moss started a long time ago. For several centuries, many used peat in dried form as a main source of fuel. It works as a fuel as it has high carbon content similar to other fossil fuels. - Source: Internet Peat moss is a soil amendment that is a dark-brown fibrous material used as a planting medium for growing plants. Peat moss is naturally made or formed after 1,000 years and harvested from peat bogs. There’s much debate about its environmental safety since it’s not sustainable and gives off carbon dioxide when harvested. - Source: Internet Peat moss is probably a familiar term if you’ve ever browsed through a garden centre, but you might be unsure of how and why it’s used. Many potting soils actually come with a bit of peat moss already mixed in, but you can also buy it on its own. Mixing peat into your soil can offer major benefits, but there are some important things to keep in mind before you start adding fistfuls of peat into all your plant containers! - Source: Internet Peat moss is available in several grades, with different particle sizes. The larger the particles are, the more expensive it is. Use peat moss as a soil amendment to lighten heavy soils and increase water retention. For clay and heavy soils that get compact easily, it softens the soil structure and improves the drainage. - Source: Internet For this purpose, use the peat moss alone or in a mixture with some soils. You can also remove the hassle by getting the peat pellets sold on the market. Many people also prefer a soilless mix of peat moss, perlite, coconut coir, and others in different amounts. This prevents diseases, fungi, bacteria, weed seeds, and other bad things commonly found in the soil. - Source: Internet But peat moss has other uses, as well. Outdoors, it can be tilled into a planting bed where the soil is not sufficiently friable. Peat moss will lighten up the soil in your garden, which may have become compacted over the years, resulting in inadequate drainage. - Source: Internet Peat moss is a material that grows on top of bogs, usually here in Canada. It’s used as a natural potting medium because its loose, spongy texture has amazing moisture retention for plants, as well as many other benefits. The thing is, it takes thousands of years for peat moss to develop, so it isn’t exactly an easily renewable resource. However, by using it sparingly as an additive to soils, we can still reap all the benefits without having to use that much. - Source: Internet Although it has a similar name, sphagnum moss is much different than peat moss. It isn’t decomposed and is made up of long, fibrous strands. It’s often used to line hanging baskets like this one. - Source: Internet Why do you think peat moss is particularly beneficial to vegetable gardens? Well, it’s because they are the ones most likely to suffer due to either extremely wet conditions or extremely hot weather. These environment characteristics can decrease vegetable production and also affect the quality of the vegetables. Adding peat moss to your vegetable garden can successfully prevent that. The only thing you have to keep an eye on is not adding too much of it. This might change the pH of the soil, which can be more bad news for your garden. - Source: Internet Sphagnum peat moss is different from sphagnum moss, though. The latter actually consists of fibrous and long strands of the plant material. This sphagnum moss is what most florists used as a lining for wire baskets. They also use the sphagnum moss to provide potted plants with a more decorative and unique touch. - Source: Internet For the last 12 years, Canadian peat producers have employed a new practice to facilitate bog restoration. This entails letting the wetlands re-flood and planting moss grafts. As the sphagnum grows, its top layer is replenished within five years. Restoring ecological balance can take 15 to 25 years. - Source: Internet again because it is fibrous organic matter, it soaks with water and then releases it slowly. In fact, it can hold as much as 20 times of its weight in water. This quality, as well as its ability to retain nutrients, is helpful if your soil is sandy, which means that it does not hold on to moisture and nutrients. Peat moss can hold on to air; roots need to breathe as well as feed and drink and in the pores and spaces within the fibers of peat moss, air can find a good place to hide. - Source: Internet One of the most useful roles of peat moss is in seed starting because this material is very sterile. Its antiseptic qualities naturally prevent bacteria and fungi from the seeds. It also gives excellent drainage, good aeration, fine texture, and low fertile, making it very ideal for germination. - Source: Internet You’ll easily find organic peat. You may come across coco-peat, but this is another name for coconut fiber. Don’t make the mistake of buying sphagnum moss or spag moss, which are too coarse for gardening. - Source: Internet – Boasts exceptional water retention and aeration qualities. Since it’s a product derived from coconut fibers – it’s much easier (and faster) to create compared to peat-based gardening products. Worm castings – Nightcrawlers and other earthworms have excellent reputations for improving the aeration of garden soil, and their excrement also helps to fertilize and recycles nutrients – how can you lose? - Source: Internet —It won’t add any nutrients to the soil as it breaks down, which is one of the main appeals of organic mulch. 5. What’s the ratio for mixing peat moss with soil? - Source: Internet Since the 1950s, sphagnum peat moss has been a common ingredient in potting soils sold in the United States. It is typically mixed with white specks of perlite, a mineral that is expanded by heating. (Wendy Galietta/The Washington Post) - Source: Internet The United Kingdom’s government will ban the use of peat moss for home gardeners beginning in 2024 in an effort to preserve the country’s peatlands. According to the UK’s Environment Secretary George Eustice, the ban is happening because “Peatlands are our biggest terrestrial carbon store and home to some of our rarest species.” - Source: Internet Since peat moss is very dry, it’s not 100% suitable for soil. It can be combined with other organic materials to improve the water retention capacity of your growing medium. When starting seeds with peat moss alone, ensure they get enough moisture. It’s also good to mix it with soils and some other soilless media. - Source: Internet Environmental concerns– The actual harvesting process for peat moss is also under scrutiny. The bogs are drained of surface water, and layers of native vegetation are removed to get at the peat. Once it dries out enough, peat moss is essentially vacuumed up at rates of about 100 acres per day. - Source: Internet Since clay soil has a pH between eight and ten, adding peat moss helps balance out the levels. Peat moss has a lower pH. When you mix peat moss into clay soil by breaking up the ground and adding it in, the clay soil will not be as challenging to utilize. - Source: Internet It does not also have harmful weed seeds or microorganisms that are often present in poorly processed compost. Also, peat moss is a crucial component in a lot of seed starting mediums and soils. It can hold a lot of moisture then release it to roots whenever needed. - Source: Internet Then the top layer of the vast sphagnum patch is removed and relocated to other areas of the bog which have not been disturbed, where it can thrive. The decayed, dried sphagnum moss is allowed to lay in the sun for 2 to 3 days where it dries. It’s then scraped up with the harvester and sucked into a receptacle. Then it’s moved to a factory for processing and packaging. - Source: Internet Peat moss is also used to grow plants that prefer soil with low pHs, such as rhododendrons, gardenias, heathers, tomatoes, Pieris, azaleas, and camellias. These plants need a peat moss mixture for their acidic soil. When combined with the correct potting mix, these plants enjoy having an environment where they can take up essential nutrients from the soil and conserve water. - Source: Internet Peat moss is a soil amendment that is harvested from peat bogs. Many of these peat bogs are found in wet areas of Canada. Peat bogs are formed over a long period as organic materials partially decompose. - Source: Internet Of the hot-button issues seen by Sally McCabe, who manages educational issues for the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, peat moss concerns pale next to others. “The biggest is probably Roundup,” she said, referring to the controversial herbicide. She counsels members to minimize peat moss use. “I always push the renewable stuff, particularly locally sourced,” she said. - Source: Internet Can you mix peat moss with soil? Absolutely. Just like compost, it’s a great addition to garden soil, as well as most kinds of soil. Soil amendments with these materials provide water retention and aeration that can help house plants grow more easily. - Source: Internet It is helpful to add both peat moss and compost. The reason people do this because peat moss does not decay very quickly at all; therefore, clay soil doesn’t get the nutrients from peat moss. Adding compost also adds more nutrition to the ground. - Source: Internet There are currently no plans to ban or restrict the use of peat moss in the United States (or anywhere else other than the UK, based on our research). 4. Can I use peat moss as mulch? - Source: Internet The vast peatlands in Canada, for example, developed 10,000 years ago, after the last glacial period. During this era, megafauna like mammoths and sabre-toothed cats still roamed the Earth. Humans were just starting to get the hang of farming wheat and barley. - Source: Internet To start plants from seed, consider buying peat pots. Once the seedlings have sturdy stems and leaves, put the containers directly in your garden. Be sure to cover the rims completely with soil. Otherwise, the peat will draw moisture from the seedling roots and surrounding earth. - Source: Internet Some alternates to peat moss are composted bark (preferably made from hardwoods), Coir which is coconut fiber and rice hulls. While rice hulls are pretty much on size, it is best if you choose coarser versions of composted bark and coir. Like peat moss, larger fibers will take longer to break down and will give more porosity to your soil. - Source: Internet Sphagnum peat moss is used in soilless potting mixes. So if you have started plants indoors from seed, you have likely already dealt with peat moss. A soilless potting mix is much better to use for starting seeds than regular soil for the following reasons: - Source: Internet Meanwhile, sphagnum moss is a plant grown on the surface layer above of the peatland, soil or a swamp. It thrives in cold and wet weather. As time goes by, the old parts sink into the lower layer. The process of decomposition takes place very slowly in the oxygenless layer. But it is patient, and over a long period of millennials, a thick layer of dead homogeneous material named peat moss is formed. - Source: Internet Peat moss has been a top growing medium, especially for starting seeds, since the 1960s. Compressed pellets of peat moss surrounded by a thin fiber bag, like those made by Jiffy, offer a convenient, mess-free, and effective method for starting plants from seed to grow in a vegetable garden or flower beds. But peat is not a sustainable product in the long run, and harvesting the material for horticultural use has come under fire because of declining peatlands. - Source: Internet If you want to make clay soil loamy, add more peat moss than usual. For this result, the ratio of peat moss to clay soil needs to be more than half and half. Adding extra peat moss to your clay soil will make it loamier. - Source: Internet Due to its great qualities as a seed starting mix, you can also use peat moss in container gardening. It keeps the seeds moist and provides them with nutrients. What you must remember is that in the case of container gardening, you’re going to have to pay more attention to how much soil, fertilizer, and compost you add. - Source: Internet Simplify matters with container gardening and a soil-less medium. One option is using PittMoss exclusively. Or, create a mix of peat moss, coco coir, and earthworm castings. - Source: Internet This makes peat moss a very unique garden material because it forms without the presence of oxygen. (Compost, for example, is broken down in the presence of oxygen and other elements.) - Source: Internet John has nice loam soil in his garden. Yes, I know the rest of us are jealous. John’s raised garden bed mix is about 1/3 native soil, 1/3 well-aged compost, and 1/3 peat moss measured by volume. Plus plant food, and for the root veggies perlite is added. - Source: Internet If you decide peat moss soil is right for your garden, mix it at a ratio of 2 parts soil to 1 part peat moss. 6. Do succulents like peat moss? - Source: Internet can meet similar goals using repurposed plant-derived waste products, as an alternative to peat. Compost and worm castings are just as good of a source of organic matter within a potting mix. Use sphagnum peat moss for your specialized gardening needs, and grow organic for life! - Source: Internet Still, peat moss is not perfect. It’s more acidic than some alternative media, and if the expanded pellets dry out completely, it is tough to bring them back to a fully moistened state. Plus, peat plugs are too small to sustain seedlings until they’re ready to plant, so eventually the seedlings must be potted up. Pellets can cost more than other methods, but they offer the convenience of a quick and clean seed-sowing experience, especially when sold with a tray and lid. - Source: Internet Even though peat moss absorbs water well, it doesn’t compact, unlike soil. Compaction makes it hard to create space for the water and air to pass through. But if you add peat moss to any compact material, you’ll have solved the compaction problem and made the growing mix drain better. - Source: Internet The moss will release the water to maintain the wetland as well. This is why peat moss is such an essential addition to gardeners’ soil. Much of what we do is figure out the best possible ways to carry out good water retention in the garden. Peat moss bogs and in turn peaty soil are the main sources of moisture retention for many. That’s why it’s commonly used in potting soil, and to line wire baskets. - Source: Internet Let’s start with the environmental concerns. On the whole, peat is a non-renewable resource. The fact that it outperforms other materials in the garden is why it was overharvested for a long time with little thought about how using moss for plants was contributing to ecological decline. - Source: Internet A: Untreated moss may contain fungi that can cause illness. Most of those you find in stores are well-treated. This is not a concern for most gardeners. - Source: Internet Both have similar applications, but in general, the decayed form of peat moss is much more acidic than the one that still looks plant-like. Typically, the only peat you’ll find at the garden center is the lower, more decomposed material. It takes genuine work to find the dried sphagnum moss; typically, it’s only through pet stores or specialty reptile shops that you’ll find good quantities of it. - Source: Internet Coco coir is a byproduct of harvesting coconut fibers. It’s similar to peat moss in many ways: It retains moisture, loosens the soil, and takes a long time to break down. Pine bark: Finely ground pine bark in your soil prevents it from becoming compacted and helps retain moisture. For a soil amendment, you want pine bark soil conditioner, not pine bark nuggets, which are used for mulch. - Source: Internet The conditions of a peat bog are harsher than most. It is very wet and acidic, with low levels of oxygen and nutrients in the water column or substrate. Despite this, it is home to many rare plants and animals that are highly specialized to thrive in such an environment. - Source: Internet Expensive. Even though peat moss is not the most expensive growing material, it is also not cheap. Especially if you use peat moss in bulk and price is an issue, a better alternative is compost. - Source: Internet In planning your food garden, if your soil is alkaline, consider adding peat moss. If the pH is fine, but the ground is too powdery or compact, amend it with peat alternatives. Organic possibilities are compost, coconut fiber, PittMoss, and earthworm castings. - Source: Internet To this day, the cycle of moss growth and decay continues. Live sphagnum floats above the dead peat, ranging up to 10 feet in depth. Peat bogs are also called peatlands. - Source: Internet Don’t confuse sphagnum peat moss with sphagnum moss, even if their names are similar. Sphagnum moss refers to the plant material harvested when still alive and growing above water. The end product is the light, fibrous material often used to decorate line wire baskets. - Source: Internet For general soil improvement, I use mixtures of compost and leaf mold, either homemade or commercially produced. This meshes with the Royal Horticultural Society’s advice. “We believe that using peat for soil incorporation and ground mulching is unnecessary and unacceptable,” spokesman Garfield Myrie wrote in response to an email. - Source: Internet This is why it is important to test your clay soil if you add peat moss to it. The pH of peat moss should be between 3 and 4.5. - Source: Internet Some are bagged separately, and some are combined with decayed organic materials to be incorporated into potting soils sold worldwide. Some are made into peat pellets, and some are sold as simply peat moss. Then it hits the shelves, where you’ve likely seen and bought it. - Source: Internet To save bog ecosystems from extinction, government agencies regulate peat mining. For example, Canada limits extraction to .016 percent of its bog reserves. Canadian harvesters can only access one in 6,000 acres at any given time. - Source: Internet Dig a network of ditches along the peatland to drain the water. Second, remove the native vegetation to get the peat exposed. Third, level the harvest to prevent drainage of the surface runoff. Fourth, harrow the top layer to speed up the drying process of peats. Fifth, suck up the dry peat layer using a large vacuum harvester. - Source: Internet The most commonly used type of peat moss is sphagnum peat moss. Sphagnum peat moss has a high ability to absorb moisture and holds ten times its dry weight in water. After it’s harvested and dried, sphagnum peat moss is light in color, making it retain 10-12 times its weight in water. - Source: Internet This guide covers everything from the types of peat moss available to how much water each type holds. We’ll cover everything from planting trees and shrubs with peat moss as a potting medium or using it as alternative mulch material in vegetable gardens. You’ll also find out which kinds of plants grow best when grown directly in peat moss without any additional soil mixed into the mix. Let’s get started! - Source: Internet Peat moss is not a natural substance. It is the partially decayed remains of plants that have been harvested from peat bogs and mires, an ecosystem formed by the incomplete decomposition of organic matter in wetlands. Peat bogs are fragile habitats that take thousands of years to form. - Source: Internet Sterile One of the best features of peat moss is its sterility. It doesn’t have any bacteria, fungus, harmful chemicals, and no weed seeds. This makes the material perfect for seedlings, which are quite vulnerable to the surrounding environment. - Source: Internet The annual rate of sphagnum growth is barely measurable — less than one millimeter or about 1/16 inch per year. For a bog to naturally generate one meter of peat moss, it can take 100 years. However, peat harvesters have discovered ways to expedite moss regeneration. - Source: Internet Pretty much every store you go to will have some form of peat moss available, whether it be a potting mix, peat moss, or specifically sphagnum peat moss, you’ll have no trouble locating a source. So many growers rely on this plant for soilless mixes, starting seeds, and soil amendment and peat moss has been on the market for a long time. Therefore, it’s reliable. - Source: Internet In case you drop a few wet mosses, the only things you have to do are picking it up, sweeping it, or drying it. In terms of sterility, peat moss also has a big advantage. The reason is that it does not contain any fungus, weed seed, harmful chemicals, and bacteria. - Source: Internet Peat moss comes from your flower pot or garden from wetlands or bogs. It’s not decomposed material because the surface of the blogs doesn’t allow oxygen and air to filter underground. لعبة قمار بوكر This makes the fibers of the sphagnum moss remain intact. - Source: Internet Alternatively, mix your own seed medium. One way is combining peat and equal parts vermiculite and perlite, volcanic materials that aerate and drain soil. For this purpose, buy fine-textured peat, encouraging the growth of roots and tender shoots. Here’s detailed information on using peat to start seedlings. - Source: Internet It is also a big help in seed starting due to its sterile nature. Peat moss has antiseptic qualities that prevent fungi and bacteria from seeds. Moreover, it can provide excellent aeration and drainage as well as fine texture, which contributes to good germination. - Source: Internet Peat moss isn’t better or worse than soil; it’s different. It’s soilless but is often added to soil to lighten, aerate, and help retain moisture. Although it’s great for keeping moisture and aerating the soil, peat moss is not often used for lawns since its acidity hinders grass growth and can kill earthworms. However, adding peat moss to your soil is excellent if you have acid-loving plants. - Source: Internet Peat moss has a pH of 4.9 to 6.5, slightly acidic. This makes it better for soil mix because the acidity helps break down other compounds in the soil. This also makes it a good corrector, especially with plants that cannot stand alkaline soil. - Source: Internet The term peat moss most often refers to the lower levels of peat found in a peat bog. Sphagnum peat moss is the plant from which the peat moss we use for gardens is derived, but most of the peat we like to use is the long-decayed form that collects deeper in the bog layers. Over time, it becomes packed down, compressed, and decays into a lovely spongy mass. The lower levels may also contain other decomposed organic material, like other rotted plants. - Source: Internet Black peat is harvested differently than sphagnum peat moss in a way that preserves the living plant. It’s cut from Sphagnum bogs in Canada and is probably black because of its high carbon content. It requires more processing before it’s sold but has less dust and fewer contaminants than brown peat moss. - Source: Internet No. Peat moss can help your soil retain nutrients and encourage your plants to grow healthier, but it barely contains any nutrients on its own. 8. Should you use peat moss in your garden? - Source: Internet A peat bog is a type of wetland, a low-lying, flooded landmass, containing saturated soils and aquatic plants. Originally, peat bogs evolved from lakes. Over thousands of years, sphagnum moss overgrew the lakes. As the surface vegetation thickened, the lower layers gradually died and decomposed, leaving brown, spongy peat. - Source: Internet Sand has very coarse particles that do not release nutrients to plants easily. It does not change the pH of your soil, but it also doesn’t hold nutrients well, so adding sand on top of a peat moss/vermiculite mix is not ideal. Sand may be preferable if you are planting trees or other plants that don’t need consistent nutrients. - Source: Internet Peat moss is more expensive than composting. Although the cost is worth it in the long run, this can be a disadvantage for some people. Mining peat is not great for the environment as it is not a renewable resource. - Source: Internet Peat moss soaks up water much better than clay soil. The way that works is the peat moss alters the texture of the clay soil, giving it the ability to aerate better. Peat moss causes the clay soil to retain moisture better as well. - Source: Internet Peat moss comes from peat bogs, many of which are found in the wetland areas of Canada. Peat bogs are formed, over the course of very long periods of time, as organic materials partially decompose. Because of the water in these bogs, anaerobic conditions are maintained. Anareobic conditions slow down full decomposition. The result is that the peat moss is preserved almost indefinitely. - Source: Internet When it comes to the uses of peat moss, seed-starting is one of the places where it shines. Mix peat with perlite and vermiculite and you have a great seed starting mix that is also soil-less. This mixture provides seeds with the right amount of drainage and aeration that will help plant roots grow strong and healthy. Add a little compost to feed plant roots some nutrients too! - Source: Internet Peat moss can hold several times its weight in water. It helps soil retain moisture longer. What does that mean for you? You don’t have to water your plants as often, and they’ll still have all the water they need. - Source: Internet As mentioned earlier, peat moss commonly serves as a great soil amendment for plants that love acid. However, there are instances when it becomes too acidic for some plant species. In that case, it may be necessary to add some garden lime into the planting bed as a means of increasing the pH level of the soil. - Source: Internet Compost: Compost is inexpensive and readily available. Like peat moss, it helps the soil retain water and nutrients. It also adds nutrients, which gives it an advantage over peat moss. - Source: Internet If your plants thrive better in alkaline soil, though, then it is better to pick compost. The good thing about peat moss is that it does not readily break down or compact. This means that even a single application can be expected to last for a few years. - Source: Internet Be wary of how much peat moss you use. Using too much or too little will not result in the same effects. If you use too much peat moss, your clay soil will not be able to drain correctly, so measure it before adding it in. - Source: Internet Increased use of peat in soilless methods like hydroponics has led to more sales of the medium for its water-retaining properties. The number of home vegetable garden growers is on the rise, as is the number of cannabis growers worldwide relying on peat moss. Production of peat in Canada alone averaged more than 1.34 million tons a year from 2014 to 2018. - Source: Internet Peat moss is often used as a base layer to germinate and grow plants like vegetables and flowers. It provides aeration to the root zone, and it’s very easy to use for newcomers in hydroponics. When using peat moss for seed starting, you also need special trays with drain holes on the bottom because if you don’t, the peat moss will expand and block the water flow out of your seedling flat. - Source: Internet The majority of peat moss actually have a low pH level, an average range of 3.5 to 6. This still depends on where the mining of the peat moss took place. With that, it is a great choice for plants that crave acid, including blueberries and strawberries. - Source: Internet In terms of benefits, peat moss has quite a few that we’ve already mentioned. From improving drainage and aeration to providing a sterile environment for sprouting seeds, peat moss is incredibly versatile and you’re bound to find at least one way to use it in your garden. According to The Spruce, it’s also relatively inexpensive, especially when compared to other soil amendments, and is readily available in stores throughout the U.S. - Source: Internet Gardeners who already have peat pellets handy should use them if they like how they work. Coconut coir pellets offer similar convenience and a more eco-friendly approach for starting seeds. A sterile potting mix made for seed starting offers the best results for most growers, but it also requires investing in a tray and new (or cleaned) small plastic or biodegradable pots or a soil block maker for those who want to start a large quantity of seeds and avoid use of pots. Filling a grow tray or pots directly with soil is an inexpensive approach for many gardeners, but can get messy. - Source: Internet Because of the cellular structure of sphagnum moss, peat moss is an excellent resource for water retentive properties. Sphagnum moss has two kinds of cells: those that assist in photosynthesis and those barrel-shaped cells that retain water. Both of these are necessary for thriving peatland, as much of the main source of nutrition for sphagnum is in the water and decayed moss below. - Source: Internet Perlite is organic as well, though, of course, the quarrying uses fossil fuel. It is also inert, like peat moss, which means that it can hold on to nutrients for long, but it does not provide any itself. It is readily available as well, which is why it is a favorite with gardeners all over the world. - Source: Internet Acidic Most of peat moss low in pH from 3.5 to 6 on average depending on the source of the peat moss is mined. It is very suitable for acid-craving plants such as strawberries, blueberries. - Source: Internet Yes, you heard that right, you can also use peat moss for lawn care. If you’re struggling with an unhealthy lawn, this compound might help it regain its lush and healthy appearance. It serves as a soil conditioner that encourages grass to grow. Like in the case of transplanted shrubs, as well as trees and potted plants, the roots of the grass will receive plenty of air, which will encourage a healthy moisture level. - Source: Internet For an effective compost recipe, add 4 parts compost to one part peat moss. Every two weeks, you should toss the pile and add some more peat moss in case it emanates a strong odor. This will tone down the smell. - Source: Internet If you are looking for an organic material to improve the content of your soil, using peat moss is a good option. It comes from bogs and is fully natural. The best part is that it’s now harvested at its optimal stage, further adding that this is an organic ingredient. Also, quarrying and transportation do burn a lot of fossil fuels, so if it’s produced organically, it’s not harvested and delivered organically. قوانين لعبة الروليت - Source: Internet There are many recipes for a great seed starting mix. The ingredients you decide to use depend on what you prefer. For example, you could choose not to use soil and replace it with peat moss. Then, you can add equal parts vermiculite or perlite, plus some fertilizer and lime. These last two ingredients will lower the pH and provide your seeds with food. - Source: Internet Finely ground pine bark in your soil prevents it from becoming compacted and helps retain moisture. For a soil amendment, you want pine bark soil conditioner, not pine bark nuggets, which are used for mulch. PittMoss: PittMoss is a locally sourced, eco-friendly brand of potting mix and soil conditioner made of recycled paper. This product was designed to replace peat moss (thus the clever name), and it has many of the same effects on soil. - Source: Internet Did you know that peat moss can defeat your soil’s ability to take in moisture? Ironically, it’s often recommended for its water holding ability. It can aid water retention, but once peat moss dries out, it is difficult to re-hydrate. Have you ever watered a dried out container, but the water just rolled off the surface? Often, that’s due to peat moss in the container soil. - Source: Internet Compost is cheaper than peat moss and fully sustainable in that you can easily make your own. On the other hand, compost won’t last long like peat moss, and you’ll have to add compost regularly. And lastly, compost will compact faster and easier than peat moss, but to have a comparable effect, you can add sand, shells, and eggshells to the soil to improve its texture. - Source: Internet One of the best things to happen in the peat world in recent years is efforts toward making peat a renewable resource. Through organizations like the International Peat Society, ethical and ecologically sensitive harvesting has been put into practice. Living plant material is relocated to make extraction more ecological. They have developed initiatives to mitigate the conflicting interests of land protectors, conservationists, and peat producers. - Source: Internet If you are into gardening, then peat moss is a term that you may have heard multiple times. It refers to a common medium designed for use in planting seedlings that promote healthy growth. Let’s learn more about this gardening staple/material called peat moss through this article. - Source: Internet The argument is convincing to horticultural growing media producers such as Karl Hammer, who uses Canadian peat moss in the mixes he makes for commercial greenhouse growers and others. “Obviously, it’s a resource that has to be used respectfully, but I don’t see it going away,” said Hammer, president of Vermont Compost Co. “We should focus on using less gasoline, not less peat.” - Source: Internet The color of peat humus is dark brown to black. Unlike peat moss, it is a heavy substrate with a low water-holding capacity. However, it too has low pH (4-8, although acidic is more common), plus contains a small amount of nitrogen – 2.5 – 3 percent. - Source: Internet Does not compact Even though peat moss absorbs water well, it does not compact, unlike soil. The problem with compaction is that it makes it hard to create any space for the water and the air to pass through. By introducing peat moss to any compact material, the compaction problem is solved and makes the growing mix drain better. - Source: Internet Of the 280 million acres of peatlands, only 0.03% may be harvested from virgin bogs. The peat mining industry is also tasked with restoring the peatlands by re-introducing plant species and re-establishing the water table. - Source: Internet Peat moss is not toxic as long as you take precautions. Be careful when working with it. When working with peat moss, it is best to use gloves to be safe. - Source: Internet Another one of the environmental concerns is that removing plants in bogs to access sphagnum moss contributes to global warming. The vast majority of plants in peat bogs sequester carbon dioxide. When all the plants are removed, the decomposition process peat goes through releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Top that off with the fossil fuels used to power the harvesters, and you may be able to see where the concerns lie. - Source: Internet A peat definition is in order! How did this material gardeners spring for at the local nursery go from its natural source to a plastic bag? Peat moss comes from sphagnum moss, harvested from peat bogs in the Northern Hemisphere. The moss is then decayed and dried in the peatland, meaning it is allowed to lie exposed to the sun. What results is a dark brown fibrous material that is excellent for gardening. - Source: Internet Peat moss is one of the most expensive soil amendments in the market for those that want to use it in improving their gardens. Most countries do not have peat bogs for extracting peat moss, and the costs tend to be high in areas that do not have peat bogs as the shipping costs are included. It is very expensive to amend an entire bed or garden with peat moss, and that is why only a smaller amount is normally used. This, therefore, means that peat becomes a very costly choice especially when one wants to amend an entire garden. - Source: Internet The peat bog is a product of numerous decaying plants, and is possible that the decomposing material may still have some diseases from the original plants. Extracting peat moss from a diseased portion means the pathogens will be automatically transferred to your garden. It is easy for pathogens in peat moss to move easily to the roots as the substance retains a lot of water after extraction. The diseases can cause massive damage to the crop without anyone realizing the exact cause of the damage. - Source: Internet On average, peat moss only grows by 0.02 inches (which is only 0.5 millimeters) every year. It is therefore, a very, very slow process. - Source: Internet Understanding what makes perfect soil will get you well on your way to having the best garden ever. Regardless of your current soil texture, structure or tilth, you can change what you already have. Call it a soil makeover. By adding organic material like compost, humus, composted cow manure, leaf mulch, peat moss, etc. – and a bit of persistence – you can greatly improve any soil. - Source: Internet Although sometimes referred to as peat, peat moss and peat are not the same things. Peat moss is one of the products harvested from peat bogs. Other types of peat moss come from the partial decomposition of other organic materials. If you know how to make compost then you must know this type of peat moss. The moss in peat moss refers to sphagnum moss. - Source: Internet Peat producers make a persuasive argument that they are harvesting sustainably. (Canadian environmental groups I contacted had no position on peat moss.) - Source: Internet You probably wonder how much peat moss you should add to clay soil. Look no further. We have researched all about adding peat moss to clay soil, and we have the answers for you. Let’s discuss! - Source: Internet As an alternative to peat moss, biochar is a really good option. It improves soil structure and water retention. When mixed in with your garden soil, it’s long lasting and will take a very long time to degrade. - Source: Internet Cleanliness You will love this characteristic the most if you know that lots of growing materials, especially organic ones are not really clean. With peat moss, you’ll find it easy to work with. And if you happen to drop some wet mosses, just pick it up, get it dried, or sweep it up. - Source: Internet Peat moss is an excellent soil amendment for your acid-loving plants and vegetable gardens. There are approximately 12,000 species of moss, but it’s only the 380 species of sphagnum moss that create peat. Bogs and fens form where Canadian sphagnum grows because both living and dead moss absorb and store water. As it grows, it spreads onto drier areas and turns those into bogs as well. - Source: Internet Highland is unswayed. “There are many ways to argue what’s sustainable,” he said. “Any forest is sustainable if you plant more trees,” but the original old growth trees are gone, he said. A mined peat bog “is never going to return to its former self,” he said. - Source: Internet – For small applications, the cost of peat moss isn’t likely to dent your wallet very much. However, any large scale use of it (like amending a whole garden area) can get pretty expensive. Acidity – You’ve probably noticed that this is listed in the ‘pros’ section as well. That’s because the acidity of peat moss can be either a positive or a negative depending on what you’re using it for. In this case, if you grow plants that need a neutral or alkaline soil, the acidity of peat moss is a drawback. - Source: Internet Before they ship peat moss to stores, producers have to sterilize it. Because peat moss is completely sterile, it’s free of bacteria, fungi, and weed seeds that could harm your plants. Other organic matter (compost, for example) carries the risk of contaminating your soil with these pathogens. - Source: Internet Aside from the soilless potting mix, you can also use peat moss outdoors. You can till it to develop a planting or garden bed in case soil is not adequately friable. It also makes your garden soil lighter, thereby improving drainage and preventing compaction. - Source: Internet PittMoss is a locally sourced, eco-friendly brand of potting mix and soil conditioner made of recycled paper. This product was designed to replace peat moss (thus the clever name), and it has many of the same effects on soil. Worm castings: Worm castings (sometimes called vermicast) come from earthworms. They improve soil texture and add nutrients as a fertilizer. - Source: Internet Because it’s sterile, peat moss is one of the best seed-starting mediums. You can purchase small peat moss pellets to insert into the soil where you want to plant seeds. Hydroponic growing: In hydroponic growing (aka soilless growing), you have to use a growing medium other than soil to support the roots of the plants. Peat moss mixed with perlite or vermiculite is a common choice because it holds water and nutrients but still has good drainage. - Source: Internet Horse Manure: It bears repeating. If tempted to use horse manure, be sure to check out the link for the bioassay test. That little bit of time could save you years of grief. - Source: Internet Using peat moss to improve soil conditions has the advantage that it lasts long (a decade, depending on how much you add, the quality, the soil, crop etc.) On the other hand, peat is mainly corrective and not regenerative. The best way to change your soil quality permanently is through regenerative techniques. - Source: Internet When you replant something, you need to make sure the plants will get enough moisture in order to establish themselves in the new location. Peat moss can help with that as well. Since it absorbs water and then holds it for quite some time, you won’t have to worry about watering your plants as often. The best recipe for a great transplanting mix involves two parts soil and one part peat moss. Spread the mix around the root balls of the shrubs or trees you’ve just transplanted. - Source: Internet The best way to ensure you use the right amount of peat moss is to go with a 2:1 ratio. This means you should add two parts of clay soil to one part of peat moss. It is okay to use less peat moss if what you are growing does not need a lot of water. - Source: Internet Peat does not decay very easily in the bog conditions, due to the sphagnum cell structure and to slower-acting anaerobic conditions. Although it grows very slowly, it can accumulate to a depth of many meters. The live moss grows on top of the dead moss, and it is the dead moss that forms the peat we use in the garden. - Source: Internet When should I use peat moss on my lawn? Peat moss uses can include lawn as well as garden. The timing is key, though. It’s best to use this material when you are planting sod, rather than using it while your lawn is growing. That’s because of the acidity spike it can create in the existing soil. - Source: Internet It is also helpful to add peat moss to clay soil because clay soil alone is not great for growing as much. In the long run, clay soil is made healthier when peat moss is added. Peat moss warms up faster than clay soil as well. - Source: Internet The base-level peat moss pH is 5.5 (sometimes even more acidic at 4.0) at least at the start of its use. While this may not seem like a problem for people who love to grow acid-loving plants, the low pH of acidic soil may be an issue for plants that need alkaline or neutral soil. Using peat may initially make your soil pH low, but studies have shown it will neutralize within a day or so. - Source: Internet Virtually devoid of nutrients. Unlike other organic materials such as manure compost, peat moss is very poor in nutrients. It also doesn’t contain any helpful microbes. So that means you can use peat moss as an amendment to the soil and other materials, but you cannot use it alone and expect the plants will grow strongly and properly. - Source: Internet Peat moss also has an incredible moisture-retention capability. This means that it is capable of absorbing and retaining water well. With that, it is the perfect place when it comes to seed starting. It also works as a great mix for other materials that can be used in growing plants. - Source: Internet Sphagnum moss is the live moss that grows in peat bogs. It’s harvested while still alive. People use sphagnum moss to decorate potted plants or to line wire baskets for planting. Sphagnum moss that was harvested while alive isn’t a soil amendment like peat moss. - Source: Internet Sphagnum peat bogs are fragile ecosystems that are slow to regenerate after being harvested. It takes one thousand years for them to grow a yard in depth. Even though harvest is carefully regulated, peat moss is not considered a renewable resource or a sustainable product. - Source: Internet A: It doesn’t have any nutrition, and doesn’t compact as much as compost does. If you need a soil amendment that has macronutrients and micronutrients, go for compost. For aeration and lightening, go for peats. - Source: Internet Like peat moss, sphagnum moss is harvested for the horticultural trade. For example, it is commonly used to line wire baskets for hanging plants to retain the soil. But the sphagnum moss used for this purpose was a plant growing in nature not long ago. You can also tell from its appearance that it is a type of moss, whereas peat moss bears more resemblance to soil. - Source: Internet There you have it. Peat moss is harvested from bogs or mires and is used in planting or potting soil mixes for acid-loving plants. Peat moss is not a natural garden soil ingredient, but it will help your garden grow lovely flowers and delicious foods. موقع 888 - Source: Internet As a growing mix, peat doesn’t need a lot of company. Pure, compressed bales of sphagnum peat moss are sold to consumers, but in mixtures for containers and seed starting, peat moss is generally blended with inert minerals to improve its moisture- and nutrient-holding qualities: perlite, a volcanic glass, or vermiculite, a mica. Both are expanded by high heat. Typically, lime is added as well to raise the pH. One drawback is that if peat is allowed to dry out, it shrinks and is difficult to re-wet. - Source: Internet This is an important type of peat because it has high nutrient content, making it useful in growing Cattleya Orchids because orchids like organic material in their soil. It’s also used for potted flowering plants and nurseries that produce bedding plants. It’s a little more acidic than sphagnum peat moss and holds more water. - Source: Internet Water retention – One of the most sought after characteristics of peat moss is its ability to retain moisture and release it to plant roots. It holds water much better than normal soils, compost, and many other growing mediums. Even better, instead of getting soggy and causing root rot, peat moss is able to release water as needed to plants as long as it’s not completely saturated. - Source: Internet The most significant disadvantages of peat moss are it’s too acidic for non-acid-loving plants, it’s not renewable, and it doesn’t have any nutrients. The upside to peat moss is it’s sterile and free of weed seeds; however, weeds can still grow in peat moss once you start using it and it’s exposed to the elements. Also, once you start using it, peat moss can attract bugs like fungus gnats since it’s also decaying. - Source: Internet the fibers peat moss is made of decompose slowly, and because they have been “treated” underwater for a very, long time, they are even more difficult to break down. This means that it has a very long life in the ground. Peat moss is fully organic: by now you know that it is sourced from bogs and it is fully natural. However, the quarrying and transportation does burn a lot of fossil fuels, so, if it is produced organically, it is not harvested and delivered organically. - Source: Internet What can I use instead of peat moss? There are several choices! One of the most commonly used alternatives is coconut coir, a material made of coconut fiber that is extracted from broken-down coconut shells. Coconut coir can have a high salinity content, though, making it necessary to water more. Other materials like worm castings serve a similar function, adding water retentive properties to the soil which helps gardeners grow plants. - Source: Internet Concerns for peat bogs have led to the creation of alternatives using compost, pine bark and coconut fiber. From left: peat moss, Organic Mechanics Planting Mix Compost Blend, Organic Mechanics Premium Blend Potting Soil, PittMoss Prime cellulosic fibers and Organic Mechanics rice hulls. The hulls are a substitute for perlite. (Wendy Galietta/The Washington Post) - Source: Internet Undoubtedly, peat moss has a lot of natural uses in the field of gardening. Some of its viable uses are for potting soil, planting seeds, plant compost, and transplanting plants. This gardening material is kind of expensive, though, so it is not advisable to use it alone. Include it in or combined it with garden soil as it can lower the cost while letting you enjoy this gardening staple’s benefits. - Source: Internet You shouldn’t use peat moss alone as a seed starter. Start with it as your base ingredient and add an aerating ingredient like perlite or vermiculite. You can also add a tiny amount of fertilizer to feed your seedlings once they start growing. - Source: Internet this makes it a good acidity corrector, especially with plants that cannot stand and alkaline soil. Peat moss helps break the ground; putting organic matter in the soil, and in all cases varying the texture of the soil, allows for better aeration, feeding and humidity retention. Because the fibers of peat moss beak down slowly, it has become popular with gardeners who want to correct the texture of clay soil in particular. - Source: Internet Peat moss is now used in a lot of soilless potting mixes. This means that if you already began to cultivate plants indoors using seedlings, it is greatly possible that you have also used the sphagnum peat moss. It would be a lot better for you to use the soilless potting mix when it comes to starting seeds because of the following: - Source: Internet Use peat moss as ⅓ – ⅔ of your total potting soil mix. The rest can be mainly compost or store-bought soil with perlite and some type of fertilizer added in. If you are growing plants that need a neutral to alkaline pH, add in some lime to balance out the peat moss. - Source: Internet Due to peat moss decaying very slowly, it continues to break down for quite some time. You do not have to worry about weeds being in peat moss. It is sterilized before it is sold. That makes it so peat moss does not have fungi or bacteria. - Source: Internet Black peat moss– Although technically a type of sphagnum, black peat usually refers to older, more decomposed peat moss that is darker in color when dried. For garden use, the peat is allowed to freeze when wet to improve its water retention. However, it still only retains water at 4 times its own weight.The final product usually ends up being dark brown in color (rather than black) and with much finer particles than sphagnum. Black peat is most frequently used by commercial growers like mushroom producers in blends, rather than by the home gardener. - Source: Internet If you’re going to use soil, mix equal parts of peat moss, vermiculite or perlite, and soil, plus fertilizers (optional). Finding the perfect mix might not be an easy task. You might have to experiment with a couple of them before finding the right one, but this is absolutely normal. - Source: Internet Most of the US’s sphagnum moss resources come from Canada or the northern parts of the United States. Sphagnum moss grows specifically in wetlands in tundra areas. There are sphagnum peat bogs in South America as well, but our commercial peat moss comes from the north. - Source: Internet What makes this variant different is that it has a somewhat crumbly feel. Basically, it is a soil amendment harvested or taken out of peat bogs. You can find a lot of peat bogs in wetland parts of Canada. - Source: Internet Overall, you should go with a 2:1 ratio to mix peat moss in clay soil. If you use too much, the ground will become loamy. If you do not use enough, the clay soil will not retain water nearly as well. - Source: Internet While peat is very moisture retentive, the fibrous material is also hydrophobic when it dries out. Therefore, it takes a significant amount of water to re-activate the retention it provides when slightly moist. Peat soil that has dried out may require some kind of surfactant, or wetting agent to break the tension and allow it to absorb water again. - Source: Internet Although sometimes referred to as “peat” for short, peat moss and peat are not, technically, the same. “Peat” is the broader term: Peat moss is just one of the products harvested from peat bogs. Other kinds of peat come from the partial decomposition of other organic materials. The “moss” in “peat moss” refers specifically to sphagnum moss (for example, Sphagnum cymbifolium). - Source: Internet Peat moss has been maligned in recent years by those who say that it is a non-renewable resource that destroys important natural environments. Canada, which supplies most of the peat moss available in North America, strictly regulates the harvesting of peat and the maintenance of bogs. Of Canada’s great reserves of peat, Cornell University states that only .02 percent are subject to harvesting. An environmental evaluation is always done before a virgin Canadian peat bog is harvested. - Source: Internet You should work peat moss into clay soil a few inches deep to 12 inches deep. It is essential to do this at least two times each year. When you add peat moss to clay soil, the soil should be dry. The peat moss holds moisture, absorbed once you mix it a few inches into the ground. - Source: Internet This moss is an excellent amendment, particularly in sandy soils or in potted plants that have difficulty retaining moisture. We’ll talk more about how to use peat moss later. First up, a few distinctions! - Source: Internet An ideal soil will retain enough moisture to keep your plants irrigated. But you do not want all of the water to pass quickly through your soil. It is a delicate balance, and peat moss, with its ability to retain water, will help you achieve that balance. - Source: Internet There is another major concern regarding the impact of peat mining. It turns out that peat is a tremendously potent terrestrial carbon storage medium. Consequently, mining peat rids us of an important carbon sink in times of drastic climate change. - Source: Internet Peat moss is not sustainable; it takes Nature 500 years to make 10 inches of peat moss. This issue has become central in the gardening world, and especially in the organic community and among gardeners who are aware of sustainability. Its quarrying is now strictly limited and regulated in many countries, like in Canada, in fact. Most gardeners have that feeling of remorse when using it nowadays. - Source: Internet In northern Europe, dried peat has been used for centuries as fuel — raising its profile as a source of atmospheric carbon dioxide — and people live closer to ancient bogland that has been drained for agriculture and development. In Canada, by contrast, peat isn’t used as a fuel, and its sheer acreage in less populated areas works in favor of its mining. Canada is the second-largest country on Earth and has 25 percent of the globe’s peatlands. The bogs are drained before harvesting, and the top layers of peat are mined with a large vacuum apparatus. - Source: Internet Did you know? I’ve been reading a case against peat from the University of Georgia Extension. The article discusses the double-edged sword nature of peat moss! Here’s what it means. Soil mixes with peat moss are often lightweight, provide excellent drainage, and also retain water! So yes – peat moss rocks for gardening! But – Mining for peat also releases oodles of CO2 and may contribute to global warming. Double-edged-sword. Peat moss style! - Source: Internet The top portion of the sphagnum peat moss has its uses, too. While it’s stringier than the deeper decayed moss, it is often used in reptile cages or terrarium use. It is not as decayed, and still resembles the plant it used to be. - Source: Internet Peat moss is partially decayed sphagnum moss found in the upper layers of peatland and bog sediments. It has low pH, light brown color, is airy, and retains water very well. Peat moss is one of the most common components of soilless mixes. - Source: Internet putting organic matter in the soil, and in all cases varying the texture of the soil, allows for better aeration, feeding and humidity retention. Because the fibers of peat moss beak down slowly, it has become popular with gardeners who want to correct the texture of clay soil in particular. Peat moss is sterile; because it has formed in an anaerobic environment and many bacteria need oxygen to live, it is free from pathogens that can harm the roots of your plants. - Source: Internet Don’t confuse peat moss (also sphagnum peat moss) with sphagnum moss. They come from the same plants, any of the Sphagnopsida class but they are not the exact same thing. Peat moss is what ends up under the water of these plants, while sphagnum moss is collected from the still living floating parts of the plant. - Source: Internet it is not decomposing matter, which means that while you can use it to change the texture and properties of your soil, it is not the best choice if you have organic regeneration in mind. For example, earthworms are not attracted to peat moss, nor are many of the microorganisms that turn the soiled fertile. The acidity of peat moss does not suit all plants; most plants, as you know, love neutral to alkaline soil, and peat moss is acidic. - Source: Internet Although compost is nutrient-rich, it doesn’t compare to peat moss when it comes to anti-compaction capabilities. Much of this is related to the moisture-retentive properties of peat, which keeps the soil it’s in aerated and light. It’s an excellent amendment for topsoil, which can compact quickly and easily. I know peat in soil would have been a welcome addition to my first raised bed, which I readily filled with the cheapest topsoil I could find, only to plant my crops in what was essentially cement. - Source: Internet Peat moss is sometimes maligned among eco-conscious gardeners. While they’re not wrong to question the origin of peat moss sold in stores, the truth is more complicated than one might think. Therefore, the topic deserves examination and discussion. - Source: Internet Yes, peat moss will break up clay soil. Peat moss breaking up clay soil is important is that clay soil does not retain water very well at all. That scenario is not ideal for plant life to thrive. - Source: Internet Clay soil that has been over-watered is slippery. When it is not wet enough or peat moss has not yet been added, the clay soil tends to be dry. After you add in your peat moss and fertilizer or compost, your clay soil should become more spring-like for a couple of months. - Source: Internet Hydrangeas need acidic soil to produce blue flowers. Alkaline soils will turn flowers pink. If you have a hydrangea bush that you want to be blue, peat moss is an easy soil amendment to increase acidity. - Source: Internet – Peat moss is excellent at holding nutrients in the soil, but it doesn’t have much nutrient value on its own. At best, it will have trace nutrients, so it’s not a good choice for feeding your plants. Cost – For small applications, the cost of peat moss isn’t likely to dent your wallet very much. However, any large scale use of it (like amending a whole garden area) can get pretty expensive. - Source: Internet Adding peat moss to clay soil has a few benefits. People mainly add peat moss to clay soil to amend it. It is a great soil amendment for plants that love acidic soil, such as blueberries and azaleas. - Source: Internet Watch the pH of your mixture Though strictly acid-hungry plants love peat moss with its low pH level, that does not mean others will do. You will need to add some pH-high materials like lime to create a neutral or alkaline environment. And be ready to monitor the pH level of the growing environment to ensure it does not drift too much. Another issue with soil pH is that with too many amendments added to change pH level, the soil can suffer. When it comes to growing, natural soil is ideal. - Source: Internet Peat moss is used to add structure and water holding capacity to your raised beds. Oddly it both promotes great drainage and holds water that plant roots can access as needed. Peat moss has a rather wide quality range and using the best quality peat moss you can afford is recommended. - Source: Internet As peatland stores a great percentage of carbon. Many environmental groups are beware of peat moss mining. The International Peat Society indicates that the harvesting process emits a large amount of carbon into the atmosphere. And the emission continues even after the mining. - Source: Internet If you wish to use peat moss for pure hydroponic growing, you should know some facts about why it is not appropriate. Because peat moss is an organic matter, if provided with plenty of oxygen and nitrogen, it will start to decompose. When that happens, the material can compress around plant roots and will choke off your plants. - Source: Internet And finally, peat moss is not renewable. So if you are environmentally aware, you may want to reduce your use of peat moss to just seed starting, pot, container, and soilless mixes instead of soil amendment, and lawn work in large quantities. Or you can completely replace it with other alternatives like compost, coco coir, pine bark, and other organic matters. - Source: Internet In Britain, for example, using peat has become taboo. The government’s environmental agency has said it wanted to phase out peat moss for hobby gardeners by 2020 and commercially by 2030. The London-based Royal Horticultural Society, the largest gardening organization of its kind in the world, has reduced peat use by 97 percent at its four major gardens and urges its members to follow its lead. - Source: Internet Highland, whose products are carried by Whole Foods Market, says he has seen steady growth in the past decade but not the explosive growth he and others had expected. On this side of the Atlantic, the ecological arguments against peat moss have been far more muted. Whatever the reasons, the issue has not seeped into most consumers’ consciousness. - Source: Internet Peat moss is not only organic, and has excellent water holding capacity, but it is also completely sterile. As we mentioned in the last section, there are no chemicals used in processing peat moss. Because there are no fungi, bacteria, and weed seeds, this media is clean as a whistle. Peat moss also has antiseptic qualities that originate in polysaccharides which suck harmful bacteria into cell walls. There’s a long and very interesting history of the use of this moss in medicine and as bandages. - Source: Internet Here are a few tips to help you find information about What Is Peat Moss?

Fibers absorb them and then release them slowly to the roots of your plants. Peat <strong>moss</strong> holds on to water; again because it is fibrous organic matter, it soaks with water and then releases it slowly. In fact, it can hold as much as 20 times of its weight in water. This quality, as well as its ability to retain nutrients, is helpful if your soil is sandy, which means that it does not hold on to moisture and nutrients. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It provides nooks and crannies where new, tender roots can grow.

This means less watering for you, saving you time, effort, and money. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The organisms that live in natural bogs are completely destroyed when <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is being cultivated or harvested from the bogs. Peat <strong>moss</strong> harvesting destroys local wildlife populations that live in the natural bogs. The process of draining <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> from bogs releases carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, and this comes with serious environmental implications such as the destruction of the ozone layer. There has always been calls for bogs to be commercially grown to prevent further damage to the environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you need to make your soil more substantial (e.g., in the case of sandy soil) and more acidic, <strong>peat</strong> humus might make a good choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Virtually all of the <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> sold in the United States comes from the vast sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> bogs of Canada. Often mixed with a mineral named perlite, it is highly valued by horticulturists for its ability to retain moisture and oxygen without becoming waterlogged or heavy. It is generally sterile and naturally suppresses a fungal disease that can afflict seedlings, making it a natural choice for seed starting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> is the main ingredient in many potting soils because it helps so much with drainage. Plants in containers often have problems with waterlogged soil, which <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> helps prevent. Seed starting: Because it’s sterile, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is one of the best seed-starting mediums. You can purchase small <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> pellets to insert into the soil where you want to plant seeds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Moreover, it takes a lot of millennia for the formation of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to occur. Peat bogs also obtain less than one-millimeter depth annually. Due to this slow process, you can’t classify <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>es as renewable and environmental resources. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another significant drawback is that <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is not at all considered environmentally friendly, as it is a non-renewable resource that takes thousands of years to form. Additionally, according to the IUCN, the harvesting process of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> emits a lot of carbon into the air. In fact, it emits more than all other vegetation types in the world combined. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> sits well below live sphagnum. To reach the decayed material, harvesters must remove the sphagnum covering it. Then, they drain the bog and suction the <strong>peat</strong> with vacuum-type equipment. After harvesting, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is dried, shredded, and chopped for consumer use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peatlands absorb carbon dioxide from the Earth’s atmosphere, markedly reducing air pollution. The live sphagnum presses against the <strong>peat</strong> below it, preventing carbon dioxide from escaping the bog. However, <strong>peat</strong> mining exposes the stored carbon dioxide, releasing it back into the atmosphere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are new to gardening, you’ve probably heard of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> but don’t know a lot about it. Peat <strong>moss</strong> comes from decomposed sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> found underwater in <strong>peat</strong> bogs. Many gardeners add <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to their soil because it works wonders for some plants, but other gardeners avoid this common soil amendment like the plague. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>because it has formed in an anaerobic environment and many bacteria need oxygen to live, it is free from pathogens that can harm the roots of your plants. Peat <strong>moss</strong> has long decomposition times; the fibers <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is made of decompose slowly, and because they have been “treated” underwater for a very, long time, they are even more difficult to break down. This means that it has a very long life in the ground. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> helps keep clay soil from drying up as easily as possible. The reason that is important is that you do not want the roots of your plants to get too dry. Using <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> in clay soil helps to keep your plant moist. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat doesn’t have any nutrient content, unlike compost, animal manures, and other soil mixes. Therefore, it’s only good for consistency and water retention. Peat <strong>moss</strong> soil is never just <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. Mixing <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> with soil is what creates these blends. If you’re growing plants in <strong>peat</strong>, you’ll always need some source of nutrients in addition to the <strong>moss</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yes. Peat <strong>moss</strong> helps improve soil drainage and prevent soggy soil, which is great for succulents. 7. Is <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> a fertilizer? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> and sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> differ in texture. Whereas <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is chopped, sphagnum fibers are fuzzy and long. Florists dress up potted plants by covering their topsoil with sphagnum. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another one of the best <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> uses is in soilless potting mixes. These are great for plants that don’t need a lot of nutrition to grow but do require air circulation and drainage. Most soils (even <strong>peat</strong> soils) host bugs, fungus, or bacteria. That’s why a soil-less mix is one of the best uses for <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Do you usually make your own compost? Adding some <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to it might help make it better. That’s because this compound is rich in carbon, and your compost needs carbon. Not to mention the fact that due to its ability to retain moisture, you won’t have to water the compost that often. For people who don’t have that much time to keep a constant eye on their compost, this is the perfect option. Just keep in mind that <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> can be rather expensive, so adding it to compost might cost you more than you’re willing to invest in this DIY project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Compost is inexpensive and readily available. Like <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, it helps the soil retain water and nutrients. It also adds nutrients, which gives it an advantage over <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. Coconut coir, aka coco coir: Coco coir is a byproduct of harvesting coconut fibers. It’s similar to <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> in many ways: It retains moisture, loosens the soil, and takes a long time to break down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> sounds too good to be true, that’s because it just might be. There are some things <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> can’t do for your soil. Plus, many gardeners refuse to use it because <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> mining is bad for the environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> helps retain moisture and nutrients for plant roots for sandy soil. If you intend to use it as a soil amendment, you should know that it changes soil pH levels. Ensure you measure and watch out if the pH level drifts too much by testing the soil pH. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can correct the carbon to nitrogen ratio of your compost heap. When your compost heap smells a lot, it means that it has too much nitrogen. Peat <strong>moss</strong> has a fine texture and it is easy to mix it in to correct this. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>under the pressure of water, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> becomes compact and thick, which means that it loses its aeration and absorption properties. This is remedied by mixing it with other media, especially perlite. Peat <strong>moss</strong> is poor in nutrients; it is not decomposing matter, which means that while you can use it to change the texture and properties of your soil, it is not the best choice if you have organic regeneration in mind. For example, earthworms are not attracted to <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, nor are many of the microorganisms that turn the soiled fertile. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most of the growing materials are not clean. However, that&rsquo;s not the case with <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. If you drop some wet <strong>moss</strong>, pick it up, get it dried or sweep it up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>– Make your own, or If you live in Arizona the compost from Arizona Worm Farm is great. If you use bagged, then a mix of several different types is best. 1 part <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> * or washed coco coir - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The fibers help the soil retain and release water. For this reason, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> balances sandy soil nicely. Sand quickly drains water from plant roots before they get a chance to drink. However, plants can easily draw water from <strong>peat</strong>, along with soil nutrients. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We’ve talked generally about how <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is created. Now let’s take a closer look. Sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> grows freely in <strong>peat</strong> bogs or wetland areas of cool-climate tundras and conifer forests. A look at the video posted in this article will give you an idea of just how lush this plant is. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is organic material degraded by the action of moisture, oxygen, bacteria, and heat. Like <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, compost helps the soil retain water. It’s a rich source of plant nutrients. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is where <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> comes in, to serve as an amendment for clay-based or sandy soil. Peat <strong>moss</strong> tends to be quite fluffy, which means adding it to a sandy soil will create plenty of body. On the other hand, adding it to a clay soil will loosen it up, thanks to its lightweight consistency. This ensures the roots of your shrubs or trees will receive enough air to develop properly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peatlands store a third of the world’s soil carbon, and their harvesting and use releases carbon dioxide, the major greenhouse gas driving climate change. The biggest environmental risk from <strong>peat</strong>lands is if they catch fire, which happened spectacularly in 2015 in Indonesia on land cleared for plantations. Peatland fires account for up to 5 percent of human-caused carbon emissions, according to the United Nations, which last year launched a <strong>peat</strong>lands conservation initiative. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When soil becomes compacted, water and nutrients can’t get through to your plants’ roots. Your plants can die as a result. One way to solve this problem is lawn aeration. But with <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, your soil will be looser, and you won’t have to aerate as often. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In the 1940s, <strong>peat</strong> was recognized for its uses in gardening or horticulture. Gardeners started using it for their plants by that time. Presently, you can see <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> being used as a soil amendment, mushroom casting, seed starting, and soilless mixture, among many others. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most often, you’ll find <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> sold in small quantities in bags. When in bulk, it usually comes in bales or bricks wrapped in plastic. Sometimes, the product label will read “sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>.” 3. Why is <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> being banned? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat mining is controversial. Environmental watchdog organizations say that <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> isn’t sustainable. However, harvesters maintain that it is renewable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You also have to use it along with other nutrients to ensure that the soil, which is poor in nutrition, will not cause any damage to the plant structure. Aside from that, <strong>moss</strong> <strong>peat</strong> is incapable of attracting earthworms due to its lack of nutrition. It is crucial to attracting earthworms because they help in the soil aeration process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Measure your soil&rsquo;s pH. Before using <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, you should consider what you are growing and what your soil’s pH is. Because it is so acidic, it should only be used for acid-loving plants such as blueberries, or in soils that are naturally neutral or alkaline. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Castings are the waste products of farmed earthworms. Castings contain enzymes and minerals, providing crops with easily absorbed nutrients. Like <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, they enhance water retention, aerate the soil, and inhibit fungus. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In a wheelbarrow, measure out two parts of soil and one part <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. Thoroughly combine and spread over the raised bed. Then, mix to a 12-inch depth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Scotland is also considered a home for <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> and sphagnum <strong>moss</strong>. The reason is that around 23 percent of this country has <strong>peat</strong> covering it. Note, though, that the majority of the <strong>peat</strong> in Scotland is not commercialized but protected instead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> is sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> that’s been dead and decomposing underwater for centuries. Through that decomposition process, it becomes useful for your soil. 2. Where can I find <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sterility is a great quality in a seed starter. Seedlings are extremely vulnerable, and they need a clean, safe environment in which to establish themselves. Peat <strong>moss</strong> provides that environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It retains water, lightens soils, and adds better drainage. You can use it in place of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> as part of a seed starting or potting mix. It’s also a very renewable resource since it comes from the husks of coconuts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the most effective and controversial materials to garden with is <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. Effective because it works well in tons of situations, and controversial because of how it is sourced. Many gardeners buy it on the regular without even knowing what it is or what it’s doing in their practice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another thing organic gardeners appreciate is all-natural sources. Not only is <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> organic, but it’s also only one step removed from the plants in the <strong>peat</strong>lands it comes from. Bog <strong>moss</strong> is essentially organic matter used in soil mixes, and bulk <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is sold on its own too. Peat <strong>moss</strong> doesn’t have any chemicals in it either. It’s free of fungus, bacteria, harmful chemicals, and weed seeds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So we’ve dedicated this piece to this interesting <strong>moss</strong>, what it is, and how to use it in the garden. We’ll also touch on why it has been looked down upon by gardeners who appreciate an ecologically sound practice. All this will help you as a gardener make the best possible decision about using it or an alternative. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best way to transition from less sustainable <strong>peat</strong> pellets to a new way of starting seeds is to phase the plugs out gradually and double up. For example, gardeners wanting to start two tomato plants should start a few seeds in pellets and a few in the new medium the first time around until they learn the nuances of a new method. Finally, learning to compost is a highly sustainable alternative to <strong>peat</strong> as an outdoor soil amendment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some growers consider <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to be nutrient-poor. It doesn&rsquo;t contain much nitrogen, potassium, or phosphorus, but it does have calcium and magnesium, which are essential nutrients for the growth of cannabis plants. Unlike other organic materials such as manure compost, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is very poor in nutrients. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> prevents soil compaction. In dense soils, the particles are jammed together, making it hard for plant roots to breathe, drink, and grow. However, since <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is spongy, it loosens tight soils, such as those high in clay. As a result, air and water can circulate better, making roots less prone to rot and stunting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In terms of its uses, one main aspect where you can use <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is as a form of soil amendment. It also works as a vital ingredient or component in potting soil. With its acid pH level, it is perfect for plants that love acid, including camellias and blueberries. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Many countries have strict rules when it comes to mining <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. For example, any <strong>peat</strong> harvested in Canada is carefully analyzed first whether it has any long-term effect on the environment. And it must be mined in sustainable and conservable ways. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>it far exceeds the price of comparable mediums, like coconut coir. In fact, you are more likely to find it mixed in with other mediums already. Peat <strong>moss</strong> tends to compact over time; under the pressure of water, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> becomes compact and thick, which means that it loses its aeration and absorption properties. This is remedied by mixing it with other media, especially perlite. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For horticultural use, the extraction of <strong>peat</strong> requires the removal of a bog’s living surface to reach the partially decomposed layers beneath. It grows at a mere sixteenth of an inch a year, and its mining removes layers that take centuries to develop. “Peat is the best vegetative carbon sink we have on the planet,” Highland said. “Why dig it up?” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>PittMoss has many of the properties of <strong>peat</strong> but without its ecological impact. For example, PittMoss enhances soil aeration, water retention, and nutrient availability. Regarding texture, it’s fluffy, lightweight, and drains well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are building a brand new garden, use 1/3 topsoil, 1/3 compost and 1/3 <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to create a loose, well drained, healthy soil base for your backyard vegetable garden. If you are growing in pots/containers, use 2/3 high quality soil mix (I like to stick with ProMix or Sunshine Mix - also labelled Sungro. I also use this mix to start my indoor plants.) and 1/3 compost. This soil mix already contains <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> so there is no need to add that. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat was dried and was used as a source of fuel in some countries for centuries. Because, like any fossil fuels, it is rich in carbon. It was only till the 1940s that <strong>peat</strong> has a place in horticulture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Furthermore, coir supplies plants with minerals. Coir also differs from <strong>peat</strong> by being denser, costlier, and less acidic. Its pH ranges between 6.0 and 6.7, close to neutral. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your soil is high in sand or clay, adding <strong>peat</strong> will make it suitable for your crops. To do this, spread <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> over your plot in a 3-inch layer. Then, mix it to a 12-inch depth until evenly distributed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat was dried and used as a source of fuel in some countries for centuries. This is because it&rsquo;s rich in carbon dioxide, just like other fossil fuels. It was until the 1940s that <strong>peat</strong> had a place in horticulture. Today, it&rsquo;s used as a soil amendment, soilless mix, seed starting, and mushroom casting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re somewhat familiar with the basics of gardening, then you’ve probably already heard of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. That’s because it has multiple uses in the garden, and it’s quite sought after by many people who want to provide their plants with the best of care. If you don’t know what <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is and how you can use it in the garden, we’re here to clear that up for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>First, &ldquo;sphagnum <strong>moss</strong>&rdquo; refers to a living plant. There are 120 species of this type of <strong>moss</strong> plant. Sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> is native to many countries across the globe, but it is especially prevalent in the Northern Hemisphere. &ldquo;Peat <strong>moss</strong>&rdquo; is not alive; it&rsquo;s long dead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When humans mine <strong>peat</strong> bogs for <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, they take away from that carbon sink effect. And since <strong>peat</strong> bogs gain less than a millimeter in depth every year, they’re considered a non-renewable resource. That means once we mine the last of them, they’re gone (at least for several human generations). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> has a lightweight and spongy texture. It has the uncanny ability to hold on to air and moisture while allowing excess water to drain freely. It’s generally pest and disease free. And it’s inexpensive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Note that you cannot use <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> dry, as it will repel water. Therefore, wet it well beforehand. To do this, pour the amount you need in a wheelbarrow or large bucket. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat Moss: This may come as a surprise. Peat <strong>moss</strong> is, however, not a sustainable material. It takes hundreds of years for <strong>peat</strong> to develop in <strong>peat</strong> bogs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The use of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> started a long time ago. For several centuries, many used <strong>peat</strong> in dried form as a main source of fuel. It works as a fuel as it has high carbon content similar to other fossil fuels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> is a soil amendment that is a dark-brown fibrous material used as a planting medium for growing plants. Peat <strong>moss</strong> is naturally made or formed after 1,000 years and harvested from <strong>peat</strong> bogs. There&rsquo;s much debate about its environmental safety since it&rsquo;s not sustainable and gives off carbon dioxide when harvested. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> is probably a familiar term if you’ve ever browsed through a garden centre, but you might be unsure of how and why it’s used. Many potting soils actually come with a bit of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> already mixed in, but you can also buy it on its own. Mixing <strong>peat</strong> into your soil can offer major benefits, but there are some important things to keep in mind before you start adding fistfuls of <strong>peat</strong> into all your plant containers! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> is available in several grades, with different particle sizes. The larger the particles are, the more expensive it is. Use <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> as a soil amendment to lighten heavy soils and increase water retention. For clay and heavy soils that get compact easily, it softens the soil structure and improves the drainage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For this purpose, use the <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> alone or in a mixture with some soils. You can also remove the hassle by getting the <strong>peat</strong> pellets sold on the market. Many people also prefer a soilless mix of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, perlite, coconut coir, and others in different amounts. This prevents diseases, fungi, bacteria, weed seeds, and other bad things commonly found in the soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> has other uses, as well. Outdoors, it can be tilled into a planting bed where the soil is not sufficiently friable. Peat <strong>moss</strong> will lighten up the soil in your garden, which may have become compacted over the years, resulting in inadequate drainage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> is a material that grows on top of bogs, usually here in Canada. It’s used as a natural potting medium because its loose, spongy texture has amazing moisture retention for plants, as well as many other benefits. The thing is, it takes thousands of years for <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to develop, so it isn’t exactly an easily renewable resource. However, by using it sparingly as an additive to soils, we can still reap all the benefits without having to use that much. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although it has a similar name, sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> is much different than <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. It isn’t decomposed and is made up of long, fibrous strands. It’s often used to line hanging baskets like this one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Why do you think <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is particularly beneficial to vegetable gardens? Well, it’s because they are the ones most likely to suffer due to either extremely wet conditions or extremely hot weather. These environment characteristics can decrease vegetable production and also affect the quality of the vegetables. Adding <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to your vegetable garden can successfully prevent that. The only thing you have to keep an eye on is not adding too much of it. This might change the pH of the soil, which can be more bad news for your garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is different from sphagnum <strong>moss</strong>, though. The latter actually consists of fibrous and long strands of the plant material. This sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> is what most florists used as a lining for wire baskets. They also use the sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> to provide potted plants with a more decorative and unique touch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For the last 12 years, Canadian <strong>peat</strong> producers have employed a new practice to facilitate bog restoration. This entails letting the wetlands re-flood and planting <strong>moss</strong> grafts. As the sphagnum grows, its top layer is replenished within five years. Restoring ecological balance can take 15 to 25 years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>again because it is fibrous organic matter, it soaks with water and then releases it slowly. In fact, it can hold as much as 20 times of its weight in water. This quality, as well as its ability to retain nutrients, is helpful if your soil is sandy, which means that it does not hold on to moisture and nutrients. Peat <strong>moss</strong> can hold on to air; roots need to breathe as well as feed and drink and in the pores and spaces within the fibers of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, air can find a good place to hide. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the most useful roles of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is in seed starting because this material is very sterile. Its antiseptic qualities naturally prevent bacteria and fungi from the seeds. It also gives excellent drainage, good aeration, fine texture, and low fertile, making it very ideal for germination. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You’ll easily find organic <strong>peat</strong>. You may come across coco-<strong>peat</strong>, but this is another name for coconut fiber. Don’t make the mistake of buying sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> or spag <strong>moss</strong>, which are too coarse for gardening. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>– Boasts exceptional water retention and aeration qualities. Since it’s a product derived from coconut fibers – it’s much easier (and faster) to create compared to <strong>peat</strong>-based gardening products. Worm castings – Nightcrawlers and other earthworms have excellent reputations for improving the aeration of garden soil, and their excrement also helps to fertilize and recycles nutrients – how can you lose? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>—It won’t add any nutrients to the soil as it breaks down, which is one of the main appeals of organic mulch. 5. What’s the ratio for mixing <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> with soil? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Since the 1950s, sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> has been a common ingredient in potting soils sold in the United States. It is typically mixed with white specks of perlite, a mineral that is expanded by heating. (Wendy Galietta/The Washington Post) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The United Kingdom’s government will ban the use of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> for home gardeners beginning in 2024 in an effort to preserve the country’s <strong>peat</strong>lands. According to the UK’s Environment Secretary George Eustice, the ban is happening because “Peatlands are our biggest terrestrial carbon store and home to some of our rarest species.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Since <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is very dry, it&rsquo;s not 100% suitable for soil. It can be combined with other organic materials to improve the water retention capacity of your growing medium. When starting seeds with <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> alone, ensure they get enough moisture. It&rsquo;s also good to mix it with soils and some other soilless media. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Environmental concerns– The actual harvesting process for <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is also under scrutiny. The bogs are drained of surface water, and layers of native vegetation are removed to get at the <strong>peat</strong>. Once it dries out enough, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is essentially vacuumed up at rates of about 100 acres per day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Since clay soil has a pH between eight and ten, adding <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> helps balance out the levels. Peat <strong>moss</strong> has a lower pH. When you mix <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> into clay soil by breaking up the ground and adding it in, the clay soil will not be as challenging to utilize. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It does not also have harmful weed seeds or microorganisms that are often present in poorly processed compost. Also, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is a crucial component in a lot of seed starting mediums and soils. It can hold a lot of moisture then release it to roots whenever needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Then the top layer of the vast sphagnum patch is removed and relocated to other areas of the bog which have not been disturbed, where it can thrive. The decayed, dried sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> is allowed to lay in the sun for 2 to 3 days where it dries. It’s then scraped up with the harvester and sucked into a receptacle. Then it’s moved to a factory for processing and packaging. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> is also used to grow plants that prefer soil with low pHs, such as rhododendrons, gardenias, heathers, tomatoes, Pieris, azaleas, and camellias. These plants need a <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> mixture for their acidic soil. When combined with the correct potting mix, these plants enjoy having an environment where they can take up essential nutrients from the soil and conserve water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> is a soil amendment that is harvested from <strong>peat</strong> bogs. Many of these <strong>peat</strong> bogs are found in wet areas of Canada. Peat bogs are formed over a long period as organic materials partially decompose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Of the hot-button issues seen by Sally McCabe, who manages educational issues for the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> concerns pale next to others. “The biggest is probably Roundup,” she said, referring to the controversial herbicide. She counsels members to minimize <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> use. “I always push the renewable stuff, particularly locally sourced,” she said. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Can you mix <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> with soil? Absolutely. Just like compost, it’s a great addition to garden soil, as well as most kinds of soil. Soil amendments with these materials provide water retention and aeration that can help house plants grow more easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It is helpful to add both <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> and compost. The reason people do this because <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> does not decay very quickly at all; therefore, clay soil doesn&rsquo;t get the nutrients from <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. Adding compost also adds more nutrition to the ground. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are currently no plans to ban or restrict the use of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> in the United States (or anywhere else other than the UK, based on our research). 4. Can I use <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> as mulch? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The vast <strong>peat</strong>lands in Canada, for example, developed 10,000 years ago, after the last glacial period. During this era, megafauna like mammoths and sabre-toothed cats still roamed the Earth. Humans were just starting to get the hang of farming wheat and barley. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To start plants from seed, consider buying <strong>peat</strong> pots. Once the seedlings have sturdy stems and leaves, put the containers directly in your garden. Be sure to cover the rims completely with soil. Otherwise, the <strong>peat</strong> will draw moisture from the seedling roots and surrounding earth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some alternates to <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> are composted bark (preferably made from hardwoods), Coir which is coconut fiber and rice hulls. While rice hulls are pretty much on size, it is best if you choose coarser versions of composted bark and coir. Like <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, larger fibers will take longer to break down and will give more porosity to your soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is used in soilless potting mixes. So if you have started plants indoors from seed, you have likely already dealt with <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. A soilless potting mix is much better to use for starting seeds than regular soil for the following reasons: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Meanwhile, sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> is a plant grown on the surface layer above of the <strong>peat</strong>land, soil or a swamp. It thrives in cold and wet weather. As time goes by, the old parts sink into the lower layer. The process of decomposition takes place very slowly in the oxygenless layer. But it is patient, and over a long period of millennials, a thick layer of dead homogeneous material named <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is formed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> has been a top growing medium, especially for starting seeds, since the 1960s. Compressed pellets of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> surrounded by a thin fiber bag, like those made by Jiffy, offer a convenient, mess-free, and effective method for starting plants from seed to grow in a vegetable garden or flower beds. But <strong>peat</strong> is not a sustainable product in the long run, and harvesting the material for horticultural use has come under fire because of declining <strong>peat</strong>lands. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to make clay soil loamy, add more <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> than usual. For this result, the ratio of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to clay soil needs to be more than half and half. Adding extra <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to your clay soil will make it loamier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Due to its great qualities as a seed starting mix, you can also use <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> in container gardening. It keeps the seeds moist and provides them with nutrients. What you must remember is that in the case of container gardening, you’re going to have to pay more attention to how much soil, fertilizer, and compost you add. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Simplify matters with container gardening and a soil-less medium. One option is using PittMoss exclusively. Or, create a mix of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, coco coir, and earthworm castings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This makes <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> a very unique garden material because it forms without the presence of oxygen. (Compost, for example, is broken down in the presence of oxygen and other elements.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>John has nice loam soil in his garden. Yes, I know the rest of us are jealous. John’s raised garden bed mix is about 1/3 native soil, 1/3 well-aged compost, and 1/3 <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> measured by volume. Plus plant food, and for the root veggies perlite is added. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you decide <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> soil is right for your garden, mix it at a ratio of 2 parts soil to 1 part <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. 6. Do succulents like <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>can meet similar goals using repurposed plant-derived waste products, as an alternative to <strong>peat</strong>. Compost and worm castings are just as good of a source of organic matter within a potting mix. Use sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> for your specialized gardening needs, and grow organic for life! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Still, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is not perfect. It’s more acidic than some alternative media, and if the expanded pellets dry out completely, it is tough to bring them back to a fully moistened state. Plus, <strong>peat</strong> plugs are too small to sustain seedlings until they’re ready to plant, so eventually the seedlings must be potted up. Pellets can cost more than other methods, but they offer the convenience of a quick and clean seed-sowing experience, especially when sold with a tray and lid. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Even though <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> absorbs water well, it doesn&rsquo;t compact, unlike soil. Compaction makes it hard to create space for the water and air to pass through. But if you add <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to any compact material, you&rsquo;ll have solved the compaction problem and made the growing mix drain better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>moss</strong> will release the water to maintain the wetland as well. This is why <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is such an essential addition to gardeners’ soil. Much of what we do is figure out the best possible ways to carry out good water retention in the garden. Peat <strong>moss</strong> bogs and in turn <strong>peat</strong>y soil are the main sources of moisture retention for many. That’s why it’s commonly used in potting soil, and to line wire baskets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Let’s start with the environmental concerns. On the whole, <strong>peat</strong> is a non-renewable resource. The fact that it outperforms other materials in the garden is why it was overharvested for a long time with little thought about how using <strong>moss</strong> for plants was contributing to ecological decline. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A: Untreated <strong>moss</strong> may contain fungi that can cause illness. Most of those you find in stores are well-treated. This is not a concern for most gardeners. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Both have similar applications, but in general, the decayed form of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is much more acidic than the one that still looks plant-like. Typically, the only <strong>peat</strong> you’ll find at the garden center is the lower, more decomposed material. It takes genuine work to find the dried sphagnum <strong>moss</strong>; typically, it’s only through pet stores or specialty reptile shops that you’ll find good quantities of it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Coco coir is a byproduct of harvesting coconut fibers. It’s similar to <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> in many ways: It retains moisture, loosens the soil, and takes a long time to break down. Pine bark: Finely ground pine bark in your soil prevents it from becoming compacted and helps retain moisture. For a soil amendment, you want pine bark soil conditioner, not pine bark nuggets, which are used for mulch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The conditions of a <strong>peat</strong> bog are harsher than most. It is very wet and acidic, with low levels of oxygen and nutrients in the water column or substrate. Despite this, it is home to many rare plants and animals that are highly specialized to thrive in such an environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Expensive. Even though <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is not the most expensive growing material, it is also not cheap. Especially if you use <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> in bulk and price is an issue, a better alternative is compost. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In planning your food garden, if your soil is alkaline, consider adding <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. If the pH is fine, but the ground is too powdery or compact, amend it with <strong>peat</strong> alternatives. Organic possibilities are compost, coconut fiber, PittMoss, and earthworm castings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To this day, the cycle of <strong>moss</strong> growth and decay continues. Live sphagnum floats above the dead <strong>peat</strong>, ranging up to 10 feet in depth. Peat bogs are also called <strong>peat</strong>lands. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Don&rsquo;t confuse sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> with sphagnum <strong>moss</strong>, even if their names are similar. Sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> refers to the plant material harvested when still alive and growing above water. The end product is the light, fibrous material often used to decorate line wire baskets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For general soil improvement, I use mixtures of compost and leaf mold, either homemade or commercially produced. This meshes with the Royal Horticultural Society’s advice. “We believe that using <strong>peat</strong> for soil incorporation and ground mulching is unnecessary and unacceptable,” spokesman Garfield Myrie wrote in response to an email. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is why it is important to test your clay soil if you add <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to it. The pH of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> should be between 3 and 4.5. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some are bagged separately, and some are combined with decayed organic materials to be incorporated into potting soils sold worldwide. Some are made into <strong>peat</strong> pellets, and some are sold as simply <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. Then it hits the shelves, where you’ve likely seen and bought it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To save bog ecosystems from extinction, government agencies regulate <strong>peat</strong> mining. For example, Canada limits extraction to .016 percent of its bog reserves. Canadian harvesters can only access one in 6,000 acres at any given time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dig a network of ditches along the <strong>peat</strong>land to drain the water. Second, remove the native vegetation to get the <strong>peat</strong> exposed. Third, level the harvest to prevent drainage of the surface runoff. Fourth, harrow the top layer to speed up the drying process of <strong>peat</strong>s. Fifth, suck up the dry <strong>peat</strong> layer using a large vacuum harvester. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The most commonly used type of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. Sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> has a high ability to absorb moisture and holds ten times its dry weight in water. After it&rsquo;s harvested and dried, sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is light in color, making it retain 10-12 times its weight in water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This guide covers everything from the types of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> available to how much water each type holds. We&rsquo;ll cover everything from planting trees and shrubs with <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> as a potting medium or using it as alternative mulch material in vegetable gardens. You&rsquo;ll also find out which kinds of plants grow best when grown directly in <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> without any additional soil mixed into the mix. Let’s get started! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> is not a natural substance. It is the partially decayed remains of plants that have been harvested from <strong>peat</strong> bogs and mires, an ecosystem formed by the incomplete decomposition of organic matter in wetlands. Peat bogs are fragile habitats that take thousands of years to form. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sterile One of the best features of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is its sterility. It doesn’t have any bacteria, fungus, harmful chemicals, and no weed seeds. This makes the material perfect for seedlings, which are quite vulnerable to the surrounding environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The annual rate of sphagnum growth is barely measurable — less than one millimeter or about 1/16 inch per year. For a bog to naturally generate one meter of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, it can take 100 years. However, <strong>peat</strong> harvesters have discovered ways to expedite <strong>moss</strong> regeneration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pretty much every store you go to will have some form of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> available, whether it be a potting mix, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, or specifically sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, you’ll have no trouble locating a source. So many growers rely on this plant for soilless mixes, starting seeds, and soil amendment and <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> has been on the market for a long time. Therefore, it’s reliable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In case you drop a few wet <strong>moss</strong>es, the only things you have to do are picking it up, sweeping it, or drying it. In terms of sterility, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> also has a big advantage. The reason is that it does not contain any fungus, weed seed, harmful chemicals, and bacteria. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> comes from your flower pot or garden from wetlands or bogs. It&rsquo;s not decomposed material because the surface of the blogs doesn&rsquo;t allow oxygen and air to filter underground. لعبة قمار بوكر This makes the fibers of the sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> remain intact. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Alternatively, mix your own seed medium. One way is combining <strong>peat</strong> and equal parts vermiculite and perlite, volcanic materials that aerate and drain soil. For this purpose, buy fine-textured <strong>peat</strong>, encouraging the growth of roots and tender shoots. Here’s detailed information on using <strong>peat</strong> to start seedlings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It is also a big help in seed starting due to its sterile nature. Peat <strong>moss</strong> has antiseptic qualities that prevent fungi and bacteria from seeds. Moreover, it can provide excellent aeration and drainage as well as fine texture, which contributes to good germination. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> isn&rsquo;t better or worse than soil; it&rsquo;s different. It&rsquo;s soilless but is often added to soil to lighten, aerate, and help retain moisture. Although it&rsquo;s great for keeping moisture and aerating the soil, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is not often used for lawns since its acidity hinders grass growth and can kill earthworms. However, adding <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to your soil is excellent if you have acid-loving plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> has a pH of 4.9 to 6.5, slightly acidic. This makes it better for soil mix because the acidity helps break down other compounds in the soil. This also makes it a good corrector, especially with plants that cannot stand alkaline soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The term <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> most often refers to the lower levels of <strong>peat</strong> found in a <strong>peat</strong> bog. Sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is the plant from which the <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> we use for gardens is derived, but most of the <strong>peat</strong> we like to use is the long-decayed form that collects deeper in the bog layers. Over time, it becomes packed down, compressed, and decays into a lovely spongy mass. The lower levels may also contain other decomposed organic material, like other rotted plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Black <strong>peat</strong> is harvested differently than sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> in a way that preserves the living plant. It&rsquo;s cut from Sphagnum bogs in Canada and is probably black because of its high carbon content. It requires more processing before it&rsquo;s sold but has less dust and fewer contaminants than brown <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>No. Peat <strong>moss</strong> can help your soil retain nutrients and encourage your plants to grow healthier, but it barely contains any nutrients on its own. 8. Should you use <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> in your garden? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A <strong>peat</strong> bog is a type of wetland, a low-lying, flooded landmass, containing saturated soils and aquatic plants. Originally, <strong>peat</strong> bogs evolved from lakes. Over thousands of years, sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> overgrew the lakes. As the surface vegetation thickened, the lower layers gradually died and decomposed, leaving brown, spongy <strong>peat</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sand has very coarse particles that do not release nutrients to plants easily. It does not change the pH of your soil, but it also doesn&rsquo;t hold nutrients well, so adding sand on top of a <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>/vermiculite mix is not ideal. Sand may be preferable if you are planting trees or other plants that don&rsquo;t need consistent nutrients. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> is more expensive than composting. Although the cost is worth it in the long run, this can be a disadvantage for some people. Mining <strong>peat</strong> is not great for the environment as it is not a renewable resource. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> soaks up water much better than clay soil. The way that works is the <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> alters the texture of the clay soil, giving it the ability to aerate better. Peat <strong>moss</strong> causes the clay soil to retain moisture better as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> comes from <strong>peat</strong> bogs, many of which are found in the wetland areas of Canada. Peat bogs are formed, over the course of very long periods of time, as organic materials partially decompose. Because of the water in these bogs, anaerobic conditions are maintained. Anareobic conditions slow down full decomposition. The result is that the <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is preserved almost indefinitely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to the uses of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, seed-starting is one of the places where it shines. Mix <strong>peat</strong> with perlite and vermiculite and you have a great seed starting mix that is also soil-less. This mixture provides seeds with the right amount of drainage and aeration that will help plant roots grow strong and healthy. Add a little compost to feed plant roots some nutrients too! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> can hold several times its weight in water. It helps soil retain moisture longer. What does that mean for you? You don’t have to water your plants as often, and they’ll still have all the water they need. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As mentioned earlier, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> commonly serves as a great soil amendment for plants that love acid. However, there are instances when it becomes too acidic for some plant species. In that case, it may be necessary to add some garden lime into the planting bed as a means of increasing the pH level of the soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Compost: Compost is inexpensive and readily available. Like <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, it helps the soil retain water and nutrients. It also adds nutrients, which gives it an advantage over <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your plants thrive better in alkaline soil, though, then it is better to pick compost. The good thing about <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is that it does not readily break down or compact. This means that even a single application can be expected to last for a few years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Be wary of how much <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> you use. Using too much or too little will not result in the same effects. If you use too much <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, your clay soil will not be able to drain correctly, so measure it before adding it in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Increased use of <strong>peat</strong> in soilless methods like hydroponics has led to more sales of the medium for its water-retaining properties. The number of home vegetable garden growers is on the rise, as is the number of cannabis growers worldwide relying on <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. Production of <strong>peat</strong> in Canada alone averaged more than 1.34 million tons a year from 2014 to 2018. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> is often used as a base layer to germinate and grow plants like vegetables and flowers. It provides aeration to the root zone, and it&rsquo;s very easy to use for newcomers in hydroponics. When using <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> for seed starting, you also need special trays with drain holes on the bottom because if you don&rsquo;t, the <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> will expand and block the water flow out of your seedling flat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The majority of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> actually have a low pH level, an average range of 3.5 to 6. This still depends on where the mining of the <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> took place. With that, it is a great choice for plants that crave acid, including blueberries and strawberries. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In terms of benefits, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> has quite a few that we&rsquo;ve already mentioned. From improving drainage and aeration to providing a sterile environment for sprouting seeds, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is incredibly versatile and you&rsquo;re bound to find at least one way to use it in your garden. According to The Spruce, it&rsquo;s also relatively inexpensive, especially when compared to other soil amendments, and is readily available in stores throughout the U.S. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gardeners who already have <strong>peat</strong> pellets handy should use them if they like how they work. Coconut coir pellets offer similar convenience and a more eco-friendly approach for starting seeds. A sterile potting mix made for seed starting offers the best results for most growers, but it also requires investing in a tray and new (or cleaned) small plastic or biodegradable pots or a soil block maker for those who want to start a large quantity of seeds and avoid use of pots. Filling a grow tray or pots directly with soil is an inexpensive approach for many gardeners, but can get messy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Because of the cellular structure of sphagnum <strong>moss</strong>, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is an excellent resource for water retentive properties. Sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> has two kinds of cells: those that assist in photosynthesis and those barrel-shaped cells that retain water. Both of these are necessary for thriving <strong>peat</strong>land, as much of the main source of nutrition for sphagnum is in the water and decayed <strong>moss</strong> below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Perlite is organic as well, though, of course, the quarrying uses fossil fuel. It is also inert, like <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, which means that it can hold on to nutrients for long, but it does not provide any itself. It is readily available as well, which is why it is a favorite with gardeners all over the world. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Acidic Most of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> low in pH from 3.5 to 6 on average depending on the source of the <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is mined. It is very suitable for acid-craving plants such as strawberries, blueberries. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yes, you heard that right, you can also use <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> for lawn care. If you’re struggling with an unhealthy lawn, this compound might help it regain its lush and healthy appearance. It serves as a soil conditioner that encourages grass to grow. Like in the case of transplanted shrubs, as well as trees and potted plants, the roots of the grass will receive plenty of air, which will encourage a healthy moisture level. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For an effective compost recipe, add 4 parts compost to one part <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. Every two weeks, you should toss the pile and add some more <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> in case it emanates a strong odor. This will tone down the smell. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are looking for an organic material to improve the content of your soil, using <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is a good option. It comes from bogs and is fully natural. The best part is that it&rsquo;s now harvested at its optimal stage, further adding that this is an organic ingredient. Also, quarrying and transportation do burn a lot of fossil fuels, so if it&rsquo;s produced organically, it&rsquo;s not harvested and delivered organically. قوانين لعبة الروليت - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are many recipes for a great seed starting mix. The ingredients you decide to use depend on what you prefer. For example, you could choose not to use soil and replace it with <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. Then, you can add equal parts vermiculite or perlite, plus some fertilizer and lime. These last two ingredients will lower the pH and provide your seeds with food. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Finely ground pine bark in your soil prevents it from becoming compacted and helps retain moisture. For a soil amendment, you want pine bark soil conditioner, not pine bark nuggets, which are used for mulch. PittMoss: PittMoss is a locally sourced, eco-friendly brand of potting mix and soil conditioner made of recycled paper. This product was designed to replace <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> (thus the clever name), and it has many of the same effects on soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Did you know that <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> can defeat your soil’s ability to take in moisture? Ironically, it’s often recommended for its water holding ability. It can aid water retention, but once <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> dries out, it is difficult to re-hydrate. Have you ever watered a dried out container, but the water just rolled off the surface? Often, that’s due to <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> in the container soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Compost is cheaper than <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> and fully sustainable in that you can easily make your own. On the other hand, compost won&rsquo;t last long like <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, and you&rsquo;ll have to add compost regularly. And lastly, compost will compact faster and easier than <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, but to have a comparable effect, you can add sand, shells, and eggshells to the soil to improve its texture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the best things to happen in the <strong>peat</strong> world in recent years is efforts toward making <strong>peat</strong> a renewable resource. Through organizations like the International Peat Society, ethical and ecologically sensitive harvesting has been put into practice. Living plant material is relocated to make extraction more ecological. They have developed initiatives to mitigate the conflicting interests of land protectors, conservationists, and <strong>peat</strong> producers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are into gardening, then <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is a term that you may have heard multiple times. It refers to a common medium designed for use in planting seedlings that promote healthy growth. Let’s learn more about this gardening staple/material called <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> through this article. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The argument is convincing to horticultural growing media producers such as Karl Hammer, who uses Canadian <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> in the mixes he makes for commercial greenhouse growers and others. “Obviously, it’s a resource that has to be used respectfully, but I don’t see it going away,” said Hammer, president of Vermont Compost Co. “We should focus on using less gasoline, not less <strong>peat</strong>.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The color of <strong>peat</strong> humus is dark brown to black. Unlike <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, it is a heavy substrate with a low water-holding capacity. However, it too has low pH (4-8, although acidic is more common), plus contains a small amount of nitrogen – 2.5 – 3 percent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Does not compact Even though <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> absorbs water well, it does not compact, unlike soil. The problem with compaction is that it makes it hard to create any space for the water and the air to pass through. By introducing <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to any compact material, the compaction problem is solved and makes the growing mix drain better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Of the 280 million acres of <strong>peat</strong>lands, only 0.03% may be harvested from virgin bogs. The <strong>peat</strong> mining industry is also tasked with restoring the <strong>peat</strong>lands by re-introducing plant species and re-establishing the water table. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> is not toxic as long as you take precautions. Be careful when working with it. When working with <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, it is best to use gloves to be safe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another one of the environmental concerns is that removing plants in bogs to access sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> contributes to global warming. The vast majority of plants in <strong>peat</strong> bogs sequester carbon dioxide. When all the plants are removed, the decomposition process <strong>peat</strong> goes through releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Top that off with the fossil fuels used to power the harvesters, and you may be able to see where the concerns lie. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A <strong>peat</strong> definition is in order! How did this material gardeners spring for at the local nursery go from its natural source to a plastic bag? Peat <strong>moss</strong> comes from sphagnum <strong>moss</strong>, harvested from <strong>peat</strong> bogs in the Northern Hemisphere. The <strong>moss</strong> is then decayed and dried in the <strong>peat</strong>land, meaning it is allowed to lie exposed to the sun. What results is a dark brown fibrous material that is excellent for gardening. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> is one of the most expensive soil amendments in the market for those that want to use it in improving their gardens. Most countries do not have <strong>peat</strong> bogs for extracting <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, and the costs tend to be high in areas that do not have <strong>peat</strong> bogs as the shipping costs are included. It is very expensive to amend an entire bed or garden with <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, and that is why only a smaller amount is normally used. This, therefore, means that <strong>peat</strong> becomes a very costly choice especially when one wants to amend an entire garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>peat</strong> bog is a product of numerous decaying plants, and is possible that the decomposing material may still have some diseases from the original plants. Extracting <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> from a diseased portion means the pathogens will be automatically transferred to your garden. It is easy for pathogens in <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to move easily to the roots as the substance retains a lot of water after extraction. The diseases can cause massive damage to the crop without anyone realizing the exact cause of the damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>On average, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> only grows by 0.02 inches (which is only 0.5 millimeters) every year. It is therefore, a very, very slow process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Understanding what makes perfect soil will get you well on your way to having the best garden ever. Regardless of your current soil texture, structure or tilth, you can change what you already have. Call it a soil makeover. By adding organic material like compost, humus, composted cow manure, leaf mulch, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, etc. – and a bit of persistence – you can greatly improve any soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although sometimes referred to as <strong>peat</strong>, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> and <strong>peat</strong> are not the same things. Peat <strong>moss</strong> is one of the products harvested from <strong>peat</strong> bogs. Other types of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> come from the partial decomposition of other organic materials. If you know how to make compost then you must know this type of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. The <strong>moss</strong> in <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> refers to sphagnum <strong>moss</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat producers make a persuasive argument that they are harvesting sustainably. (Canadian environmental groups I contacted had no position on <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You probably wonder how much <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> you should add to clay soil. Look no further. We have researched all about adding <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to clay soil, and we have the answers for you. Let&rsquo;s discuss! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As an alternative to <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, biochar is a really good option. It improves soil structure and water retention. When mixed in with your garden soil, it’s long lasting and will take a very long time to degrade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cleanliness You will love this characteristic the most if you know that lots of growing materials, especially organic ones are not really clean. With <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, you’ll find it easy to work with. And if you happen to drop some wet <strong>moss</strong>es, just pick it up, get it dried, or sweep it up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> is an excellent soil amendment for your acid-loving plants and vegetable gardens. There are approximately 12,000 species of <strong>moss</strong>, but it’s only the 380 species of sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> that create <strong>peat</strong>. Bogs and fens form where Canadian sphagnum grows because both living and dead <strong>moss</strong> absorb and store water. As it grows, it spreads onto drier areas and turns those into bogs as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Highland is unswayed. “There are many ways to argue what’s sustainable,” he said. “Any forest is sustainable if you plant more trees,” but the original old growth trees are gone, he said. A mined <strong>peat</strong> bog “is never going to return to its former self,” he said. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>– For small applications, the cost of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> isn’t likely to dent your wallet very much. However, any large scale use of it (like amending a whole garden area) can get pretty expensive. Acidity – You’ve probably noticed that this is listed in the ‘pros’ section as well. That’s because the acidity of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> can be either a positive or a negative depending on what you’re using it for. In this case, if you grow plants that need a neutral or alkaline soil, the acidity of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is a drawback. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before they ship <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to stores, producers have to sterilize it. Because <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is completely sterile, it’s free of bacteria, fungi, and weed seeds that could harm your plants. Other organic matter (compost, for example) carries the risk of contaminating your soil with these pathogens. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Aside from the soilless potting mix, you can also use <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> outdoors. You can till it to develop a planting or garden bed in case soil is not adequately friable. It also makes your garden soil lighter, thereby improving drainage and preventing compaction. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>PittMoss is a locally sourced, eco-friendly brand of potting mix and soil conditioner made of recycled paper. This product was designed to replace <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> (thus the clever name), and it has many of the same effects on soil. Worm castings: Worm castings (sometimes called vermicast) come from earthworms. They improve soil texture and add nutrients as a fertilizer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Because it’s sterile, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is one of the best seed-starting mediums. You can purchase small <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> pellets to insert into the soil where you want to plant seeds. Hydroponic growing: In hydroponic growing (aka soilless growing), you have to use a growing medium other than soil to support the roots of the plants. Peat <strong>moss</strong> mixed with perlite or vermiculite is a common choice because it holds water and nutrients but still has good drainage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Horse Manure: It bears re<strong>peat</strong>ing. If tempted to use horse manure, be sure to check out the link for the bioassay test. That little bit of time could save you years of grief. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Using <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to improve soil conditions has the advantage that it lasts long (a decade, depending on how much you add, the quality, the soil, crop etc.) On the other hand, <strong>peat</strong> is mainly corrective and not regenerative. The best way to change your soil quality permanently is through regenerative techniques. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you replant something, you need to make sure the plants will get enough moisture in order to establish themselves in the new location. Peat <strong>moss</strong> can help with that as well. Since it absorbs water and then holds it for quite some time, you won’t have to worry about watering your plants as often. The best recipe for a great transplanting mix involves two parts soil and one part <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. Spread the mix around the root balls of the shrubs or trees you’ve just transplanted. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best way to ensure you use the right amount of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is to go with a 2:1 ratio. This means you should add two parts of clay soil to one part of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. It is okay to use less <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> if what you are growing does not need a lot of water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat does not decay very easily in the bog conditions, due to the sphagnum cell structure and to slower-acting anaerobic conditions. Although it grows very slowly, it can accumulate to a depth of many meters. The live <strong>moss</strong> grows on top of the dead <strong>moss</strong>, and it is the dead <strong>moss</strong> that forms the <strong>peat</strong> we use in the garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When should I use <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> on my lawn? Peat <strong>moss</strong> uses can include lawn as well as garden. The timing is key, though. It’s best to use this material when you are planting sod, rather than using it while your lawn is growing. That’s because of the acidity spike it can create in the existing soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It is also helpful to add <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to clay soil because clay soil alone is not great for growing as much. In the long run, clay soil is made healthier when <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is added. Peat <strong>moss</strong> warms up faster than clay soil as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The base-level <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> pH is 5.5 (sometimes even more acidic at 4.0) at least at the start of its use. While this may not seem like a problem for people who love to grow acid-loving plants, the low pH of acidic soil may be an issue for plants that need alkaline or neutral soil. Using <strong>peat</strong> may initially make your soil pH low, but studies have shown it will neutralize within a day or so. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Virtually devoid of nutrients. Unlike other organic materials such as manure compost, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is very poor in nutrients. It also doesn’t contain any helpful microbes. So that means you can use <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> as an amendment to the soil and other materials, but you cannot use it alone and expect the plants will grow strongly and properly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> also has an incredible moisture-retention capability. This means that it is capable of absorbing and retaining water well. With that, it is the perfect place when it comes to seed starting. It also works as a great mix for other materials that can be used in growing plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> is the live <strong>moss</strong> that grows in <strong>peat</strong> bogs. It’s harvested while still alive. People use sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> to decorate potted plants or to line wire baskets for planting. Sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> that was harvested while alive isn’t a soil amendment like <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> bogs are fragile ecosystems that are slow to regenerate after being harvested. It takes one thousand years for them to grow a yard in depth. Even though harvest is carefully regulated, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is not considered a renewable resource or a sustainable product. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A: It doesn’t have any nutrition, and doesn’t compact as much as compost does. If you need a soil amendment that has macronutrients and micronutrients, go for compost. For aeration and lightening, go for <strong>peat</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Like <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> is harvested for the horticultural trade. For example, it is commonly used to line wire baskets for hanging plants to retain the soil. But the sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> used for this purpose was a plant growing in nature not long ago. You can also tell from its appearance that it is a type of <strong>moss</strong>, whereas <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> bears more resemblance to soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There you have it. Peat <strong>moss</strong> is harvested from bogs or mires and is used in planting or potting soil mixes for acid-loving plants. Peat <strong>moss</strong> is not a natural garden soil ingredient, but it will help your garden grow lovely flowers and delicious foods. موقع 888 - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As a growing mix, <strong>peat</strong> doesn’t need a lot of company. Pure, compressed bales of sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> are sold to consumers, but in mixtures for containers and seed starting, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is generally blended with inert minerals to improve its moisture- and nutrient-holding qualities: perlite, a volcanic glass, or vermiculite, a mica. Both are expanded by high heat. Typically, lime is added as well to raise the pH. One drawback is that if <strong>peat</strong> is allowed to dry out, it shrinks and is difficult to re-wet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is an important type of <strong>peat</strong> because it has high nutrient content, making it useful in growing Cattleya Orchids because orchids like organic material in their soil. It&rsquo;s also used for potted flowering plants and nurseries that produce bedding plants. It&rsquo;s a little more acidic than sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> and holds more water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Water retention – One of the most sought after characteristics of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is its ability to retain moisture and release it to plant roots. It holds water much better than normal soils, compost, and many other growing mediums. Even better, instead of getting soggy and causing root rot, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is able to release water as needed to plants as long as it’s not completely saturated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The most significant disadvantages of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> are it&rsquo;s too acidic for non-acid-loving plants, it&rsquo;s not renewable, and it doesn&rsquo;t have any nutrients. The upside to <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is it&rsquo;s sterile and free of weed seeds; however, weeds can still grow in <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> once you start using it and it&rsquo;s exposed to the elements. Also, once you start using it, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> can attract bugs like fungus gnats since it&rsquo;s also decaying. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>the fibers <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is made of decompose slowly, and because they have been “treated” underwater for a very, long time, they are even more difficult to break down. This means that it has a very long life in the ground. Peat <strong>moss</strong> is fully organic: by now you know that it is sourced from bogs and it is fully natural. However, the quarrying and transportation does burn a lot of fossil fuels, so, if it is produced organically, it is not harvested and delivered organically. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What can I use instead of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>? There are several choices! One of the most commonly used alternatives is coconut coir, a material made of coconut fiber that is extracted from broken-down coconut shells. Coconut coir can have a high salinity content, though, making it necessary to water more. Other materials like worm castings serve a similar function, adding water retentive properties to the soil which helps gardeners grow plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Concerns for <strong>peat</strong> bogs have led to the creation of alternatives using compost, pine bark and coconut fiber. From left: <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, Organic Mechanics Planting Mix Compost Blend, Organic Mechanics Premium Blend Potting Soil, PittMoss Prime cellulosic fibers and Organic Mechanics rice hulls. The hulls are a substitute for perlite. (Wendy Galietta/The Washington Post) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Undoubtedly, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> has a lot of natural uses in the field of gardening. Some of its viable uses are for potting soil, planting seeds, plant compost, and transplanting plants. This gardening material is kind of expensive, though, so it is not advisable to use it alone. Include it in or combined it with garden soil as it can lower the cost while letting you enjoy this gardening staple’s benefits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You shouldn’t use <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> alone as a seed starter. Start with it as your base ingredient and add an aerating ingredient like perlite or vermiculite. You can also add a tiny amount of fertilizer to feed your seedlings once they start growing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>this makes it a good acidity corrector, especially with plants that cannot stand and alkaline soil. Peat <strong>moss</strong> helps break the ground; putting organic matter in the soil, and in all cases varying the texture of the soil, allows for better aeration, feeding and humidity retention. Because the fibers of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> beak down slowly, it has become popular with gardeners who want to correct the texture of clay soil in particular. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> is now used in a lot of soilless potting mixes. This means that if you already began to cultivate plants indoors using seedlings, it is greatly possible that you have also used the sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. It would be a lot better for you to use the soilless potting mix when it comes to starting seeds because of the following: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Use <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> as ⅓ – ⅔ of your total potting soil mix. The rest can be mainly compost or store-bought soil with perlite and some type of fertilizer added in. If you are growing plants that need a neutral to alkaline pH, add in some lime to balance out the <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Due to <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> decaying very slowly, it continues to break down for quite some time. You do not have to worry about weeds being in <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. It is sterilized before it is sold. That makes it so <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> does not have fungi or bacteria. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Black <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>– Although technically a type of sphagnum, black <strong>peat</strong> usually refers to older, more decomposed <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> that is darker in color when dried. For garden use, the <strong>peat</strong> is allowed to freeze when wet to improve its water retention. However, it still only retains water at 4 times its own weight.The final product usually ends up being dark brown in color (rather than black) and with much finer particles than sphagnum. Black <strong>peat</strong> is most frequently used by commercial growers like mushroom producers in blends, rather than by the home gardener. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re going to use soil, mix equal parts of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, vermiculite or perlite, and soil, plus fertilizers (optional). Finding the perfect mix might not be an easy task. You might have to experiment with a couple of them before finding the right one, but this is absolutely normal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most of the US’s sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> resources come from Canada or the northern parts of the United States. Sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> grows specifically in wetlands in tundra areas. There are sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> bogs in South America as well, but our commercial <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> comes from the north. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What makes this variant different is that it has a somewhat crumbly feel. Basically, it is a soil amendment harvested or taken out of <strong>peat</strong> bogs. You can find a lot of <strong>peat</strong> bogs in wetland parts of Canada. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Overall, you should go with a 2:1 ratio to mix <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> in clay soil. If you use too much, the ground will become loamy. If you do not use enough, the clay soil will not retain water nearly as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While <strong>peat</strong> is very moisture retentive, the fibrous material is also hydrophobic when it dries out. Therefore, it takes a significant amount of water to re-activate the retention it provides when slightly moist. Peat soil that has dried out may require some kind of surfactant, or wetting agent to break the tension and allow it to absorb water again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although sometimes referred to as &ldquo;<strong>peat</strong>&rdquo; for short, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> and <strong>peat</strong> are not, technically, the same. &ldquo;Peat&rdquo; is the broader term: Peat <strong>moss</strong> is just one of the products harvested from <strong>peat</strong> bogs. Other kinds of <strong>peat</strong> come from the partial decomposition of other organic materials. The &ldquo;<strong>moss</strong>&rdquo; in &ldquo;<strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>&rdquo; refers specifically to sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> (for example, Sphagnum cymbifolium). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> has been maligned in recent years by those who say that it is a non-renewable resource that destroys important natural environments. Canada, which supplies most of the <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> available in North America, strictly regulates the harvesting of <strong>peat</strong> and the maintenance of bogs. Of Canada&rsquo;s great reserves of <strong>peat</strong>, Cornell University states that only .02 percent are subject to harvesting. An environmental evaluation is always done before a virgin Canadian <strong>peat</strong> bog is harvested. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You should work <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> into clay soil a few inches deep to 12 inches deep. It is essential to do this at least two times each year. When you add <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to clay soil, the soil should be dry. The <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> holds moisture, absorbed once you mix it a few inches into the ground. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>moss</strong> is an excellent amendment, particularly in sandy soils or in potted plants that have difficulty retaining moisture. We’ll talk more about how to use <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> later. First up, a few distinctions! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>An ideal soil will retain enough moisture to keep your plants irrigated. But you do not want all of the water to pass quickly through your soil. It is a delicate balance, and <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, with its ability to retain water, will help you achieve that balance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There is another major concern regarding the impact of <strong>peat</strong> mining. It turns out that <strong>peat</strong> is a tremendously potent terrestrial carbon storage medium. Consequently, mining <strong>peat</strong> rids us of an important carbon sink in times of drastic climate change. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> is not sustainable; it takes Nature 500 years to make 10 inches of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. This issue has become central in the gardening world, and especially in the organic community and among gardeners who are aware of sustainability. Its quarrying is now strictly limited and regulated in many countries, like in Canada, in fact. Most gardeners have that feeling of remorse when using it nowadays. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In northern Europe, dried <strong>peat</strong> has been used for centuries as fuel — raising its profile as a source of atmospheric carbon dioxide — and people live closer to ancient bogland that has been drained for agriculture and development. In Canada, by contrast, <strong>peat</strong> isn’t used as a fuel, and its sheer acreage in less populated areas works in favor of its mining. Canada is the second-largest country on Earth and has 25 percent of the globe’s <strong>peat</strong>lands. The bogs are drained before harvesting, and the top layers of <strong>peat</strong> are mined with a large vacuum apparatus. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Did you know? I’ve been reading a case against <strong>peat</strong> from the University of Georgia Extension. The article discusses the double-edged sword nature of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>! Here’s what it means. Soil mixes with <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> are often lightweight, provide excellent drainage, and also retain water! So yes – <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> rocks for gardening! But – Mining for <strong>peat</strong> also releases oodles of CO2 and may contribute to global warming. Double-edged-sword. Peat <strong>moss</strong> style! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The top portion of the sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> has its uses, too. While it’s stringier than the deeper decayed <strong>moss</strong>, it is often used in reptile cages or terrarium use. It is not as decayed, and still resembles the plant it used to be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> is partially decayed sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> found in the upper layers of <strong>peat</strong>land and bog sediments. It has low pH, light brown color, is airy, and retains water very well. Peat <strong>moss</strong> is one of the most common components of soilless mixes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>putting organic matter in the soil, and in all cases varying the texture of the soil, allows for better aeration, feeding and humidity retention. Because the fibers of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> beak down slowly, it has become popular with gardeners who want to correct the texture of clay soil in particular. Peat <strong>moss</strong> is sterile; because it has formed in an anaerobic environment and many bacteria need oxygen to live, it is free from pathogens that can harm the roots of your plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Don’t confuse <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> (also sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>) with sphagnum <strong>moss</strong>. They come from the same plants, any of the Sphagnopsida class but they are not the exact same thing. Peat <strong>moss</strong> is what ends up under the water of these plants, while sphagnum <strong>moss</strong> is collected from the still living floating parts of the plant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>it is not decomposing matter, which means that while you can use it to change the texture and properties of your soil, it is not the best choice if you have organic regeneration in mind. For example, earthworms are not attracted to <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>, nor are many of the microorganisms that turn the soiled fertile. The acidity of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> does not suit all plants; most plants, as you know, love neutral to alkaline soil, and <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is acidic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although compost is nutrient-rich, it doesn’t compare to <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> when it comes to anti-compaction capabilities. Much of this is related to the moisture-retentive properties of <strong>peat</strong>, which keeps the soil it’s in aerated and light. It’s an excellent amendment for topsoil, which can compact quickly and easily. I know <strong>peat</strong> in soil would have been a welcome addition to my first raised bed, which I readily filled with the cheapest topsoil I could find, only to plant my crops in what was essentially cement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> is sometimes maligned among eco-conscious gardeners. While they’re not wrong to question the origin of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> sold in stores, the truth is more complicated than one might think. Therefore, the topic deserves examination and discussion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yes, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> will break up clay soil. Peat <strong>moss</strong> breaking up clay soil is important is that clay soil does not retain water very well at all. That scenario is not ideal for plant life to thrive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Clay soil that has been over-watered is slippery. When it is not wet enough or <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> has not yet been added, the clay soil tends to be dry. After you add in your <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> and fertilizer or compost, your clay soil should become more spring-like for a couple of months. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hydrangeas need acidic soil to produce blue flowers. Alkaline soils will turn flowers pink. If you have a hydrangea bush that you want to be blue, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is an easy soil amendment to increase acidity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>– Peat <strong>moss</strong> is excellent at holding nutrients in the soil, but it doesn’t have much nutrient value on its own. At best, it will have trace nutrients, so it’s not a good choice for feeding your plants. Cost – For small applications, the cost of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> isn’t likely to dent your wallet very much. However, any large scale use of it (like amending a whole garden area) can get pretty expensive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Adding <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to clay soil has a few benefits. People mainly add <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to clay soil to amend it. It is a great soil amendment for plants that love acidic soil, such as blueberries and azaleas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Watch the pH of your mixture Though strictly acid-hungry plants love <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> with its low pH level, that does not mean others will do. You will need to add some pH-high materials like lime to create a neutral or alkaline environment. And be ready to monitor the pH level of the growing environment to ensure it does not drift too much. Another issue with soil pH is that with too many amendments added to change pH level, the soil can suffer. When it comes to growing, natural soil is ideal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> is used to add structure and water holding capacity to your raised beds. Oddly it both promotes great drainage and holds water that plant roots can access as needed. Peat <strong>moss</strong> has a rather wide quality range and using the best quality <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> you can afford is recommended. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As <strong>peat</strong>land stores a great percentage of carbon. Many environmental groups are beware of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> mining. The International Peat Society indicates that the harvesting process emits a large amount of carbon into the atmosphere. And the emission continues even after the mining. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you wish to use <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> for pure hydroponic growing, you should know some facts about why it is not appropriate. Because <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is an organic matter, if provided with plenty of oxygen and nitrogen, it will start to decompose. When that happens, the material can compress around plant roots and will choke off your plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>And finally, <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> is not renewable. So if you are environmentally aware, you may want to reduce your use of <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> to just seed starting, pot, container, and soilless mixes instead of soil amendment, and lawn work in large quantities. Or you can completely replace it with other alternatives like compost, coco coir, pine bark, and other organic matters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In Britain, for example, using <strong>peat</strong> has become taboo. The government’s environmental agency has said it wanted to phase out <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> for hobby gardeners by 2020 and commercially by 2030. The London-based Royal Horticultural Society, the largest gardening organization of its kind in the world, has reduced <strong>peat</strong> use by 97 percent at its four major gardens and urges its members to follow its lead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Highland, whose products are carried by Whole Foods Market, says he has seen steady growth in the past decade but not the explosive growth he and others had expected. On this side of the Atlantic, the ecological arguments against <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong> have been far more muted. Whatever the reasons, the issue has not seeped into most consumers’ consciousness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat <strong>moss</strong> is not only organic, and has excellent water holding capacity, but it is also completely sterile. As we mentioned in the last section, there are no chemicals used in processing <strong>peat</strong> <strong>moss</strong>. Because there are no fungi, bacteria, and weed seeds, this media is clean as a whistle. Peat <strong>moss</strong> also has antiseptic qualities that originate in polysaccharides which suck harmful bacteria into cell walls. There’s a long and very interesting history of the use of this <strong>moss</strong> in medicine and as bandages. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/2e/4b/8b/2e4b8b789555b10457a17a0840db541e--frames-image.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Use Peat Moss In Vegetable Garden - Can I Put Peat Moss On Top Of Soil">
Here are a few tips to help you find information about What Is Peat Moss? Uses in Gardens and Potted Plants:
