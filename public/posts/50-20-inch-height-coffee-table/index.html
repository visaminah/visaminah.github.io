It’s important to get the right size and shape table for your room, so get out your tape measure before searching, Rains wrote. - Source: Internet From an ergonomic standpoint, an end table that’s the proper height is one that’s easier to use. If you plan on getting a lot out of your tables—as a source of light, perhaps, or as a place to set books or other decorations—it’s always better to make sure you can reach it comfortably. An end table that’s too tall or too short could limit the efficiency of your piece. - Source: Internet When choosing the best coffee table for your space, consider the other pieces in your room: are they dark or light? Simple or embellished? Shiny or distressed? Choose a coffee table that complements your existing décor – or start with a coffee table you love and pick out other pieces to match it! – to create a cohesive aesthetic. (You can also choose based on organizational needs; many designs come with hidden storage.) - Source: Internet There’s more to end table aesthetics than just style. Though the material and design of your piece are major factors in determining their appropriateness in your room, it’s impossible to ignore the major impact height can have on a room’s overall vibes. If an end table is significantly taller than the couch or chair it’s placed beside, or is much shorter, it can throw off the balance of your room and make it appear awkward. - Source: Internet At Bassett, we’re dedicated to an old-fashioned work ethic. We design and build high-quality coffee tables with close attention to detail and superior craftsmanship. With our BenchMade line, our artisan craftsmen create furniture to suit your needs and style one piece at a time. - Source: Internet Check the proportions and visual impact. A storage ottoman or closed-volume table will feel weighty in a room, Hilliard wrote, so consider an oval to make the piece appear a little sleeker and a neutral color to keep it understated. - Source: Internet The general rule is that the depth of your end table should correspond to the depth of the sofa (or chair) it stands beside. Anything shorter (or especially longer) can throw off the balance of your room. For reference, standard end table depth ranges between 22-24 inches. - Source: Internet How many hours do we put into choosing the perfect sofa, the perfect rug, the perfect chairs for our living room…only to throw in a hand-me-down coffee table that used to belong to Aunt Susan? (bless her heart). Okay, we don’t all go down the who-cares-about-a-coffee-table route. Plenty of you have definitely belabored the choice of a table, we’re sure, but regardless of what side of those scenarios you find yourself, you might need some guidance or inspiration in the coffee table shopping department. What size and shape go with what sofa size and shape? It might feel like a shot in the dark, but fear not, we’re here to help. We’ve put together a shopping guide with all the best coffee tables we could find—round, square, rectangular, oval!—and a few rules to keep in mind (with a diagram!) when choosing a coffee table. - Source: Internet Some storage coffee tables even have drawers or open shelving. Bassett’s beautiful selection is designed in a way that brings style in functionality together seamlessly. Keep your living room organized and tidy with extra modularity and freedom. - Source: Internet Coffee tables are useful for a variety of reasons. Use it to kick up your feet and watch TV after a long day. Cover it with your favorite trinkets and decorations, like vases, books, and potted plants. Use it as a tray to serve meals and drinks to your friends and family. - Source: Internet Don’t forget style. A coffee table is a work horse but is also an important design element in any room, Rains wrote. - Source: Internet Stop by a Bassett showroom near you and see our collection of stylish coffee tables. Get inspired by the new looks and innovative design. Then, when you’re ready, book an appointment with a Bassett design consultant. They’ll help you turn inspiration into reality with furniture that looks beautiful and will last a lifetime. - Source: Internet Standard end table height ranges between 18-24 inches. In other words, these tables range from approximately 1.5-2 feet off the ground, with an average width of around 16-22 inches. - Source: Internet “A glass coffee table will add lightness and airiness to the space, but it isn’t suitable for bearing a lot of weight, resting feet or being bumped into by little ones,” she wrote. “A rich material choice with treasured objects atop it will draw the eye, so keeping other design choices clean-lined and more monochromatic will stave off visual overload.” - Source: Internet “Less than 18 inches spacing narrows circulation and greater than 18 inches of space makes it a stretch to set down a drink or rest your feet,” she says. “If the chairs perpendicular to your sofa seem to be crossing into the space in front of your sofa, your coffee table needs to be longer.” - Source: Internet When you have such a tall piece, levels are the name of the game. On the left, we have a tall lamp, a mid-sized piece of the art and piece of nature, and a low stack of books. But on the right, with a narrower table, Ginny was able to fake the illusion of additional levels by grounding her art and nature with a bold printed book. In any case, WOW, I have been way over-styling my tables!!! - Source: Internet As you lay out the plan for your living room, think about the best shape for the space. Do you have children or pets? Is it a large room or is it small and narrow? A round or oval coffee table is ideal if you have children or pets. The curved edge means a sharp corner injures no one if one falls or bumps into it. Using a rectangular shape and allowing 30 inches between the television console and the coffee table will give you the right amount of room to walk between the two pieces. A rounded one gives a little more room to walk past, as it will curve away from the television console. - Source: Internet Coffee tables are often chosen after sofas and other décors, making them the last piece of the puzzle when designing a living room. The perfect distance from your sofa to your coffee table is 18 inches, which is generally a good arm’s length. For added comfort, make sure the height of the coffee or cocktail table is two inches below the height of your sofa. - Source: Internet If you have a large comfy sectional or the traditional conversational set up with a sofa and a couple of chairs (kind of like Ginny’s living room above), a square table is a great choice. It fits perfectly in the L-shape nook of your sectional or the big space in the middle of your chat zone. The best part of a square table? You get the most styling space bang for your buck. Who doesn’t love a well-styled coffee table vignette? We really like the mix of the square top and round base of table #1 or #18 for a play on shapes. Similar to the shadow box table we talked about in the previous section, #2 from IKEA has a drawer with four sections, and the glass top lets you see all the pretty things you decide to store (definitely not the best option if you know you’ll just end up junking up that drawer with remotes and catalogs, though). - Source: Internet According to interior designer and CEO of Kathy Kuo Home , Kathy Kuo, there’s no one right way to go about buying a side or end table. “Choose a table that compliments your larger anchor pieces (sofas, arm chairs, and coffee tables). It can blend in or stand out,” she says. - Source: Internet We were noticing that this was a post that a lot of people have been looking at recently so we thought let’s just put it up at the top of the blog again! Picking out a coffee table is something that you think you just instinctually know how to do… until it’s time to find one. That’s why we made this post so you don’t have to guess what size, shape, or type you need to make the perfect sofa match. Enjoy this quick little republish with updated shippable picks. xx - Source: Internet Living room design trends are constantly changing, and coffee tables aren’t exempt from this. Contemporary design is all about eccentricity and simplicity, with a minimalist focus being popular in many homes today. Why buy furniture that’s square or circular when you can buy furniture of other shapes? - Source: Internet Instead, width is better determined by the functionality you’d like to receive from the piece. Naturally, wider end tables can hold more items (lamps, books, etc.), while shorter ones are more limited in convenience. - Source: Internet Coffee tables are one of the most flexible pieces of furniture in your home. They normally rest in front of your living room sofa and give you a place to put knick-knacks, rest your feet, or set your food on. You can blend them in with your décor or use one as an accent piece to set the room’s style. - Source: Internet “The height of the table should be generally between 14 to 20 inches tall,” she wrote. “I prefer the table to be approximately two inches lower than the seat height on your sofa. Keep approximately 16 inches from the edge of the table to the sofa and at least 28 to 30 inches to the TV cabinet or furniture opposite the sofa. A table should be two-thirds the length of your sofa for correct proportion.” - Source: Internet My frequency illusion kicked in recently when I was looking for styling inspiration for some new end tables. I was feeling overwhelmed with making my tables work in my space — my lamps felt way too big and tall, the surfaces felt crowed with ephemera, and I was just NOT feeling it — so I decided to peek through our archives to see how the actual pros on our team do it. AND Y’ALL, THERE’S A FORMULA. AND IT’S SO EASY. AND I LOVE MY TABLES NOW. - Source: Internet Once you figure out the right size and shape, after that, it’s more about making the right design choice for your space. Rectangular and oval-shaped coffee tables can almost be interchanged, depending on what kind of flow you’re looking for—same goes with round and square. Let’s break it down a bit further (with the bonus of our favorite shopping picks): - Source: Internet With this in mind, let’s turn our attention to more comprehensive end table sizing information. For the best results, you’ll want to consider the depth and width of your prospective end table as well. Let’s take a look at each in turn. - Source: Internet “If there are small children in the home, consider opting for a fabric covered ottoman with legs for comfort and soft edges — just make sure it is large enough that it does not look like a chair ottoman,” Rains wrote. “A primitive wood table that won’t show wear and tear is also a great choice with children in the home.” - Source: Internet Different designs bring different personalities into the home; modern coffee tables come in an array of silhouettes but will generally feature clean lines. Stick to straight legs and neutral colors, or ramp it up with angled legs and distressed textures for a more retro, mid-century feel. Rectangle and square coffee tables are classic shapes, but more curved or softer edges can bring a homier vibe. - Source: Internet Use wood coffee tables as an accessory, or present a dynamic focal point to your living room. At Bassett Furniture, we design tables that are not only practical but also give your room that wow factor. We create centerpieces, not afterthoughts. - Source: Internet PS. If you’ve been similarly awakened and now you’re like, “holy crap, I just need to clear off some space and grab a floor lamp to make my space work,” Julie rounded up 39 of our favorites. (You know what else you’ll see in that post? End tables styled with books, one natural element, and a lamp nearby.) - Source: Internet Coffee tables shaped like a hexagon, a trapezoid, or even abstract shapes are in vogue. Additionally, bright colors are in, making the coffee table a signature accent piece for your home. Neon colors can make a room with traditional furniture pop. - Source: Internet The price points for a coffee table can range from ultra-expensive to very budget friendly, so before you start shopping know what you have to spend on it. Your overall budget should be broken down to into areas such as, accessories, lighting and furniture. The furniture line item includes the sofa, side tables, chairs and coffee table, with a larger portion allocated to the bigger pieces. The good news is that you can bend a little on your budget if you see something you love as long as it does not comprise the quality of the sofa or chairs. - Source: Internet Coffee tables can vary in size, but most of them are 18 to 24 inches wide, 36 to 48 inches long, and 16 to 18 inches tall. This makes the accent piece a sizable addition to any room, so it’s important to make sure there’s plenty of clearance around the table for people to walk around. The last thing you want is for your guests to feel cramped in your room, so plan the size of your table accordingly. - Source: Internet Formal, informal, modern or vintage; these are all styles to be considered when purchasing your coffee table. If you favor a contemporary look, choose a sleek metal table with a glass top. If country casual is more your speed, a rustic oak table would be perfect. Pick a round table with wood turned legs for a romantic feel. There are many styles to choose from, just use the decorating scheme of the room as your guide. - Source: Internet If your living room furniture tends to wrap around your area rug, consider getting a round or square size coffee table. The uniformity of each edge will make it easy for everyone to reach the coffee table without having to reach it, and the perfect size will fill empty space around the living room area. For those who have children or smaller spaces, avoiding corners may be important. In this case, round and oval coffee tables are preferable. - Source: Internet Consider rectangle (or oval but more on this shape next) if you have a standard sofa (or an extra-long sofa with chaise) so everyone can have easy access to their coffee, cocktail, or late-night snack of choice. This is also a great choice if you have a narrow space with minimal walk-around clearance. If you’re a household with more remotes or tech cords than you can count, think about getting a table with some functional but still sleek drawers like #1, #4, #18, or #21. It’s hard to see in the photo, but the table at #2 has a shadow box top (that’s great for putting in your favorite curiosities and trinkets but still having plenty of surface area for you know…real life stuff. Oh, and if you regularly eat in front of your TV (whether by choice or because you don’t actually have a formal dining area), a lift-top coffee table is super useful for not having to hunch over your plate (#10 and #20). - Source: Internet Side tables come in many different shapes, materials, and styles – and they offer a variety of features. Choose from round, rectangular, and square side tables. When selecting a shape, consider your other furnishings and choose a shape that provides visual contrast. For example, balance a large round ottoman with a rectangular side table. Or if you have a sectional that features sharp angles, juxtapose it with a small round side table. - Source: Internet Sleek and compact, side tables are perfect to hold your mugs and magazines. Whether it’s oak, mirrored or white tables that you need to complement your décor, our huge range has the perfect sizing and finish. Opt for square metal styles or round glass for your bed or a sofa side, or browse our pretty vases to create a statement corner. - Source: Internet Yes, these kinds of tables can look fantastic in family rooms and living rooms. A low profile makes it easy to rest your feet on and can act in place of an ottoman. The shorter look also gives it a unique look for your room and can serve as the accent piece in your furniture set. They’re great for kids, too, since younger children won’t have any issues putting things on the tabletop. - Source: Internet ANYWAY. Now that we’ve gone over how to pick an accent table and how to style it, let’s dive into some EHD-approved picks! (PS. Thanks to my whole team for helping me assemble these graphics and links. Sometimes I go a little overboard with the pinning — there are just so many good tables, guys!!! — and I need help assembling everything. That said, I looked literally everywhere on the internet and these are the cutest ones for every style at every price point!) - Source: Internet Consider the function. Think about how you plan to use the table before buying one, Hilliard wrote. Your choice of size and material will be affected if you plan to use the table to display objects, for extra storage, for food and drinks when entertaining or if you have children who need soft edges to avoid getting hurt, Hilliard wrote. - Source: Internet MY FAVORITE USE. End tables are often a little more affordable than their full-sized coffee table cousins, so grab two (or three, if your space is enormous) and let them live in front of your sofa. Added bonus: if you want to shake things up a bit, you can repurpose these lil cuties as nightstands (or, you know, as actual side tables), which make them a more budget-friendly choice for those of us who are frequently shaking things up at home. - Source: Internet You didn’t think I was gonna let you get to the next styling formula without looking at some EHD projects, did you? I’M A HYPE MAN, BABY. Jess’ malachite end table is the perfect example of playing with scale: it’s a little lower than what we normally see, but it’s balanced by the height of the floor lamp. Similarly, Sara’s drum table is a small grounding force for her lighter-weight chairs in this open concept space. And minimalists can rejoice: look at that styling! So simple, so easy. - Source: Internet And let’s also take a second to look at what makes each of these rooms above work: both leggy tables are balancing out a chunkier, grounded sofa. The round table on the left speaks to the hits of black in the room, the light wood coffee table (the full reveal here is so good), and it echoes the geometric shape of the pillows. On the right, we’re seeing a traditional silhouette that reflects the black metal base of the coffee table. - Source: Internet OKAY. WE’RE DONE. Just a casual reminder (as your resident Craigslist and FB Marketplace fanatic), if you see anything you love and you don’t want to pay full price, be sure to search for vendor and item names daily! That’s how Bowser scored a great deal on her end tables (that she used as nightstands, but still). - Source: Internet “This also balances the scale and makes the area look better proportioned,” Rains wrote. “If your space is small, choose a lower height table with a smaller dimension. An acrylic or glass table will also make a space appear larger.” - Source: Internet The recent months at home have led many people to reevaluate the comfort and configuration of their furniture. Whether you want to purchase all new furniture or upgrade the look of your family room, your coffee table may be a good place to start. If you’re like most people, your coffee table functions as a serving table, a footrest, a repository for books and magazines, a workstation and your jigsaw-puzzle spot. Choosing the right size, shape and material for your coffee table can make a big difference in how it works and how long it lasts. - Source: Internet Another important factor is to know what the primary use will be. Will the table be more decorative, or provide storage? How much storage will be enough? Tables can come with shelves, or drawers to hold everything from kids’ toys to that stash of magazines you will someday read. Regardless if storage is needed, there is still a good chance you will want to be able to place a drink or a plate down without the risk of tipping over. Pick a piece that will hold drinks and snack plates with ease. If décor is more the purpose, you can focus on one with lines and texture in a material you love. - Source: Internet Following are some suggestions for where to begin your search for data on Ikea Side Table:\rYou should try to find 22 Inch High Coffee Table-related information from reputable places.

It’s important to get the right size and shape <strong>table</strong> for your room, so get out your tape measure before searching, Rains wrote. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>From an ergonomic standpoint, an end <strong>table</strong> that’s the proper <strong>height</strong> is one that’s easier to use. If you plan on getting a lot out of your <strong>table</strong>s—as a source of light, perhaps, or as a place to set books or other decorations—it’s always better to make sure you can reach it comfortably. An end <strong>table</strong> that’s too tall or too short could limit the efficiency of your piece. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When choosing the best coffee <strong>table</strong> for your space, consider the other pieces in your room: are they dark or light? Simple or embellished? Shiny or distressed? Choose a coffee <strong>table</strong> that complements your existing décor – or start with a coffee <strong>table</strong> you love and pick out other pieces to match it! – to create a cohesive aesthetic. (You can also choose based on organizational needs; many designs come with hidden storage.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There’s more to end <strong>table</strong> aesthetics than just style. Though the material and design of your piece are major factors in determining their appropriateness in your room, it’s impossible to ignore the major impact <strong>height</strong> can have on a room’s overall vibes. If an end <strong>table</strong> is significantly taller than the couch or chair it’s placed beside, or is much shorter, it can throw off the balance of your room and make it appear awkward. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At Bassett, we’re dedicated to an old-fashioned work ethic. We design and build high-quality coffee <strong>table</strong>s with close attention to detail and superior craftsmanship. With our BenchMade line, our artisan craftsmen create furniture to suit your needs and style one piece at a time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=2><li>Check the proportions and visual impact. A storage ottoman or closed-volume <strong>table</strong> will feel weighty in a room, Hilliard wrote, so consider an oval to make the piece appear a little sleeker and a neutral color to keep it understated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>The general rule is that the depth of your end <strong>table</strong> should correspond to the depth of the sofa (or chair) it stands beside. Anything shorter (or especially longer) can throw off the balance of your room. For reference, standard end <strong>table</strong> depth ranges between 22-24 inches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>How many hours do we put into choosing the perfect sofa, the perfect rug, the perfect chairs for our living room…only to throw in a hand-me-down coffee <strong>table</strong> that used to belong to Aunt Susan? (bless her heart). Okay, we don’t all go down the who-cares-about-a-coffee-<strong>table</strong> route. Plenty of you have definitely belabored the choice of a <strong>table</strong>, we’re sure, but regardless of what side of those scenarios you find yourself, you might need some guidance or inspiration in the coffee <strong>table</strong> shopping department. What size and shape go with what sofa size and shape? It might feel like a shot in the dark, but fear not, we’re here to help. We’ve put together a shopping guide with all the best coffee <strong>table</strong>s we could find—round, square, rectangular, oval!—and a few rules to keep in mind (with a diagram!) when choosing a coffee <strong>table</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some storage coffee <strong>table</strong>s even have drawers or open shelving. Bassett&rsquo;s beautiful selection is designed in a way that brings style in functionality together seamlessly. Keep your living room organized and tidy with extra modularity and freedom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Coffee <strong>table</strong>s are useful for a variety of reasons. Use it to kick up your feet and watch TV after a long day. Cover it with your favorite trinkets and decorations, like vases, books, and potted plants. Use it as a tray to serve meals and drinks to your friends and family. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=4><li>Don’t forget style. A coffee <strong>table</strong> is a work horse but is also an important design element in any room, Rains wrote. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Stop by a Bassett showroom near you and see our collection of stylish coffee <strong>table</strong>s. Get inspired by the new looks and innovative design. Then, when you’re ready, book an appointment with a Bassett design consultant. They’ll help you turn inspiration into reality with furniture that looks beautiful and will last a lifetime. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Standard end <strong>table</strong> <strong>height</strong> ranges between 18-24 inches. In other words, these <strong>table</strong>s range from approximately 1.5-2 feet off the ground, with an average width of around 16-22 inches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“A glass coffee <strong>table</strong> will add lightness and airiness to the space, but it isn’t sui<strong>table</strong> for bearing a lot of weight, resting feet or being bumped into by little ones,” she wrote. “A rich material choice with treasured objects atop it will draw the eye, so keeping other design choices clean-lined and more monochromatic will stave off visual overload.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“Less than 18 inches spacing narrows circulation and greater than 18 inches of space makes it a stretch to set down a drink or rest your feet,” she says. “If the chairs perpendicular to your sofa seem to be crossing into the space in front of your sofa, your coffee <strong>table</strong> needs to be longer.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you have such a tall piece, levels are the name of the game. On the left, we have a tall lamp, a mid-sized piece of the art and piece of nature, and a low stack of books. But on the right, with a narrower <strong>table</strong>, Ginny was able to fake the illusion of additional levels by grounding her art and nature with a bold printed book. In any case, WOW, I have been way over-styling my <strong>table</strong>s!!! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As you lay out the plan for your living room, think about the best shape for the space. Do you have children or pets? Is it a large room or is it small and narrow? A round or oval coffee <strong>table</strong> is ideal if you have children or pets. The curved edge means a sharp corner injures no one if one falls or bumps into it. Using a rectangular shape and allowing 30 inches between the television console and the coffee <strong>table</strong> will give you the right amount of room to walk between the two pieces. A rounded one gives a little more room to walk past, as it will curve away from the television console. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Coffee <strong>table</strong>s are often chosen after sofas and other décors, making them the last piece of the puzzle when designing a living room. The perfect distance from your sofa to your coffee <strong>table</strong> is 18 inches, which is generally a good arm&rsquo;s length. For added comfort, make sure the <strong>height</strong> of the coffee or cocktail <strong>table</strong> is two inches below the <strong>height</strong> of your sofa. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you have a large comfy sectional or the traditional conversational set up with a sofa and a couple of chairs (kind of like Ginny’s living room above), a square <strong>table</strong> is a great choice. It fits perfectly in the L-shape nook of your sectional or the big space in the middle of your chat zone. The best part of a square <strong>table</strong>? You get the most styling space bang for your buck. Who doesn’t love a well-styled coffee <strong>table</strong> vignette? We really like the mix of the square top and round base of <strong>table</strong> #1 or #18 for a play on shapes. Similar to the shadow box <strong>table</strong> we talked about in the previous section, #2 from IKEA has a drawer with four sections, and the glass top lets you see all the pretty things you decide to store (definitely not the best option if you know you’ll just end up junking up that drawer with remotes and catalogs, though). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>According to interior designer and CEO of Kathy Kuo Home , Kathy Kuo, there&rsquo;s no one right way to go about buying a side or end <strong>table</strong>. &ldquo;Choose a <strong>table</strong> that compliments your larger anchor pieces (sofas, arm chairs, and coffee <strong>table</strong>s). It can blend in or stand out,&rdquo; she says. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We were noticing that this was a post that a lot of people have been looking at recently so we thought let’s just put it up at the top of the blog again! Picking out a coffee <strong>table</strong> is something that you think you just instinctually know how to do… until it’s time to find one. That’s why we made this post so you don’t have to guess what size, shape, or type you need to make the perfect sofa match. Enjoy this quick little republish with updated shippable picks. xx - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Living room design trends are constantly changing, and coffee <strong>table</strong>s aren&rsquo;t exempt from this. Contemporary design is all about eccentricity and simplicity, with a minimalist focus being popular in many homes today. Why buy furniture that&rsquo;s square or circular when you can buy furniture of other shapes? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Instead, width is better determined by the functionality you’d like to receive from the piece. Naturally, wider end <strong>table</strong>s can hold more items (lamps, books, etc.), while shorter ones are more limited in convenience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Coffee <strong>table</strong>s are one of the most flexible pieces of furniture in your home. They normally rest in front of your living room sofa and give you a place to put knick-knacks, rest your feet, or set your food on. You can blend them in with your décor or use one as an accent piece to set the room&rsquo;s style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“The <strong>height</strong> of the <strong>table</strong> should be generally between 14 to 20 inches tall,” she wrote. “I prefer the <strong>table</strong> to be approximately two inches lower than the seat <strong>height</strong> on your sofa. Keep approximately 16 inches from the edge of the <strong>table</strong> to the sofa and at least 28 to 30 inches to the TV cabinet or furniture opposite the sofa. A <strong>table</strong> should be two-thirds the length of your sofa for correct proportion.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>My frequency illusion kicked in recently when I was looking for styling inspiration for some new end <strong>table</strong>s. I was feeling overwhelmed with making my <strong>table</strong>s work in my space — my lamps felt way too big and tall, the surfaces felt crowed with ephemera, and I was just NOT feeling it — so I decided to peek through our archives to see how the actual pros on our team do it. AND Y’ALL, THERE’S A FORMULA. AND IT’S SO EASY. AND I LOVE MY TABLES NOW. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once you figure out the right size and shape, after that, it’s more about making the right design choice for your space. Rectangular and oval-shaped coffee <strong>table</strong>s can almost be interchanged, depending on what kind of flow you’re looking for—same goes with round and square. Let’s break it down a bit further (with the bonus of our favorite shopping picks): - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With this in mind, let’s turn our attention to more comprehensive end <strong>table</strong> sizing information. For the best results, you’ll want to consider the depth and width of your prospective end <strong>table</strong> as well. Let’s take a look at each in turn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“If there are small children in the home, consider opting for a fabric covered ottoman with legs for comfort and soft edges — just make sure it is large enough that it does not look like a chair ottoman,” Rains wrote. “A primitive wood <strong>table</strong> that won’t show wear and tear is also a great choice with children in the home.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Different designs bring different personalities into the home; modern coffee <strong>table</strong>s come in an array of silhouettes but will generally feature clean lines. Stick to straight legs and neutral colors, or ramp it up with angled legs and distressed textures for a more retro, mid-century feel. Rectangle and square coffee <strong>table</strong>s are classic shapes, but more curved or softer edges can bring a homier vibe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Use wood coffee <strong>table</strong>s as an accessory, or present a dynamic focal point to your living room. At Bassett Furniture, we design <strong>table</strong>s that are not only practical but also give your room that wow factor. We create centerpieces, not afterthoughts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>PS. If you’ve been similarly awakened and now you’re like, “holy crap, I just need to clear off some space and grab a floor lamp to make my space work,” Julie rounded up 39 of our favorites. (You know what else you’ll see in that post? End <strong>table</strong>s styled with books, one natural element, and a lamp nearby.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Coffee <strong>table</strong>s shaped like a hexagon, a trapezoid, or even abstract shapes are in vogue. Additionally, bright colors are in, making the coffee <strong>table</strong> a signature accent piece for your home. Neon colors can make a room with traditional furniture pop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The price points for a coffee <strong>table</strong> can range from ultra-expensive to very budget friendly, so before you start shopping know what you have to spend on it. Your overall budget should be broken down to into areas such as, accessories, lighting and furniture. The furniture line item includes the sofa, side <strong>table</strong>s, chairs and coffee <strong>table</strong>, with a larger portion allocated to the bigger pieces. The good news is that you can bend a little on your budget if you see something you love as long as it does not comprise the quality of the sofa or chairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Coffee <strong>table</strong>s can vary in size, but most of them are 18 to 24 inches wide, 36 to 48 inches long, and 16 to 18 inches tall. This makes the accent piece a sizable addition to any room, so it&rsquo;s important to make sure there&rsquo;s plenty of clearance around the <strong>table</strong> for people to walk around. The last thing you want is for your guests to feel cramped in your room, so plan the size of your <strong>table</strong> accordingly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Formal, informal, modern or vintage; these are all styles to be considered when purchasing your coffee <strong>table</strong>. If you favor a contemporary look, choose a sleek metal <strong>table</strong> with a glass top. If country casual is more your speed, a rustic oak <strong>table</strong> would be perfect. Pick a round <strong>table</strong> with wood turned legs for a romantic feel. There are many styles to choose from, just use the decorating scheme of the room as your guide. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your living room furniture tends to wrap around your area rug, consider getting a round or square size coffee <strong>table</strong>. The uniformity of each edge will make it easy for everyone to reach the coffee <strong>table</strong> without having to reach it, and the perfect size will fill empty space around the living room area. For those who have children or smaller spaces, avoiding corners may be important. In this case, round and oval coffee <strong>table</strong>s are preferable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Consider rectangle (or oval but more on this shape next) if you have a standard sofa (or an extra-long sofa with chaise) so everyone can have easy access to their coffee, cocktail, or late-night snack of choice. This is also a great choice if you have a narrow space with minimal walk-around clearance. If you’re a household with more remotes or tech cords than you can count, think about getting a <strong>table</strong> with some functional but still sleek drawers like #1, #4, #18, or #21. It’s hard to see in the photo, but the <strong>table</strong> at #2 has a shadow box top (that’s great for putting in your favorite curiosities and trinkets but still having plenty of surface area for you know…real life stuff. Oh, and if you regularly eat in front of your TV (whether by choice or because you don’t actually have a formal dining area), a lift-top coffee <strong>table</strong> is super useful for not having to hunch over your plate (#10 and #20). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Side <strong>table</strong>s come in many different shapes, materials, and styles – and they offer a variety of features. Choose from round, rectangular, and square side <strong>table</strong>s. When selecting a shape, consider your other furnishings and choose a shape that provides visual contrast. For example, balance a large round ottoman with a rectangular side <strong>table</strong>. Or if you have a sectional that features sharp angles, juxtapose it with a small round side <strong>table</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sleek and compact, side <strong>table</strong>s are perfect to hold your mugs and magazines. Whether it’s oak, mirrored or white <strong>table</strong>s that you need to complement your décor, our huge range has the perfect sizing and finish. Opt for square metal styles or round glass for your bed or a sofa side, or browse our pretty vases to create a statement corner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yes, these kinds of <strong>table</strong>s can look fantastic in family rooms and living rooms. A low profile makes it easy to rest your feet on and can act in place of an ottoman. The shorter look also gives it a unique look for your room and can serve as the accent piece in your furniture set. They&rsquo;re great for kids, too, since younger children won&rsquo;t have any issues putting things on the <strong>table</strong>top. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>ANYWAY. Now that we’ve gone over how to pick an accent <strong>table</strong> and how to style it, let’s dive into some EHD-approved picks! (PS. Thanks to my whole team for helping me assemble these graphics and links. Sometimes I go a little overboard with the pinning — there are just so many good <strong>table</strong>s, guys!!! — and I need help assembling everything. That said, I looked literally everywhere on the internet and these are the cutest ones for every style at every price point!) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=3><li>Consider the function. Think about how you plan to use the <strong>table</strong> before buying one, Hilliard wrote. Your choice of size and material will be affected if you plan to use the <strong>table</strong> to display objects, for extra storage, for food and drinks when entertaining or if you have children who need soft edges to avoid getting hurt, Hilliard wrote. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>MY FAVORITE USE. End <strong>table</strong>s are often a little more affordable than their full-sized coffee <strong>table</strong> cousins, so grab two (or three, if your space is enormous) and let them live in front of your sofa. Added bonus: if you want to shake things up a bit, you can repurpose these lil cuties as nightstands (or, you know, as actual side <strong>table</strong>s), which make them a more budget-friendly choice for those of us who are frequently shaking things up at home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You didn’t think I was gonna let you get to the next styling formula without looking at some EHD projects, did you? I’M A HYPE MAN, BABY. Jess’ malachite end <strong>table</strong> is the perfect example of playing with scale: it’s a little lower than what we normally see, but it’s balanced by the <strong>height</strong> of the floor lamp. Similarly, Sara’s drum <strong>table</strong> is a small grounding force for her lighter-weight chairs in this open concept space. And minimalists can rejoice: look at that styling! So simple, so easy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>And let’s also take a second to look at what makes each of these rooms above work: both leggy <strong>table</strong>s are balancing out a chunkier, grounded sofa. The round <strong>table</strong> on the left speaks to the hits of black in the room, the light wood coffee <strong>table</strong> (the full reveal here is so good), and it echoes the geometric shape of the pillows. On the right, we’re seeing a traditional silhouette that reflects the black metal base of the coffee <strong>table</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>OKAY. WE’RE DONE. Just a casual reminder (as your resident Craigslist and FB Marketplace fanatic), if you see anything you love and you don’t want to pay full price, be sure to search for vendor and item names daily! That’s how Bowser scored a great deal on her end <strong>table</strong>s (that she used as nightstands, but still). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“This also balances the scale and makes the area look better proportioned,” Rains wrote. “If your space is small, choose a lower <strong>height</strong> <strong>table</strong> with a smaller dimension. An acrylic or glass <strong>table</strong> will also make a space appear larger.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The recent months at home have led many people to reevaluate the comfort and configuration of their furniture. Whether you want to purchase all new furniture or upgrade the look of your family room, your coffee <strong>table</strong> may be a good place to start. If you’re like most people, your coffee <strong>table</strong> functions as a serving <strong>table</strong>, a footrest, a repository for books and magazines, a workstation and your jigsaw-puzzle spot. Choosing the right size, shape and material for your coffee <strong>table</strong> can make a big difference in how it works and how long it lasts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another important factor is to know what the primary use will be. Will the <strong>table</strong> be more decorative, or provide storage? How much storage will be enough? Tables can come with shelves, or drawers to hold everything from kids’ toys to that stash of magazines you will someday read. Regardless if storage is needed, there is still a good chance you will want to be able to place a drink or a plate down without the risk of tipping over. Pick a piece that will hold drinks and snack plates with ease. If décor is more the purpose, you can focus on one with lines and texture in a material you love. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=http://www.marathonhardware.com/products/wood-components/hoods/wood_hood.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="20 Inch Height Coffee Table - 21 Inch High Side Table">
