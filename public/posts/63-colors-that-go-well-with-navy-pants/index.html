From head-to-toe navy for a monochrome look to a subtle pop of burgundy to unexpected <strong>colors</strong> like electric green, their stylish looks prove exactly how to pull off an outfit with navy blue. Some of these I’ve tried out before, but others are inspiring me to try some new color pairings. Ahead, see 11 chic ways the fashion set wears navy blue and shop pieces inspired by their looks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although pairing a gray tie with a blue suit and vice versa is nearly foolproof, there are some ways for you to make the most of this combination. For one thing, avoid too strong a contrast between the two <strong>colors</strong>, which is the general rule for any color coordination. So, if your suit is dark gray, avoid a really pale blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;There are plenty of complementary color options to choose from when it comes to navy. To create a contrast, look at <strong>colors</strong> such as browns, reds and oranges. Orange sits just next to yellow on the color wheel and works particularly well with navy as the bright tones of the orange make the dark blue appear even deeper.&rsquo; says the designer and head of creative at Swyft (opens in new tab), Kelly Collins. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Accessories, including gloves, hats, and scarves, are another great way to use these two <strong>colors</strong>, and, again, you have two broad options. If you have a gray coat on, you could go monochromatic and select elegant gray cashmere-lined peccary gloves to match tones. Alternatively, go with a contrast and choose a pair of bold petrol blue leather gloves in lamb nappa leather. With a scarf, you may be able to “kill two birds with one stone” by purchasing a double-sided version, like this dark blue and gray one in alpaca from Fort Belvedere, which lets you contrast or blend with a flip of the cloth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The opposite move–a gray sports coat with navy trousers–is rarer, maybe because it is generally more difficult to pull off a lighter jacket with darker <strong>pants</strong>.

Here, a pattern can be your friend and using a gray sports coat that contains a pattern, again the classic glen check or Prince of Wales, will enhance your chances of success. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Here is another outfit idea for work with navy <strong>pants</strong> and animal print shoes. The light pink top is a perfect addition to this outfit that lets the shoes stand out. The purse is also a fun touch.

It’s a classic look that is polished and professional, and can easily go from the office to happy hour. I really like this pair of navy <strong>pants</strong> because of the impeccable tailoring and fit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bright combinations are paired with a red top. There is one simple rule: one of the <strong>colors</strong> should be visually larger than the other.
