The weathered <strong>gray</strong> look isn’t meant for interiors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ul><li>It’s well known that opposites do sometimes attract. Cool <strong>gray</strong> walls and warm terracotta flooring is a great example of the effect, as the two contrast perfectly and give balance to a room. White Marble Tile - Sometimes, <strong>gray</strong> walls run the danger of a room becoming a little dark, especially if the room suffers from a lack of sunlight. A great way to fix that is to pair it with a white floor. If you’re doing a kitchen or bathroom, how about a sophisticated white marble tile? The hints of <strong>gray</strong> in the tile will blend beautifully with the <strong>gray</strong> walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul></li><li>Gray hardwood floors are a trend that is growing in popularity in Salt Lake City.

It will not detract from the other curated elements and <strong>furniture</strong> selections. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can opt for a light white oak for a newer classic to a mid tone walnut for a more traditional look.

If your style is traditional, you can accomplish a rustic or traditional look with a deep brown floor and cream-colored wall like the living room above. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There is a reason why <strong>gray</strong> hardwood floors are so popular – they are the perfect neutral tone. They can match any style or color scheme and will never go out of style. Gray hardwood floors are also very versatile; they can be used in any room in your home, from the living room, kitchen, and the bedroom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the trickiest parts of decorating with wood floors is selecting the right color scheme. The best way to determine which colors go with your wood flooring is to look at the material&rsquo;s undertone. Wood often features subtle hints of yellow, orange, red, <strong>gray</strong>, or brown within the finish. Once you&rsquo;ve determined the underlying hue, apply the principles of the color wheel to select colors that complement your wood floors. Shades of blue help balance wood with yellow or orange tones, for example, while green looks gorgeous against floors with true brown coloring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So you have <strong>gray</strong> wood flooring (or you were considering it until you ran across this ghastly article). First off, I’m sorry. I don’t mean to be the bearer of bad news or to tell you that the brand new floors you paid to have installed were a bad choice. Maybe you still love them. Good for you sticking with your style! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A room completely clad in wood flooring and furnishings might appear too heavy for most people&rsquo;s tastes. Balance the look by incorporating a variety of materials within your <strong>furniture</strong> and accessories. Wood floors pair beautifully with an array of other textures, including woven fabrics, leather, metal, concrete, painted surfaces, and more, which you can bring in through upholstered seating, accent <strong>furniture</strong>, and wall decor. Layer in wood accents in smaller ways, such as on the legs of <strong>furniture</strong> or with accessories like picture frames, to tie the room together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To keep your spaces from looking too much like one of the cave scenes from The Goonies, it’s wise to select <strong>furniture</strong> that’s lighter. However, if you are a traditionalist, we get it. You may want to match up the floor more closely with your rustic style; again, just go a little bit lighter so your room doesn’t feel too one-dimensional or dark. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Alas, you may have already made the <strong>gray</strong> flooring mistake. Or you moved into a home with <strong>gray</strong> wood flooring because many DIY’ers and builders are using <strong>gray</strong> everywhere. If you, don’t despair- I will give you a few coping mechanisms to live with <strong>gray</strong> weathered wood floors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blues are our favorite color to pair with <strong>gray</strong> floors. They are cold and calming, and they nearly always complement <strong>gray</strong> floors. You’ll be alright as long as you stick to a cool blue (light, mid, or dark). So consider blue blues (a phrase I coined) or blue-<strong>gray</strong>s (also called dusty blues). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gray hardwood flooring can be used to create a modern or traditional look, and there are many shades of <strong>gray</strong> from which to choose. Some people may think that all <strong>gray</strong> hardwood is the same. However, there are many different colors and textures available. When shopping for <strong>gray</strong> hardwood flooring, it’s important to consider the color of the wood, as well as the finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Is it going to be too dark? No way – if you know how to act properly. In reality, black kitchen cabinet fronts complement light <strong>gray</strong> floors beautifully. This contrast makes the furnishings stand out while making the floor appear lighter and airier. Loft aficionados, in particular, adore this combination, which they frequently offset with an unpainted brick wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gray floors, and in general, kitchen color schemes with grey floors are an excellent choice for a kitchen. Shades of this lovely color are very popular, look lovely, and, as most homeowners remark, are completely dirt-repellent. Furthermore, <strong>gray</strong>-toned floors may now be manufactured from a variety of materials, ranging from hardwood to laminate, linoleum, porcelain stoneware, and concrete. Also, you can always choose a darker or lighter shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gray hardwood is also a good choice for people who want a unique look in their home. It can be used in any room, and it goes well with both modern and traditional decor. It can add a touch of elegance to any room, while also providing a level of sophistication. In addition, <strong>gray</strong> hardwood is perfect for those who are looking for a one-of-a-kind flooring option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Almost anything looks amazing with black. It contrasts with the <strong>gray</strong> flooring while creating a big statement. Because it isn’t a color, you may modify the rest of your décor over time if you become tired of a particular color scheme. Choose slick black paint shades to add a touch of sophistication to your kitchen. Its reflecting surface is sleek and sophisticated, and it does not show dirt or fingerprints like a matte finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pay attention to the distinguishing colors. It would be a mistake to believe that a <strong>gray</strong> floor is neutral enough to accommodate colored kitchen furnishings. On the contrary, <strong>gray</strong> may play a cruel joke on it, causing the color of the façade to fade. If you are unsure if you can select a rich hue appropriately, consider tranquil tones – there are many contrasting ones among them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ul><li>In your kitchen or laundry area, you can’t go wrong with a classic checkerboard look. You’ll have a nice contrast between the tiles and a moderately warm <strong>gray</strong> wall, which will be enhanced with a bit of sunlight. Black Tile - If you’re going for a minimalistic or sleek, modern look, pairing jet black tiles with light <strong>gray</strong> walls is the way to. The two colors are complementary, but the dark black provides the perfect bit of contrast in the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul></li><li>If the cherry wood is new, it will likely take the stain more evenly and will have a darker <strong>gray</strong> color than if the wood is older and has more natural variations in color. For better results, make the stain very thin and apply slowly until you get <strong>gray</strong>. Then you can seal and tone to get an exact color match. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When white cabinets are combined with <strong>gray</strong> flooring, you have the option of adding color in less permanent sections of your kitchen. For example, if you want to change the color scheme, you may paint the walls a bright and strong color and then repaint them. Changing the color of your kitchen cabinets would be a more difficult and costly process, so choosing a neutral tone like white ensures that it will never go out of style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you choose a white or light <strong>gray</strong> cabinet, dark flooring will help to ground everything. Darker floors also make a kitchen feel cozier and more welcoming. Keep in mind that, because dark floors show dirt more than light floors, you may need to clean them more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Because <strong>gray</strong> is a blend of black and white, it makes sense to utilize both on your cabinets. Cabinets should be white, and the island should be black. Alternatively, paint the top cabinets one color and the bottom cabinets another. This choice adds depth to your kitchen while also seamlessly tying in your <strong>gray</strong> flooring. It also helps you decide whether to choose all white or all black for your kitchen cabinets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The green color is ideal for those looking for new ways to spruce up their living environment. Sage green is one of the greatest green shades that go well with <strong>gray</strong> flooring. This lovely color adds an exquisite touch to a conventional green while retaining its relaxing and natural effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In addition to their calming effects, <strong>gray</strong> hardwood floors are also known for being durable and long-lasting. They can withstand heavy traffic and are easy to maintain, making them a great choice for families with kids or pets. A quick sweep or vacuum will remove most dirt and dust and keep the floors looking shiny and new. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gray hardwood flooring has been around for quite a while, but it has become more popular in recent years. Some people think that it is just a fad and that it will not last. However, many people love the look of <strong>gray</strong> hardwood floors and plan to keep them for many years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ul><li>For this cool <strong>gray</strong> paint with blue undertones, you’ll want to pair it with a light-colored hardwood like ash, pine, birch, or hickory. In terms of stain, you could go for a classic <strong>gray</strong> or weathered <strong>gray</strong>, or something with warmer tones like a golden pecan. Taupe - This warm <strong>gray</strong>, with its brown undertones, should be matched with dark-colored hardwoods. Stains to consider would be dark walnut and chestnut, but also perhaps jacobean, espresso, or red mahogany. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul></li><li>In the two above photos, all of the accents are also <strong>gray</strong> and black and polished nickel fixtures. This leaves the kitchen and living room feeling very cold. While it may look “clean” and pretty, it doesn’t have any warmth or natural elements to it. It looks like a warehouse, not a home style created over time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Light <strong>gray</strong> is another good neutral to consider. As with white, it can come in a plethora of shades, so make sure you choose one with the right undertones to compliment your floors. Technically, undertones can be pink, blue, green, or any other color, but the simplest way to account for undertones is to determine whether your floors have warm or cool undertones and then assess each paint color to see whether it is a warm or cool <strong>gray</strong>. If your floors themselves are <strong>gray</strong>, <strong>gray</strong> walls are not the right choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ignore any notion that requires wood tones to match. A modern approach to design purposefully blends the rough and rustic with the stained and polished in varied stains and grains for a collected-over-time look. Combine wood floors and <strong>furniture</strong> that feature diverse textures and stains, but aim to mix wood finishes with a similar undertone, such as <strong>gray</strong> or yellow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cherry wood is a popular choice for <strong>furniture</strong>. It is a hardwood with a reddish-brown color that becomes darker with age. It can be stained in many different colors, but some people are looking for a <strong>gray</strong> stain instead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grey hardwood has a sleek and modern aesthetic that complements and enhances ultra-modern vibes. Grey being a neutral colour, it works well with pastels, as well as dark but muted tones, like purple, moss green, chocolate brown and royal blue. Choose <strong>furniture</strong> sets with upholstery that has similar shades. A minimalist modern design will never go wrong against a grey floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Avoid all <strong>gray</strong> paint on the walls as well. This will add to the cold feeling and flat feeling of no dimension. Instead, opt for an every so slight warm white, like Benjamin Moore Simply White or a Sherwin Williams White from this list. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Shades of beige and taupe have long been popular neutral shades that offer a bit more color than white or <strong>gray</strong> and are typically darker than cream. “Greige” is the term given to the group of colors that are a combination of cool <strong>gray</strong> and warm beige. Beige, greige, and taupe are all great options if you want a richer color on your walls while staying in the neutral family. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Neutral tones in whites and <strong>gray</strong>s can help balance the room and make your interior feel brighter. And don’t forget the trim. If you are remodeling an older home or updating yours that has antiquated brown or orange woodwork, you will want to choose a complementary color to your floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your <strong>gray</strong> flooring has cold undertones, go with blue cabinets for a new aesthetic. Blue is a calming and stress-relieving color. If you cook a lot for your family, have a lot of traffic in your kitchen, or simply desire a more zen environment, blue can help you generate a more serene kitchen ambiance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Don’t overlook color temperature. Choosing the proper color scheme is simple after you’ve determined the undertone of your <strong>gray</strong> flooring. Not only should your cabinet color be warm or cool, but so should your countertops, area rugs, appliances, and stools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ul><li>For this warm undertone shade of <strong>gray</strong>, you’ll want to pair it with dark colored, warm hardwoods like walnut, chestnut, or cherry wood. Dark walnut, espresso or regular chestnut stains work well. Charcoal Gray - For this dark <strong>gray</strong> wall paint, you’ll probably want to stick to warm hardwoods, although lighter colored hardwoods like pine and white oak can work too! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul></li><li>The colour of your walls is the backdrop for your interior décor and should coordinate with the flooring to give you the perfect canvas for your <strong>furniture</strong> and accessories. Lighter wall colours will make your room appear brighter and coordinate with the interior better. If you prefer a darker and bolder wall, stick to neutrals like browns or greyish blues. It is best to avoid bright colours that stand out too much as they can overshadow your floor and make it a challenge to find the right <strong>furniture</strong> to complement it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For lighter <strong>gray</strong> walls, you typically want to pick floor colors that have a similarly cool feel. For darker <strong>gray</strong>s, warmer colors often work better. However, there’s nothing wrong with a bit of contrast! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hi, I&rsquo;m Paul, I&rsquo;m a long-time writer and short-time <strong>furniture</strong> obsessed homeowner. I love everything about <strong>furniture</strong> and interior design. I grew up in the northeast, but I&rsquo;ve lived in six different states so lots of moving.

Some of the most popular options include oak, maple, and bamboo. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Treat wood floors that lack intense yellow or red undertones as a neutral. With this type of wood flooring, you can feel free to layer <strong>furniture</strong> and accents in your palette of choice. In this dining nook, the beauty of wood floors is exposed by the purposeful elimination of an area rug and the lighter upholstered chairs and unique rattan pedestal dining table that sit on top. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pale yellow is a good color to choose if you want to create a bright and vivid space. This color will still give you a yellowish tint, but it will be much softer and more natural. Using yellow walls with <strong>gray</strong> floors is a terrific way to prevent boring appearances, especially if the majority of your <strong>furniture</strong> is in neutral colors like white or <strong>gray</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to liven up your kitchen, crimson is a great color to use next to <strong>gray</strong>. For your kitchen cabinets, you may choose a red-based wood, such as cherry or mahogany. In comparison to red gloss laminate kitchen cabinets, which trend toward a more modern and international style, this would create a more natural, comforting ambiance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ul><li>If you’re going for a minimalistic or sleek, modern look, pairing jet black tiles with light <strong>gray</strong> walls is the way to. The two colors are complementary, but the dark black provides the perfect bit of contrast in the room. Red Brick - It’s well known that opposites do sometimes attract.
