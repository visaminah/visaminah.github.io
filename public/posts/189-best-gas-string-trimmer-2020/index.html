Michelle has made a career of evaluating products side-by-side, comprehensively testing, and scoring the smallest details, and differentiating factors on everything from coffee grinders to cordless power tools. Additionally, she also brings extensive lawn care experience to the table. David has formal training as a mechanical engineer with extensive experience in lithium batteries and electrical power systems, which he gained from working on electric vehicles and underwater robots. - Source: Internet This trimmer employs a bump feed to dispense more string, but it’s a little more difficult to replace the string than some of the other models. There aren’t alignment indicators on the spool, which forced us to consult a manual, but it was straightforward once we became familiar with it. This minor drawback should only be an issue once or twice, after which you’ll get the hang of it. - Source: Internet The Tanaka TCG27EBSP is a gas trimmer that comes with a 26.9cc, 2-cycle commercial grade engine. This means you can use it for professional trimming or in a large garden. - Source: Internet While the materials used to make trimmer strings are all reasonably weld resistant, some string types have a higher degree of resistance than others. Given the same material, shaped line is more weld-resistant than round because of the increased surface area. Round string has the least amount of surface area, allowing heat buildup to occur more quickly. - Source: Internet Every trimmer we looked into could cut regular lawn grass, but we needed one that could also handle weeds and thick growth. At that point, we saw the first big differences between the models. The less powerful trimmers had trouble with the rougher terrain. They got stuck in the grass or pushed it over instead of cutting it. Because we don’t have a rating for how much current the motor uses, we have to make more accurate estimates or extrapolations based on other metrics, such as run time and battery capacity. - Source: Internet One of the difference in the Echo, besides the curved shaft, is the rapid feed line. Unlike the bump feed, the rapid feed puts out string itself. However, at times, it is known to get stuck. The rapid feed is convenient for users. Pros The Echo is lightweight. - Source: Internet Square trimmer line has four hard cutting edges that are designed to aggressively cut through coarse weeds and green underbrush, where it excels. Round line is quieter and more fuel-efficient due to reduced wind resistance. It is also more durable than square line of the same size because it consists of more material. For generally weed-free lawns, round line could be the best choice. - Source: Internet The RYOBI 2 Cycle Gas Straight Shaft String Trimmer comes with a full crank engine for life twice as long as others. This string trimmer accepts RYOBI Expand-It Universal Brand Fit attachments adding versatility to your trimmer. Attach an edger, a blower, or even a tiller to the powerhead and quickly move from project to project. - Source: Internet You want to wear safety goggles to protect your eyes from flying debris. Gas trimmers can be loud so protect your ears with ear muffs or ear plugs. Protect your hands by using a good pair of safety gloves. - Source: Internet Remington RM1159 Walk-Behind High-Wheeled String Trimmer Via Amazon.com If I was looking for an upgrade, I would definitely go for the Remington RM1159 string trimmer. If you want to get rid of tall and nasty weeds, you can knock them out of the park with this walk-behind trimmer; in short, I could say that this trimmer is basically a weed eater on steroids. - Source: Internet Efficiency and power are two benefits of length in a string trimmer. It may not seem like much, but if you have a lot of weedy areas to clear up, the extra cutting you’ll have to do on each pass can add up quickly. Power saving is another area where length excels, as length results in a faster cutting line tip at a given engine speed. - Source: Internet The efficiency with which a line cuts can also be affected by its shape. The line used for string trimmers might be formed like a circle, a square, a star, or even be sliced into sharp edges. The most popular kind has a rounded edge, but since it doesn’t have a cutting edge, it rips the grass instead of cutting it. The line with the twist is marginally superior because the shape it creates is marginally more pointed. - Source: Internet Better materials, like reinforced composite nylon have a greater more cutting power and breakage resistance. Some products include strengthening materials like aluminum that are incorporated into the nylon or a hardened core material to prevent breakage. Other trimmer strings are made from non-nylon polymers or copolymers for added strength. - Source: Internet Electric string trimmers are relatively quiet; the whirling of the string and the cutting sound are usually the loudest parts. Unlike their gas-powered rivals, these trimmers are much quieter and hence rarely necessitate the use of hearing protection. These are the kinds that need a little extra vigor to get through the heftier outdoor tasks. We tried to find a middle ground between the high screech and the hair dryer hum produced by the trimmers we evaluated. This would be better for your ears and more considerate for your neighbors. - Source: Internet Make sure to get a weed eater that matches your skill level and experience. After all, you don’t want to buy something too advanced only to underuse it. Also, with some trimmer models, there’s a learning curve, so you might want to take that into account. On that note, we would like to sign off with a quick recap of our findings on the best weed eater. - Source: Internet Some string trimmers have speed adjustments to accommodate a variety of trimming applications. On battery-powered models, power can be increased for trimming thicker or more overgrown regions and decreased for trimming perimeters while conserving battery life. When dealing with dense vegetation or tenacious weeds, the throttle responsiveness of a gas-powered trimmer can enable rapid power adjustments. Many trimmers have only one fixed speed, regardless of the environment. A string trimmer’s runtime is maximized with only one speed, both in terms of battery life and fuel usage. - Source: Internet Make sure the trimmer is off and cool so you can open the filter cover and remove the air filter. Wash the air filter in soapy water and let it dry. Then you can put some motor oil on it and squeeze it so the oil coats evenly. Put the air filter back in position and close the filter cover. - Source: Internet But there are a few bonus features offered by some manufacturers that can take your string trimmer from “good” to the best weed eater around. However—and this is a big drawback for some—the power cord can severely limit your range and may prove to be a hazard. It may be all too easy for some to cut through it by accident or even trip over it while they work. For these reasons, corded weed eaters are best for those with smaller yards, who live in big towns, and who can stick close to home for their trimming. - Source: Internet Trimmer line ranges in size from about .065-inch to .170-inch. Large diameter line requires a properly sized trimmer head and more power to operate. Be sure to check the weed wacker’s operator’s manual for compatibility before attempting to load a new size. - Source: Internet Select readers have been increasingly interested in patio furniture sales and expert-recommended gas grills, too. Sprucing up greenery around your home might be on your to-do list ahead of the summer — and one of the tools that might be handy to have on hand is a string trimmer. We consulted experts on what string trimmers are, how they work and what are the best string trimmers to consider right now. - Source: Internet Basic trimmer string is made of hardened monofilament nylon. This material has been the industry standard for years, but manufacturers are making constant improvements to increase durability and capability. Plain nylon line is still effective, but stronger materials are now available. - Source: Internet The Remington RM25S is a true budget pick. It’s a bit of a contradiction, since it’s heavy (more than 15 pounds), it has the smallest cutting width of all the trimmers on this list, and it has only a 25 cc, 2-cycle engine. For the price, though, it’s a solid weed eater and brush cutter for residential use. - Source: Internet With the RM2530 Rustler, Remington presents the perfect partner in your battle to keep tall grass and weeds at bay. The Rustler™ gas-powered trimmer/edger’s powerful 25cc 2-cycle engine and 16-inch cutting swath help you power through more territory at once. QuickStart™ technology makes getting started faster and easier. And when your trimmer line wears down, never fear – just tap the dual-line bump head on the ground, and more line is ready for action. - Source: Internet We’re, for most parts, satisfied with its design and performance, but the only thing that bothered us was the weight. This straight shaft string trimmer clocks in a little over 18 lbs, which is undoubtedly quite bulky and heavy for some users. Therefore, it’s not meant for extended use since you’re most likely to develop muscle fatigue early on when cutting weeds. - Source: Internet Interestingly enough, The PoulanPro brand is owned by Husqvarna. Poulan Pro trimmers boast features that ensure there’s a unit that’s perfect for every job. The PR28CD features a 28cc, 2-stroke engine with a curved shaft and 16-inch cut path. As an attachment-capable trimmer with Pro-Link™, this unit accepts six optional attachments that make it even more versatile. From standard trimming to blowing, tilling, hedge trimming, edging, brush cutting, and even tree pruning. - Source: Internet The Remington RM25C Curved Shaft Gas String Trimmer is our pick as the best commercial weed eater for the money. It has a powerful 25cc, 2-stroke engine with QuickStart technology that makes it much easier to pull the string. It has a 16-inch trimmer head to quickly cut through the tallest grass, and a curved shaft makes it easier to see where the blade is cutting. The dual-line bump feed is twice as effective as a single line and is easy to control. - Source: Internet After use, clean the string trimmer with a cloth and dish soap to avoid a clogged machine. Remove and clean air and fuel filters as well as the spark plug. Some gas weed eaters may need oil changes too. - Source: Internet The Craftsman WS2200 is more ergonomic. Although this wacker is also as heavy as 15.87 lbs, it has an adjustable winding bump trimmer head that you can adjust the over-mold handle to control the operation and improve comfort. You need to pick your preferred working position and lock the handle in place. - Source: Internet Our next metric focused on the battery system of each string trimmer, and this accounts for 25% of each product’s final score. We based the bulk of this score on the maximum runtime for each product and awarded extra points to models with different speed settings because it allows you to maximize the battery life by throttling down when extra speed is unnecessary. We measured the runtime for these weed eaters when they weren’t actually eating weeds, so you’ll probably get lower numbers if you’re chewing through dense vegetation or particularly stubborn weeds. - Source: Internet The Makita XRU15PT 36V again earned the top score in this metric. It is exceptionally well balanced, with the battery end of the trimmer only slightly heavier than the head, making it easy to carry one-handed and to wield through fields of grass. The molded, ergonomic grip makes it easy to keep a good grip without working too hard. We also liked the guard on this model because it doesn’t detract from your ability to do precise cuts while maintaining an equivalent degree of protection. The Makita XRU15PT includes a shoulder strap attachment as well. - Source: Internet Sometimes the straight shaft vs curved shaft debate doesn’t need to happen. Two-piece powerhead units allow for more flexible use. These attachment-capable tools can choose the greater torque and power of a straight shaft string trimmer or the ergonomics of a curved shaft. - Source: Internet The first and foremost reason for the gas string trimmers is their superiority in power and durability – as long as their maintenance is not lackluster. Next, this type of weed eater is not limited to moving around. You can maneuver around obstacles in your grass. - Source: Internet Bateman suggested this model as “a much cheaper option that gets the job done for small yards.” It features an 18-inch cutting path to cover more ground and a molded grip handle to make it easier to use in your hand. The trimmer also includes a lock to keep the cord in place as you move around the lawn. It’s a popular pick with Amazon shoppers, earning a 4.4-star rating over close to 2,000 reviews. - Source: Internet Both a weed eater and a lawnmower are used to cut the overgrown weeds. Primarily, an eater is small, using a fast spinning microfilament string stiff enough to cut small portions of grass. Most lawnmowers, however, are bulkier with a motor and a rotary blade. The blade cuts the grass more quickly and with hardly any skill. - Source: Internet In line with these objectives, this Tanaka string trimmer weighs just 10.1 pounds upon being assembled. This machine begins immediately with the S-Start feature and a Walbro carburetor. It has anti-vibration mounts and a lengthy 54-inch drive shaft to reduce fatigue from constantly bending. - Source: Internet In a nutshell, I can’t see any reason to pick a gas-powered string trimmer over an electric weed eater. Gas is pricey, worse for the environment, and challenging to keep in stock. Electricity is cheap, and it is much more sustainable than gas. - Source: Internet If you need a string trimmer that can handle dense plants and grass without a struggle, then it’s worth checking out the Ego Power+ STA1500 string trimming attachment for the Ego Power+ Power Head. It is easily one of the most powerful string trimmers of the group and sliced through dense weeds and tall grass without difficulty. It can clear areas that would have stopped other products dead in their tracks. We also think it’s fairly comfortable to use and a compact way to add a cordless string trimmer to your arsenal if you have the aforementioned Power Head. - Source: Internet We have arranged the 15 weed eaters (line trimmers) in our review alphabetically by brand name. There are so many variations that comparing them is like comparing apples and pears – it all depends on what is essential to the individual user. Let’s have a look. - Source: Internet Instead of a blade, string trimmers use a string (or “line”) to slice through foliage. String trimmers consist of a long shaft with a cutting head, also known as a trimmer head, on one end. The cutting head is the part of the tool where you load the string, and it’s the part that does the cutting (thus the name). - Source: Internet A pair of trimmers tied for the top spot when it came to eating weeds; namely, the Makita XRU15PT 36V and the Ego Power+ STA1500 Attachment. Both are exceptionally effective at eliminating weeds, cutting through pretty much any grasses, weeds, shrubs, and bushes we pitted them against smoothly and effectively. They both tackled tall grass and dense weeds with ease, even cutting through burly stalks and stems without showing any sign of a struggle. - Source: Internet The brushless motor powers the Greenworks PRO 80V engine. The design of the trimmer is straight and made of an aluminum shaft, which provides ergonomics and balance while trimming. The trigger can be adjusted to Variable Speed to provide more control over the cutting power. The overall construction of the Greenworks PRO 80V is lightweight yet extremely durable, which makes it easy to maneuver without having to compromise on the strength. Check On Amazon Pros The single charge of one battery can last you for 30 minutes - Source: Internet The Husqvarna and the Snapper both followed. We recorded sound levels of 88.5 decibels for the Snapper XD. The Husqvarna is very loud on startup, registering 105 decibels, but this quickly drops to around 95 decibels while operating the string trimmer. The Snapper has a whine that can be quite grating, while our judges believe the Husqvarna’s sound is one of the least annoying; it’s just loud. - Source: Internet What Should I Look for in an Electric Weed Wacker? You should look for an adjustable handle, blade guard, lightweight design, and versatility. You’ll want to be comfortable holding one of these tools for hours, so pick a model that fits your height and isn’t too heavy. Being able to switch the string with other attachments can also save space and money. Are Electric Weed Eaters Worth It? Electric weed eaters are worth the investment since you won’t need to purchase pricey gas to fuel them. You can use them anywhere there’s an electrical outlet and extension cable, and you’ll never have to recharge or refuel them. - Source: Internet To say we put each string trimmer through its paces would be an understatement. We implemented 72 individual tests between the 9 trimmers in the review, running each through the same 8 tests to comparatively assess aspects ranging from weed-eating power to noise levels. This allows us to rank each in accordance with its performance in each metric and make special recommendations for the specific needs of homeowners or anyone looking to improve their yard. We paid retail price for each model to ensure an unbiased assessment of these string trimmers. - Source: Internet “provides power to handle the toughest jobs without the need of an extension cord.” Hudson recommended using non-ethanol gasoline for the best performance. An electric string trimmer can carry consistent amounts of power through an electrical outlet with a cord, this is unlike a battery-powered string trimmer, which is cordless. - Source: Internet When it comes to string trimmers, monofilament nylon lines are most commonly used. This line can be purchased in both spools and rolls and comes in various lengths, making it easy to customize. When working with electric trimmers that have a lower power output, a thinner line of roughly 1/16 inch is preferable. In addition to being useful for edging lawns and flower beds, this method is also useful for clipping any stray grass that may emerge there. - Source: Internet Like the Weed Eating metric, Ease of Use also constitutes 30% of the total score for each cordless string trimmer. Here we compared the weight and guard design of each trimmer, as well as how comfortable and balanced they are to hold. We also compared the ease of replacing and feeding the line and noted if there was a shoulder strap attachment. - Source: Internet Ideally, the trimming speed can reach 7000 RPM and create a cutting path of 10 inches across the grass. At this speed, you should be careful while moving the machine. Cover the trimmer head with a safety guard when you do not use it. There is also a safety valve throttle that protects the engine from accidental starts. - Source: Internet Of our top picks, the Husqvarna 324L is by far the lightest at only 5.1 pounds. That’s even light for an electric string trimmer. 3. Is a straight or curved shaft string trimmer better? - Source: Internet Reviewers on Amazon were satisfied with the ergonomics of the weed eater, complimenting the user-friendliness of the adjustable shaft and handle. Though some reviewers thought the push-button feed system was unhelpful, others preferred it to the Tap ‘N Go system of other models, which administers a new line by tapping the trimmer’s head to the ground. Despite being battery-powered, one customer stated the weed eater lasted long enough to trim their almost three-acre yard. - Source: Internet Size, weight, and maneuverability of your weed trimmer should accommodate the type of work you need to get done. If your yard has a lot of trees or lawn furniture and you need to get in nooks and crannies, stay away from heavy-duty weed eaters with wide shields. A heavier option may be a better fit though if you’ve got an open space and you want a power tool that can make strong, sweeping cuts through intense brush. - Source: Internet The other major benefit is that gas engines aren’t limited by either an extension cord or a battery’s run time. If a gas trimmer runs out of juice in the middle of a job, all you have to do is fill up the tank and keep working. You don’t have to wait for a battery to recharge. - Source: Internet The only real issue I have with this corded string trimmer is that its best strength is also its weakness. The adjustable handles don’t always stay fixed when trimming, which is a rather worrying safety issue. It also suffers from a common problem with trimmers like these: a narrow cord retention slot. - Source: Internet Cordless varieties are also more cost-effective than battery-powered weed eaters since batteries may need replacement after a few years of use. How Powerful Should an Electric String Trimmer Be? Your electric string trimmer should be powerful enough to cut through stalky weeds and dense grass. 5 amp models can easily cut through tough plants, while 3 amp corded weed eaters can only manage in thin grass with few delicate weeds. - Source: Internet It turns out that the answer is not very much. Electric trimmers can chew through the typical grass and weeds you’ll face in the garden, so power is no issue. They’re also much more lightweight without a heavy gas-powered motor and full fuel tank, meaning you can go for longer. - Source: Internet The Troy-Bilt TB525 EC Curved Shaft Trimmer is designed for the perfectionist in you. If you like to keep the lawn or garden a certain way, it’s important to get the right tools for the job. But then again, you don’t want to spend hours cutting grass, and hence we recommend buying this good string trimmer. - Source: Internet The Makita XUX01ZM5 Brushless Cordless Couple Shaft String Trimmer is a battery-powered trimmer that uses a powerful 18-volt battery. The brushless motor can produce up to 7,100 RPM, and it’s adjustable with 3 speeds so you can set a balance between power and battery life. An electronic torque control automatically shuts off the trimmer if the machine slows down or suddenly stops, and a lever style lock system makes changing heads and attachments easy. - Source: Internet For the greatest durability, round string is the standard. Combining more material with less surface area, it has a longer wear time. Round string made of reinforced nylon or non-nylon polymer, or string with a hardened core material, will provide greater durability than basic nylon. - Source: Internet In a straight shaft system like the EGO Power Head string trimmer, the drive cable accomplishes the same function, but since there is no curve to account for, the cable is less vulnerable to breakage. Straight shaft string trimmers can employ a variety of driving mechanisms, from steel cables to solid steel driveshafts. Because the drive cable/shaft experiences less bending, straight shaft trimmers tend to hold up better over time. - Source: Internet It is well balanced for easy maneuverability and comes with a harness and safety glasses for added user comfort. But it has a lot of other features to commend it as a great choice in 4 stroke trimmers. Straight shaft trimmers have the advantage of transferring power more efficiently to the trimmer head. Given all the moving parts of a gas-powered trimmer, these particular types of weed eaters can be somewhat expensive to maintain. Because the gas-powered string trimmer has no cord, it is not limited by the length of that cord as to where it can go. - Source: Internet Husqvarna 128ld trimmer is fitted with a 2-stroke, 28-cc engine, which makes it optimized for performance. The 1-horsepower engine is powerful enough to cut through bush-like terrain with no hassles. Similar to other gas-powered trimmers, the Husqvarna 128ld also makes use of 100% gasoline, which needs to be mixed with oil before use. - Source: Internet All of the power goes to a longer string, which means that they tend to operate at higher RPMs. A trimmer is an essential tool for keeping your yard neat and tidy. However, with so many different models, it can be confusing to make your purchase decision. So, here we’ve created a buying guide with the features to look for, things to consider and the answers to some common questions to help you make your final choice. The curved shaft allows you to see the trimming point without a need to strain, while not increasing the bulkiness of the trimmer. - Source: Internet Echo GT-225 2 Cycle Curved Shaft Gas Trimmer Via Amazon.com The Echo GT-225 is one of my favorite budget picks for lawn care. While it might be quite light, it promises to be sturdy enough and get the job done. While it might be void of some features housed by other weed eater models, for the price range, you will be purchasing a decent trimmer that can handle daily wear-and-tear and will last for many years. - Source: Internet Manufacturers make many accessories for these power heads. Additionally, these tools tend to support larger string gauges. Metal and plastic cutting blades can even replace trimmer line should the need ever arise. These tools also let you replace the weedeater head with a pole saw, edger, articulating hedge trimmer, power brush—even a cultivator for tilling soil. - Source: Internet “An undersized cord will cause a drop in line voltage resulting in loss of power and overheating,” Howard explains. “When in doubt, use the next heavier gauge.” She says the letters WA on the cord jacket indicate a cord that is suitable for outdoor use. Regarding corded versus cordless trimmers, Howard feels they are comparable in terms of power. Corded trimmers are generally less expensive than battery-operated trimmers and are easy to maintain, but they have less mobility. - Source: Internet For battery-powered trimmers, our primary goal was to assess power and run time. For gas-engine trimmers, we wanted to judge whether the power they provided was offset by their noise and weight. For all trimmers, we wanted to see if each machine was comfortable and well balanced, and whether its line feed was finicky or robust. We found that especially when we were using the machines to cut down weeds, the growth was so tough, it took an immediate toll on the trimmer’s line, causing us to use the bump feed line mechanism at twice or three times the rate that we would in normal grass trimming. - Source: Internet Other lines come in the form of a square or a star. These string trimmer lines have edges that are sharper than those of rounded trimmer lines, which allows them to cut through the grass rather than rip it as they work. You also have the option of going with a line that has serrations on it if you want a trimmer line that is even sharper as it saws through thicker grass and weeds with little effort. - Source: Internet We took each string trimmer to various locations to test them on all kinds of grasses (short and tall), shrubs, and bushes. The Ego STA1500 was able to cut just about everything we pointed it at.

To maximize the power of the battery, the trimmer offers two-speed settings to allow you to optimize your battery’s life. The weed eater’s battery pack can also easily transfer to any number of your CRAFTSMAN tools that have a compatible battery pack. - Source: Internet Every string trimmer, whether cordless, plug-in electric, or gas-powered, has limitations on line size. Line diameter is a good indicator of durability. Assuming the same material and shape, a thicker line lasts longer. Thicker line also costs more. - Source: Internet No matter which model you buy, it’s essential to check how the trimmer starts. Anything which requires multiple attempts is a no-go, as you don’t want to be pulling cords for several minutes. That said, most weed eater models on our list need minimal effort to start engine operation. However, some of them need a separate starter, which is not included with the trimmer. - Source: Internet In our recent best string trimmer review article, we featured exclusively straight shaft models. There’s a reason for that. It’s the preferred form factor for cordless at present. While some curve models do exist, manufacturers don’t give them as much attention. We’ll try to articulate why that might be the case in this article. - Source: Internet Ahead of its time, Husqvarna launched the solar-powered Automower® robotic mower in 1995 already.

It also includes a harness to relieve the strain on your arms and improve stability. Powered by a 31cc, 4-cycle, full-crankshaft engine, your WBP31BCF is designed for reliability. The full-crank design delivers a fast start and smooth operation, reducing emissions, increasing fuel efficiency, and delivering a longer life. - Source: Internet In total, we conducted a dozen distinct tests that we divided among four weighted rating metrics. Each of these metrics — Weed Eating, Ease of Use, Battery Life, and Noise — are weighted proportional to their importance to overall string trimmer performance. The score for each metric is determined by the performance of each trimmer in the tests composing each metric. - Source: Internet To give it enough power to stand among commercial-grade trimmers, this machine has a 21.1cc PureFire 2-Stroke engine. This engine doesn’t significantly add weight nor does it have difficulties related to maintenance, and the fuel tank capacity is at an acceptable 14.9 fluid ounces. - Source: Internet But that doesn’t mean gas or electric string trimmers shouldn’t be used at home. For larger properties, gas provides the most power —these trimmers do generally require more upkeep and are heavier to carry around, Bateman advised. And electric string trimmers, which tend to be the most affordable of the three, are more suitable for small yards since a cord can only go so far, he added. - Source: Internet Some string trimmers require pre-cut lengths of line. Others use either one or two long lengths of line that wind onto a spool. You may need to remove the spool from the housing or load it in place. Refer to the owner’s manual or manufacturer’s website for detailed instructions for your specific trimmer brand and model. - Source: Internet One of the greatest benefits of this trimmer is that it’s compatible with Ryobi’s line of “Expand-It” products. By purchasing extra attachments, you can easily convert this one tool into many others, including an edger, blower, and tiller. If you need more than just a string trimmer to tidy up your lawn, you’ll save money and storage space with this Ryobi tool. - Source: Internet Which edger can I attach to it? The TrimmerPlus TPE720 is the recommended edger for this trimmer. So when should you can the oil in it? Should it be every four times you use it? I would probably drain and refill the oil for homeowner use after using it one or two weekends. After that, an oil change each spring should be plenty. If you are running it for more than an hour or two each weekend, you might want to change the oil more frequently. Does this accept older Craftsman brand attachments? This unit will accept older Craftsman attachments. - Source: Internet You are able to customize the weed eater using the Power Command Dial. The Black and Decker LST136 40V Max String Trimmer features a power drive transmission which delivers a higher level of power from the weed eater’s motor.

One reviewer, in particular, noted that this WORX trimmer was great for those that want to worry less with the mechanics of their tools, citing the ease of the command feed system to distribute the line. Reviewers did have varying responses to the battery life of this trimmer. Some said that they could trim for up to 30 minutes on one charged battery, whereas others said they could trim for only 15. - Source: Internet Wind the string in the opposite direction of its rotation. In most cases, you’ll want to wind the string counterclockwise. Many trimmer manufacturers imprint an arrow on the spool to show the proper direction to wind the string. - Source: Internet The string in your weed trimmer head can have a big impact on weekly yard work. Using the wrong string causes constant breaks or sticks inside the spool housing, forcing you to stop and reload frequently. But, the right pick provides ease of use and clean cutting, every time. - Source: Internet Starting the Husqvarna 324L is extremely easy. You do not have to keep pulling the cord to flood the engine anymore. All you need is a single pull and the engine will start by itself. The Husqvarna 324L weighs just about 11 pounds; while it might be lightweight, the trimmer provides a lot of power while maintaining maneuverability as well. Even though 4-stroke engine weed trimmers are considered heavy, the Husqvarna 324L is quite light. - Source: Internet The trimmer is equipped with a 2-cycle, 21.2cc engine; while it might not be the largest engine around, it is more than enough to do what you need it to do. The smaller engine also contributes to making this model quite lightweight. Due to the small engine, starting the Echo GT-225 is very easy and will not exert you in any way; as long as you have oil and gas, you can expect the trimmer to start easily. - Source: Internet Simply put, a string trimmer operates “with a shaft and string line that uses a circular motion to cut grass or weeds,” explained McCoy. The shaft can be either curved or straight. Straight shafts typically offer more customization: You can choose add-ons to switch out of the string trimmer head, McCoy said. Some of these attachments are specially designed for edges, others for trees. - Source: Internet Powered by a 25 cc 4-cycle engine, this Husqvarna trimmer model is designed to deliver precise cuts and improved accessibility.

This rotating tool can be used to mow down grass or weeds, and it also has the capability of throwing debris such as rocks. Most trimmers today include safety measures that make them less likely to cause injuries to the user or others. These precautions include: - Source: Internet The straight shaft trimmer or weedeater design is more functional. First of all, the straight shaft will be longer, which extends the reach. Taller people will quickly appreciate this. Also, a straight driveline generates less vibration, and because of a lower gear reduction, straight shaft trimmers generate more torque. - Source: Internet It appears that it is a good choice if you don’t use it to cut down a bamboo forest. If you want a reliable, sturdy machine with a sling and double handles, this would be a good option for the price. COOCHEER weed eater powers through thick grass and dense undergrowth. The offset U-handle feature provides unprecedented operational control and user comfort while operating this trimmer/grass cutter. - Source: Internet The downside to the Honda HHT35SLTAT is that it quickly goes through gas, which is not surprising considering the engine size, but it would often run out when we were far from a refill source. The trimmer is difficult to get off the tool, and refilling it is tedious, and it’s difficult to get the head back on when you are finished. At 17 pounds, it can get quite heavy after a short time. - Source: Internet The weight of a trimmer is another thing that you should consider while buying a weed eater for commercial purposes. As you know, clearing your larger fields will take time and therefore, it should not be heavy if you want to complete the work without getting tired. The weed eater’s weight can be determined by the elements it comprises. That’s why you should not go with trimmers that come with various parts. Power - Source: Internet Cordless string trimmers have the advantage of not needing an extension chord, but their higher price and lengthy charging time might be off-putting. The advantages of battery-powered string trimmers are also present in electric models, but with the added benefits of a lower price and an infinitely long run time. However, their power range is often limited, and you’ll need to lug an extension cord across your yard to get the job done. - Source: Internet However, it can be quite a pricey purchase if you don’t already have the Power Head and this trimmer can feel like it has too much power for average yards. The guard didn’t prevent freshly-cut weeds from getting flung back at us, and precision work can be quite difficult. It’s hard to avoid cutting trenches, and the Ego Power+ STA1500 can be brutal on things like birdbaths, outdoor lights, or the side of your house if you aren’t careful when using it. It’s not for everyone, but it’s a great option if you need heavy-duty string trimming capabilities and plan to get other Ego cordless tools. - Source: Internet Performance dropped a bit with the remaining trimmers. The Snapper XD 82V clocked in at 48 minutes of runtime and has two operating modes, but we didn’t notice a huge difference between the two modes except for the amount of noise produced. The low power mode still seems plenty powerful to chew through pretty much anything with the line we used. However, the difference between the two modes might be more noticeable with a different line. - Source: Internet The string trimmer weighs 10.3 lbs without the gas and has a good balance. This will make it easy to use for long periods of trimming without feeling tired. - Source: Internet String trimmer shafts differ in both form and function. In both curved and straight shaft gas trimmers, a motor connects to a cutting head by way of a shaft. The shaft on both models is going to be where the handle and the throttle are mounted. Within the metal shaft, a drive cable runs the length of the shaft, spun by the engine, and turns the cutting head at the other end of the trimmer. - Source: Internet This string trimmer is designed for homeowners on large lots that require extensive yard maintenance. The power behind a gas trimmer is hard to match from any other power source, and useful when cutting through less groomed areas of your yard. If you don’t mind dealing with an engine and the maintenance it occasionally requires, this weed eater could be a good fit for your trimming and edging needs. - Source: Internet While electric trimmers don’t require nearly as much maintenance as their gas counterparts, there are things you can do on a regular basis to keep them running well for an extended period. Kristi Howard, of Black \u0026 Decker Outdoor Products, says that a common problem with electric string trimmers involves people using the wrong gauge of extension cord to power them. Howard says you should be sure to use an extension cord that is heavy enough to carry the current your product will draw. - Source: Internet The string trimmer has a shock-absorption design, adding improved use-comfort. A translucent fuel tank allows you to monitor your fuel level as you work visually. The engine design limits run-time emissions and noise levels. Supplied with the product is a 10-inch, 3-tooth blade that makes cutting heavy vegetation easier. Included in the package is a shoulder strap that makes using this machine even more manageable. - Source: Internet Still, at 9.9 pounds, this corded weed eater is also nearly double the weight of other trimmers I’ve looked at, so you’ll need that handle to keep control. Annoyingly, even with the bolt tightened, it never feels entirely secure. - Source: Internet To summarize the straight shaft vs curved shaft string trimmers argument…both have their benefits and their weaknesses. However, when considering straight shaft vs curved shaft string trimmers, your intentions matter. Do you work with these tools daily? Are you a casual homeowner with a small yard? Are you tall or short?

It has a 25cc, 4-cycle engine that can spin the line up to 7,000 revolutions per minute (RPM). The 18-inch trimmer head makes short work of any tall grass and weeds, and the easy to use bumper feed releases line when you tap it on the ground for ultimate control. It’s lightweight at only 5 pounds, and it features a translucent fuel tank so you always know how much fuel remains. The air purge primer bulb removes air from the system, and it’s easy to reload the line. - Source: Internet The string could be places in the cutting head as part of a fixed line or spool. A fixed line means you don’t need to worry about the string getting jammed. But it tends to wear the line out faster. - Source: Internet To avoid any potential engine issues, hanging it on the wall, by the engine will keep your weed eater safe and well maintained. However, there are a couple of nuisances to be aware of should you have an electric or gas-powered weed eater, and a few additional rules to go by when storing your equipment. One of the most important considerations is how powerful the cutter is. If you choose a gas-powered trimmer, power is important, and you should pay attention to whether the power output is enough for the kind of jobs you want to do. Gas-powered engines in weed eaters are either 2-stroke or 4-stroke. - Source: Internet The Ryobi RY253SS is the best gas string trimmer for the money. See our review above to find out why. 2. What is the lightest gas string trimmer? - Source: Internet Weed trimmer string is available in round, square, multi-sided, twisted, and serrated shapes for different types of yard work. The shape of the string affects performance in several ways, including the cleanness of the cut, the durability of the string, and even noise level. It is important to match the shape with the application for which you’ll be using the string. - Source: Internet This offering from Black and Decker also converts from a trimmer to an edger with a simple turn of the trimmer’s shaft making it an excellent investment for many of your lawn care needs. Moreover, it has a curved shaft that makes trimming and cutting actually more comfortable even if this is not a task that you enjoy. It has a straight shaft which makes it easier to get under bushes, etc and it does seem to eat up the line like lots of weed eaters do. - Source: Internet String trimmer power is mostly determined by tradeoffs among efficiency, portability, and cost. When it comes to power, gas is unrivaled, and refueling takes only minutes. However, they are noisy, not maintenance-free, require a mixture of oil and gas, and emit harmful gases. String trimmers powered by batteries are quieter, produce no emissions, and require hardly any upkeep. Furthermore, modern technology may achieve the same level of performance as a 30cc engine while lasting about as long as a tank of gas. - Source: Internet To properly maintain an electric trimmer, Howard suggests checking for damaged parts and cleaning off the air intake slots before each use to avoid overheating. She says you should never immerse an electric string trimmer in water or clean it with a pressure washer, and you should store it indoors, out of reach of children. “Keeping your trimmer regularly maintained should minimize your need for larger repairs,” Howard adds. - Source: Internet can carry consistent amounts of power through an electrical outlet with a cord, this is unlike a battery-powered string trimmer, which is cordless. A battery powered string trimmer will run with less noise and feature batteries that usually are often compatible with other indoor and outdoor power tools. If you’re wondering how the batteries on string trimmer compare, Hudson suggested looking at total watts on each. The higher the wattage, the more power. - Source: Internet The workhorse could chop down weeds as long as my waist level with ease. The trimmer’s deflector prevented a lot of bad debris from flying around. The RM1159 is quite compact and can easily reach around small corners and nooks. Once I was done with the mowing process, my lawn looked like entirely new terrain. - Source: Internet The head of a string trimmer holds the spool. And the “string” in string trimmer does actually refer to a string. Many of the more modern string trimmers will have an easy-load spool to let you load string through two holes without having to remove the spool at all — the spool winds up the string to work, Bateman noted. He recommended beginners find a string trimmer with an easy-load spool feature — some traditional and professional-grade string trimmers require taking the entire spool out to replace the string. - Source: Internet The weed-wacker String Trimmer is a robust 30cc 4-cycle gas-powered string trimmer that makes less noise and eliminates the need to mix gas and oil. With a cutting width of 17 inches, you can trim more grass in less time. This machine allows you to get to cutting faster thanks to features like enhanced 2-step starting and a high-capacity, easy-winding bump head. - Source: Internet The Milwaukee 2825-21ST M18 FUEL String Trimmer is our premium choice pick. It’s a battery-powered trimmer that allows complete portability and near-silent operation.

We tried to list any models that used outdated systems in our reviews. - Source: Internet A string trimmer is a tool that can help you trim tall grass and weeds in your garden. The string trimmer has a nylon string instead of a blade to do the cutting. This nylon string rotates very fast and helps to cut the weeds. - Source: Internet Hands down, it’s one of the most user-friendly and result-driven trimmers on the market.

We also included weed wacker strings of varying sizes for light- to heavy-duty yard work, ranging from .080 to .155 inches, making them compatible with a range of residential and commercial weed wacker heads. - Source: Internet In the straight shaft vs curved shaft string trimmers argument, the extended straight shaft string trimmer typically weighs more and feels less balanced than curved. Because professionals are likely to use straight over curved shafts, the increased quality of the components also drives up the price. Pro-grade models tend to include more features, further affecting the price point. - Source: Internet The shaft is a straight line one that is suitable if you’re tall so you don’t need to bend while trimming.

Here, you need to pull this line a few times, which is quite time-consuming and tiring also. Meanwhile, some trimmers do not even start with consistent pulling. That’s the reason you should go with weed eaters that come with S-start or sequential start. - Source: Internet While choosing a commercial weed eater, you should also take into consideration the cutting path. It is important if you need a tool that will assist you in clearing grass on a lawn effectively. Plus, it takes lesser time to accomplish the task. Most trimmers come with a small cutting track that is quite less effective when you clear larger fields. - Source: Internet It’s not a great feeling to get injured by the string trimmer.

However, some reviewers noticed a performance decrease during the trimming of thick grass and weeds, and others felt the weed eater was heavy and awkward, despite the curved design. In one particular review, a customer detailed beneficial steps when mixing your gas and oil, noting that non-ethanol gasoline is the best to use, and explaining the importance of mixing according to the manufacturer’s instructions. - Source: Internet String trimmers can be gas or electric. If you’re going with gas, you’ll enjoy a more powerful trimmer that lasts through your work. Electric weed eaters emit fewer fumes and are therefore less of a health risk and more environmentally friendly. The drawback is that you sometimes lose power or endurance when going electric. - Source: Internet That depends on your specific needs. Trimmers with curved shafts are usually shorter, lighter, and cheaper. Straight shafts are longer, so they can reach a wider radius, and these trimmers typically produce more torque. You’ll notice all of our top picks have straight shafts. - Source: Internet Though Amazon customer’s suggest this trimmer’s battery life is better than most other battery-operated products, it is still best suited for small jobs. Since there is only one included battery, it is important to be able to finish the job on one charge.

A wider cutting will go through more string, but the time-saving advantage makes it worth it. If choosing between two similar models, we recommend the one with the bigger cutting width. - Source: Internet We test our gas-engine and battery-powered string trimmers in identical fashion. We use the machines on ordinary suburban lawn grasses such as blue grass, perennial ryegrass, and fescues in a variety of suburban and rural locations. However, our most severe testing occurred along the sloping bank of a sand floor drainage basin in southern New Jersey, where we used the trimmers to cut down knee-deep weeds and wild flowers. We also did considerable edging where sidewalks meet lawns. - Source: Internet In their Amazon reviews, many customers commented on the longevity of the included battery, a compliment that many battery-powered trimmers do not typically receive. Reviewers also praised the weed eater’s balanced weight and telescoping handle that adjusts to the user’s height.

I have to offer several reasons why you should choose the GT-225 over others. Just because it is a lightweight trimmer does not mean that it lacks power. The Echo GT-225 is capable of edging and trimming without giving up midway. While other models pack a lot more power, they do not have the combination of being lightweight and powerful at the same time. - Source: Internet The handle of electric string trimmers might be fixed.

Though powerful enough to cut through brush and heavy grass found on large lots, the cord limits mobility to around 100 feet from the power source. However, despite an awkward design, the trimmer is affordable and effective. - Source: Internet Round string comes in all sizes. It is economical, durable, and easy to reload. A round string is best for lawns with mostly grass and just a few weeds. It is not as efficient on weedy properties because the smooth edges tend to tear through weeds rather than cutting cleanly. A round string is also more likely to overheat and weld together when trimming along concrete walls or fences. - Source: Internet Even on the thorniest grass, the RM1159 can be pushed easily. It is quite lightweight and easy to maneuver around any type of terrain. The trimmer is very easy to use and starts right up after you unpack it. The trimmer is fully-assembled and equipped with 14-inch wheels, which lets you move the machine with ease. - Source: Internet Husqvarna Gas Straight Shaft String Trimmer 128LD - Editor’s Choice Via Amazon.com Husqvarna 128ld String Trimmer is one of the best weed eaters that I have ever tried!

For me, it is the right trimmer that can cut an overgrown lawn before using a lawnmower. - Source: Internet However, four-stroke engines are lubricated with oil from a reservoir, while two-stroke versions are not. It means you need to mix oil into the fuel manually with a two-stroke engine, and you will probably need to change the spark plugs more often. Uses quick start technology that makes the pull start easier when compared to other trimmers in the market. You can simply tap the head on the ground to feed more line on your trimmer. Very easy to assemble as you just have to reposition the handle and install its guard. - Source: Internet There are many reasons to purchase this cordless string trimmer but let’s start with the basics. For starters, it’s a dual function model that combines a string trimmer and a brush cutter. Therefore, if you want something that can power through a dense and thick overgrowth, get your hands on this power tool. - Source: Internet One Amazon customer pointed out that the trimmer provides comparable power to that of a gas trimmer, but without the powerful fumes. On arrival, many reviewers raved about its easy assembly, allowing them to get out and take care of their yard quickly. Though many reviewers described the product’s powerful performance, there are also a number of reviewers that critiqued its design, citing poor ergonomics that caused the hand to wrap awkwardly around the handle. - Source: Internet For professional use, Bateman’s pick is this trimmer from STIHL, which is well-known for its chainsaws and other outdoor equipment. It features a rubberized loop handle to grip at the center of the shaft and baffles, which are tools that help reduce the noise coming from the trimmer. Bateman also said this trimmer could work well for those with larger properties. “This gas-powered trimmer is exceptionally easy to start, has a ton of power for cutting through tall weeds and has reduced vibration which is great for longer use,” Bateman explained. Although sold out on STIHL’s own website, you can find the model at Ace Hardware and receive free in-store or curbside pick up with it. - Source: Internet Using a mower might be a bit of an overkill in such situations, so it’s best to opt for a weed eater instead. Obviously, weed trimmers are not the most original idea, but one that needs some thinking through. Mainly because there are plenty of gas weed eater options out there, but very few can actually meet your expectations. - Source: Internet This trimmer is equipped with an adjustable anti-vibration assist handle and bump feed trimmer head, built with the user’s comfort in mind.

The cushioning on the handle will ensure that your hands feel minimum vibration while using the machinery. The handle assembly can also be folded down for easier storage. - Source: Internet Its lightweight telescopic pole and overall weight of 5.07 pounds is pretty small compared to other trimmers. Still, while the cutting path is smaller, it’s much easier to lug around the garden. - Source: Internet There are many different types of weed trimmers you can see in the market today. Some are powered by gas, some by a battery, while others by electricity. While the ultimate goal of trimming the lawn is met, they tend to differ in many aspects. - Source: Internet A 4-stroke engine runs on straight gasoline, so you won’t have to mix fuel. String trimmers with 4-stroke engines are typically quieter and have better fuel efficiency than 2-stroke weed eaters. These benefits are what makes 4-cycle trimmers cost more. However, these also require more maintenance, since these tools need regular oil changes. - Source: Internet If you’re anything like me, at some point you might have wondered about the difference between straight shaft vs curved shaft string trimmers or weedeaters. Most folks might tend to think that one string trimmer design was the same as any other. I’ve worked on a few lawn crews over the years—as well as having spent years maintaining my own lawn. You may be tempted to think that one trimmer design works exactly the same as the other. - Source: Internet The Husqvarna 324L is a straightforward hand-held trimmer that has a cutting circumference of 17-inches. It is fitted with a 25cc X-Torq engine and equipped with a Smart Start System. The X-Torq engine helps increase the efficiency of fuel by up to 20% and reduces the emission of harmful exhaust by 60%.

Plus, they don’t need refueling to work. - Source: Internet To use this beast, you have to mix the fuel like other 2-cycle weed trimmers. You needn’t be concerned about improper mixing ratios that foul the engine. Thankfully, the manufacturer sells a designed 2-cycle engine oil formulated to mix with one gallon of gasoline. - Source: Internet To begin with, this weed eater has some incredible features which make it exceedingly handy and functional. For instance, it runs on a robust 4-cycle engine, delivering high performance and power with low operating noise. This bit is important as you don’t want to be that annoying neighbor who runs a loud trimmer. - Source: Internet Even if you aren’t familiar with the term “string trimmer,” you’re probably familiar with the tool itself. These tools go by many names, including weed eater, weed wacker, grass trimmer, and weed trimmer. Don’t worry too much about which name to use — they’re all the same thing. - Source: Internet “My pick for homeowners would be a powerful battery model so you don’t need to worry about wires or filling with gas,” Monji said. For the average yard, Bateman agreed that battery-powered string trimmer would be best, especially since he has seen battery life improve significantly in recent years. The kinds of weeds in your front or back yard also can help you decide whether you need an electric, gas or battery-powered trimmer. With thick weeds or overgrown lawns, an electric or battery powered trimmer could struggle more than one that uses gas, Bateman said. - Source: Internet However, what seals the deal for us is the “tap and go” line release, streamlining weed removal from the get-go. Unlike dated models, the T25 trimmer head enables easy line reloading, which further adds to the user’s convenience.

We will look at weights, balance, power, starters, and the most frustrating part of using a string trimmer, changing cutting lines. We will look at how easy it is to start them and how difficult it is to restart them once they’re running hot. - Source: Internet If you value ease of use, electric trimmers are a smart choice. As long as you have a cord and access to an outlet, you have unlimited runtime with a trimmer that is simple to start, quiet while running, and requires little maintenance. The downside to many electric trimmers is that they aren’t very portable, and can only go as far as the cord will allow. These weed eaters are a great choice for small yards. - Source: Internet In terms of weight, it’s about average for a corded weed eater, coming in at 6.5 pounds. Thankfully, this corded string trimmer has a D-ring handle, which makes precision work straightforward. - Source: Internet The trimmer is quite durable and has a very robust construction.

Michelle has made a career of evaluating products side-by-side, comprehensively testing, and scoring the smallest details, and differentiating factors on everything from coffee grinders to cordless power tools. Additionally, she also brings extensive lawn care experience to the table. David has formal training as a mechanical engineer with extensive experience in lithium batteries and electrical power systems, which he gained from working on electric vehicles and underwater robots. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>trimmer</strong> employs a bump feed to dispense more <strong>string</strong>, but it&rsquo;s a little more difficult to replace the <strong>string</strong> than some of the other models. There aren&rsquo;t alignment indicators on the spool, which forced us to consult a manual, but it was straightforward once we became familiar with it. This minor drawback should only be an issue once or twice, after which you&rsquo;ll get the hang of it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Tanaka TCG27EBSP is a gas <strong>trimmer</strong> that comes with a 26.9cc, 2-cycle commercial grade engine. This means you can use it for professional trimming or in a large garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While the materials used to make <strong>trimmer</strong> <strong>string</strong>s are all reasonably weld resistant, some <strong>string</strong> types have a higher degree of resistance than others. Given the same material, shaped line is more weld-resistant than round because of the increased surface area. Round <strong>string</strong> has the least amount of surface area, allowing heat buildup to occur more quickly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Every <strong>trimmer</strong> we looked into could cut regular lawn grass, but we needed one that could also handle weeds and thick growth. At that point, we saw the first big differences between the models. The less powerful <strong>trimmer</strong>s had trouble with the rougher terrain. They got stuck in the grass or pushed it over instead of cutting it. Because we don’t have a rating for how much current the motor uses, we have to make more accurate estimates or extrapolations based on other metrics, such as run time and battery capacity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the difference in the Echo, besides the curved shaft, is the rapid feed line. Unlike the bump feed, the rapid feed puts out <strong>string</strong> itself. However, at times, it is known to get stuck. The rapid feed is convenient for users. Pros The Echo is lightweight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Square <strong>trimmer</strong> line has four hard cutting edges that are designed to aggressively cut through coarse weeds and green underbrush, where it excels. Round line is quieter and more fuel-efficient due to reduced wind resistance. It is also more durable than square line of the same size because it consists of more material. For generally weed-free lawns, round line could be the best choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The RYOBI 2 Cycle Gas Straight Shaft String Trimmer comes with a full crank engine for life twice as long as others. This <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> accepts RYOBI Expand-It Universal Brand Fit attachments adding versatility to your <strong>trimmer</strong>. Attach an edger, a blower, or even a tiller to the powerhead and quickly move from project to project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You want to wear safety goggles to protect your eyes from flying debris. Gas <strong>trimmer</strong>s can be loud so protect your ears with ear muffs or ear plugs. Protect your hands by using a good pair of safety gloves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=4><li>Remington RM1159 Walk-Behind High-Wheeled String Trimmer Via Amazon.com If I was looking for an upgrade, I would definitely go for the Remington RM1159 <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>. If you want to get rid of tall and nasty weeds, you can knock them out of the park with this walk-behind <strong>trimmer</strong>; in short, I could say that this <strong>trimmer</strong> is basically a weed eater on steroids. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Efficiency and power are two benefits of length in a <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>. It may not seem like much, but if you have a lot of weedy areas to clear up, the extra cutting you’ll have to do on each pass can add up quickly. Power saving is another area where length excels, as length results in a faster cutting line tip at a given engine speed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The efficiency with which a line cuts can also be affected by its shape. The line used for <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s might be formed like a circle, a square, a star, or even be sliced into sharp edges. The most popular kind has a rounded edge, but since it doesn’t have a cutting edge, it rips the grass instead of cutting it. The line with the twist is marginally superior because the shape it creates is marginally more pointed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Better materials, like reinforced composite nylon have a greater more cutting power and breakage resistance. Some products include strengthening materials like aluminum that are incorporated into the nylon or a hardened core material to prevent breakage. Other <strong>trimmer</strong> <strong>string</strong>s are made from non-nylon polymers or copolymers for added strength. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Electric <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s are relatively quiet; the whirling of the <strong>string</strong> and the cutting sound are usually the loudest parts. Unlike their gas-powered rivals, these <strong>trimmer</strong>s are much quieter and hence rarely necessitate the use of hearing protection. These are the kinds that need a little extra vigor to get through the heftier outdoor tasks. We tried to find a middle ground between the high screech and the hair dryer hum produced by the <strong>trimmer</strong>s we evaluated. This would be better for your ears and more considerate for your neighbors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Make sure to get a weed eater that matches your skill level and experience. After all, you don’t want to buy something too advanced only to underuse it. Also, with some <strong>trimmer</strong> models, there’s a learning curve, so you might want to take that into account. On that note, we would like to sign off with a quick recap of our findings on the best weed eater. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s have speed adjustments to accommodate a variety of trimming applications. On battery-powered models, power can be increased for trimming thicker or more overgrown regions and decreased for trimming perimeters while conserving battery life. When dealing with dense vegetation or tenacious weeds, the throttle responsiveness of a gas-powered <strong>trimmer</strong> can enable rapid power adjustments. Many <strong>trimmer</strong>s have only one fixed speed, regardless of the environment. A <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>’s runtime is maximized with only one speed, both in terms of battery life and fuel usage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Make sure the <strong>trimmer</strong> is off and cool so you can open the filter cover and remove the air filter. Wash the air filter in soapy water and let it dry. Then you can put some motor oil on it and squeeze it so the oil coats evenly. Put the air filter back in position and close the filter cover. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But there are a few bonus features offered by some manufacturers that can take your <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> from “good” to the best weed eater around. However—and this is a big drawback for some—the power cord can severely limit your range and may prove to be a hazard. It may be all too easy for some to cut through it by accident or even trip over it while they work. For these reasons, corded weed eaters are best for those with smaller yards, who live in big towns, and who can stick close to home for their trimming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Trimmer line ranges in size from about .065-inch to .170-inch. Large diameter line requires a properly sized <strong>trimmer</strong> head and more power to operate. Be sure to check the weed wacker’s operator’s manual for compatibility before attempting to load a new size. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Select readers have been increasingly interested in patio furniture sales and expert-recommended gas grills, too. Sprucing up greenery around your home might be on your to-do list ahead of the summer — and one of the tools that might be handy to have on hand is a <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>. We consulted experts on what <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s are, how they work and what are the best <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s to consider right now. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Basic <strong>trimmer</strong> <strong>string</strong> is made of hardened monofilament nylon. This material has been the industry standard for years, but manufacturers are making constant improvements to increase durability and capability. Plain nylon line is still effective, but stronger materials are now available. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Remington RM25S is a true budget pick. It’s a bit of a contradiction, since it’s heavy (more than 15 pounds), it has the smallest cutting width of all the <strong>trimmer</strong>s on this list, and it has only a 25 cc, 2-cycle engine. For the price, though, it’s a solid weed eater and brush cutter for residential use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With the RM2530 Rustler, Remington presents the perfect partner in your battle to keep tall grass and weeds at bay. The Rustler™ gas-powered <strong>trimmer</strong>/edger’s powerful 25cc 2-cycle engine and 16-inch cutting swath help you power through more territory at once. QuickStart™ technology makes getting started faster and easier. And when your <strong>trimmer</strong> line wears down, never fear – just tap the dual-line bump head on the ground, and more line is ready for action. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We’re, for most parts, satisfied with its design and performance, but the only thing that bothered us was the weight. This straight shaft <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> clocks in a little over 18 lbs, which is undoubtedly quite bulky and heavy for some users. Therefore, it’s not meant for extended use since you’re most likely to develop muscle fatigue early on when cutting weeds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Interestingly enough, The PoulanPro brand is owned by Husqvarna. Poulan Pro <strong>trimmer</strong>s boast features that ensure there’s a unit that’s perfect for every job. The PR28CD features a 28cc, 2-stroke engine with a curved shaft and 16-inch cut path. As an attachment-capable <strong>trimmer</strong> with Pro-Link™, this unit accepts six optional attachments that make it even more versatile. From standard trimming to blowing, tilling, hedge trimming, edging, brush cutting, and even tree pruning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Remington RM25C Curved Shaft Gas String Trimmer is our pick as the best commercial weed eater for the money. It has a powerful 25cc, 2-stroke engine with QuickStart technology that makes it much easier to pull the <strong>string</strong>. It has a 16-inch <strong>trimmer</strong> head to quickly cut through the tallest grass, and a curved shaft makes it easier to see where the blade is cutting. The dual-line bump feed is twice as effective as a single line and is easy to control. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After use, clean the <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> with a cloth and dish soap to avoid a clogged machine. Remove and clean air and fuel filters as well as the spark plug. Some gas weed eaters may need oil changes too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Craftsman WS2200 is more ergonomic. Although this wacker is also as heavy as 15.87 lbs, it has an adjustable winding bump <strong>trimmer</strong> head that you can adjust the over-mold handle to control the operation and improve comfort. You need to pick your preferred working position and lock the handle in place. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Our next metric focused on the battery system of each <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>, and this accounts for 25% of each product&rsquo;s final score. We based the bulk of this score on the maximum runtime for each product and awarded extra points to models with different speed settings because it allows you to maximize the battery life by throttling down when extra speed is unnecessary. We measured the runtime for these weed eaters when they weren&rsquo;t actually eating weeds, so you&rsquo;ll probably get lower numbers if you&rsquo;re chewing through dense vegetation or particularly stubborn weeds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Makita XRU15PT 36V again earned the top score in this metric. It is exceptionally well balanced, with the battery end of the <strong>trimmer</strong> only slightly heavier than the head, making it easy to carry one-handed and to wield through fields of grass. The molded, ergonomic grip makes it easy to keep a good grip without working too hard. We also liked the guard on this model because it doesn&rsquo;t detract from your ability to do precise cuts while maintaining an equivalent degree of protection. The Makita XRU15PT includes a shoulder strap attachment as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sometimes the straight shaft vs curved shaft debate doesn’t need to happen. Two-piece powerhead units allow for more flexible use. These attachment-capable tools can choose the greater torque and power of a straight shaft <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> or the ergonomics of a curved shaft. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The first and foremost reason for the gas <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s is their superiority in power and durability – as long as their maintenance is not lackluster. Next, this type of weed eater is not limited to moving around. You can maneuver around obstacles in your grass. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bateman suggested this model as “a much cheaper option that gets the job done for small yards.” It features an 18-inch cutting path to cover more ground and a molded grip handle to make it easier to use in your hand. The <strong>trimmer</strong> also includes a lock to keep the cord in place as you move around the lawn. It’s a popular pick with Amazon shoppers, earning a 4.4-star rating over close to 2,000 reviews. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Both a weed eater and a lawnmower are used to cut the overgrown weeds. Primarily, an eater is small, using a fast spinning microfilament <strong>string</strong> stiff enough to cut small portions of grass. Most lawnmowers, however, are bulkier with a motor and a rotary blade. The blade cuts the grass more quickly and with hardly any skill. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In line with these objectives, this Tanaka <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> weighs just 10.1 pounds upon being assembled. This machine begins immediately with the S-Start feature and a Walbro carburetor. It has anti-vibration mounts and a lengthy 54-inch drive shaft to reduce fatigue from constantly bending. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In a nutshell, I can’t see any reason to pick a gas-powered <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> over an electric weed eater. Gas is pricey, worse for the environment, and challenging to keep in stock. Electricity is cheap, and it is much more sustainable than gas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you need a <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> that can handle dense plants and grass without a struggle, then it&rsquo;s worth checking out the Ego Power+ STA1500 <strong>string</strong> trimming attachment for the Ego Power+ Power Head. It is easily one of the most powerful <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s of the group and sliced through dense weeds and tall grass without difficulty. It can clear areas that would have stopped other products dead in their tracks. We also think it&rsquo;s fairly comfortable to use and a compact way to add a cordless <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> to your arsenal if you have the aforementioned Power Head. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We have arranged the 15 weed eaters (line <strong>trimmer</strong>s) in our review alphabetically by brand name. There are so many variations that comparing them is like comparing apples and pears – it all depends on what is essential to the individual user. Let’s have a look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Instead of a blade, <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s use a <strong>string</strong> (or “line”) to slice through foliage. String <strong>trimmer</strong>s consist of a long shaft with a cutting head, also known as a <strong>trimmer</strong> head, on one end. The cutting head is the part of the tool where you load the <strong>string</strong>, and it’s the part that does the cutting (thus the name). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A pair of <strong>trimmer</strong>s tied for the top spot when it came to eating weeds; namely, the Makita XRU15PT 36V and the Ego Power+ STA1500 Attachment. Both are exceptionally effective at eliminating weeds, cutting through pretty much any grasses, weeds, shrubs, and bushes we pitted them against smoothly and effectively. They both tackled tall grass and dense weeds with ease, even cutting through burly stalks and stems without showing any sign of a struggle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The brushless motor powers the Greenworks PRO 80V engine. The design of the <strong>trimmer</strong> is straight and made of an aluminum shaft, which provides ergonomics and balance while trimming. The trigger can be adjusted to Variable Speed to provide more control over the cutting power. The overall construction of the Greenworks PRO 80V is lightweight yet extremely durable, which makes it easy to maneuver without having to compromise on the strength. Check On Amazon Pros The single charge of one battery can last you for 30 minutes - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Husqvarna and the Snapper both followed. We recorded sound levels of 88.5 decibels for the Snapper XD. The Husqvarna is very loud on startup, registering 105 decibels, but this quickly drops to around 95 decibels while operating the <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>. The Snapper has a whine that can be quite grating, while our judges believe the Husqvarna&rsquo;s sound is one of the least annoying; it&rsquo;s just loud. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What Should I Look for in an Electric Weed Wacker? You should look for an adjustable handle, blade guard, lightweight design, and versatility. You’ll want to be comfortable holding one of these tools for hours, so pick a model that fits your height and isn’t too heavy. Being able to switch the <strong>string</strong> with other attachments can also save space and money. Are Electric Weed Eaters Worth It? Electric weed eaters are worth the investment since you won’t need to purchase pricey gas to fuel them. You can use them anywhere there’s an electrical outlet and extension cable, and you’ll never have to recharge or refuel them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To say we put each <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> through its paces would be an understatement. We implemented 72 individual tests between the 9 <strong>trimmer</strong>s in the review, running each through the same 8 tests to comparatively assess aspects ranging from weed-eating power to noise levels. This allows us to rank each in accordance with its performance in each metric and make special recommendations for the specific needs of homeowners or anyone looking to improve their yard. We paid retail price for each model to ensure an unbiased assessment of these <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“provides power to handle the toughest jobs without the need of an extension cord.” Hudson recommended using non-ethanol gasoline for the best performance. An electric <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> can carry consistent amounts of power through an electrical outlet with a cord, this is unlike a battery-powered <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>, which is cordless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s, monofilament nylon lines are most commonly used. This line can be purchased in both spools and rolls and comes in various lengths, making it easy to customize. When working with electric <strong>trimmer</strong>s that have a lower power output, a thinner line of roughly 1/16 inch is preferable. In addition to being useful for edging lawns and flower beds, this method is also useful for clipping any stray grass that may emerge there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Like the Weed Eating metric, Ease of Use also constitutes 30% of the total score for each cordless <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>. Here we compared the weight and guard design of each <strong>trimmer</strong>, as well as how comfortable and balanced they are to hold. We also compared the ease of replacing and feeding the line and noted if there was a shoulder strap attachment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ideally, the trimming speed can reach 7000 RPM and create a cutting path of 10 inches across the grass. At this speed, you should be careful while moving the machine. Cover the <strong>trimmer</strong> head with a safety guard when you do not use it. There is also a safety valve throttle that protects the engine from accidental starts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Of our top picks, the Husqvarna 324L is by far the lightest at only 5.1 pounds. That’s even light for an electric <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>. 3. Is a straight or curved shaft <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> better? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Reviewers on Amazon were satisfied with the ergonomics of the weed eater, complimenting the user-friendliness of the adjustable shaft and handle. Though some reviewers thought the push-button feed system was unhelpful, others preferred it to the Tap ‘N Go system of other models, which administers a new line by tapping the <strong>trimmer</strong>’s head to the ground. Despite being battery-powered, one customer stated the weed eater lasted long enough to trim their almost three-acre yard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Size, weight, and maneuverability of your weed <strong>trimmer</strong> should accommodate the type of work you need to get done. If your yard has a lot of trees or lawn furniture and you need to get in nooks and crannies, stay away from heavy-duty weed eaters with wide shields. A heavier option may be a better fit though if you’ve got an open space and you want a power tool that can make strong, sweeping cuts through intense brush. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The other major benefit is that gas engines aren’t limited by either an extension cord or a battery’s run time. If a gas <strong>trimmer</strong> runs out of juice in the middle of a job, all you have to do is fill up the tank and keep working. You don’t have to wait for a battery to recharge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The only real issue I have with this corded <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> is that its best strength is also its weakness. The adjustable handles don’t always stay fixed when trimming, which is a rather worrying safety issue. It also suffers from a common problem with <strong>trimmer</strong>s like these: a narrow cord retention slot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cordless varieties are also more cost-effective than battery-powered weed eaters since batteries may need replacement after a few years of use. How Powerful Should an Electric String Trimmer Be? Your electric <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> should be powerful enough to cut through stalky weeds and dense grass. 5 amp models can easily cut through tough plants, while 3 amp corded weed eaters can only manage in thin grass with few delicate weeds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It turns out that the answer is not very much. Electric <strong>trimmer</strong>s can chew through the typical grass and weeds you’ll face in the garden, so power is no issue. They’re also much more lightweight without a heavy gas-powered motor and full fuel tank, meaning you can go for longer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Troy-Bilt TB525 EC Curved Shaft Trimmer is designed for the perfectionist in you. If you like to keep the lawn or garden a certain way, it’s important to get the right tools for the job. But then again, you don’t want to spend hours cutting grass, and hence we recommend buying this good <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Makita XUX01ZM5 Brushless Cordless Couple Shaft String Trimmer is a battery-powered <strong>trimmer</strong> that uses a powerful 18-volt battery. The brushless motor can produce up to 7,100 RPM, and it’s adjustable with 3 speeds so you can set a balance between power and battery life. An electronic torque control automatically shuts off the <strong>trimmer</strong> if the machine slows down or suddenly stops, and a lever style lock system makes changing heads and attachments easy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For the greatest durability, round <strong>string</strong> is the standard. Combining more material with less surface area, it has a longer wear time. Round <strong>string</strong> made of reinforced nylon or non-nylon polymer, or <strong>string</strong> with a hardened core material, will provide greater durability than basic nylon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In a straight shaft system like the EGO Power Head <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>, the drive cable accomplishes the same function, but since there is no curve to account for, the cable is less vulnerable to breakage. Straight shaft <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s can employ a variety of driving mechanisms, from steel cables to solid steel driveshafts. Because the drive cable/shaft experiences less bending, straight shaft <strong>trimmer</strong>s tend to hold up better over time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It is well balanced for easy maneuverability and comes with a harness and safety glasses for added user comfort. But it has a lot of other features to commend it as a great choice in 4 stroke <strong>trimmer</strong>s. Straight shaft <strong>trimmer</strong>s have the advantage of transferring power more efficiently to the <strong>trimmer</strong> head. Given all the moving parts of a gas-powered <strong>trimmer</strong>, these particular types of weed eaters can be somewhat expensive to maintain. Because the gas-powered <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> has no cord, it is not limited by the length of that cord as to where it can go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Husqvarna 128ld <strong>trimmer</strong> is fitted with a 2-stroke, 28-cc engine, which makes it optimized for performance. The 1-horsepower engine is powerful enough to cut through bush-like terrain with no hassles. Similar to other gas-powered <strong>trimmer</strong>s, the Husqvarna 128ld also makes use of 100% gasoline, which needs to be mixed with oil before use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>All of the power goes to a longer <strong>string</strong>, which means that they tend to operate at higher RPMs. A <strong>trimmer</strong> is an essential tool for keeping your yard neat and tidy. However, with so many different models, it can be confusing to make your purchase decision. So, here we’ve created a buying guide with the features to look for, things to consider and the answers to some common questions to help you make your final choice. The curved shaft allows you to see the trimming point without a need to strain, while not increasing the bulkiness of the <strong>trimmer</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=3><li>Echo GT-225 2 Cycle Curved Shaft Gas Trimmer Via Amazon.com The Echo GT-225 is one of my favorite budget picks for lawn care. While it might be quite light, it promises to be sturdy enough and get the job done. While it might be void of some features housed by other weed eater models, for the price range, you will be purchasing a decent <strong>trimmer</strong> that can handle daily wear-and-tear and will last for many years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Manufacturers make many accessories for these power heads. Additionally, these tools tend to support larger <strong>string</strong> gauges. Metal and plastic cutting blades can even replace <strong>trimmer</strong> line should the need ever arise. These tools also let you replace the weedeater head with a pole saw, edger, articulating hedge <strong>trimmer</strong>, power brush—even a cultivator for tilling soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“An undersized cord will cause a drop in line voltage resulting in loss of power and overheating,” Howard explains. “When in doubt, use the next heavier gauge.” She says the letters WA on the cord jacket indicate a cord that is suitable for outdoor use. Regarding corded versus cordless <strong>trimmer</strong>s, Howard feels they are comparable in terms of power. Corded <strong>trimmer</strong>s are generally less expensive than battery-operated <strong>trimmer</strong>s and are easy to maintain, but they have less mobility. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For battery-powered <strong>trimmer</strong>s, our primary goal was to assess power and run time. For gas-engine <strong>trimmer</strong>s, we wanted to judge whether the power they provided was offset by their noise and weight. For all <strong>trimmer</strong>s, we wanted to see if each machine was comfortable and well balanced, and whether its line feed was finicky or robust. We found that especially when we were using the machines to cut down weeds, the growth was so tough, it took an immediate toll on the <strong>trimmer</strong>’s line, causing us to use the bump feed line mechanism at twice or three times the rate that we would in normal grass trimming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Other lines come in the form of a square or a star. These <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> lines have edges that are sharper than those of rounded <strong>trimmer</strong> lines, which allows them to cut through the grass rather than rip it as they work. You also have the option of going with a line that has serrations on it if you want a <strong>trimmer</strong> line that is even sharper as it saws through thicker grass and weeds with little effort. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We took each <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> to various locations to test them on all kinds of grasses (short and tall), shrubs, and bushes. The Ego STA1500 was able to cut just about everything we pointed it at. Credit: Jenna Ammerman - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The 20-volt battery-powered weed eater from CRAFTSMAN offers customers a quiet, portable solution to their yard maintenance needs. To maximize the power of the battery, the <strong>trimmer</strong> offers two-speed settings to allow you to optimize your battery’s life. The weed eater’s battery pack can also easily transfer to any number of your CRAFTSMAN tools that have a compatible battery pack. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Every <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>, whether cordless, plug-in electric, or gas-powered, has limitations on line size. Line diameter is a good indicator of durability. Assuming the same material and shape, a thicker line lasts longer. Thicker line also costs more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>No matter which model you buy, it’s essential to check how the <strong>trimmer</strong> starts. Anything which requires multiple attempts is a no-go, as you don’t want to be pulling cords for several minutes. That said, most weed eater models on our list need minimal effort to start engine operation. However, some of them need a separate starter, which is not included with the <strong>trimmer</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In our recent best <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> review article, we featured exclusively straight shaft models. There’s a reason for that. It’s the preferred form factor for cordless at present. While some curve models do exist, manufacturers don’t give them as much attention. We’ll try to articulate why that might be the case in this article. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ahead of its time, Husqvarna launched the solar-powered Automower® robotic mower in 1995 already. The company currently has 27 line <strong>trimmer</strong> models on offer, ranging from the 122C at $159.99 to the iconic 535LK at $519.99. We reviewed the best generalist machine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Husqvarna 128LD weighs 10.8 lbs which makes it lightweight for a gas <strong>trimmer</strong>. It should be easy to carry this <strong>trimmer</strong> around for a long period of time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So, stop mixing oil and gas and take control of your lawn care with the Sunseeker 4-Cycle WBP31BCF Straight Shaft 2-in-1 Grass Trimmer and Brush Cutter is a versatile, powerful tool. The WBP31BCF has a grass <strong>trimmer</strong> attachment for detail work along borders and a brush cutter blade for heavier grasses and brush clearing. It also includes a harness to relieve the strain on your arms and improve stability. Powered by a 31cc, 4-cycle, full-crankshaft engine, your WBP31BCF is designed for reliability. The full-crank design delivers a fast start and smooth operation, reducing emissions, increasing fuel efficiency, and delivering a longer life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In total, we conducted a dozen distinct tests that we divided among four weighted rating metrics. Each of these metrics — Weed Eating, Ease of Use, Battery Life, and Noise — are weighted proportional to their importance to overall <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> performance. The score for each metric is determined by the performance of each <strong>trimmer</strong> in the tests composing each metric. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To give it enough power to stand among commercial-grade <strong>trimmer</strong>s, this machine has a 21.1cc PureFire 2-Stroke engine. This engine doesn’t significantly add weight nor does it have difficulties related to maintenance, and the fuel tank capacity is at an acceptable 14.9 fluid ounces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean gas or electric <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s shouldn’t be used at home. For larger properties, gas provides the most power —these <strong>trimmer</strong>s do generally require more upkeep and are heavier to carry around, Bateman advised. And electric <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s, which tend to be the most affordable of the three, are more suitable for small yards since a cord can only go so far, he added. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s require pre-cut lengths of line. Others use either one or two long lengths of line that wind onto a spool. You may need to remove the spool from the housing or load it in place. Refer to the owner’s manual or manufacturer’s website for detailed instructions for your specific <strong>trimmer</strong> brand and model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the greatest benefits of this <strong>trimmer</strong> is that it’s compatible with Ryobi’s line of “Expand-It” products. By purchasing extra attachments, you can easily convert this one tool into many others, including an edger, blower, and tiller. If you need more than just a <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> to tidy up your lawn, you’ll save money and storage space with this Ryobi tool. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Which edger can I attach to it? The TrimmerPlus TPE720 is the recommended edger for this <strong>trimmer</strong>. So when should you can the oil in it? Should it be every four times you use it? I would probably drain and refill the oil for homeowner use after using it one or two weekends. After that, an oil change each spring should be plenty. If you are running it for more than an hour or two each weekend, you might want to change the oil more frequently. Does this accept older Craftsman brand attachments? This unit will accept older Craftsman attachments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You are able to customize the weed eater using the Power Command Dial. The Black and Decker LST136 40V Max String Trimmer features a power drive transmission which delivers a higher level of power from the weed eater’s motor. The result is a <strong>trimmer</strong> that allows you to work faster and finish sooner. There are many ways to kill weeds and keep your garden in tip top condition, but weed eaters are certainly the easiest, most convenient and most effective. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Easy Winding High Capacity Bump Head carries 20 feet of line. A big, multi-position, the adjustable handle gives you more control and makes it easier to use right- or left-handed. Convert the WS405 WEEDWACKER <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> into other lawn care tools with separately sold attachments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Amazon reviewers agree that this is a lightweight mower suitable for small, simple jobs. One reviewer, in particular, noted that this WORX <strong>trimmer</strong> was great for those that want to worry less with the mechanics of their tools, citing the ease of the command feed system to distribute the line. Reviewers did have varying responses to the battery life of this <strong>trimmer</strong>. Some said that they could trim for up to 30 minutes on one charged battery, whereas others said they could trim for only 15. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wind the <strong>string</strong> in the opposite direction of its rotation. In most cases, you’ll want to wind the <strong>string</strong> counterclockwise. Many <strong>trimmer</strong> manufacturers imprint an arrow on the spool to show the proper direction to wind the <strong>string</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>string</strong> in your weed <strong>trimmer</strong> head can have a big impact on weekly yard work. Using the wrong <strong>string</strong> causes constant breaks or sticks inside the spool housing, forcing you to stop and reload frequently. But, the right pick provides ease of use and clean cutting, every time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Starting the Husqvarna 324L is extremely easy. You do not have to keep pulling the cord to flood the engine anymore. All you need is a single pull and the engine will start by itself. The Husqvarna 324L weighs just about 11 pounds; while it might be lightweight, the <strong>trimmer</strong> provides a lot of power while maintaining maneuverability as well. Even though 4-stroke engine weed <strong>trimmer</strong>s are considered heavy, the Husqvarna 324L is quite light. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>trimmer</strong> is equipped with a 2-cycle, 21.2cc engine; while it might not be the largest engine around, it is more than enough to do what you need it to do. The smaller engine also contributes to making this model quite lightweight. Due to the small engine, starting the Echo GT-225 is very easy and will not exert you in any way; as long as you have oil and gas, you can expect the <strong>trimmer</strong> to start easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Simply put, a <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> operates “with a shaft and <strong>string</strong> line that uses a circular motion to cut grass or weeds,” explained McCoy. The shaft can be either curved or straight. Straight shafts typically offer more customization: You can choose add-ons to switch out of the <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> head, McCoy said. Some of these attachments are specially designed for edges, others for trees. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Powered by a 25 cc 4-cycle engine, this Husqvarna <strong>trimmer</strong> model is designed to deliver precise cuts and improved accessibility. The straight shaft configuration provides better reach under the bushes and hard-to-reach corners. The weed eater pretty easy to use, thanks to the smart start technology, minimizing starter cord resistance by 40%. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Considering its status as high-powered equipment, the <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> presents a risk of harming its users. This rotating tool can be used to mow down grass or weeds, and it also has the capability of throwing debris such as rocks. Most <strong>trimmer</strong>s today include safety measures that make them less likely to cause injuries to the user or others. These precautions include: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The straight shaft <strong>trimmer</strong> or weedeater design is more functional. First of all, the straight shaft will be longer, which extends the reach. Taller people will quickly appreciate this. Also, a straight driveline generates less vibration, and because of a lower gear reduction, straight shaft <strong>trimmer</strong>s generate more torque. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It appears that it is a good choice if you don’t use it to cut down a bamboo forest. If you want a reliable, sturdy machine with a sling and double handles, this would be a good option for the price. COOCHEER weed eater powers through thick grass and dense undergrowth. The offset U-handle feature provides unprecedented operational control and user comfort while operating this <strong>trimmer</strong>/grass cutter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The downside to the Honda HHT35SLTAT is that it quickly goes through gas, which is not surprising considering the engine size, but it would often run out when we were far from a refill source. The <strong>trimmer</strong> is difficult to get off the tool, and refilling it is tedious, and it’s difficult to get the head back on when you are finished. At 17 pounds, it can get quite heavy after a short time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The weight of a <strong>trimmer</strong> is another thing that you should consider while buying a weed eater for commercial purposes. As you know, clearing your larger fields will take time and therefore, it should not be heavy if you want to complete the work without getting tired. The weed eater’s weight can be determined by the elements it comprises. That’s why you should not go with <strong>trimmer</strong>s that come with various parts. Power - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cordless <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s have the advantage of not needing an extension chord, but their higher price and lengthy charging time might be off-putting. The advantages of battery-powered <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s are also present in electric models, but with the added benefits of a lower price and an infinitely long run time. However, their power range is often limited, and you’ll need to lug an extension cord across your yard to get the job done. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, it can be quite a pricey purchase if you don&rsquo;t already have the Power Head and this <strong>trimmer</strong> can feel like it has too much power for average yards. The guard didn&rsquo;t prevent freshly-cut weeds from getting flung back at us, and precision work can be quite difficult. It&rsquo;s hard to avoid cutting trenches, and the Ego Power+ STA1500 can be brutal on things like birdbaths, outdoor lights, or the side of your house if you aren&rsquo;t careful when using it. It&rsquo;s not for everyone, but it&rsquo;s a great option if you need heavy-duty <strong>string</strong> trimming capabilities and plan to get other Ego cordless tools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Performance dropped a bit with the remaining <strong>trimmer</strong>s. The Snapper XD 82V clocked in at 48 minutes of runtime and has two operating modes, but we didn&rsquo;t notice a huge difference between the two modes except for the amount of noise produced. The low power mode still seems plenty powerful to chew through pretty much anything with the line we used. However, the difference between the two modes might be more noticeable with a different line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> weighs 10.3 lbs without the gas and has a good balance. This will make it easy to use for long periods of trimming without feeling tired. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>String <strong>trimmer</strong> shafts differ in both form and function. In both curved and straight shaft gas <strong>trimmer</strong>s, a motor connects to a cutting head by way of a shaft. The shaft on both models is going to be where the handle and the throttle are mounted. Within the metal shaft, a drive cable runs the length of the shaft, spun by the engine, and turns the cutting head at the other end of the <strong>trimmer</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> is designed for homeowners on large lots that require extensive yard maintenance. The power behind a gas <strong>trimmer</strong> is hard to match from any other power source, and useful when cutting through less groomed areas of your yard. If you don’t mind dealing with an engine and the maintenance it occasionally requires, this weed eater could be a good fit for your trimming and edging needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While electric <strong>trimmer</strong>s don’t require nearly as much maintenance as their gas counterparts, there are things you can do on a regular basis to keep them running well for an extended period. Kristi Howard, of Black & Decker Outdoor Products, says that a common problem with electric <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s involves people using the wrong gauge of extension cord to power them. Howard says you should be sure to use an extension cord that is heavy enough to carry the current your product will draw. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> has a shock-absorption design, adding improved use-comfort.

Gas-powered engines in weed eaters are either 2-stroke or 4-stroke. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Ryobi RY253SS is the best gas <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> for the money.

When it comes to power, gas is unrivaled, and refueling takes only minutes. However, they are noisy, not maintenance-free, require a mixture of oil and gas, and emit harmful gases.

Many of the more modern <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s will have an easy-load spool to let you load <strong>string</strong> through two holes without having to remove the spool at all — the spool winds up the <strong>string</strong> to work, Bateman noted.

Pro-grade models tend to include more features, further affecting the price point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The shaft is a straight line one that is suitable if you’re tall so you don’t need to bend while trimming.

That’s the reason you should go with weed eaters that come with S-start or sequential start. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While choosing a commercial weed eater, you should also take into consideration the cutting path. It is important if you need a tool that will assist you in clearing grass on a lawn effectively. Plus, it takes lesser time to accomplish the task.

However, some reviewers noticed a performance decrease during the trimming of thick grass and weeds, and others felt the weed eater was heavy and awkward, despite the curved design. In one particular review, a customer detailed beneficial steps when mixing your gas and oil, noting that non-ethanol gasoline is the best to use, and explaining the importance of mixing according to the manufacturer’s instructions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>String <strong>trimmer</strong>s can be gas or electric. If you’re going with gas, you’ll enjoy a more powerful <strong>trimmer</strong> that lasts through your work. Electric weed eaters emit fewer fumes and are therefore less of a health risk and more environmentally friendly. The drawback is that you sometimes lose power or endurance when going electric. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>That depends on your specific needs. Trimmers with curved shafts are usually shorter, lighter, and cheaper. Straight shafts are longer, so they can reach a wider radius, and these <strong>trimmer</strong>s typically produce more torque.

While other models pack a lot more power, they do not have the combination of being lightweight and powerful at the same time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The handle of electric <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s might be fixed.

It is economical, durable, and easy to reload. A round <strong>string</strong> is best for lawns with mostly grass and just a few weeds.

Bateman also said this <strong>trimmer</strong> could work well for those with larger properties. “This gas-powered <strong>trimmer</strong> is exceptionally easy to start, has a ton of power for cutting through tall weeds and has reduced vibration which is great for longer use,” Bateman explained.

String <strong>trimmer</strong>s with 4-stroke engines are typically quieter and have better fuel efficiency than 2-stroke weed eaters. These benefits are what makes 4-cycle <strong>trimmer</strong>s cost more. However, these also require more maintenance, since these tools need regular oil changes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re anything like me, at some point you might have wondered about the difference between straight shaft vs curved shaft <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s or weedeaters. Most folks might tend to think that one <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> design was the same as any other.

For the average yard, Bateman agreed that battery-powered <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> would be best, especially since he has seen battery life improve significantly in recent years. The kinds of weeds in your front or back yard also can help you decide whether you need an electric, gas or battery-powered <strong>trimmer</strong>. With thick weeds or overgrown lawns, an electric or battery powered <strong>trimmer</strong> could struggle more than one that uses gas, Bateman said. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, what seals the deal for us is the “tap and go” line release, streamlining weed removal from the get-go.

Lastly, the high-visibility cutting shield ensures clear viewing while protecting the operator from flying rocks and debris when whacking weeds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The tap and go <strong>trimmer</strong> head allow quick line feed for the twin line cutting system. Replacing the line will no longer eat up precious daylight and will give you more time to get your lawns and landscaping looking clean. All Badger Gas units come with a 6-year Home Owners and a 3-year Commercial Manufacturer’s limited warranty! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Craftsman CMXGTAMD30SA Straight Shaft String Trimmer is the last model on our list to review for you, and this one features a large 30cc, 4-cycle engine that provides the user with a 17-inch cutting width. The shaft is straight, so it’s easier to use in some situations, especially when using attachments. It has a two-step starting mechanism where you push a priming bulb before pulling the <strong>string</strong> for easy starting. A multi-position handle helps make holding it more comfortable, and it also helps to reduce vibrations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are looking for a reliable way to weed your lawn or garden with a weed wacker, look no further than the Cyclone Desert <strong>trimmer</strong> <strong>string</strong>. This .095-inch, multi-sided weed wacker <strong>string</strong> is made with a durable copolymer, offering abrasion resistance while cutting brush, weeds, and grass. Alternatively, the Maxpower <strong>trimmer</strong> line comes with an ample 855 feet of .095-inch line made with nylon monofilament for heavy-duty weeding and lawn maintenance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So, let’s take a look at 15 gas-powered line <strong>trimmer</strong>s from 15 different manufacturers and see how they stack up – to each other and to weed-eating. We will look at weights, balance, power, starters, and the most frustrating part of using a <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>, changing cutting lines. We will look at how easy it is to start them and how difficult it is to restart them once they’re running hot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you value ease of use, electric <strong>trimmer</strong>s are a smart choice. As long as you have a cord and access to an outlet, you have unlimited runtime with a <strong>trimmer</strong> that is simple to start, quiet while running, and requires little maintenance. The downside to many electric <strong>trimmer</strong>s is that they aren’t very portable, and can only go as far as the cord will allow. These weed eaters are a great choice for small yards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In terms of weight, it’s about average for a corded weed eater, coming in at 6.5 pounds. Thankfully, this corded <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> has a D-ring handle, which makes precision work straightforward. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>trimmer</strong> is quite durable and has a very robust construction.

You will be able to get the <strong>trimmer</strong> into tight spaces without straining yourself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With a gas <strong>trimmer</strong>, you’re probably going to be doing some maintenance at the beginning and end of the season. It’s just what you have to do with an engine. With a cordless <strong>trimmer</strong>, though, you don’t have that maintenance. Kenneth Deemer, Local Roots Landscaping - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In recent years, it’s added gas <strong>trimmer</strong>s, cultivators, blowers, and three new chainsaw platforms to the Remington® line of equipment. Their power tools are built to take on any yard task. And just like the first products sold almost a century ago, each tool built today is designed to be efficient, durable, and deliver more than enough power for the job at hand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://www.mowermagic.co.uk/acatalog/hitachi_781301_brush-cutter-trimmer-heads_73715_p1.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Best Gas String Trimmer 2020 - 15 Best Gas Operated Weed Eaters For Ease Of Use">
