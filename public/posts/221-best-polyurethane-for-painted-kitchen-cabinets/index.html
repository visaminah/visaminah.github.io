Satin falls right between semi-gloss and eggshell finish. Benjamin Moore makes a broader range of products, including high-gloss for that candy-coated finish on your cabinets. And they also make a matte finish for a more durable paint specific for wood cabinets. - Source: Internet My favorite brushes for cabinets are Zibra brushes. They not only give you a flawless finish but the brushes just glide over the surface of whatever you are painting. They are a little more expensive but I’ve never lost a bristle with these and they are fun to use: Zibra Brushes for Cabinets - Source: Internet If you’ve completed any DIY painting projects, you probably already know that most of the important work happens before you ever open a can of paint. First, empty your cabinets and remove all hardware including hinges and pulls. Scrub all surfaces thoroughly, and use a good degreasing agent to ensure all surfaces are squeaky clean. - Source: Internet Painting your own cabinets is such a budget-friendly way to make a huge upgrade in the room of your house that is most important for resale. I was quoted a cost of over $3,000 to hire painters for my kitchen cabinets, but by doing it myself, I paid just $492. See exactly how much it costs to paint your cabinets vs hiring a pro here: How Much Does It Cost To Paint Kitchen Cabinets - Source: Internet If you use a paint sprayer, you’ll need to dilute the paint with some water and cover everything you don’t want the paint to get on (which is everything but the cabinets!). Using a sprayer will give you a smooth finish and no visible brush strokes. Plus, it will take less time for the actual paint job — but the prep time is usually longer since you want to make sure you’ve covered everything but the cabinets in plastic to protect them from unwanted painting. - Source: Internet There is not a huge difference in the requirements for cabinet paint and trim paint. With trim paint, you will be painting fewer flat surfaces which means more painting with a brush than a roller. So you want a durable paint that can handle high-traffic areas without brush strokes and comes in a semi-gloss finish. Based on my testing, Benjamin Moore Advance is the best paint for cabinets and trim. - Source: Internet Oil-based polyurethanes were always the more durable choice but now they have a lot of competition as water-based formulas have improved. Oil-based products have a strong odor and can take longer to dry. However, the longer drying time can mean fewer brush strokes. - Source: Internet Again, pick whatever sheen makes you happiest. Just know that the more matte you go, the more it’ll show dirt and wear. The more high-gloss you go, the more difficulty you’ll have getting a smooth finish on your cabinets. - Source: Internet Polyurethane is an excellent way to protect your painted kitchen cabinets. It’s available in both oil-based and water-based formulas, so you can choose the one that best suits your needs. Be sure to apply several thin coats for the best protection. - Source: Internet This is a major advantage for lacquer on kitchen cabinets, as you do not have to wait for it to dry. If you use the lacquer at room temperature, then it should dry within 15 minutes. You can then sand it down and apply the second coat, which can be completed within an hour. Lacquer dries particularly quickly when compared to other clear coatings, which can take from 72 hours to seven days to dry properly. - Source: Internet The colour options for polyurethane are amazing. It is a painted finish so you can create almost any colour that you can dream of. This is especially beneficial if you need to colour match an existing fixture or fitting within the kitchen or home (which can be very handy with renovated kitchen projects) or are looking to create a truly unique, one-of-a-kind statement in your new kitchen. - Source: Internet There are different types of paints, each with its own properties that make it better or worse for kitchen cabinets. You touch your cabinet doors all the time, you spill food on them and it’s easy to accidentally bump up against them, so you want them to have a durable coating that won’t flake off easily. Here are the best types of paint for kitchen cabinets. - Source: Internet It is possible to use polyurethane over paint, but there are a few things to keep in mind. First, it is important to make sure that the paint is completely dry before applying the polyurethane. If the paint is not completely dry, it can cause the polyurethane to bubble and peel. - Source: Internet Painting your kitchen cabinets requires more than just choosing paint and slapping it on the cabinet doors with a paintbrush. You’ll want to prep and make sure you have the proper tools handy so you can do a stellar job. After all, you don’t want your cabinets to have sloppy, noticeable brush marks and an uneven surface. Here’s how you can give your cabinets a smooth finish that looks like professional painters did the dirty work. - Source: Internet The exposed edges on melamine and laminate finished cabinets are probably one of their biggest pitfalls in a kitchen. Over time, the edges can become exposed to heat from the workings of cooking and preparing meals. This can cause the edges to peel or become exposed, which not only looks unsightly but also leaves the base under the coating at risk of damage. - Source: Internet You’ll want to select a paint that is durable and can withstand some wear and tear. Once you’ve selected the perfect paint, it’s time to think about which sealer will work best for your project. Here are a few things to consider when choosing a sealer for your newly painted cabinets: - Source: Internet If you want a more rugged, vintage look for your cabinets, chalk paint is perfect for that too. If you want a piece of furniture – your kitchen cabinet, coffee tables, even your kitchen table, dining room table, or kitchen island – to have a chalky, gritty, rustic appearance, you can skip the waxing and let the paint give itself its own chalky appearance. This is also the reason why people tend to treat chalk paint as a decorative paint too. - Source: Internet Patience and prep work are vital to getting a professional-quality smooth finish on your kitchen cabinets, even when you use the best paint for cabinets. All DIY-paint projects involve a lot of prep work, just like the professionals do. The more thorough your prep, the easier the painting will be, and the better the finished product. Check out our ultimate guide to painting kitchen cabinets for all the tips and tricks from start to finish. - Source: Internet Let me first start by saying we paint a ton of kitchen cabinets. And when I say we, I mean the extremely skilled professional painting crew we have. They have been painting kitchen cabinets for years and have perfected the process. - Source: Internet Painting your kitchen cabinets can be a fun DIY painting project to do. Before getting to work, you’re going to need to decide on what kind of paint you want to use. There are a variety of paint options for you to choose from; picking the right one can get overwhelming and difficult. One of the types of paint that’s commonly recommended is chalk paint. - Source: Internet All of the above information about paints for kitchen cupboards also applies to bathroom cabinets. Since bathroom cabinets experience more moisture and condensation on a regular basis, I would always use a satin or even a semi-gloss sheen to better protect them. However, all of the cabinet paints I tested did really well when it came to holding up to moisture. - Source: Internet I’m happy with my blue kitchen because I will love it forever whether it is trendy or not. If I had focused on what was trendy instead of what I loved, I would be sitting here in 2019 with a neutral kitchen, jealous of everyone else’s blue kitchens. Of course, you can always repaint your cabinets. But why go to that trouble when you can be happy from the start? - Source: Internet Using lacquer will not give you the same durability as a polyurethane finish, but its impact resistance, flexibility, and sheen far exceed other clear coat finishes for your kitchen cupboards. It will provide you with a clear coat that is waterproof, chip-resistant, and breathable, with a sheen of various levels, from high gloss to matte. With daily wear and tear, its sheen may become dull, but with a little buffing and polishing, its luster can be restored. Before making a decision about the whether lacquer is best for your kitchen cabinets, let us guide you through some advantages and disadvantages of this type of coating. - Source: Internet Once your cabinets have their first coat of paint on, let it dry completely, then take a look at the paint job from different angles. When the paint dries, you may find spots where you accidentally painted against the wood grain and it sticks out in bright lighting. Or, if you used high-gloss or semi-gloss paint, you might find a spot that doesn’t look as glossy. Once you’ve taken a look and made note of spots that need a little extra help, then move forward with your second coat and pay special attention to the places to fix. - Source: Internet This is one of the best white paints for kitchen cabinets, especially north-facing ones. The incoming cool gray and blue light neutralizes the warmth of the off-white on the cabinets to create a sense of harmony and balance indoors. In the south-facing rooms, the warm white cabinet color may come out a little yellow! So, don’t forget to try a sample in various directions to know the true hue. - Source: Internet You never want to refinish cabinets without sanding. Remember, you are not sanding to remove the old paint or stain. You are simply scuff sanding which means that you are sanding the surface of the cabinets just enough, so they aren’t slick. This helps the new primer and paint adhere well and it’s a step you never want to skip! TO make it go faster, here is my favorite electric sander: Tack life Electric Sander (click here for the current price). - Source: Internet Sherwin Williams Greek Villa is slightly more warm and creamy than SW Alabaster. So, if you prefer a white kitchen cabinet color that feels creamy and slightly lighter beige, Sherwin Williams Greek Villa cabinets are something to have an eye on!

Allow ample natural light to enter this kitchen to make it further appear light, soft, airy, and creamy. - Source: Internet As you can see in the video, this paint also levels out well on open wood grains and has outstanding coverage even on dark cabinets.

Both melamine and laminate finishes are adhered to a backing, not painted on like polyurethane.

Many primers can be used with both oil-based and latex paints. After priming, be sure to lightly sand your cabinets once again with 220-grit sandpaper and wipe them clean. - Source: Internet Oil-based paint is the go-big-or-go-home of interior paints.

Lacquer paint will give the smoothest, most durable finish to your kitchen cabinets. The only downside to using it is the drying time.

You also want to make sure you sand corners, edges and any crevices really well, as that’s where chipping is most likely to occur if not prepared properly.’ - Source: Internet Water-based polyurethane is a type of clear coat that is typically used on painted surfaces.

One of the pros of chalk paint is that it can be used to paint virtually anything. That being said, if your kitchen cabinets are made of raw wood, it would still be best to sand before painting. Although the chalk paint on wood furniture may adhere well, smoothening it first will be much easier for you to do than smoothening it later; a light sanding should suffice. - Source: Internet Dark paint colors are especially susceptible to showing smudges and dust so I use a clear coat on those to provide protection.

But don’t get too excited and start using them just yet — you’ll want to let them dry for at least 24 hours or longer.

Once you’ve waited for at least a day, then you can start using your cabinets again! - Source: Internet Before beginning, make sure your cabinets are clean and free of dust.

I like to drill holes for new hardware before sanding and priming so if I make a mistake, I can easily stop and fill the hole at that point. New hardware can easily update the look of cabinets without a lot of extra work or cost. - Source: Internet As mentioned previously, cabinets need to have durable paint to keep them looking nice for a long time. The paints you use for crafting, like acrylic paints, chalk paint and even milk paint will be different from the paint that you put on wood cabinets.

You’ll need to brush on multiple coats of paint, especially if the material of your kitchen cabinets are darker and the paint that you intend to use is lighter.

This type of finish is great for your kitchen cupboards, although we do suggest that you give your cabinets a good stain before you apply the clear coat. This is due to its high clarity finish, which could leave your cabinets with a rather plain look otherwise. So, applying a light stain first will ensure the best possible finish, which should last for a long time. - Source: Internet Experts advise using a random orbital sander to get better and faster results, although tricky parts like cabinet door edges should be hand sanded. If the cabinets haven’t been painted or stained before, start with a medium grit sandpaper before using a finer one. If there is excessive paint or a considerable rough surface, consider stripping. - Source: Internet Also, remember that the texture must be suited for the purpose. For example, a high-gloss finish is not acceptable on the floor, as it will make it very slippery. Your kitchen cabinets will look amazing in a semi-gloss finish, as it will fit into the aesthetic of your kitchen. - Source: Internet Oil-based paint was historically known as the best paint for kitchen cabinets for multiple reasons. It has a durable finish and results in a smooth finish, which is what the goal is in a place like a kitchen. However, it isn’t as common anymore because it’s not good for the environment and dangerous to use. Use toxic mineral spirits to thin the paint, which you’ll be exposed to during the painting process, and disposing of things containing oil is difficult and wreaks havoc on the climate. - Source: Internet Sherwin Williams is among the most well-known and accessible paint brands around.

Essentially, this is transparent paint that protects the wood cabinets from UV rays and damage, helping to make the original finish last much longer. It’s similar to the stuff they use on cars to help them keep their color in the UV rays of the sun. - Source: Internet The key here is using thin coats of paint. This will limit the number of drips, pooling, and any other blemishes that can happen when painting.

The next step is the final coat of paint, so it’s crucial you make sure they are perfect for that glass-like smooth finish on your cabinets. - Source: Internet One of the differences between regular paint versus chalk paint is that there’s no need to apply a primer before painting. This means that you can grab your brush, your paint, and start redesigning your kitchen cabinets. Latex, another common type of paint for instance, will still need a well cleaned surface, then primer before you can finally get started doing the paint job that you want. - Source: Internet A cool white paint color would be a blunder in a kitchen with ample warm wood on the shelves, lighting fixtures, and exposed beams. So, if you have a warm color palette running around the house, it’s ideal to pick a neutral or warmer color for the kitchen cabinets as well. On the other hand, a cooler-toned palette like coastal would embrace the use of cooler whites on the cabinets. Cohesiveness is the ultimate key to a well-balanced home!

The primer acts as a bonder, gripping both the cabinets and the paint. A good primer is key to achieving both a smooth and durable finish. Primer also helps to block existing color, necessitating fewer coats of paint. - Source: Internet If you’re not careful, matte finishes can look really dull and boring. If you just painted all your kitchen cabinets doors with two coats of matte paint in the same color, it could look really drab and lifeless. The key to mattes is playing around with different colors and styles to find the right balance. - Source: Internet Make sure that before you do anything in your apartment, you get permission from your landlord. Your lease should specify what modifications you can or can’t make to your apartment, so read through that to start off.

Choosing the right primer is essential in high-traffic areas like kitchens. We recommend a product like Sherwin-Williams Extreme Bond Primer that offers a higher degree of adhesion than a standard primer. - Source: Internet Choosing the perfect color is no mean feat with so many different options around. Look at your current countertop, fixture and flooring for color cues that might inspire your cabinet refresh.

Simply clean your cabinets with a soft cloth to get rid of any dirt that may accidentally get trapped beneath the paint prior to painting. Doing so will give you a smoother finish. If you want a more decorative finish, you may skip this step altogether, if you want to give the finished product a more rugged texture. - Source: Internet Polyurethane is a type of clear finish that is typically used to protect painted surfaces.

With the tips included in this article, you’re well on your way to a smooth, professional, paint job! - Source: Internet The best roller to use when painting kitchen cabinets is a mini foam roller. The foam roller is dense which provides a smoother finish. If you were to use a regular napped roller, you’d get a textured finish. I prefer using this type of roller. - Source: Internet When it comes to a smooth finish, I’m such a stickler! Unfortunately, one of the downsides to painting honey oak kitchen cabinets is that they have a very open grain. In other words, you can see lots of small indentions on the entire wood surface. To specifically test which paint finishes would settle into the wood grain to make smooth surfaces, I painted a sample of each on the back of one of my own cabinet doors. - Source: Internet For DIYers, I personally recommend brushing or rolling your cabinets. There is definitely a learning curve with a paint sprayer and while it can be easy to use at first, it can be hard to troubleshoot problems unless you have some experience. Not only does it take time to learn to use a paint sprayer, prepping the space to spray the cabinet boxes can be daunting. If you are going to use a paint sprayer, I recommend just spraying the cabinet doors and drawer fronts and rolling the boxes. Here is an easy-to-use spray for spray painting cabinet doors: HomeRight Max Paint Sprayer - Source: Internet Yes, you can paint over already painted cabinets however it may require some additional work. If your cabinets are chipping and the paint is peeling, you will have to scrape the chipping paint off the cabinets. Then you have to sand them smooth. You may need to add wood filler of Bondo to make them smooth again. - Source: Internet Whether you’re going for lasting durability, an appealing aesthetic, or somewhere between the two, your painted kitchen cabinet can dramatically affect the design of a kitchen and how big the space feels. And because it makes such a crucial difference, you want the best paint finish for kitchen cabinets. You can also learn how to paint your kitchen cabinet hardware yourself to save money! - Source: Internet Gloss paint finish kitchen cabinets are ideal for single people or couples who don’t have messy pets and children to worry about. If you want your kitchen to look bright, spacious, and impressive, then gloss can be a brilliant choice. However, if you have wood veneer and cleaning and maintenance are an issue for you, trying something with a much flatter finish to be on the safe side. And some homeowners make their decision based on the contrast of the cabinets with their kitchen cookware; considering if the gloss finish will pair well with their best nonstick pans since they are out all the time. - Source: Internet Water-based polyurethane dries quickly and has little odor, but it isn’t as tough as oil-based polyurethane. Whichever type you choose, make sure to apply several thin coats rather than one thick coat. This will help prevent bubbles or craters from forming in the finish. - Source: Internet It’s easy to apply and can be touch-up if necessary. The downside of polyurethane is that it takes longer to cure, so you’ll need to be patient while waiting for it to dry completely. It’s also not as heat resistant as lacquer, so keep that in mind if your kitchen gets a lot of sun exposure. - Source: Internet Right in between oil-based and latex paints are hybrid enamels. These hybrid paints combine the best of both worlds — the durable finish of oil-based paint and the environmental-friendliness and easy cleaning properties of water-based paint. Hybrid enamel is a water-based acrylic alkyd, so it looks and behaves like an oil-based paint (which is what alkyd paint does, just without the oil), while not yellowing over time (an acrylic paint property). This is arguably the best type of paint for kitchen cabinets. - Source: Internet After you have filled in any indentations, you’re going to want to sand everything down nice and smooth. Use a 100-150 grit sandpaper for this step. This has a two-fold purpose. You will be working to smooth out the wood filler along with any other raised imperfections on your cabinets. - Source: Internet So you’re giving your kitchen an upgrade, and you want to paint your kitchen cabinets. If you’ve ever painted cabinets of any sort, you know that it can be difficult to get a smooth finish. We’ve done some of the prep work for you, and researched this question thoroughly. Here are some tried and true tips to help you get that smooth finish you’re looking for. - Source: Internet Lacquer is supplied in a matte finish, which gives you a dull finish and is not all that popular. Then there is a medium finish, which brings out the grain and natural hue of the wood and is used by most people resurfacing their kitchen cabinets. Lastly, there is a high gloss finish, which gives you a reflective surface, but it also shows dust more easily. - Source: Internet One of the easiest ways to get a smooth finish on your kitchen cabinets is to use flood coating with your primer. Always sand in between coats of paint. It helps the new layer of paint bond with the previous layer and the primer to make a more even coat. - Source: Internet SW Pure White is classic, versatile, and can work for one and all kinds of palettes. It’s definitely one of my favorites since it’s clean and crisp enough to appear like a cool white but with a touch of warmth – this color can pair with warmer colors as well. You must pair this white kitchen cabinet paint with taupe, beige, tan, blue, gray, and green on the lower cabinets. In terms of hardware, feel free to choose from nickel, matte black, satin brass, polished chrome, and oil-rubbed bronze. - Source: Internet But don’t worry! This piece of blog is dedicated to my TOP picks of WHITE paint colors for kitchen cabinets from Benjamin Moore and Sherwin Williams. When diving further down the line, whites can be subcategorized into warm whites, neutral whites, and cool whites. Depending upon your interior design style, the existing architectural elements, the finish of hardware, and the compass direction – the best white paint for kitchen cabinets can be chosen. So, before I reveal those majestic white paint colors, first let’s have a look at the bigger picture! - Source: Internet Benjamin Moore is a premium paint brand and is a major competitor to Sherwin Williams, so you shouldn’t be surprised to learn they have some of the best products around. Their Advance line is particularly great for painting kitchen cabinets. Here are some of the reasons why: - Source: Internet If you’re considering painting your kitchen cabinets, you may be wondering if polyurethane is the right choice for protecting your paint job. Polyurethane is a clear coating that dries to a hard, durable finish. It’s often used on wood floors and other surfaces that see a lot of wear and tear. - Source: Internet Painting your own cabinets is worthwhile but it is still a lot of work. Don’t leave the finished product up to chance by using just any old paint. Cabinet paints are not created equal and as you’ll see from my testing, the most expensive paints are not necessarily the best! - Source: Internet Really, this is the most important part of the entire project. A coat of paint will only be as good as the prep work. In properly preparing the cabinets, you are laying the foundation for a good coat of paint. So what does this involve? - Source: Internet Plus, it takes just soap and water to clean up. If you have leftover paint, just let it dry out and throw it right into the garbage–no annoying trips to the hazardous waste disposal sites. And you can pick your method to paint kitchen cabinets. A paint sprayer will give you the easiest, even coat. But with hybrid enamel paint, your wood cabinets will look great if you opt to brush or roll the paint. - Source: Internet EDITED TO UPDATE: Since writing this post, we’ve decided to give our entire home a bit of an overhaul. Which includes finally replacing these 40-year-old cabinets. Having them painted and updating them worked well for 14 years though! I still think this is a great way to update cabinets and if ours weren’t so old, we probably would not have replaced them. It was just time. :) - Source: Internet If your kitchen cabinets have been painted with gloss latex or acrylic enamel high-sheen paints, then you have paint that is stain resistant and durable, and it may then be not necessary for you to give any added clear coats over the paint. These paints are expensive and need a careful application, so the chances are that you have used other paints that are less superior. This is where you will benefit when you cover these paints with a clear coat like polyurethane. - Source: Internet Use a brush, applicator or lint-free cloth to apply the polyurethane. The polyurethane dries very quickly and any defects can be difficult to touch up. Ensure the kitchen is well lit up so that it allows you to spot any defects in your application. Apply a second coat if you feel there is a need for it, but in general, a well-painted kitchen cabinet will do well with just one clear coat. - Source: Internet Cabinets can honestly make or break your kitchen décor. If they’re a nice color and are well-painted, they can make your kitchen look incredible. On the other hand, if they look rough, then your entire kitchen can take on the same vibe. A simple and affordable solution to making any kitchen cupboards look better is by painting them — even the most outdated cabinets can give off a whole new ambiance with a fresh coat of paint! - Source: Internet Painting your kitchen cabinets is an amazing alternative to investing in new ones. It’s a fantastic budget-friendly way to update your kitchen without the inconvenience of an expensive full-scale kitchen renovation. Kitchen cabinet painting is the best way to get a new look without the hassle. - Source: Internet If you’re planning to paint your cabinets, one of the best ways to protect them is by applying a polyurethane topcoat. Polyurethane not only provides extra protection from scratches and wear, but it also gives painted cabinets a beautiful, glossy finish. Here’s everything you need to know about using polyurethane on painted cabinets. - Source: Internet Today I want to share the steps on how to paint kitchens cabinets and get a smooth finish like the pros. Along with a few tips and tricks to make the process as smooth as possible. Also, I’ll answer a few of the most asked questions regarding painting kitchen cabinets. - Source: Internet Sherwin Williams Extra White is a bright, crisp, and cool white paint for kitchen cabinets. This is one of the best white colors for cabinets if you’re aiming to achieve a cooler color palette in your home. However, you must be slightly careful when pairing this cool white cabinet color since it has the potential to appear slightly blue and gray in the north-facing rooms. On the other hand, in the south-facing rooms, this paint can counteract with the yellow light to appear slightly softer. - Source: Internet In this article, we’re going to take a look at the 3 most common finishes when painting a kitchen cabinet – gloss, matte, and satin. You can also learn more about how to paint laminate cabinets. We will also compare satin vs semi gloss cabinets, as well as matte finish and which suits your kitchen cabinets the best. This Kitchen Infinity blog will compare their pros and cons, giving you a feel for the best finish for your kitchen cabinets. We also have a useful guide for those learning how to paint kitchen cabinets without sanding. - Source: Internet A lacquer finish on your kitchen cabinets will outlast any of the other coatings like polyurethane, stains, varnish, or shellac. It may not be as durable as the other coatings, but will last longer without flaking or yellowing. It also seals your wooden surface by penetrating deep into the wood fibers, which is better than that of a topcoat. You will need just two layers, which can last for up to 10 years. - Source: Internet Second, you need to use a high-quality polyurethane specifically designed for use on cabinets. Some lower-quality products can yellow over time or leave a cloudy finish. Third, be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully when applying polyurethane. - Source: Internet Painting cabinets yourself is always cheaper than buying new cabinets or cabinet doors. As long as your cabinets are solid wood and in good condition, painting them yourself will save you a lot of money.

I think it shows slightly less fingerprints and mess compared to glossy paint. However, both are totally fine options and glossy looks great in ultra-modern spaces! If you don’t have kids or pets or cook much (or have a maid) – super glossy is great! - Source: Internet While chalk paint doesn’t need a primer, it may still need a protective wax top coat. Adding this layer of wax is essential to keeping it a durable paint for cabinets. You may need to purchase special brushes to paint with wax as it does have a different consistency than regular paint. Wax paint brushes tend to have softer bristles, which makes it easier to spread the wax around the surface of what you’re painting without leaving nasty brush marks. - Source: Internet There are a few different ways you can go about painting cabinets. They all may or may not be an option for you. It all depends on what painting tools you have available to you. - Source: Internet You can put polyurethane on painted cabinets, but there are a few things to keep in mind. First, you need to make sure that the paint is fully cured before applying any kind of topcoat. If it’s not, the polyurethane can react with the paint and cause it to bubble or peel. - Source: Internet Chalk painting is a fun alternative to conventional ways of painting, like spray-painting, brushing or rolling. While some prefer the more traditional route, others are more adventurous and would love to try out using chalk paint for their kitchen cabinets. Some think using chalk paint is beneficial because it’s quick drying, it requires minimal prep work, it’s water-based, it’s durable after waxing, and it can be sanded for a smooth finish. Quick Drying - Source: Internet So as I said shortly after I started this blog I decided to start changing things around in my home. One of the biggest changes was my chalk painted kitchen cabinets. At the time Annie Sloan chalk paint was the rage. I was reading other blog tutorials on how to paint kitchen cabinets without sanding or priming. I was all about the fastest way to paint my cabinets so I went for it. - Source: Internet There are two basic types of topcoats for furniture: water-based and oil-based. Traditionally, oil-based polyurethanes were the main clear coats used on furniture but now more water-based formulas are on the market. Here’s a little about the pros and cons of each: - Source: Internet In some cases, when using paint for your kitchen cupboards, there is a residue left behind. However, with a clear coat for cabinets, this will never happen. A paint coating tends not to cover rough edges, but a clear coat will have no problem, as it covers any rough edges perfectly. - Source: Internet Lastly, this is one of the most important aspects when picking the best white paint for the kitchen cabinet. Especially if you have the cabinets reaching up to the bottom of the ceiling, the color of the kitchen cabinet has a major say. Let’s say, if you have a warmer and creamy tone of white paint on the ceiling, the ultra and crisp white paint on the cabinet will contradict it and make that “unappealing” appearance. On the other hand, if you have crisp white paint on the ceiling, the white paint with the ‘yellow’ undertone on the cabinet will butt against it! So, in this case, what do you do? - Source: Internet As it’s prone to chipping, you’ll need to regularly reapply coats of paint over again after a few months. You’ll need to take into account whether or not you’re willing to give your kitchen cabinets some touch-ups over the year. If this doesn’t bother you, and you want to go for a rustic, chalky appearance with your furniture, then this may not be a disadvantage to you. Additionally, milk paint could be another alternative if you want to have a more distressed and chippy look. - Source: Internet If you want your kitchen cabinets done right, fill out the form below to get a free estimate.

Although it’s water-based, it is the most durable top coat that I have come across that won’t yellow. I have applied it on 5 high-use pieces of painted furniture and they all look as good as the first day I applied the clear coat. - Source: Internet No, not because we enjoy doing extra work, but this is for when we paint the cabinets. You don’t see behind the hinge which makes it the perfect place to put your piece of tape. As for the other piece of tape on top of the numbered ones, that protects the number from paint. - Source: Internet A picture is worth a thousand words. Looking at before and after pictures of painted kitchen cabinets can help you envision your cabinets painted. It may help you decide to give this process a try. - Source: Internet When applying Varathane’s Spar Urethane, make sure to keep a wet edge so it doesn’t dry up on you too fast. In other words, work in a smaller section at a time, and don’t go over the previous section with your brush once you are done. It doesn’t give you quite as much time as its interior polyurethane version. Be sure to apply it within temperatures of 65 – 85 degrees Fahrenheit. - Source: Internet Use a the best paint for cabinets, hybrid enamel paint, and check out our post on the best kitchen paint colors for this year.

Taking the time to repaint kitchen cabinets is a brilliant way to spruce up a lackluster kitchen and fall in love with your home’s heart. - Source: Internet While you could paint your kitchen cabinets without sanding, we don’t really recommend it. Sanding removes the top layer of paint and helps smooth out the surface, giving the fresh coat something to adhere to. You don’t have to paint bare wood, but it certainly doesn’t hurt. - Source: Internet ‘Durability is the most important characteristic of your chosen paint finish in the kitchen,’ says Helen Shaw, director at Benjamin Moore (opens in new tab). ‘Kitchen cabinets and islands work incredibly hard and are subject to the bumps and scrapes of a busy household, so it is important your chosen product is up to the job. Eggshell is one of the most popular finishes, offering low levels of sheen for a smart, contemporary finish. Satin finishes are durable enough to wipe away finger marks or stains; if you prefer a more reflective finish, opt for a semi-gloss or gloss paint.’ - Source: Internet Once your cabinets are prepped and ready to go, start by applying a thin layer of polyurethane with a brush or roller designed for smooth surfaces. Work in small sections and be sure to evenly cover all areas. Let the first coat dry completely before applying additional coats (usually 2-3 is sufficient). - Source: Internet Polyurethane kitchen cabinets are a type of cabinetry that is made from polyurethane, which is a synthetic material. Polyurethane kitchen cabinets are very durable and resistant to scratches, staining, and moisture. They are also easy to clean and maintain. - Source: Internet Chalk paint and matte finishes have their place on wood furniture. But for the daily wear and tear wood cabinets withstand, you need to protect them. Unless you enjoy repainting. - Source: Internet This step depends on the shape of your cabinets and if you are changing out your kitchen cabinet hardware or not. If you are and the new hardware you chose doesn’t line up with the old holes, now is the time to fill them.

Satin falls right between semi-gloss and eggshell finish. Benjamin Moore makes a broader range of products, including high-gloss for that candy-coated finish on your <strong>cabinets</strong>. And they also make a matte finish for a more durable paint specific for wood <strong>cabinets</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>My favorite brushes for <strong>cabinets</strong> are Zibra brushes. They not only give you a flawless finish but the brushes just glide over the surface of whatever you are painting. They are a little more expensive but I’ve never lost a bristle with these and they are fun to use: Zibra Brushes for Cabinets - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;ve completed any DIY painting projects, you probably already know that most of the important work happens before you ever open a can of paint. First, empty your <strong>cabinets</strong> and remove all hardware including hinges and pulls. Scrub all surfaces thoroughly, and use a good degreasing agent to ensure all surfaces are squeaky clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Painting your own <strong>cabinets</strong> is such a budget-friendly way to make a huge upgrade in the room of your house that is most important for resale. I was quoted a cost of over $3,000 to hire painters for my kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>, but by doing it myself, I paid just $492. See exactly how much it costs to paint your <strong>cabinets</strong> vs hiring a pro here: How Much Does It Cost To Paint Kitchen Cabinets - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you use a paint sprayer, you&rsquo;ll need to dilute the paint with some water and cover everything you don&rsquo;t want the paint to get on (which is everything but the <strong>cabinets</strong>!). Using a sprayer will give you a smooth finish and no visible brush strokes. Plus, it will take less time for the actual paint job — but the prep time is usually longer since you want to make sure you&rsquo;ve covered everything but the <strong>cabinets</strong> in plastic to protect them from unwanted painting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There is not a huge difference in the requirements for cabinet paint and trim paint. With trim paint, you will be painting fewer flat surfaces which means more painting with a brush than a roller. So you want a durable paint that can handle high-traffic areas without brush strokes and comes in a semi-gloss finish. Based on my testing, Benjamin Moore Advance is the best paint for <strong>cabinets</strong> and trim. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Oil-based <strong>polyurethane</strong>s were always the more durable choice but now they have a lot of competition as water-based formulas have improved. Oil-based products have a strong odor and can take longer to dry. However, the longer drying time can mean fewer brush strokes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Again, pick whatever sheen makes you happiest. Just know that the more matte you go, the more it’ll show dirt and wear. The more high-gloss you go, the more difficulty you’ll have getting a smooth finish on your <strong>cabinets</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Polyurethane is an excellent way to protect your painted kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. It’s available in both oil-based and water-based formulas, so you can choose the one that best suits your needs. Be sure to apply several thin coats for the best protection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a major advantage for lacquer on kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>, as you do not have to wait for it to dry. If you use the lacquer at room temperature, then it should dry within 15 minutes. You can then sand it down and apply the second coat, which can be completed within an hour. Lacquer dries particularly quickly when compared to other clear coatings, which can take from 72 hours to seven days to dry properly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The colour options for <strong>polyurethane</strong> are amazing. It is a painted finish so you can create almost any colour that you can dream of. This is especially beneficial if you need to colour match an existing fixture or fitting within the kitchen or home (which can be very handy with renovated kitchen projects) or are looking to create a truly unique, one-of-a-kind statement in your new kitchen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are different types of paints, each with its own properties that make it better or worse for kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. You touch your cabinet doors all the time, you spill food on them and it&rsquo;s easy to accidentally bump up against them, so you want them to have a durable coating that won&rsquo;t flake off easily. Here are the best types of paint for kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It is possible to use <strong>polyurethane</strong> over paint, but there are a few things to keep in mind. First, it is important to make sure that the paint is completely dry before applying the <strong>polyurethane</strong>.

One of the pros of chalk paint is that it can be used to paint virtually anything. That being said, if your kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> are made of raw wood, it would still be best to sand before painting. Although the chalk paint on wood furniture may adhere well, smoothening it first will be much easier for you to do than smoothening it later; a light sanding should suffice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dark paint colors are especially susceptible to showing smudges and dust so I use a clear coat on those to provide protection.

Once you&rsquo;ve waited for at least a day, then you can start using your <strong>cabinets</strong> again! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before beginning, make sure your <strong>cabinets</strong> are clean and free of dust.

However, it isn&rsquo;t as common anymore because it&rsquo;s not good for the environment and dangerous to use.

On the other hand, a cooler-toned palette like coastal would embrace the use of cooler whites on the <strong>cabinets</strong>. Cohesiveness is the ultimate key to a well-balanced home! So, now that we’ve discussed some important aspects of choosing white paint colors for <strong>cabinets</strong>, let’s have a look at the best specific examples from the manufacturers, Sherwin Williams and Benjamin Moore.

And some homeowners make their decision based on the contrast of the <strong>cabinets</strong> with their kitchen cookware; considering if the gloss finish will pair well with their best nonstick pans since they are out all the time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Water-based <strong>polyurethane</strong> dries quickly and has little odor, but it isn’t as tough as oil-based <strong>polyurethane</strong>. Whichever type you choose, make sure to apply several thin coats rather than one thick coat. This will help prevent bubbles or craters from forming in the finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s easy to apply and can be touch-up if necessary. The downside of <strong>polyurethane</strong> is that it takes longer to cure, so you’ll need to be patient while waiting for it to dry completely. It’s also not as heat resistant as lacquer, so keep that in mind if your kitchen gets a lot of sun exposure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Right in between oil-based and latex paints are hybrid enamels. These hybrid paints combine the best of both worlds — the durable finish of oil-based paint and the environmental-friendliness and easy cleaning properties of water-based paint. Hybrid enamel is a water-based acrylic alkyd, so it looks and behaves like an oil-based paint (which is what alkyd paint does, just without the oil), while not yellowing over time (an acrylic paint property). This is arguably the best type of paint for kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After you have filled in any indentations, you&rsquo;re going to want to sand everything down nice and smooth. Use a 100-150 grit sandpaper for this step. This has a two-fold purpose. You will be working to smooth out the wood filler along with any other raised imperfections on your <strong>cabinets</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So you&rsquo;re giving your kitchen an upgrade, and you want to paint your kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. If you&rsquo;ve ever painted <strong>cabinets</strong> of any sort, you know that it can be difficult to get a smooth finish. We&rsquo;ve done some of the prep work for you, and researched this question thoroughly. Here are some tried and true tips to help you get that smooth finish you&rsquo;re looking for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Lacquer is supplied in a matte finish, which gives you a dull finish and is not all that popular. Then there is a medium finish, which brings out the grain and natural hue of the wood and is used by most people resurfacing their kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. Lastly, there is a high gloss finish, which gives you a reflective surface, but it also shows dust more easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the easiest ways to get a smooth finish on your kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> is to use flood coating with your primer. Always sand in between coats of paint. It helps the new layer of paint bond with the previous layer and the primer to make a more even coat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>SW Pure White is classic, versatile, and can work for one and all kinds of palettes. It’s definitely one of my favorites since it’s clean and crisp enough to appear like a cool white but with a touch of warmth – this color can pair with warmer colors as well. You must pair this white kitchen cabinet paint with taupe, beige, tan, blue, gray, and green on the lower <strong>cabinets</strong>. In terms of hardware, feel free to choose from nickel, matte black, satin brass, polished chrome, and oil-rubbed bronze. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But don’t worry! This piece of blog is dedicated to my TOP picks of WHITE paint colors for kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> from Benjamin Moore and Sherwin Williams. When diving further down the line, whites can be subcategorized into warm whites, neutral whites, and cool whites. Depending upon your interior design style, the existing architectural elements, the finish of hardware, and the compass direction – the best white paint for kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> can be chosen. So, before I reveal those majestic white paint colors, first let’s have a look at the bigger picture! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Benjamin Moore is a premium paint brand and is a major competitor to Sherwin Williams, so you shouldn’t be surprised to learn they have some of the best products around. Their Advance line is particularly great for painting kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. Here are some of the reasons why: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re considering painting your kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>, you may be wondering if <strong>polyurethane</strong> is the right choice for protecting your paint job. Polyurethane is a clear coating that dries to a hard, durable finish. It’s often used on wood floors and other surfaces that see a lot of wear and tear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Painting your own <strong>cabinets</strong> is worthwhile but it is still a lot of work. Don’t leave the finished product up to chance by using just any old paint. Cabinet paints are not created equal and as you’ll see from my testing, the most expensive paints are not necessarily the best! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Really, this is the most important part of the entire project. A coat of paint will only be as good as the prep work. In properly preparing the <strong>cabinets</strong>, you are laying the foundation for a good coat of paint. So what does this involve? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Plus, it takes just soap and water to clean up. If you have leftover paint, just let it dry out and throw it right into the garbage–no annoying trips to the hazardous waste disposal sites. And you can pick your method to paint kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. A paint sprayer will give you the easiest, even coat. But with hybrid enamel paint, your wood <strong>cabinets</strong> will look great if you opt to brush or roll the paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>EDITED TO UPDATE: Since writing this post, we’ve decided to give our entire home a bit of an overhaul. Which includes finally replacing these 40-year-old <strong>cabinets</strong>. Having them painted and updating them worked well for 14 years though! I still think this is a great way to update <strong>cabinets</strong> and if ours weren’t so old, we probably would not have replaced them. It was just time. :) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> have been painted with gloss latex or acrylic enamel high-sheen paints, then you have paint that is stain resistant and durable, and it may then be not necessary for you to give any added clear coats over the paint. These paints are expensive and need a careful application, so the chances are that you have used other paints that are less superior. This is where you will benefit when you cover these paints with a clear coat like <strong>polyurethane</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Use a brush, applicator or lint-free cloth to apply the <strong>polyurethane</strong>. The <strong>polyurethane</strong> dries very quickly and any defects can be difficult to touch up. Ensure the kitchen is well lit up so that it allows you to spot any defects in your application. Apply a second coat if you feel there is a need for it, but in general, a well-painted kitchen cabinet will do well with just one clear coat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cabinets can honestly make or break your kitchen décor. If they&rsquo;re a nice color and are well-painted, they can make your kitchen look incredible. On the other hand, if they look rough, then your entire kitchen can take on the same vibe. A simple and affordable solution to making any kitchen cupboards look better is by painting them — even the most outdated <strong>cabinets</strong> can give off a whole new ambiance with a fresh coat of paint! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Painting your kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> is an amazing alternative to investing in new ones. It’s a fantastic budget-friendly way to update your kitchen without the inconvenience of an expensive full-scale kitchen renovation. Kitchen cabinet painting is the best way to get a new look without the hassle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re planning to paint your <strong>cabinets</strong>, one of the best ways to protect them is by applying a <strong>polyurethane</strong> topcoat. Polyurethane not only provides extra protection from scratches and wear, but it also gives painted <strong>cabinets</strong> a beautiful, glossy finish. Here’s everything you need to know about using <strong>polyurethane</strong> on painted <strong>cabinets</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Today I want to share the steps on how to paint kitchens <strong>cabinets</strong> and get a smooth finish like the pros. Along with a few tips and tricks to make the process as smooth as possible. Also, I’ll answer a few of the most asked questions regarding painting kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sherwin Williams Extra White is a bright, crisp, and cool white paint for kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. This is one of the best white colors for <strong>cabinets</strong> if you’re aiming to achieve a cooler color palette in your home. However, you must be slightly careful when pairing this cool white cabinet color since it has the potential to appear slightly blue and gray in the north-facing rooms. On the other hand, in the south-facing rooms, this paint can counteract with the yellow light to appear slightly softer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In this article, we&rsquo;re going to take a look at the 3 most common finishes when painting a kitchen cabinet – gloss, matte, and satin. You can also learn more about how to paint laminate <strong>cabinets</strong>. We will also compare satin vs semi gloss <strong>cabinets</strong>, as well as matte finish and which suits your kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> the best. This Kitchen Infinity blog will compare their pros and cons, giving you a feel for the best finish for your kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. We also have a useful guide for those learning how to paint kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> without sanding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A lacquer finish on your kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> will outlast any of the other coatings like <strong>polyurethane</strong>, stains, varnish, or shellac. It may not be as durable as the other coatings, but will last longer without flaking or yellowing. It also seals your wooden surface by penetrating deep into the wood fibers, which is better than that of a topcoat. You will need just two layers, which can last for up to 10 years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Second, you need to use a high-quality <strong>polyurethane</strong> specifically designed for use on <strong>cabinets</strong>. Some lower-quality products can yellow over time or leave a cloudy finish. Third, be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully when applying <strong>polyurethane</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Painting <strong>cabinets</strong> yourself is always cheaper than buying new <strong>cabinets</strong> or cabinet doors. As long as your <strong>cabinets</strong> are solid wood and in good condition, painting them yourself will save you a lot of money. For more ideas to save you a ton of money while increasing your home’s ROI, click here: The Easiest Projects To Add Character and Value To Your Home - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I prefer semi-gloss paint for kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. I think it shows slightly less fingerprints and mess compared to glossy paint. However, both are totally fine options and glossy looks great in ultra-modern spaces! If you don’t have kids or pets or cook much (or have a maid) – super glossy is great! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While chalk paint doesn&rsquo;t need a primer, it may still need a protective wax top coat. Adding this layer of wax is essential to keeping it a durable paint for <strong>cabinets</strong>. You may need to purchase special brushes to paint with wax as it does have a different consistency than regular paint. Wax paint brushes tend to have softer bristles, which makes it easier to spread the wax around the surface of what you&rsquo;re painting without leaving nasty brush marks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are a few different ways you can go about painting <strong>cabinets</strong>. They all may or may not be an option for you. It all depends on what painting tools you have available to you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can put <strong>polyurethane</strong> on painted <strong>cabinets</strong>, but there are a few things to keep in mind. First, you need to make sure that the paint is fully cured before applying any kind of topcoat. If it’s not, the <strong>polyurethane</strong> can react with the paint and cause it to bubble or peel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Chalk painting is a fun alternative to conventional ways of painting, like spray-painting, brushing or rolling. While some prefer the more traditional route, others are more adventurous and would love to try out using chalk paint for their kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. Some think using chalk paint is beneficial because it’s quick drying, it requires minimal prep work, it’s water-based, it’s durable after waxing, and it can be sanded for a smooth finish. Quick Drying - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So as I said shortly after I started this blog I decided to start changing things around in my home. One of the biggest changes was my chalk painted kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. At the time Annie Sloan chalk paint was the rage. I was reading other blog tutorials on how to paint kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> without sanding or priming. I was all about the fastest way to paint my <strong>cabinets</strong> so I went for it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are two basic types of topcoats for furniture: water-based and oil-based. Traditionally, oil-based <strong>polyurethane</strong>s were the main clear coats used on furniture but now more water-based formulas are on the market. Here’s a little about the pros and cons of each: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In some cases, when using paint for your kitchen cupboards, there is a residue left behind. However, with a clear coat for <strong>cabinets</strong>, this will never happen. A paint coating tends not to cover rough edges, but a clear coat will have no problem, as it covers any rough edges perfectly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Lastly, this is one of the most important aspects when picking the best white paint for the kitchen cabinet. Especially if you have the <strong>cabinets</strong> reaching up to the bottom of the ceiling, the color of the kitchen cabinet has a major say. Let’s say, if you have a warmer and creamy tone of white paint on the ceiling, the ultra and crisp white paint on the cabinet will contradict it and make that “unappealing” appearance. On the other hand, if you have crisp white paint on the ceiling, the white paint with the ‘yellow’ undertone on the cabinet will butt against it! So, in this case, what do you do? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As it’s prone to chipping, you’ll need to regularly reapply coats of paint over again after a few months. You’ll need to take into account whether or not you’re willing to give your kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> some touch-ups over the year. If this doesn’t bother you, and you want to go for a rustic, chalky appearance with your furniture, then this may not be a disadvantage to you. Additionally, milk paint could be another alternative if you want to have a more distressed and chippy look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want your kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> done right, fill out the form below to get a free estimate. Heritage Custom Painting is a professional painting service with years of experience, and we specialize in kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. Fill out the form below or give us a call today to learn more about what we can do for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are wondering how to seal chalk-painted kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>, your best bet is Varathane Water-Based Polyurethane. Although it’s water-based, it is the most durable top coat that I have come across that won’t yellow. I have applied it on 5 high-use pieces of painted furniture and they all look as good as the first day I applied the clear coat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>No, not because we enjoy doing extra work, but this is for when we paint the <strong>cabinets</strong>. You don’t see behind the hinge which makes it the perfect place to put your piece of tape. As for the other piece of tape on top of the numbered ones, that protects the number from paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A picture is worth a thousand words. Looking at before and after pictures of painted kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> can help you envision your <strong>cabinets</strong> painted. It may help you decide to give this process a try. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When applying Varathane’s Spar Urethane, make sure to keep a wet edge so it doesn’t dry up on you too fast. In other words, work in a smaller section at a time, and don’t go over the previous section with your brush once you are done. It doesn’t give you quite as much time as its interior <strong>polyurethane</strong> version. Be sure to apply it within temperatures of 65 – 85 degrees Fahrenheit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Use a the best paint for <strong>cabinets</strong>, hybrid enamel paint, and check out our post on the best kitchen paint colors for this year. Take your time with the prep work, and use care to sand and clean in between coats of paint. DIY painting is an affordable way to transform a room. Taking the time to repaint kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> is a brilliant way to spruce up a lackluster kitchen and fall in love with your home’s heart. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While you could paint your kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> without sanding, we don’t really recommend it. Sanding removes the top layer of paint and helps smooth out the surface, giving the fresh coat something to adhere to. You don’t have to paint bare wood, but it certainly doesn’t hurt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Durability is the most important characteristic of your chosen paint finish in the kitchen,&rsquo; says Helen Shaw, director at Benjamin Moore (opens in new tab). &lsquo;Kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> and islands work incredibly hard and are subject to the bumps and scrapes of a busy household, so it is important your chosen product is up to the job. Eggshell is one of the most popular finishes, offering low levels of sheen for a smart, contemporary finish. Satin finishes are durable enough to wipe away finger marks or stains; if you prefer a more reflective finish, opt for a semi-gloss or gloss paint.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once your <strong>cabinets</strong> are prepped and ready to go, start by applying a thin layer of <strong>polyurethane</strong> with a brush or roller designed for smooth surfaces. Work in small sections and be sure to evenly cover all areas. Let the first coat dry completely before applying additional coats (usually 2-3 is sufficient). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Polyurethane kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> are a type of cabinetry that is made from <strong>polyurethane</strong>, which is a synthetic material. Polyurethane kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> are very durable and resistant to scratches, staining, and moisture. They are also easy to clean and maintain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Chalk paint and matte finishes have their place on wood furniture. But for the daily wear and tear wood <strong>cabinets</strong> withstand, you need to protect them. Unless you enjoy repainting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This step depends on the shape of your <strong>cabinets</strong> and if you are changing out your kitchen cabinet hardware or not. If you are and the new hardware you chose doesn’t line up with the old holes, now is the time to fill them. Patch the holes and any other imperfections with a high-quality filler like Bondo and let that dry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/33/d1/cc/33d1ccf3b8a0c5e39c103b10afe71e50.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Best Polyurethane For Painted Kitchen Cabinets - Polyurethane on Painted Cabinets">
