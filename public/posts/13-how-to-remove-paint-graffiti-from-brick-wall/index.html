If this doesn’t work then wipe a <strong>paint</strong> remover over the <strong>paint</strong> or <strong>graffiti</strong> you want to remove and use small circular motions with a soft cloth, remember to always wear protective gloves and goggles when using these industrial-strength chemicals. When the <strong>paint</strong> has lifted, you can wash down with warm soapy water. Using a <strong>paint</strong> remover will mean you will need to <strong>paint</strong> your whole garage door a couple of times, however, if you use Eco Solutions Graffiti Go it will lift the <strong>graffiti</strong> leaving your door looking as good as new. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XkVBm3bitEE/maxresdefault.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="How To Remove Paint Graffiti From Brick Wall - how to remove paint graffiti from brick wall"><p>Here are a few tips to help you find information about How To Paint Over Graffiti On Brick:</p><ul><li>Look for good places to get information about Best Ways to Remove Graffiti, Paint and Permanent Marker.
