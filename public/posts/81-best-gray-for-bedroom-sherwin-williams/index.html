The color of the walls in this bedroom is Lamp Room Gray by Farrow \u0026 Ball. This is a great example of how to incorporate so many subdued textures and colors that won’t overpower a room and make it feel cramped. - Source: Internet 03 of 06 Seize the Gray, by Clare “Seize the Gray is the perfect shade of gray and one of our bestsellers,” says Nicole Gibbons, the founder and CEO of Clare paint. “Other paint brands offer so many options and grays can be hard to get right. At Clare, we wanted to make sure we had a tried-and-true gray in our palette and Seize the Gray is it! It’s a clean, neutral gray with no undertones and is very versatile and calming.” Undertone: None, neutral - Source: Internet Naturally, it’s easy to dismiss gray as a cool color; even when you narrow down your swatches to those with beige, violet, or yellow undertones, a trip to the hardware store can still reveal aisle after aisle of options. To help, we asked pro designers for the best warm gray paint colors they’ve used in projects (in kitchens and living rooms, on trim and molding). Here are their top seven picks. - Source: Internet This gray bedroom gives of a fresh, vibrant vibe. This would make a perfect bedroom concept for a younger person’s bedroom or even a millennial couple who appreciate the minimalist approach. Really, whoever appreciated the subdued grays and simple approach to this bedroom can’t steer wrong with this setup. The color is Chelsea Gray by Benjamin Moore. - Source: Internet This gorgeous gray color creates a delicate canvas for some pretty interesting design colors. The color is winter’s Gate by Pratt \u0026 Lambert and the color itself is perfect for homeowners who are a bit too shy of stepping out of the beige wall comfort zone. This color is more subdued and has a natural white overtone to it. - Source: Internet Dorian Gray is another fantastic neutral warm-ish gray that I would say is a mid-tone shade. I used it on a client’s vent hood and it turned out so beautiful. Dorian is also a stunning neutral cabinetry color. - Source: Internet This bold gray color acts as a gorgeous canvas for these pictures on the wall. This is a great example of how versatile a gray bedroom wall can be. The lighter colors act as a more subdued canvas to allow other attributes to shine while a darker wall acts as a bold statement canvas ready to become more emboldened by decorative attributes. The color is Iron Mountain by Benjamin Moore. - Source: Internet There’s just something intriguing in mixing subdued blue-gray colors with royal colors. Take, for example, this bedroom, predominantly gray and adorned with jewel tones in blue and purple. These colors in the bedroom absolutely pop, mostly because the more subdued gray color acts as a subtle canvas to let these colors shine. The color of the walls in Elephant’s Breath by Farrow \u0026 Ball. - Source: Internet Cool gray paint colors have blue, purple, or green undertones. If you’re thinking of selecting a paint color from this category, be sure to test it out on your walls. Nuanced cool undertones can be an asset – but when they’re too strong – they dominate in an unappealing way. - Source: Internet Although the color gray is commonly associated with cooler, cloudy days, there are both “cool grays” and “warm grays.” Cool grays have more blue undertones, while warm grays are grounded in yellow and brown — similar to “greige,” a combination of gray and beige. Consider the following elements when you’re deciding between a cool or warm gray for interiors: flooring, cabinetry, lighting fixtures, wood trim (painted or stained) and the color of stone or brick in the house. The undertone of your interior elements should match the undertone of the grays you use. For example, cooler interior elements, such as certain stone and brushed nickel, pair well with cooler grays, while brick and gold are warmer and more easily integrate with warmer undertones, such as beige. - Source: Internet Imagine snuggling up in this bedroom during an early morning thunderstorm? This room will invoke that feeling of peace all year long with all these great subdued gray colors and clean white elements. The bedding in this bedroom only makes the scene cozier, as you can’t go wrong with so much plush bedding. The color is Pashmina by Benjamin Moore. - Source: Internet In their bedroom, Brett and Kara Phillips of High Street Homes went with Benjamin Moore’s Balboa Mist, a classic, putty-like greige. “We love the way the color changes from a gray to beige tone as the light moves throughout the day, giving our room a timeless elegance,” says Kara. “We used it in eggshell on the walls, and painted the trim in Sherwin-Williams’s White Duck.” To further pull out its warmth, the pair added a vintage wood side table and bouclé armchair. Originally, they assumed they’d go with a darker paint, but now they love how a light and airy morning feel gives way to a cozy ambience in the evening. - Source: Internet Although in massive or tiny spaces, you’ll want a lighter shade with a higher LRV. And in rooms where there’s a lot of natural or artificial light, Morning Fog can look more blue than gray. So, if this shade looks too blue, try a lighter Sedate Gray (SW 6169). - Source: Internet Summit Gray (SW7669) by Sherwin Williams is a strong dark gray paint color with a LRV of 30. The color has a balanced color profile. It has extremely close to equal parts red, green, and blue (R: 149 G: 148 B: 145). - Source: Internet This wonderfully relaxing bedroom features more subdued gray tones all around. Everything from the carpet, to the bedspread, to the walls makes this room seem peaceful and quiet. The perfect room to weather out a raging thunderstorm outside or take a relaxing spring nap. The color is Ammonite by Farrow \u0026 Ball. - Source: Internet This wonderful gray is Coventry Gray by Benjamin Moore and offers a subtle canvas to the room. This is perfect for someone who wants to stray from the typical white wall color but doesn’t want to go too bold in a bedroom either. It’s light enough to be able to make colors shine on their own, but gray enough to change it up. - Source: Internet Classic Gray (OC-23) by Benjamin Moore is a popular light gray paint color, and it’s the lightest gray paint color on this list with an LRV of 74.74. Creating an interior design plan around ‘Classic Gray’ is easy because of its light, neutral appearance. - Source: Internet Classic Gray by Benjamin Moore is one of the best light gray paint colors for a living room. Checkout the photo below to see how serene this light gray looks on the walls. It’s a perfect match for rooms with plenty of natural light. - Source: Internet This warm gray paint color has become a designer go-to for good reason: It can easily blur into the background, making it a safe choice. “Classic Gray is a wonderful, very subtle warm gray,” explains designer Young Huh. “In fact it really balances the line between a gray and an off-white and looks fantastic on kitchen cabinetry, especially when combined with a striking countertop and backsplash.” Bright enough to lighten low ceilings (a favorite strategy of Berkley Minkhorts, co-owner of House of Nomad, who used the shade all over her own home), this is also one of the softest picks. - Source: Internet This medium light gray is one of the most neutral gray paint colors possible – it has a chroma of only 0.27. In simple terms, this color is about as close to true gray as you can get. If you’re after a neutral gray, this is an excellent choice! - Source: Internet This bedroom features a more tranquil gray, in fact, the name of the paint is Tranquility by Benjamin Moore. This bedroom makes the attributes pop since the gray is a lighter gray and can hold bolder attributes. This is a great idea for keeping a room interesting but not overpowering anything with too dark walls. - Source: Internet I recommend this color to anyone that can’t quite choose between off-white and gray. Classic Gray is really a hybrid between the two color classifications. In fact, despite having ‘gray’ in the name, Benjamin Moore technically includes the color in their off-white color collection. - Source: Internet The number one paint color on the planet right now across all paint companies is probably Sherwin Williams Repose Gray. We will never know for sure because we don’t have that information but I would be shocked if Repose isn’t number one right now. Repose is a fantastic light warm gray that I recommend a lot to my clients because I think it’s about as close to perfection as you can get when it comes to a whole home color and light neutral. - Source: Internet This almost entirely all gray bedroom features gray walls, gray bedding and decorations. Although it may seem like entirely way too much gray, as you can see from the photo, all these subtle grays just work and flow together. The color is London Fog by Benjamin Moore and features a creamy undertone which makes it not too overpowering. - Source: Internet “I love to use gray tones with clear, real primaries like navy, red, and yellow,” adds Rosenfeld. “Really, any shade of blue works well with a gray backdrop. Think of the sky: It is all blues and variegated grays. I always look to nature to understand how these colors interact.” - Source: Internet It can be challenging to pick a blue gray with the right balance of blue and gray undertones. So the decision isn’t one that you should make instantly. Instead, you should consider spending a few days living with the different shades you’re debating to see which one calls to you. - Source: Internet “I recently used Light French Gray by Sherwin-Williams in satin for a built-in and was very happy with how it turned out,” shares designer Kate Lester. “It was the perfect neutral pop of color, especially against white walls.” This mid-tone gray fits best in rooms constantly bathed in light, whether from nearby windows or the lovely glow of an illuminated floor lamp. In smaller, darker interiors, though, it might appear too strong. That’s why Lester paired it with a bright white for appealing contrast. - Source: Internet Worldly Gray is just warm enough to make it feel relaxed, and homey. It’s an all around great color. I recommend Worldly Gray in almost any room – bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens, dining rooms, but it is definitely one of the best gray paints for cabinets. - Source: Internet Here’s another beautiful bathroom example from Allard \u0026 Roberts Interior Design, Inc. In this lighting, Comfort Gray reads gray with green undertones. It’s soothing and very chic. - Source: Internet There’s a reason (OK, multiple reasons) why gray paint colors are so popular. They’re mostly neutral, yet add more depth and interest to a room than white. Gray is timeless—and you can rest assured that it’s a color that won’t go out of style anytime soon. Fortunately, there are way more than 50 shades to choose from, so you’re sure to find one that matches the look you want to achieve. - Source: Internet Dark gray paint colors stand out proudly and distinctively. You can’t miss the dominate gray in these colors. This category has the kind of bold paint colors that you build a color palette around. - Source: Internet 01 of 06 Agreeable Gray, by Sherwin-Williams “Agreeable Gray SW 7029 is our most popular gray paint color because it’s the perfect hue for any living space, whether it be a family room or bedroom,” says Sue Wadden, director of color marketing at Sherwin-Williams. “It’s less cool than other grays, which bodes well for the resurgence of warmer hues and beiges that we’re seeing homeowners gravitate towards.” Want a gray that’s versatile and easy on the eyes? You can’t go wrong with this warmer shade. Undertone: Warm - Source: Internet These designs have some pretty great color concepts thrown into a more subdued gray colored room. You can easily add some intriguing color into the mix by way of bedroom furniture, including bedspreads, decorative pillows, stylish couches, picture frames, and other colorful elements. The wall color is Sleigh Bells by Benjamin Moore. - Source: Internet Edgecomb Gray (HC-173) is relaxed, creamy and warm. The paint color has medium depth with a LRV of 63.88. Edgecomb Gray’s subtle elegance makes this paint color a favorite for many interior design professionals and an extremely popular warm gray paint color. - Source: Internet This classic bedroom setup features these gorgeous dark gray walls in Downpipe by Farrow \u0026 Ball. This clean concept is made exceptionally better by the simplistic elements such as the lamp and side table. This is the perfect way to incorporate elements that will only enhance the room, not take too much away from it. - Source: Internet This bedroom is accented by hints of orange and deep, dark wood tones. The floor and the accenting orange elements seem to match perfectly, leaving one to wonder if this was planned, or just some happy accident. The color is Passive by Sherwin Williams, and that nutty brown color of the gray makes for a gorgeous canvas for this beautiful bedroom. - Source: Internet Most designers agree: White and gray make the perfect pair. “I think the pairing brings out the best in both of them. Sometimes when you pair white with a color, the color makes it look gray, and sometimes when you pair gray with a color, it makes it look white,” notes Lester. Galloway notes that Dunn-Edwards’s Whisper is a creamy alternative she loves to use, especially for those instances where a typical white or ivory isn’t working. - Source: Internet Other than that, this icy blue paint color can be used in your kids’ rooms, nursery, and shiplaps for modern farmhouse interior design styles. Be careful around this crisp blue Sherwin Williams paint since it doesn’t hold any green or gray undertones. So, definitely, it’s a true blue Sherwin Williams paint color. - Source: Internet Worsted (No.284) by Farrow \u0026 Ball is a medium-dark gray paint color that can read with blue undertones, especially when illuminated with cool light. The slight blue bias keeps this paint color from feeling too heavy. - Source: Internet This wonderfully chic gray gives off that farmhouse feels but with a pretty intense facelift. Not your typical drab, shabby chic impression, this bolder gray has elements of a rustic setting with all the modern bolder colors of a master bedroom. The color is Guggenheim Color G042 from Fine Paints of Europe, and they weren’t joking when they put “fine” into that title. - Source: Internet Stonington Gray by Benjamin Moore is a medium gray paint color and has some cool blue undertones. The color should look like a true gray in most rooms. However, with cool lighting or blue objects in a room, the color can end up appearing bluish. - Source: Internet Though designer Katie Rosenfeld rarely goes with grays, she loves Benjamin Moore’s Pilgrim Haze. Since it’s warm-toned with just a hint of cool, she uses it to soften coastal interiors, especially in her own designs, which skew warm. Her trick to getting this bold, bluelike gray to appear less intense? Cutting it back by 50 percent, just as she did for these cabinets in a kitchen in Kennebunkport, Maine. - Source: Internet If you’re looking for something one shade darker than a mid-toned neutral warm gray, Dovetail is such a great color. Great for interior doors and cabinetry. I’m afraid it may be too dark for a whole room color but it would be pretty as an accent wall. - Source: Internet This bedroom features a more modern suite look with mostly subdued gray tones and bolder decorative attributes. This is a great design concept when wanting to incorporate more subdued colors with bolder attributes. The color is Edge comb Gray by Benjamin Moore. The subdued walls create a great starting point for more design concepts. - Source: Internet Warm colors have stronger red and green color profiles, with less blue. Because of this red / green bias, gray paint colors tend to have a yellow, or brown hue. Depending on the exact mix of color, warm grays can also have orange, or olive undertones. - Source: Internet A more basic gray paint, these bedroom walls look absolutely stunning. This gray paint is called Windy City by Benjamin Moore and is definitely not a more subtle gray. However, this bolder gray color allows the lighter colors in the bedding and décor to shine since they have this great bold canvas to work on. - Source: Internet This wonderful gray color is called Baltic Gray by Benjamin Moore. This color features some of the best tones of gray – giving the room that gray appearance without bogging anything down with a harder black overtone. This is a cleaner gray that will work well with both bolder and more subtle attributes, it just depends on which way you want to go with it. - Source: Internet This color has mild olive undertones when illuminated with well balanced natural light. However, beware of warm artificial lighting, and the soft warm light that pours in from North facing windows. Warm light tricks the eye into seeing Anew Gray as a warm gray with orange or brown undertones. - Source: Internet This subtle gray allows some pretty bold attributes to shine through. As you can see from the bold mirror decoration on the wall, this more subtle gray lets pieces like these shine. The dark wood bed frame and matching nightstand also stand out more prominently due to this subdued gray color. The color is Rodeo by Benjamin Moore. - Source: Internet Arctic Seal would be a great option if you’re wanting something moody but not quite as bold as going full on black. This color would make a really pretty accent wall in an office or bedroom. It’d also be fun to paint bathroom cabinets with this dark gray paint color. Get creative! - Source: Internet “Undertones can be really tricky when selecting grays,” offers Armstrong. “Once I have narrowed down a color I am considering, I take that color chip, cut it out, and lay it on a piece of white typing paper. If there are any weird undertones in the color, they will be amplified when contrasted onto plain white paper. I’ll also compare it to other colors, like blue and green and purple, and see if there are any undertones that show themselves.” - Source: Internet This Sherwin Williams dark blue paint color has a touch of purple to exhibit an utmost cool and crisp vibe. With an LRV of 8, this color feels quite dark, dominating, and bold. Unlike the other above-mentioned dark blues, this one has more blue to it – hence, not so much gray or green. - Source: Internet If you choose Dorian Gray, I recommend sticking with a cool color pallet for the rest of the room as well. Here’s a look at this popular gray paint color used on an exterior door. Stunning! - Source: Internet Is gray the new beige? Depends on who you ask, but if retail trends are any indication, it’s taken the place off-white as the new go-to neutral. (For more proof, check out Benjamin Moore’s top-selling paint colors—more than half of them are a shade of gray.) Perhaps that’s because of its endless versatility: Whether you’re aiming for bright and crisp or warm and cozy, there’s a gray that will accomplish the task. Because choosing among seemingly endless number of grays in a fan deck can be a bit daunting, we’ve gathered designers’ favorite hues to help you get started. - Source: Internet Another Sherwin Williams dark blue paint color is Outerspace. This deep blue color can add immense depth and dimension to any space – hence, making a great statement. Just like in the inspiration above, this color can best pair with lighter grays or beiges on the adjacent wall and true whites for door and window trims. - Source: Internet This cute bedroom features a solid back gray wall that acts almost as a supporting canvas for the rest of the bedroom. This is a great way to make other, more prominent decorative elements, such as this vibrant and colorful wallpaper, to stand out without taking too much away from anything. The color of the back wall is Con forth White by Farrow \u0026 Ball. - Source: Internet Gray Owl is versatile, and looks great anywhere.

They can be teamed effortlessly with our Strong White for a clean but calm gray interior scheme and layered with accents of caramel \u0026 chocolate shades.” For those who want to design a home that’s both warm and sophisticated, they’ll never regret this timeless shade of gray.

The color of the walls in this bedroom is Lamp Room Gray by Farrow & Ball. This is a great example of how to incorporate so many subdued textures and colors that won’t overpower a room and make it feel cramped. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>03 of 06 Seize the Gray, by Clare &ldquo;Seize the Gray is the perfect shade of <strong>gray</strong> and one of our bestsellers,&rdquo; says Nicole Gibbons, the founder and CEO of Clare paint. &ldquo;Other paint brands offer so many options and <strong>gray</strong>s can be hard to get right. At Clare, we wanted to make sure we had a tried-and-true <strong>gray</strong> in our palette and Seize the Gray is it! It&rsquo;s a clean, neutral <strong>gray</strong> with no undertones and is very versatile and calming.&rdquo; Undertone: None, neutral - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Naturally, it’s easy to dismiss <strong>gray</strong> as a cool color; even when you narrow down your swatches to those with beige, violet, or yellow undertones, a trip to the hardware store can still reveal aisle after aisle of options. To help, we asked pro designers for the best warm <strong>gray</strong> paint colors they’ve used in projects (in kitchens and living rooms, on trim and molding). Here are their top seven picks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>gray</strong> bedroom gives of a fresh, vibrant vibe. This would make a perfect bedroom concept for a younger person’s bedroom or even a millennial couple who appreciate the minimalist approach. Really, whoever appreciated the subdued <strong>gray</strong>s and simple approach to this bedroom can’t steer wrong with this setup. The color is Chelsea Gray by Benjamin Moore. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This gorgeous <strong>gray</strong> color creates a delicate canvas for some pretty interesting design colors. The color is winter’s Gate by Pratt & Lambert and the color itself is perfect for homeowners who are a bit too shy of stepping out of the beige wall comfort zone. This color is more subdued and has a natural white overtone to it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dorian Gray is another fantastic neutral warm-ish <strong>gray</strong> that I would say is a mid-tone shade. I used it on a client’s vent hood and it turned out so beautiful. Dorian is also a stunning neutral cabinetry color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This bold <strong>gray</strong> color acts as a gorgeous canvas for these pictures on the wall. This is a great example of how versatile a <strong>gray</strong> bedroom wall can be. The lighter colors act as a more subdued canvas to allow other attributes to shine while a darker wall acts as a bold statement canvas ready to become more emboldened by decorative attributes. The color is Iron Mountain by Benjamin Moore. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There’s just something intriguing in mixing subdued blue-<strong>gray</strong> colors with royal colors. Take, for example, this bedroom, predominantly <strong>gray</strong> and adorned with jewel tones in blue and purple. These colors in the bedroom absolutely pop, mostly because the more subdued <strong>gray</strong> color acts as a subtle canvas to let these colors shine. The color of the walls in Elephant’s Breath by Farrow & Ball. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cool <strong>gray</strong> paint colors have blue, purple, or green undertones. If you’re thinking of selecting a paint color from this category, be sure to test it out on your walls. Nuanced cool undertones can be an asset – but when they’re too strong – they dominate in an unappealing way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although the color <strong>gray</strong> is commonly associated with cooler, cloudy days, there are both “cool <strong>gray</strong>s” and “warm <strong>gray</strong>s.” Cool <strong>gray</strong>s have more blue undertones, while warm <strong>gray</strong>s are grounded in yellow and brown — similar to “greige,” a combination of <strong>gray</strong> and beige. Consider the following elements when you’re deciding between a cool or warm <strong>gray</strong> for interiors: flooring, cabinetry, lighting fixtures, wood trim (painted or stained) and the color of stone or brick in the house. The undertone of your interior elements should match the undertone of the <strong>gray</strong>s you use. For example, cooler interior elements, such as certain stone and brushed nickel, pair well with cooler <strong>gray</strong>s, while brick and gold are warmer and more easily integrate with warmer undertones, such as beige. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Imagine snuggling up in this bedroom during an early morning thunderstorm? This room will invoke that feeling of peace all year long with all these great subdued <strong>gray</strong> colors and clean white elements. The bedding in this bedroom only makes the scene cozier, as you can’t go wrong with so much plush bedding. The color is Pashmina by Benjamin Moore. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In their bedroom, Brett and Kara Phillips of High Street Homes went with Benjamin Moore’s Balboa Mist, a classic, putty-like greige. “We love the way the color changes from a <strong>gray</strong> to beige tone as the light moves throughout the day, giving our room a timeless elegance,” says Kara. “We used it in eggshell on the walls, and painted the trim in Sherwin-Williams’s White Duck.” To further pull out its warmth, the pair added a vintage wood side table and bouclé armchair. Originally, they assumed they’d go with a darker paint, but now they love how a light and airy morning feel gives way to a cozy ambience in the evening. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although in massive or tiny spaces, you’ll want a lighter shade with a higher LRV. And in rooms where there’s a lot of natural or artificial light, Morning Fog can look more blue than <strong>gray</strong>. So, if this shade looks too blue, try a lighter Sedate Gray (SW 6169). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Summit Gray (SW7669) by Sherwin Williams is a strong dark <strong>gray</strong> paint color with a LRV of 30. The color has a balanced color profile. It has extremely close to equal parts red, green, and blue (R: 149 G: 148 B: 145). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This wonderfully relaxing bedroom features more subdued <strong>gray</strong> tones all around. Everything from the carpet, to the bedspread, to the walls makes this room seem peaceful and quiet. The perfect room to weather out a raging thunderstorm outside or take a relaxing spring nap. The color is Ammonite by Farrow & Ball. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This wonderful <strong>gray</strong> is Coventry Gray by Benjamin Moore and offers a subtle canvas to the room. This is perfect for someone who wants to stray from the typical white wall color but doesn’t want to go too bold in a bedroom either. It’s light enough to be able to make colors shine on their own, but <strong>gray</strong> enough to change it up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Classic Gray (OC-23) by Benjamin Moore is a popular light <strong>gray</strong> paint color, and it’s the lightest <strong>gray</strong> paint color on this list with an LRV of 74.74. Creating an interior design plan around ‘Classic Gray’ is easy because of its light, neutral appearance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Classic Gray by Benjamin Moore is one of the best light <strong>gray</strong> paint colors for a living room. Checkout the photo below to see how serene this light <strong>gray</strong> looks on the walls. It’s a perfect match for rooms with plenty of natural light. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This warm <strong>gray</strong> paint color has become a designer go-to for good reason: It can easily blur into the background, making it a safe choice. “Classic Gray is a wonderful, very subtle warm <strong>gray</strong>,” explains designer Young Huh. “In fact it really balances the line between a <strong>gray</strong> and an off-white and looks fantastic on kitchen cabinetry, especially when combined with a striking countertop and backsplash.” Bright enough to lighten low ceilings (a favorite strategy of Berkley Minkhorts, co-owner of House of Nomad, who used the shade all over her own home), this is also one of the softest picks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This medium light <strong>gray</strong> is one of the most neutral <strong>gray</strong> paint colors possible – it has a chroma of only 0.27. In simple terms, this color is about as close to true <strong>gray</strong> as you can get. If you’re after a neutral <strong>gray</strong>, this is an excellent choice! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This bedroom features a more tranquil <strong>gray</strong>, in fact, the name of the paint is Tranquility by Benjamin Moore. This bedroom makes the attributes pop since the <strong>gray</strong> is a lighter <strong>gray</strong> and can hold bolder attributes. This is a great idea for keeping a room interesting but not overpowering anything with too dark walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I recommend this color to anyone that can’t quite choose between off-white and <strong>gray</strong>. Classic Gray is really a hybrid between the two color classifications. In fact, despite having ‘<strong>gray</strong>’ in the name, Benjamin Moore technically includes the color in their off-white color collection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The number one paint color on the planet right now across all paint companies is probably Sherwin Williams Repose Gray. We will never know for sure because we don’t have that information but I would be shocked if Repose isn’t number one right now. Repose is a fantastic light warm <strong>gray</strong> that I recommend a lot to my clients because I think it’s about as close to perfection as you can get when it comes to a whole home color and light neutral. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This almost entirely all <strong>gray</strong> bedroom features <strong>gray</strong> walls, <strong>gray</strong> bedding and decorations. Although it may seem like entirely way too much <strong>gray</strong>, as you can see from the photo, all these subtle <strong>gray</strong>s just work and flow together. The color is London Fog by Benjamin Moore and features a creamy undertone which makes it not too overpowering. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“I love to use <strong>gray</strong> tones with clear, real primaries like navy, red, and yellow,” adds Rosenfeld. “Really, any shade of blue works well with a <strong>gray</strong> backdrop. Think of the sky: It is all blues and variegated <strong>gray</strong>s. I always look to nature to understand how these colors interact.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It can be challenging to pick a blue <strong>gray</strong> with the right balance of blue and <strong>gray</strong> undertones. So the decision isn’t one that you should make instantly. Instead, you should consider spending a few days living with the different shades you’re debating to see which one calls to you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“I recently used Light French Gray by Sherwin-Williams in satin for a built-in and was very happy with how it turned out,” shares designer Kate Lester. “It was the perfect neutral pop of color, especially against white walls.” This mid-tone <strong>gray</strong> fits best in rooms constantly bathed in light, whether from nearby windows or the lovely glow of an illuminated floor lamp. In smaller, darker interiors, though, it might appear too strong. That’s why Lester paired it with a bright white for appealing contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Worldly Gray is just warm enough to make it feel relaxed, and homey. It’s an all around great color. I recommend Worldly Gray in almost any room – bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens, dining rooms, but it is definitely one of the best <strong>gray</strong> paints for cabinets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Here’s another beautiful bathroom example from Allard & Roberts Interior Design, Inc. In this lighting, Comfort Gray reads <strong>gray</strong> with green undertones. It’s soothing and very chic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There&rsquo;s a reason (OK, multiple reasons) why <strong>gray</strong> paint colors are so popular. They&rsquo;re mostly neutral, yet add more depth and interest to a room than white. Gray is timeless—and you can rest assured that it&rsquo;s a color that won&rsquo;t go out of style anytime soon. Fortunately, there are way more than 50 shades to choose from, so you&rsquo;re sure to find one that matches the look you want to achieve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dark <strong>gray</strong> paint colors stand out proudly and distinctively. You can’t miss the dominate <strong>gray</strong> in these colors. This category has the kind of bold paint colors that you build a color palette around. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>01 of 06 Agreeable Gray, by Sherwin-Williams &ldquo;Agreeable Gray SW 7029 is our most popular <strong>gray</strong> paint color because it&rsquo;s the perfect hue for any living space, whether it be a family room or bedroom,&rdquo; says Sue Wadden, director of color marketing at Sherwin-Williams. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s less cool than other <strong>gray</strong>s, which bodes well for the resurgence of warmer hues and beiges that we&rsquo;re seeing homeowners gravitate towards.&rdquo; Want a <strong>gray</strong> that&rsquo;s versatile and easy on the eyes? You can&rsquo;t go wrong with this warmer shade. Undertone: Warm - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>These designs have some pretty great color concepts thrown into a more subdued <strong>gray</strong> colored room. You can easily add some intriguing color into the mix by way of bedroom furniture, including bedspreads, decorative pillows, stylish couches, picture frames, and other colorful elements. The wall color is Sleigh Bells by Benjamin Moore. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Edgecomb Gray (HC-173) is relaxed, creamy and warm. The paint color has medium depth with a LRV of 63.88. Edgecomb Gray’s subtle elegance makes this paint color a favorite for many interior design professionals and an extremely popular warm <strong>gray</strong> paint color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This classic bedroom setup features these gorgeous dark <strong>gray</strong> walls in Downpipe by Farrow & Ball. This clean concept is made exceptionally better by the simplistic elements such as the lamp and side table. This is the perfect way to incorporate elements that will only enhance the room, not take too much away from it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This bedroom is accented by hints of orange and deep, dark wood tones. The floor and the accenting orange elements seem to match perfectly, leaving one to wonder if this was planned, or just some happy accident. The color is Passive by Sherwin Williams, and that nutty brown color of the <strong>gray</strong> makes for a gorgeous canvas for this beautiful bedroom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most designers agree: White and <strong>gray</strong> make the perfect pair. “I think the pairing brings out the best in both of them. Sometimes when you pair white with a color, the color makes it look <strong>gray</strong>, and sometimes when you pair <strong>gray</strong> with a color, it makes it look white,” notes Lester. Galloway notes that Dunn-Edwards’s Whisper is a creamy alternative she loves to use, especially for those instances where a typical white or ivory isn’t working. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Other than that, this icy blue paint color can be used in your kids’ rooms, nursery, and shiplaps for modern farmhouse interior design styles. Be careful around this crisp blue Sherwin Williams paint since it doesn’t hold any green or <strong>gray</strong> undertones. So, definitely, it’s a true blue Sherwin Williams paint color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Worsted (No.284) by Farrow & Ball is a medium-dark <strong>gray</strong> paint color that can read with blue undertones, especially when illuminated with cool light. The slight blue bias keeps this paint color from feeling too heavy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This wonderfully chic <strong>gray</strong> gives off that farmhouse feels but with a pretty intense facelift. Not your typical drab, shabby chic impression, this bolder <strong>gray</strong> has elements of a rustic setting with all the modern bolder colors of a master bedroom. The color is Guggenheim Color G042 from Fine Paints of Europe, and they weren’t joking when they put “fine” into that title. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Stonington Gray by Benjamin Moore is a medium <strong>gray</strong> paint color and has some cool blue undertones. The color should look like a true <strong>gray</strong> in most rooms. However, with cool lighting or blue objects in a room, the color can end up appearing bluish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Though designer Katie Rosenfeld rarely goes with <strong>gray</strong>s, she loves Benjamin Moore’s Pilgrim Haze. Since it’s warm-toned with just a hint of cool, she uses it to soften coastal interiors, especially in her own designs, which skew warm. Her trick to getting this bold, bluelike <strong>gray</strong> to appear less intense? Cutting it back by 50 percent, just as she did for these cabinets in a kitchen in Kennebunkport, Maine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re looking for something one shade darker than a mid-toned neutral warm <strong>gray</strong>, Dovetail is such a great color. Great for interior doors and cabinetry. I’m afraid it may be too dark for a whole room color but it would be pretty as an accent wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This bedroom features a more modern suite look with mostly subdued <strong>gray</strong> tones and bolder decorative attributes. This is a great design concept when wanting to incorporate more subdued colors with bolder attributes. The color is Edge comb Gray by Benjamin Moore. The subdued walls create a great starting point for more design concepts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Warm colors have stronger red and green color profiles, with less blue. Because of this red / green bias, <strong>gray</strong> paint colors tend to have a yellow, or brown hue. Depending on the exact mix of color, warm <strong>gray</strong>s can also have orange, or olive undertones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A more basic <strong>gray</strong> paint, these bedroom walls look absolutely stunning. This <strong>gray</strong> paint is called Windy City by Benjamin Moore and is definitely not a more subtle <strong>gray</strong>. However, this bolder <strong>gray</strong> color allows the lighter colors in the bedding and décor to shine since they have this great bold canvas to work on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This wonderful <strong>gray</strong> color is called Baltic Gray by Benjamin Moore. This color features some of the best tones of <strong>gray</strong> – giving the room that <strong>gray</strong> appearance without bogging anything down with a harder black overtone. This is a cleaner <strong>gray</strong> that will work well with both bolder and more subtle attributes, it just depends on which way you want to go with it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This color has mild olive undertones when illuminated with well balanced natural light. However, beware of warm artificial lighting, and the soft warm light that pours in from North facing windows. Warm light tricks the eye into seeing Anew Gray as a warm <strong>gray</strong> with orange or brown undertones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This subtle <strong>gray</strong> allows some pretty bold attributes to shine through. As you can see from the bold mirror decoration on the wall, this more subtle <strong>gray</strong> lets pieces like these shine. The dark wood bed frame and matching nightstand also stand out more prominently due to this subdued <strong>gray</strong> color. The color is Rodeo by Benjamin Moore. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Arctic Seal would be a great option if you’re wanting something moody but not quite as bold as going full on black. This color would make a really pretty accent wall in an office or bedroom. It’d also be fun to paint bathroom cabinets with this dark <strong>gray</strong> paint color. Get creative! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“Undertones can be really tricky when selecting <strong>gray</strong>s,” offers Armstrong. “Once I have narrowed down a color I am considering, I take that color chip, cut it out, and lay it on a piece of white typing paper. If there are any weird undertones in the color, they will be amplified when contrasted onto plain white paper. I’ll also compare it to other colors, like blue and green and purple, and see if there are any undertones that show themselves.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This Sherwin Williams dark blue paint color has a touch of purple to exhibit an utmost cool and crisp vibe. With an LRV of 8, this color feels quite dark, dominating, and bold. Unlike the other above-mentioned dark blues, this one has more blue to it – hence, not so much <strong>gray</strong> or green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you choose Dorian Gray, I recommend sticking with a cool color pallet for the rest of the room as well. Here’s a look at this popular <strong>gray</strong> paint color used on an exterior door. Stunning! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Is <strong>gray</strong> the new beige? Depends on who you ask, but if retail trends are any indication, it&rsquo;s taken the place off-white as the new go-to neutral.
