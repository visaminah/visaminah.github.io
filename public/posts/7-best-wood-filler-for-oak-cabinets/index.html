From the cabinet painter’s perspective, what matters is how smooth the wood feels to start with. Most wood falls into one of three categories: light grain, medium/heavy grain, or knotted. - Source: Internet This group includes golden oak, red oak, hickory, and walnut. Perhaps because the grain pattern is so heavy and visually dominant on these woods, and because their stained color is so strong (usually some variation of dark orange), homeowners seem to be the most eager to either paint or replace these design offenders, to completely transform and refresh the look and feel of their kitchen. Therefore these are the wood cabinets we paint most often. How do you know you have one of these types of cabinets? These woods don’t always feel paper-smooth to the touch, and you can feel the texture of the grain if you run your fingers across a cabinet door. - Source: Internet The vast majority of homeowners say Yes! The flat areas of their cabinets (the doors and drawer fronts, plus the cabinet bases) are fully filled and end up paper-smooth by the time we’re done with them. This is more than enough to make your cabinets look amazing and totally transform your kitchen. For most of our clients, any minuscule grain that it still visible as a slight waviness, especially on those curved areas or edges, just isn’t an issue. But if you want ALL the grain removed, we can still do that! It would just add to the cost of your project, to account for the extra time and labor required to hand-fill every last bit of grain. - Source: Internet Most homeowners want their painted kitchen cabinets to look like new, like they were painted by the manufacturer with a factory finish that feels smooth to the touch. Otherwise, if you still see or feel the underlying grain underneath the layers of fresh paint, it’s a dead give-away that the cabinets were originally stained and then painted later, and not painted very well to boot. So the challenge for the professional cabinet painter is to make sure that the vast majority of the wood grain is undetectable after painting. How do you accomplish that? - Source: Internet We bring fully-painted sample cabinet doors to our estimates and consultations, just like the ones you’ve seen here. They’re all done on red oak or other heavy-grained wood, so that you can see the amount of grain that’s filled, and the level of smoothness to expect for your own cabinet painting project. We’re very proud of our smooth, lovely painted samples! - Source: Internet We can deal with those too, but they come with greater challenges. Because of the depth of these knots, addressing them requires many filler applications before they’re finally filled to satisfaction. In some cases three or four manual applications of wood filler are needed, along with dry times in between each application. Again, all this adds to the cost of your project. The good news is that it’s much cheaper than replacing your cabinets would be! - Source: Internet These types of wood cabinets are the easiest to paint and get a silky-smooth result. If your cabinets feel smooth to the touch already, they’re probably a fine-grained wood such as cherry or maple. They may have a visual pattern, but they’ll still feel smooth as a sheet of paper. - Source: Internet Following are some suggestions on where to begin your search for data on Will I Still See the Grain on Painted Cabinets?:\rYou should try to find Aqua Coat Grain Filler-related information from reputable places.
