Sometimes we struggle when choosing between gold or silver shoes, here is a good rule of thumb: If you usually wear gold jewelry, gold shoes are the best choice, if you usually wear silver–choose silver shoes, they will look best with your skin tone.

No matter which <strong>colors</strong> you pair with navy, use contrast to avoid a muddied-up palette and supply resting places for the eye. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another great option is a strappy sandal, again, depending on the dress.

Whatever the shoe you choose, just make sure that the color and style you choose compliments your dress and are appropriate for the occasion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Picture whitecaps breaking atop dark <strong>blue</strong> waves, and you&rsquo;ll immediately realize why whites go so well with navy <strong>blue</strong>. White is a classic high-contrast partner that sets off the deep hue and gives navy a lively lift. Juxtapose navy <strong>blue</strong> furniture, decor, or cabinetry with a backdrop of crisp white walls for an energizing effect.

For a complementary color scheme, look to <strong>blue</strong>&rsquo;s opposite on the wheel: orange. The fiery hue introduces warmth that balances the cool depth of navy <strong>blue</strong>. Establish a bold, colorful look with a medium-tone shade of orange, such as tangerine or papaya, that will stand up well against its dark counterpart.

Incorporate the color into your navy <strong>blue</strong> room with metallic gold accents or gold-toned wood finishes on floors, furniture, or trim. This radiant hue is especially helpful for lightening up dark navy <strong>blue</strong> <strong>colors</strong> to ward off a gloomy look. A large gold mirror on a navy <strong>blue</strong> wall, for example, will reflect light around the space to create an expansive effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A lacy navy <strong>blue</strong> dress is perfect for special occasions like date nights, an evening out with friends, or even a fancy dinner party. Since the dress is already quite detailed, you’ll want to keep your shoe choice simple. Black heels are always a classic option, but if you’re looking for something a little different silver or gold strappy heels would also look great.

And turtleneck with a sports coat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This all-American pairing is a classic color scheme for interiors. Combine red and white with navy <strong>blue</strong> to decorate patriotic country-style spaces and playful nautical-inspired kids&rsquo; rooms. Vibrant cherry red or scarlet accents can also provide striking contrast against navy <strong>blue</strong> in modern or eclectic designs.

Pairing navy <strong>blue</strong> with more muted shades of red, such as salmon, rich burgundy, or brick red, can help set a sophisticated tone that&rsquo;s ideal for formal dining rooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Orange is really scary for a lot of people, but when done right it can be a masterpiece. I feel like when it comes to wearing orange and <strong>blue</strong> together it&rsquo;s go big or go home. Their brightness is their beauty and when embraced can be really powerful. However, for those looking for subtler options, you can wear a cerulean <strong>blue</strong> with a tangerine or go for a deep or navy <strong>blue</strong> to tone down the brightness of the orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although—fun fact—the <strong>blue</strong> of U.S. naval officer uniforms is actually black, in order to combat fading. #TheStruggleIsReal - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>By reds, we mean all the different tones of red, especially because this is a tricky color pairing and so you need to find the perfect shade of <strong>blue</strong> with the perfect shade of red or even burgundy.
