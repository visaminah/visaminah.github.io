Two-stroke (or 2-cycle) engines require a mixture of fuel and oil be added to the fuel tank. This mixture results in both engine combustion and lubrication. Operating a 2-Stroke engine on gasoline alone will result in engine failure. - Source: Internet The differences between 2-stroke and 4-stroke oil funnel back to the specifics of 2-stroke and 4-stroke engines. On a 4-stroke engine, four strokes complete one cycle. For 2-stroke engines, they do more work per piston movement. - Source: Internet STIHL 2-cycle oils are formulated to meet the high temperatures and lean running conditions of today’s innovative and technically advanced STIHL engines. All STIHL 2-cycle oils contain a fuel stabilizer for longer storage life and to prevent fuel varnishing. STIHL recommends a mix of 50:1 high-quality 89 octane unleaded gasoline to STIHL engine oil. This same mix ratio should be used during break-in. Oil is packaged in 100 ml, 200 ml, 500 ml and 1 litre bottles (100 \u0026 200 ml also available as a six-pack). - Source: Internet Since the 1980s, different types of two-stroke oil have been developed for specialized uses, such as outboard motor two-strokes, as well as the more standard auto lube (motorcycle) two-stroke oil. As a rule of thumb, it will be stated somewhere on the printed label of most containers of oil available commercially, that it is compatible with “Autolube” or injector pumps. Those oils tend to have the consistency of liquid dish soap if shaken. A more viscous oil cannot reliably be passed through an injection system, although a premix can be used on either type. - Source: Internet Use a 32:1 gasoline to oil ratio. One gallon of gasoline combined with 4 oz of two-cycle engine oil. If you are in the state of California, use a 2-cycle oil mix ratio of 40:1. - Source: Internet Note: Never use gasoline with an ethanol content higher than 10%. Ethanol attracts moisture when exposed to air. After absorbing less than an ounce of water, the 2-cycle gasoline and oil mixture will start to separate and if used, result in damage to your engine’s carburetor. - Source: Internet with a minimum octane rating of 89 (mid-grade) and maximum ethanol content of 10%. Never use a fuel with a higher content than this. The lower the ethanol content the better. 2-cycle premium oil that is ISO-L-EGD and JASO M345 FD certified. - Source: Internet String trimmers that run 4-cycle (4-stage) engines have a fill port for engine oil and a fill port for gasoline. Never mix oil and fuel together for a 4-cycle engine. Also, never use 2-cycle oil in a 4-cycle string trimmer. Good engine oil is required. - Source: Internet Use a 40:1 two-cycle oil mix ratio. One gallon of gasoline combined with 3.2 oz of two-cycle engine oil. - Source: Internet This engine is certified to operate on unleaded gasoline. Before operation, gasoline must be mixed with a good quality synthetic 2 cycle air cooled engine oil designed to be mixed at a ratio of 40:1. Poulan/Weed Eater brand synthetic oil is recommended. - Source: Internet Following are some suggestions on where to begin your search for data on 2 Stroke Oil Maruyama 5 Liter Brush cutter Chainsaw Blower Trimmer Engine Stihl Ryobi Husky for Husqvarna:\rYou should try to find Stihl Oil Mix Ratio Chart-related information from reputable places.
