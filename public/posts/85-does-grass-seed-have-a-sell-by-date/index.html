Cool season grasses are prevalent on the northern side and generally grow in every place there. - Source: Internet It is better to spend a little extra to ensure that you buy a high-quality bag of seeds. Why? Because it works well and can be stored for a longer period. The leftover seeds need to be sealed properly and stored. So, it is best to keep them in any dark and cool cupboards with good airflow. - Source: Internet To know if grass seed is still good, you can place the seeds in a cup of water and test if they float. If they rise to the top after a few minutes, they’re likely not good. Those that sink are still in good shape and will likely germinate. This test is free and easy, so why not give it a try? - Source: Internet Keep grass seeds in a cool, dry place, with proper air circulation. The temperature needs to remain between 40-50 F (4-10 C). Do not store seeds in a garage or shed where temperature can go below 32 F (0 C). Also, keep the bags off the floor where mice can’t reach them. - Source: Internet Now you need to make sure that the seeds do not dry out at any point. Do not cover them up with straws that might lead to the growth of weed, which you do not need. On the other hand, cover the top with a layer of soil. This thin layer will keep the seeds hydrated and will provide a warm and moist environment. - Source: Internet Seeds that date back to 2-3 years can also be used if they have been stored well. If you are using old seeds, try out with a few to see if they germinate. Then only plant the rest of them. - Source: Internet Grass seeds need a good and healthy start to begin the process of germination. We suggest that you should water the seeds daily twice a day in the beginning. Continue doing this till germination and make sure that the topsoil is always moist. But remember not to apply excess water at one time. This would only lead to waterlogging, and that could be fatal for the seeds. - Source: Internet The grass you select for your yard affects how long your grass seed lasts. According to Oregon State University , studies show that 50% of seeds from Kentucky bluegrass, perennial ryegrass , and tall fescue seeds can germinate after three to five years of storage. These rates apply for creeping bentgrass even after five years. - Source: Internet Place a few grass seeds in one cup of room temperature water. Wait 15 minutes to give the seeds some time to soak up the moisture. Floating seeds won’t germinate, but those that sank will still sprout. - Source: Internet As for that leftover seed, make sure you seal the bag properly. Once sealed, store it in a cool, dark, and dry place with good airflow around the bag. Do this and it should be good for a couple of years. - Source: Internet Yes, the grass needs to get water regularly in order to grow well. But too much of it may destroy them. Make sure that water does not flood the area, or it does not settle on the surface. That would mean the seeds rotting or decaying away. - Source: Internet To deal with such cases, it is best to opt for seeds of different variants that can grow in the shade. We would suggest that you first try out with a handful of seeds to see if they grow. If the seeds germinate, buy the same variant otherwise try out something else. - Source: Internet Ideal storage temperatures for most seeds are above freezing but under 60 degrees F. Temperature above 100 degrees can badly affect seed viability. Storage humidity. If seeds are stored in cloth sacks or open containers, their moisture levels are subject to change. In humid climates, they may absorb humidity. - Source: Internet Spread a damp paper towel on a plane surface. Now, place 10-12 seeds in a row and roll the sheet. Put it in a zipped plastic bag, and keep it in a warm place for one week. - Source: Internet Always elevate your grass seed bags off the floor. If you have sturdy shelving, this is ideal. If not, you can create a makeshift low shelf with a few piled bricks and a thick piece of wood or even an unused plastic tub and put your grass seed bags in that. - Source: Internet Also, check for the date which will be printed on the pack. It is best to avoid seeds that have been on the shelf for a long time. There is a chance that they might not grow as expected. So, always look for the latest date and choose that. - Source: Internet Perennial Ryegrass and Kentucky Bluegrass are popular all-purpose choices. This popularity is partially because they are hardy in zones 3 – 9. They also have a longer shelf-life than some other grasses, so if you’re shopping at the box store you’re more likely to get seed that will germinate well. - Source: Internet Grass seed lasts two to three years in an open bag if your roll it up and seal it as much as possible. If the bag is open to the elements, there’s a high chance it’ll get covered in moisture and mold. Expired grass seed can be used, but it’s usually only about 10% as effective as it should be. - Source: Internet MOOWY Power Lawn Best grass seed for hard-wearing results View offer Slide 1 of 0 Description The trick to this is to add these power lawn seeds to some fresh topsoil and then watch as your … read more Slide 1 of 1 View offer - Source: Internet Fall is just around the corner, which means so is the best time to complete your lawn seeding project. You may have a bag of grass seed in your garage from last year. Is it still viable? You can check the bag for an expiration date, or you can read more about what you need to know about grass seed storage and some simple steps to determine if it’s still viable*: - Source: Internet While seed needs water to germinate, too much of a good thing will severely hinder growth. For best results, plant grass seed after the majority of the spring downpours have ended. Gently water the seeded areas the right way for best results. - Source: Internet There is a huge variety of grass seeds available to buy nowadays and it can be a little overwhelming. Even though all grass seed do relatively the same job, it all depends on how much money you want to spend and the size of the area that you want to cover. Although it doesn’t really matter, experts say that you should pay attention to the label when buying seed and look for the lower amount of weed seed, crop seed, and inert matter, the better. - Source: Internet What kind of area do you live in? Do you have a sandy backyard or your soil mostly consists of heavy clay? Answering these questions will help you figure out what kind of seeds you need. Every seed does not thrive in every kind of soil. In fact, you can have a different kind of grass from your neighbor. - Source: Internet You may be purchasing extra grass seeds and may have to store it away for the winter. For this, it is best to select a bag with a mesh. This will allow air to flow through it while the mesh keeps insects away.

Now, if that date has passed, it is best to throw away the container. If the date is close by or you bought the packets a year ago, it is best to test them first. - Source: Internet Moisture is something that can bring down the seed’s productivity or destroy it completely. So, make sure that you never buy open seed bags from shops. While moisture helps seeds germinate, that happens once you plant them. Otherwise, it can spoil the seeds and create pathogens. These pathogens break the seeds down, and they slowly decay with time. - Source: Internet I share this story because one of the most commonly asked questions here at Nature’s Finest Seed has to do with storage. Sometimes after planting a new lawn or overseeding an existing lawn it’s normal to have some leftover seed. Instead of throwing it away or scattering it over your lawn, keep it for later use. Leftover seed can come in handy for filling in bare or thin spots in the future. It’s also great for quick repairs after sprinkler work or lawn damage. - Source: Internet After that, remove the bag and count how many seeds germinated. If 6-8 seeds sprout, it means they have a 60-80 percent germination rate. In case 4 or fewer seeds germinate, then the rate is 50 percent or lower, and you need to acquire fresh grass seeds. - Source: Internet Put the damp paper towel with the seeds into a Ziploc bag. Put the bag in a warm area, such as your kitchen window or on top of your refrigerator. Wait 10 days to see if any seeds sprouted. If five or more seeds germinated, then the grass seed will work. - Source: Internet Grass seed can go bad in the bag from becoming stale, humid, or too dry. The seeds will eventually crack or get moldy, so it’s important to rotate the bags and use them within a few years of purchasing them. The good news is that many grass seeds can last well beyond the predicted expiration date. - Source: Internet Many people begin gardening not only as a means to grow healthy and nutritious fruits and vegetables, but to also save money. Growing a crop of your favorite vegetables can be an absolute delight, as can herbs and flowers for the garden. However, each season, growers with limited space may find themselves left with unused garden seeds. In many cases, these seeds are stored away for safekeeping, slowly accumulating with what many the gardening community refer to as a “seed stash.” So are old seeds still good for planting or is it better to acquire more? Read on to find out. - Source: Internet Even if you’ve taken great care over your bag of seed over 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, with each passing year fewer seeds will germinate. This means that your coverage rate will go down significantly compared with a fresh mix. So, you’ll need more seeds to cover less area. That being said, overseeding with old seed will not have any damaging affect on your lawn. - Source: Internet The best storage conditions for seed packets require a dark, dry, and cool location. For this reason, many growers choose to store plant seeds in airtight jars in places such as refrigerators or in cellars or basements. Many may also add rice grains to the jars to discourage the presence of moisture. - Source: Internet Two variants of grass are most popular – Kentucky Ryegrass and Perennial Ryegrass. They are popular because these grow well in zones 3-9. They also have an extensive shelf life and can remain alive longer than most other grasses. Plus, you can purchase them from your local supermarkets as well as nurseries. - Source: Internet The viability of stored seeds of any kind are greatly influenced by storage conditions, and unfortunately, the ideal conditions for seed storage are very often exactly the opposite of how homeowners store grass seed. In general, seeds will maintain their viability longest if stored in cool, dry conditions—which is not the condition typical in most garages and sheds. The factors influencing seed viability include: - Source: Internet Look for discoloration and any fungi growth on the body. These are initial signs of decaying seeds. Also, check if they have become damp and are sticking to each other. That could also be another sign of damage. - Source: Internet Secondly, pay attention to how the seed packets have been stored. Ideally, they need to be kept upright with some space around them. This is needed for airflow, which keeps the seeds in perfect condition. If the packets are kept on top of each other with no space for airflow, they may again start catching moisture. This will prevent them from germinating well. - Source: Internet Keep the seeds in a cellar or basement, as long as it is dry and cool. You can also refrigerate them as well. However, don’t forget to place an open box of baking soda or a commercial desiccant. It helps in soaking up the excess moisture. - Source: Internet If the storage temperature is cold, and relative humidity (RH) is dry, then seeds will be viable for long. Refrigerate them, in airtight containers, or keep at the coolest location in your home. If you store the seeds as per the instructions on the label, then they’ll stay viable for up to five years! - Source: Internet Storage conditions do have a major influence of the long-term viability of stored seed. Storing your seed outside in a shed, or garage is not ideal due to the exposure to heat and humidity. Instead, try storing your seed indoors in a cool, dry area, to extend your purchase’s shelf life. - Source: Internet I use Jonathan Green seed which I buy directly from the manufacturer. I find this gets me the freshest, best-quality seed. This one is my go-to and I highly recommend it. - Source: Internet Most varieties of grass require at least 3 hours of sunlight daily to germinate. Areas receiving less than this amount might be more conducive to low sunlight ground covers if grass refuses to grow. You could also try to lay sod yourself with a grass type that thrives in shade. - Source: Internet The viability of seeds depends on storage conditions. Seeds can remain viable for a more extended period if appropriately stored in a cool and dry place. The factors that affect seed viability are: - Source: Internet Note: If you think your grass seed is bad because it’s not growing in your yard, make sure you’ve chosen the right grass for the season. There are dozens of warm-weather and cold-weather grasses that don’t grow well in certain environments. Knowing which grass you’re planting is crucial to its success! - Source: Internet If you look on the back of your seed packet, there should be some type of dated information, at least with most reputable sources. For example, it may have a “packed for” date, which is typically when the seeds were packed, not necessarily when they were harvested. As with many items you find at the grocery store, you may have “sell by” or “best by” date, which normally indicates the end of the year those seeds were packed. - Source: Internet To properly store grass seed, first make sure it’s placed in the right kind of packaging. Breathable packaging is best, such as a cloth sack or burlap bag. Breathable materials will allow good air flow and reduce the risk of molding. However, if you have a full unopened bag of grass seed it’s best to leave it unopened in the original packaging. - Source: Internet Cold weather will hinder seed growth. For grass seed to germinate, the soil temperature must be at least 55 degrees, and the air temperature should be consistently at 60 degrees or higher. If you plant your seed too early in the spring, it will sit on top of the soil and not germinate. By the time the weather warms up, many of the seeds are damaged and won’t sprout, leaving your new growth sparse and patchy. I always say that when you think it’s time to spread seed in the spring … wait 10 days to be sure you don’t waste your grass seed. - Source: Internet So, it would help if you were careful about the time of the year when you plant them. If they are planted too early, the seeds will not germinate and sit on the ground. This will not necessarily kill all the seeds, but many could be damaged by the time the temperature rises. - Source: Internet Cold weather can stop the growth of grass completely. Grass generally needs at least a soil temperature of 55 degrees to begin growing. Anything colder than that can prevent growth altogether. The air temperature needs to be at 60 degrees consistently. A higher temperature will not be a problem, but a lower one will be. - Source: Internet Maybe you’ve had this experience. You go to the big box store and stare at several different kinds of grass seed. The more you look, the more confused you get. How do you know which type to buy when there’s no one to ask? When you do buy, you might buy too much grass seed, and now you are wondering if it’s going to last until next season. Does grass seed go bad? The answer is that it can … the shelf life of grass seed depends on many factors. - Source: Internet Adding on, if you had been planning to store seeds, it is best to choose the best of the lot at any store. Purchase seeds that have a far expiration date and these should last long. Also, pick up high-quality seeds as they will again stay potent for a longer time. - Source: Internet According to SF Gate, an unopened bag of grass seed can last three or more years. Some brands claim to last up to five years, which could provide quite a reliable supply of grass seed for the incoming years. Grass seeds can last longer if they’re kept in a cool, dry space without too much sunshine, rain, humidity, and debris. - Source: Internet While some may wonder whether or not it is safe to plant seeds that have passed their expiration dates, we know that planting expired seeds will not impact the outcome of the final plant grown from that seed. So, will expired seeds grow? Yes. Plants grown from expired seed packets will grow to produce healthy and fruitful harvests, just as their younger counterparts. With this in mind, one may be left to wonder then, when do old seeds expire? More importantly, why do we need seed expiration dates? - Source: Internet You can also add some natural desiccant to absorb excess humidity. If you have the little desiccant packages that are sealed, you can place those into any opened grass seed bags. If your grass seed bag is sealed, place the desiccant packages nearby. - Source: Internet General purpose - for use on lawns that have a mix of everything going on. General-purpose grass seed mixes grow well in most soils and grow fairly quickly, especially in spring and autumn. They’re also the best option if your lawn gets both sun and shade during the day. - Source: Internet If you have expired grass seed, you can plant it or toss it into a compost bin. Expired grass seed still contains a few essential components for fertilizer once it breaks down. It’s unlikely to germinate, but it works for patchy areas and overseeding since most of them won’t grow. - Source: Internet So let’s look at the absolute ideal scenario. An unopened bag of grass seed that’s kept in ideal storage conditions can last up to 5 years. In comparison, an open bag usually lasts around 18 months according to an Oregon State University study. Grass seeds that grow in hardiness zones 3–9 can last up to 5 years if it’s grown in the absolute best conditions. Common grass verities on the other hand can last up to 3 years in storage. - Source: Internet A hot, humid garage is, unfortunately, one of the worst places to store seed. Grass seed is best stored in a dry space, in temperatures ranging from 32ºF to 60ºF. If you have space, the absolute best way to store seed is in a sealed container in the refrigerator until you’re ready to use it. If you don’t have refrigeration space, keep your seed stored in a container and try to use it as soon as possible after purchase. - Source: Internet Use old grass seeds for reseeding or top seeding, but do not expect a high germination rate as compared to the fresh turfgrass seeds. Store new grass seeds in a tightly sealed plastic bag or container, so they cannot soak moisture. This increases the viability of seeds. Also, keep the seeds away from hot shed or garage and store them in a cool and dry place, indoors. - Source: Internet You want the location to have some natural ventilation and circulation. You also want to be sure it won’t freeze, which will kill the seeds. A temperature range of between 40 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit is ideal. - Source: Internet Our top pick is that the Miracle-Gro EverGreen Complete 4in1. It is the best overall grass seed on the market.

That means you get the best seed, without any filler, bringing you fuller and longer lasting results than the competition. - Source: Internet : For the majority of seeds, the correct storage temperature is above freezing but below 60 F (15 C). Temperature above 100 F (37 C) can affect seed’s viability severely. Humidity: If you are storing seeds in open containers or cloth sacks, then there is a chance of change in the moisture content of seeds. - Source: Internet Germination rates drop 10% to 20% per year. So, you might want to do a quick germination rate test after a couple of years. But if you’d rather not deal with germinating seeds, a local lawn seeding company can help you get your yard in shape for you. - Source: Internet Whether you’re storing grass seed in bulk or forgot about a bag you got a couple of years ago, you’re not alone. Many people prefer grass seed over sod because it’s much more natural and affordable. However, leaving the bag open can invite mold and bacterial growth. - Source: Internet Give your grass seed the sniff test. Nothing says “mold” faster than a whiff of that telltale damp, grassy, musty, “dirty gym socks” odor. If your grass seed doesn’t smell like seed anymore, there is a good chance it is no longer viable. - Source: Internet According to All Creatures Healthcare, “The reason that grass seeds can be dangerous for dogs (or even cats) is that they can easily penetrate their outer skin in multiple areas. If left untreated, this can be incredibly painful – in worst-case scenarios, the internal damage it may cause can even be fatal”. Therefore use this product with care. - Source: Internet Most grass seeds need direct exposure to sunlight to grow well. They need to be placed under the sun for at least 3 hours every day. This would lead to good growth. However, if your seeds are planted in the shade, they may refuse to grow well or may take a lot of time to germinate. - Source: Internet The cooler the storage temperature and the dryer the relative humidity (RH), the longer your seeds will remain viable. Seeds stored in a sealed container in a refrigerator usually enjoy the best longevity. If this isn’t practical, seek out the coolest location in your home. Stored with this kind of care, your grass seed may remain viable for as long as five years. - Source: Internet Seed moisture content : The necessary internal moisture content is 10-20 percent for most seeds. When exposed to moisture below this level or high humidity, they have a chance of dying. Generally, seeds do not go below their optimal internal moisture levels. The surrounding humid conditions influence them and they absorb extra moisture from the atmosphere. - Source: Internet By high quality, we mean seeds that have less than 0.5% weed. Also, the chaff or dirt present in the pack should be less than 2%. The presence of other crops should also not be more than 2%. If the seeds meet these criteria, then you should have a pack of healthy seeds. - Source: Internet Pour out some of the grass seed and give it a good visual check. Grass seed that has gone bad will often start to visibly discolor. You may see what looks like white dust or greenish damp patches – this is fungi and mildew. Seed that clumps together is also more than likely no longer viable. - Source: Internet Seed moisture content. An internal seed moisture level of 10 to 20 percent is ideal for most seeds, though this depends on the species. Seeds that lose moisture and fall below this level, or absorb humidity to higher levels, are likely to die. Normally, it is rare for seeds to fall below their optimum internal moisture levels, but they can easily absorb too much moisture when surrounding conditions are humid. - Source: Internet GBW Grass Seed Best budget grass seed View offer Slide 1 of 0 Description Are you looking for results on a budget?

Do your best to seal the bag and prevent it from getting moldy, humid, or dirty. You can use the expired seeds, but remember that they’re much less effective and likely won’t germinate at the same rate as brand-new, unopened grass seed bags. - Source: Internet You might have purchased the best seeds and checked the date twice before buying. There are still chances that the seeds may not work properly after a year. The bag might have been tightly sealed, and the planting directions may have been given. In such cases, it can get very frustrating. - Source: Internet It’s not quite as simple as stamping an expiry date on a bag of seed. You can still get results from a bag of grass seed for many years, but the actual “expiry date” depends on how well you store your seed. It’s impossible to provide an exact estimation of how much less viable a seed mix can become over time, but seed stored in a typical residential garage could lose as much as 10% germination each year. - Source: Internet If there are several seeds that sink and more that float, the bag is mostly expired. That being said, you can still use expired grass seeds. We’ll cover more details about what you can do with the seeds that won’t germinate later in the article.

These will be available at any local nursery or plant store. It usually includes warm season <strong>grass</strong>es if you live on the southern side of the US. Cool season <strong>grass</strong>es are prevalent on the northern side and generally grow in every place there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It is better to spend a little extra to ensure that you buy a high-quality bag of <strong>seed</strong>s. Why? Because it works well and can be stored for a longer period. The leftover <strong>seed</strong>s need to be sealed properly and stored. So, it is best to keep them in any dark and cool cupboards with good airflow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To know if <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> is still good, you can place the <strong>seed</strong>s in a cup of water and test if they float. If they rise to the top after a few minutes, they’re likely not good. Those that sink are still in good shape and will likely germinate. This test is free and easy, so why not give it a try? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Keep <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong>s in a cool, dry place, with proper air circulation. The temperature needs to remain between 40-50 F (4-10 C). Do not store <strong>seed</strong>s in a garage or shed where temperature can go below 32 F (0 C). Also, keep the bags off the floor where mice can’t reach them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now you need to make sure that the <strong>seed</strong>s do not dry out at any point. Do not cover them up with straws that might lead to the growth of weed, which you do not need. On the other hand, cover the top with a layer of soil. This thin layer will keep the <strong>seed</strong>s hydrated and will provide a warm and moist environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Seeds that date back to 2-3 years can also be used if they have been stored well. If you are using old <strong>seed</strong>s, try out with a few to see if they germinate. Then only plant the rest of them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grass <strong>seed</strong>s need a good and healthy start to begin the process of germination. We suggest that you should water the <strong>seed</strong>s daily twice a day in the beginning. Continue doing this till germination and make sure that the topsoil is always moist. But remember not to apply excess water at one time. This would only lead to waterlogging, and that could be fatal for the <strong>seed</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>grass</strong> you select for your yard affects how long your <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> lasts. According to Oregon State University , studies show that 50% of <strong>seed</strong>s from Kentucky blue<strong>grass</strong>, perennial rye<strong>grass</strong> , and tall fescue <strong>seed</strong>s can germinate after three to five years of storage. These rates apply for creeping bent<strong>grass</strong> even after five years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Place a few <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong>s in one cup of room temperature water. Wait 15 minutes to give the <strong>seed</strong>s some time to soak up the moisture. Floating <strong>seed</strong>s won’t germinate, but those that sank will still sprout. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As for that leftover <strong>seed</strong>, make sure you seal the bag properly. Once sealed, store it in a cool, dark, and dry place with good airflow around the bag. Do this and it should be good for a couple of years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yes, the <strong>grass</strong> needs to get water regularly in order to grow well. But too much of it may destroy them. Make sure that water does not flood the area, or it does not settle on the surface. That would mean the <strong>seed</strong>s rotting or decaying away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To deal with such cases, it is best to opt for <strong>seed</strong>s of different variants that can grow in the shade. We would suggest that you first try out with a handful of <strong>seed</strong>s to see if they grow. If the <strong>seed</strong>s germinate, buy the same variant otherwise try out something else. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ideal storage temperatures for most <strong>seed</strong>s are above freezing but under 60 degrees F. Temperature above 100 degrees can badly affect <strong>seed</strong> viability. Storage humidity. If <strong>seed</strong>s are stored in cloth sacks or open containers, their moisture levels are subject to change. In humid climates, they may absorb humidity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Spread a damp paper towel on a plane surface. Now, place 10-12 <strong>seed</strong>s in a row and roll the sheet. Put it in a zipped plastic bag, and keep it in a warm place for one week. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Always elevate your <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> bags off the floor. If you have sturdy shelving, this is ideal. If not, you can create a makeshift low shelf with a few piled bricks and a thick piece of wood or even an unused plastic tub and put your <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> bags in that. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Also, check for the date which will be printed on the pack. It is best to avoid <strong>seed</strong>s that have been on the shelf for a long time. There is a chance that they might not grow as expected. So, always look for the latest date and choose that. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Perennial Rye<strong>grass</strong> and Kentucky Blue<strong>grass</strong> are popular all-purpose choices. This popularity is partially because they are hardy in zones 3 – 9. They also have a longer shelf-life than some other <strong>grass</strong>es, so if you’re shopping at the box store you’re more likely to get <strong>seed</strong> that will germinate well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grass <strong>seed</strong> lasts two to three years in an open bag if your roll it up and seal it as much as possible. If the bag is open to the elements, there’s a high chance it’ll get covered in moisture and mold. Expired <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> can be used, but it’s usually only about 10% as effective as it should be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=10><li>MOOWY Power Lawn Best <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> for hard-wearing results View offer Slide 1 of 0 Description The trick to this is to add these power lawn <strong>seed</strong>s to some fresh topsoil and then watch as your &mldr; read more Slide 1 of 1 View offer - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Fall is just around the corner, which means so is the best time to complete your lawn <strong>seed</strong>ing project. You may have a bag of <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> in your garage from last year. Is it still viable? You can check the bag for an expiration date, or you can read more about what you need to know about <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> storage and some simple steps to determine if it’s still viable*: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While <strong>seed</strong> needs water to germinate, too much of a good thing will severely hinder growth. For best results, plant <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> after the majority of the spring downpours have ended. Gently water the <strong>seed</strong>ed areas the right way for best results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There is a huge variety of <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong>s available to buy nowadays and it can be a little overwhelming. Even though all <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> do relatively the same job, it all depends on how much money you want to spend and the size of the area that you want to cover. Although it doesn&rsquo;t really matter, experts say that you should pay attention to the label when buying <strong>seed</strong> and look for the lower amount of weed <strong>seed</strong>, crop <strong>seed</strong>, and inert matter, the better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What kind of area do you live in? Do you have a sandy backyard or your soil mostly consists of heavy clay? Answering these questions will help you figure out what kind of <strong>seed</strong>s you need. Every <strong>seed</strong> does not thrive in every kind of soil. In fact, you can have a different kind of <strong>grass</strong> from your neighbor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You may be purchasing extra <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong>s and may have to store it away for the winter. For this, it is best to select a bag with a mesh. This will allow air to flow through it while the mesh keeps insects away. Insects and rodents can be very detrimental for your <strong>seed</strong>s, and they can eat away all of it throughout the winter if not protected well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=5><li>RUNADI Grass Lawn Seed Best <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> for fast results View offer Slide 1 of 0 Description If you are looking for quick results, the RUNADI Grass Lawn Seed will do the job quick.

Now, if that date has passed, it is best to throw away the container. If the date is close by or you bought the packets a year ago, it is best to test them first. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Moisture is something that can bring down the <strong>seed</strong>’s productivity or destroy it completely. So, make sure that you never buy open <strong>seed</strong> bags from shops. While moisture helps <strong>seed</strong>s germinate, that happens once you plant them. Otherwise, it can spoil the <strong>seed</strong>s and create pathogens. These pathogens break the <strong>seed</strong>s down, and they slowly decay with time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I share this story because one of the most commonly asked questions here at Nature’s Finest Seed has to do with storage. Sometimes after planting a new lawn or over<strong>seed</strong>ing an existing lawn it’s normal to have some leftover <strong>seed</strong>. Instead of throwing it away or scattering it over your lawn, keep it for later use. Leftover <strong>seed</strong> can come in handy for filling in bare or thin spots in the future. It’s also great for quick repairs after sprinkler work or lawn damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After that, remove the bag and count how many <strong>seed</strong>s germinated. If 6-8 <strong>seed</strong>s sprout, it means they have a 60-80 percent germination rate. In case 4 or fewer <strong>seed</strong>s germinate, then the rate is 50 percent or lower, and you need to acquire fresh <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Put the damp paper towel with the <strong>seed</strong>s into a Ziploc bag. Put the bag in a warm area, such as your kitchen window or on top of your refrigerator. Wait 10 days to see if any <strong>seed</strong>s sprouted. If five or more <strong>seed</strong>s germinated, then the <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> will work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grass <strong>seed</strong> can go bad in the bag from becoming stale, humid, or too dry. The <strong>seed</strong>s will eventually crack or get moldy, so it’s important to rotate the bags and use them within a few years of purchasing them. The good news is that many <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong>s can last well beyond the predicted expiration date. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Many people begin gardening not only as a means to grow healthy and nutritious fruits and vegetables, but to also save money. Growing a crop of your favorite vegetables can be an absolute delight, as can herbs and flowers for the garden. However, each season, growers with limited space may find themselves left with unused garden <strong>seed</strong>s. In many cases, these <strong>seed</strong>s are stored away for safekeeping, slowly accumulating with what many the gardening community refer to as a “<strong>seed</strong> stash.” So are old <strong>seed</strong>s still good for planting or is it better to acquire more? Read on to find out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Even if you’ve taken great care over your bag of <strong>seed</strong> over 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, with each passing year fewer <strong>seed</strong>s will germinate. This means that your coverage rate will go down significantly compared with a fresh mix. So, you’ll need more <strong>seed</strong>s to cover less area. That being said, over<strong>seed</strong>ing with old <strong>seed</strong> will not have any damaging affect on your lawn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best storage conditions for <strong>seed</strong> packets require a dark, dry, and cool location. For this reason, many growers choose to store plant <strong>seed</strong>s in airtight jars in places such as refrigerators or in cellars or basements. Many may also add rice grains to the jars to discourage the presence of moisture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Two variants of <strong>grass</strong> are most popular – Kentucky Rye<strong>grass</strong> and Perennial Rye<strong>grass</strong>. They are popular because these grow well in zones 3-9. They also have an extensive shelf life and can remain alive longer than most other <strong>grass</strong>es. Plus, you can purchase them from your local supermarkets as well as nurseries. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The viability of stored <strong>seed</strong>s of any kind are greatly influenced by storage conditions, and unfortunately, the ideal conditions for <strong>seed</strong> storage are very often exactly the opposite of how homeowners store <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong>. In general, <strong>seed</strong>s will maintain their viability longest if stored in cool, dry conditions—which is not the condition typical in most garages and sheds. The factors influencing <strong>seed</strong> viability include: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Look for discoloration and any fungi growth on the body. These are initial signs of decaying <strong>seed</strong>s. Also, check if they have become damp and are sticking to each other. That could also be another sign of damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Secondly, pay attention to how the <strong>seed</strong> packets have been stored. Ideally, they need to be kept upright with some space around them. This is needed for airflow, which keeps the <strong>seed</strong>s in perfect condition. If the packets are kept on top of each other with no space for airflow, they may again start catching moisture. This will prevent them from germinating well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Keep the <strong>seed</strong>s in a cellar or basement, as long as it is dry and cool. You can also refrigerate them as well. However, don’t forget to place an open box of baking soda or a commercial desiccant. It helps in soaking up the excess moisture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If the storage temperature is cold, and relative humidity (RH) is dry, then <strong>seed</strong>s will be viable for long. Refrigerate them, in airtight containers, or keep at the coolest location in your home. If you store the <strong>seed</strong>s as per the instructions on the label, then they’ll stay viable for up to five years! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Storage conditions do have a major influence of the long-term viability of stored <strong>seed</strong>. Storing your <strong>seed</strong> outside in a shed, or garage is not ideal due to the exposure to heat and humidity. Instead, try storing your <strong>seed</strong> indoors in a cool, dry area, to extend your purchase’s shelf life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I use Jonathan Green <strong>seed</strong> which I buy directly from the manufacturer. I find this gets me the freshest, best-quality <strong>seed</strong>. This one is my go-to and I highly recommend it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most varieties of <strong>grass</strong> require at least 3 hours of sunlight daily to germinate. Areas receiving less than this amount might be more conducive to low sunlight ground covers if <strong>grass</strong> refuses to grow. You could also try to lay sod yourself with a <strong>grass</strong> type that thrives in shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The viability of <strong>seed</strong>s depends on storage conditions. Seeds can remain viable for a more extended period if appropriately stored in a cool and dry place. The factors that affect <strong>seed</strong> viability are: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Note: If you think your <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> is bad because it’s not growing in your yard, make sure you’ve chosen the right <strong>grass</strong> for the season. There are dozens of warm-weather and cold-weather <strong>grass</strong>es that don’t grow well in certain environments. Knowing which <strong>grass</strong> you’re planting is crucial to its success! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you look on the back of your <strong>seed</strong> packet, there should be some type of dated information, at least with most reputable sources. For example, it may have a “packed for” date, which is typically when the <strong>seed</strong>s were packed, not necessarily when they were harvested. As with many items you find at the grocery store, you may have “sell by” or “best by” date, which normally indicates the end of the year those <strong>seed</strong>s were packed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To properly store <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong>, first make sure it’s placed in the right kind of packaging. Breathable packaging is best, such as a cloth sack or burlap bag. Breathable materials will allow good air flow and reduce the risk of molding. However, if you have a full unopened bag of <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> it’s best to leave it unopened in the original packaging. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cold weather will hinder <strong>seed</strong> growth. For <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> to germinate, the soil temperature must be at least 55 degrees, and the air temperature should be consistently at 60 degrees or higher. If you plant your <strong>seed</strong> too early in the spring, it will sit on top of the soil and not germinate. By the time the weather warms up, many of the <strong>seed</strong>s are damaged and won’t sprout, leaving your new growth sparse and patchy. I always say that when you think it’s time to spread <strong>seed</strong> in the spring … wait 10 days to be sure you don’t waste your <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So, it would help if you were careful about the time of the year when you plant them. If they are planted too early, the <strong>seed</strong>s will not germinate and sit on the ground. This will not necessarily kill all the <strong>seed</strong>s, but many could be damaged by the time the temperature rises. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cold weather can stop the growth of <strong>grass</strong> completely. Grass generally needs at least a soil temperature of 55 degrees to begin growing. Anything colder than that can prevent growth altogether. The air temperature needs to be at 60 degrees consistently. A higher temperature will not be a problem, but a lower one will be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Maybe you’ve had this experience. You go to the big box store and stare at several different kinds of <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong>. The more you look, the more confused you get. How do you know which type to buy when there’s no one to ask? When you do buy, you might buy too much <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong>, and now you are wondering if it’s going to last until next season. Does <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> go bad? The answer is that it can … the shelf life of <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> depends on many factors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Adding on, if you had been planning to store <strong>seed</strong>s, it is best to choose the best of the lot at any store. Purchase <strong>seed</strong>s that have a far expiration date and these should last long. Also, pick up high-quality <strong>seed</strong>s as they will again stay potent for a longer time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>According to SF Gate, an unopened bag of <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> can last three or more years. Some brands claim to last up to five years, which could provide quite a reliable supply of <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> for the incoming years. Grass <strong>seed</strong>s can last longer if they’re kept in a cool, dry space without too much sunshine, rain, humidity, and debris. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While some may wonder whether or not it is safe to plant <strong>seed</strong>s that have passed their expiration dates, we know that planting expired <strong>seed</strong>s will not impact the outcome of the final plant grown from that <strong>seed</strong>. So, will expired <strong>seed</strong>s grow? Yes. Plants grown from expired <strong>seed</strong> packets will grow to produce healthy and fruitful harvests, just as their younger counterparts. With this in mind, one may be left to wonder then, when do old <strong>seed</strong>s expire? More importantly, why do we need <strong>seed</strong> expiration dates? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can also add some natural desiccant to absorb excess humidity. If you have the little desiccant packages that are sealed, you can place those into any opened <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> bags. If your <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> bag is sealed, place the desiccant packages nearby. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>General purpose - for use on lawns that have a mix of everything going on. General-purpose <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> mixes grow well in most soils and grow fairly quickly, especially in spring and autumn. They’re also the best option if your lawn gets both sun and shade during the day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you have expired <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong>, you can plant it or toss it into a compost bin. Expired <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> still contains a few essential components for fertilizer once it breaks down. It’s unlikely to germinate, but it works for patchy areas and over<strong>seed</strong>ing since most of them won’t grow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So let’s look at the absolute ideal scenario. An unopened bag of <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> that’s kept in ideal storage conditions can last up to 5 years. In comparison, an open bag usually lasts around 18 months according to an Oregon State University study. Grass <strong>seed</strong>s that grow in hardiness zones 3–9 can last up to 5 years if it’s grown in the absolute best conditions. Common <strong>grass</strong> verities on the other hand can last up to 3 years in storage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A hot, humid garage is, unfortunately, one of the worst places to store <strong>seed</strong>. Grass <strong>seed</strong> is best stored in a dry space, in temperatures ranging from 32ºF to 60ºF. If you have space, the absolute best way to store <strong>seed</strong> is in a sealed container in the refrigerator until you’re ready to use it. If you don’t have refrigeration space, keep your <strong>seed</strong> stored in a container and try to use it as soon as possible after purchase. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Use old <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong>s for re<strong>seed</strong>ing or top <strong>seed</strong>ing, but do not expect a high germination rate as compared to the fresh turf<strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong>s. Store new <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong>s in a tightly sealed plastic bag or container, so they cannot soak moisture. This increases the viability of <strong>seed</strong>s. Also, keep the <strong>seed</strong>s away from hot shed or garage and store them in a cool and dry place, indoors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You want the location to have some natural ventilation and circulation. You also want to be sure it won’t freeze, which will kill the <strong>seed</strong>s. A temperature range of between 40 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit is ideal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Our top pick is that the Miracle-Gro EverGreen Complete 4in1. It is the best overall <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> on the market. Not only is it excellent value for money but it gives fantastic results, and the variety of what this product does makes it our top choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At Manderley, we test our <strong>seed</strong> yearly to ensure we are providing our customers with the best possible coverage, year after year. Did you know that Canada No. 1 Grade Seed only requires a 70% germination rate? Manderley PRO Grade and Less Water lines use only the highest quality <strong>seed</strong> which leave Canada No. 1 grade in their dust! That means you get the best <strong>seed</strong>, without any filler, bringing you fuller and longer lasting results than the competition. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>: For the majority of <strong>seed</strong>s, the correct storage temperature is above freezing but below 60 F (15 C). Temperature above 100 F (37 C) can affect <strong>seed</strong>’s viability severely. Humidity: If you are storing <strong>seed</strong>s in open containers or cloth sacks, then there is a chance of change in the moisture content of <strong>seed</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Germination rates drop 10% to 20% per year. So, you might want to do a quick germination rate test after a couple of years. But if you’d rather not deal with germinating <strong>seed</strong>s, a local lawn <strong>seed</strong>ing company can help you get your yard in shape for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Whether you’re storing <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> in bulk or forgot about a bag you got a couple of years ago, you’re not alone. Many people prefer <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> over sod because it’s much more natural and affordable. However, leaving the bag open can invite mold and bacterial growth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Give your <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> the sniff test. Nothing says “mold” faster than a whiff of that telltale damp, <strong>grass</strong>y, musty, “dirty gym socks” odor. If your <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> doesn’t smell like <strong>seed</strong> anymore, there is a good chance it is no longer viable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>According to All Creatures Healthcare, &ldquo;The reason that <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong>s can be dangerous for dogs (or even cats) is that they can easily penetrate their outer skin in multiple areas. If left untreated, this can be incredibly painful – in worst-case scenarios, the internal damage it may cause can even be fatal&rdquo;. Therefore use this product with care. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong>s need direct exposure to sunlight to grow well. They need to be placed under the sun for at least 3 hours every day. This would lead to good growth. However, if your <strong>seed</strong>s are planted in the shade, they may refuse to grow well or may take a lot of time to germinate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The cooler the storage temperature and the dryer the relative humidity (RH), the longer your <strong>seed</strong>s will remain viable. Seeds stored in a sealed container in a refrigerator usually enjoy the best longevity. If this isn&rsquo;t practical, seek out the coolest location in your home. Stored with this kind of care, your <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> may remain viable for as long as five years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Seed moisture content : The necessary internal moisture content is 10-20 percent for most <strong>seed</strong>s. When exposed to moisture below this level or high humidity, they have a chance of dying. Generally, <strong>seed</strong>s do not go below their optimal internal moisture levels. The surrounding humid conditions influence them and they absorb extra moisture from the atmosphere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>By high quality, we mean <strong>seed</strong>s that have less than 0.5% weed. Also, the chaff or dirt present in the pack should be less than 2%. The presence of other crops should also not be more than 2%. If the <strong>seed</strong>s meet these criteria, then you should have a pack of healthy <strong>seed</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pour out some of the <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> and give it a good visual check. Grass <strong>seed</strong> that has gone bad will often start to visibly discolor. You may see what looks like white dust or greenish damp patches – this is fungi and mildew. Seed that clumps together is also more than likely no longer viable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Seed moisture content. An internal <strong>seed</strong> moisture level of 10 to 20 percent is ideal for most <strong>seed</strong>s, though this depends on the species. Seeds that lose moisture and fall below this level, or absorb humidity to higher levels, are likely to die. Normally, it is rare for <strong>seed</strong>s to fall below their optimum internal moisture levels, but they can easily absorb too much moisture when surrounding conditions are humid. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=11><li>GBW Grass Seed Best budget <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> View offer Slide 1 of 0 Description Are you looking for results on a budget?

If you are planting it in the spring, ensure that you do it after heavy downpours are over before planting them. Water your <strong>seed</strong>s lightly every day, and that should provide them with enough to grow well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Just because you accidentally left the <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> bag open for a couple of months doesn’t mean it’s expired. Do your best to seal the bag and prevent it from getting moldy, humid, or dirty. You can use the expired <strong>seed</strong>s, but remember that they’re much less effective and likely won’t germinate at the same rate as brand-new, unopened <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> bags. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You might have purchased the best <strong>seed</strong>s and checked the date twice before buying. There are still chances that the <strong>seed</strong>s may not work properly after a year. The bag might have been tightly sealed, and the planting directions may have been given. In such cases, it can get very frustrating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s not quite as simple as stamping an expiry date on a bag of <strong>seed</strong>. You can still get results from a bag of <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> for many years, but the actual “expiry date” depends on how well you store your <strong>seed</strong>. It’s impossible to provide an exact estimation of how much less viable a <strong>seed</strong> mix can become over time, but <strong>seed</strong> stored in a typical residential garage could lose as much as 10% germination each year. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If there are several <strong>seed</strong>s that sink and more that float, the bag is mostly expired. That being said, you can still use expired <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong>s. We’ll cover more details about what you can do with the <strong>seed</strong>s that won’t germinate later in the article. For now, you can try this test to figure out what condition the opened <strong>seed</strong>s are in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The short answer is yes; <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong>s can expire. Like most products, you will see a use-by date on the packaging. It&rsquo;s also good to note that the older it gets, the less chance the <strong>seed</strong>s will germinate, especially if your pack isn&rsquo;t stored correctly. So for best results, use fresh <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Even if the germination rate is 50% or less, you can compensate by sprinkling more <strong>seed</strong>. You might want to keep older <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> for over<strong>seed</strong>ing projects , where it’s not a disaster if some <strong>seed</strong>s don’t sprout. Talk to a landscaping company near you for help over<strong>seed</strong>ing your lawn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best way to dispose of expired <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> is to throw it into the yard waste bin. It decomposes, so there’s no point in throwing it into the dumpster or recycling bin. Squirrels, raccoons, and many other animals eat <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong>s, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Can <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> go bad? The short answer is yes. If you spot excess moisture, mildew, or fungi, toss the <strong>seed</strong>. But, if you’re not sure, test the <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> before you get rid of it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When stored under these ideal conditions, <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> should last between 10-18 months from the testing date without a significant decrease in the germination rate. After this time the <strong>seed</strong> can still be used, but each year after that will see the germination rate drop. Most sources report a 10-20% decrease for every year <strong>grass</strong> <strong>seed</strong> is stored. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/warzone-charity.jpg?w=800" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Does Grass Seed Have A Sell By Date - Will Expired Seeds Still Grow: Planting With Expired Seed Packets">
