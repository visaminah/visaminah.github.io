Instead, bring in the safe-bet shades to make your new neutrals pop even more dramatically. A traditional white mantle or glossy white trim highlights the color of your walls, plus it calls attention to the fact that you thought outside the white-and-gray box. - Source: Internet “The key to selecting the right gray is to focus more on the undertone of the color and the lighting in the space rather than the chip itself,” says Cyndy Aldred, the blogger behind The Creativity Exchange. “In darker rooms, grays take on a warmer tone and transform the atmosphere.” She also notes that if a room has an abundance of artificial lighting, gray walls can shift and appear green to the eye. - Source: Internet If you plan on selling in the next 2+ years, want to paint NOW, and don’t plan on repainting before you sell, don’t paint your walls gray. By the time you list your home, the world will be THAT MUCH CLOSER to the warmer end of things and gray will make your home look dated compared to more UPDATED homes on the market – gray is NOT timeless or trend-proof. Instead, choose a warmer neutral that suits the finishes in your home (hopefully) or at the very least, find your home’s best white. - Source: Internet Remember the all-gray, all the time look? That is what is dated. A trend is a trend usually because it is used and seen way too much. Fickle us, at some point we get bored with the color of the decade and want to move on to something new that we will probably overdo. - Source: Internet Flooring-wise, light toned woods are here to stay. Dark woods and gray woods are definitely on the way out. Look for light, natural warm toned woods. - Source: Internet HECK YES. As mentioned earlier, if you want to use gray in your home, warm gray will have more longevity than cool gray (as long as it suits the finishes in your space). The exception is the DARKER end of the cool gray range, including some of the popular grays with blue undertones, these are still kickin’ it as cabinets and feature walls. - Source: Internet Is gray paint going out of style in 2021? Homeowners are still choosing gray paint for their walls. Griege is surging to bring warmth to rooms. Designers are moving to off-white, sand and mushroom like colors. - Source: Internet A tried and true favorite, both Aldred and Wadden love Repose Gray by Sherwin-Williams. This reliable and ever-popular favorite gets top marks for versatility. “I love Repose Gray because it’s a true, neutral gray that has always been a top seller,” Wadden says. “It pairs well with textures and finishes, making it the perfect blank canvas for any space.” - Source: Internet In areas with lots of wood elements, tread carefully when choosing light gray paint colors with greenish notes. “Be mindful of the other aspects of the room, such as furniture, cabinets, and flooring,” Wadden says. “The green undertones in gray look very prominent when paired with wood.” - Source: Internet However, it was not lamb but mutton. Although there is a huge difference between lamb and mutton there is a very faint flavor that I just can’t get past. No matter how delicious lollipop lamb chops are I am forever scared! The same goes for the color gray! - Source: Internet Houston-based designer Mary Patton puts the dark gray paint color Plummett by Farrow and Ball on the top of her list. “It’s a soft, soothing dark gray,” she says. “It works beautifully on cabinets, in bedrooms, or in living spaces. If you want something a little lighter, it also looks great cut by 50% with white.” - Source: Internet If your walls are already gray and you’re selling soon – don’t worry, it’s all good. Gray is still popular enough that your home won’t look outdated. However, if you have a room or two that need freshening up, I suggest transitioning into a more modest neutral or at least a good white paint colour. - Source: Internet Sara Barney of Austin, Texas-based BANDD Design chose Anonymous by Sherwin-Williams as her go-to gray paint color. “I love this shade of gray because it adds the perfect touch of color while also keeping the room bright and sleek,” she says. “We wanted to keep this kitchen neutral for the most part since we incorporated copper statement pieces throughout. This color was a perfect option to keep it looking fresh and modern.” - Source: Internet Gray Owl by Benjamin Moore gets the vote of interior designer Ariel Okin, based in New York City. “Gray Owl is a beautiful true gray through and through. It’s not too green and not too blue, and it hits the right balance between warm and cool,” she says. “I particularly like it in bedrooms for a clean and monochromatic palette of creams and grays.” - Source: Internet But if you’re reading this blog post, something tells me that you’re a bit worried about doing so (or you’re just here for my charm and wit, which is cool too). I’m just here to give you some well-intentioned advice that’s geared almost ENTIRELY towards RESALE. If you plan on living in your home forever and ever OR long enough that previous trends are irrelevant and your whole home will need updating anyway, then don’t worry – DO WHAT YOU LOVE, it’s your home! In fact, I’ll TELL you which grays are the most beautiful! - Source: Internet Because more and more often, my Online Paint Colour Consulting clients are looking for white cabinets or at the very LEAST, warm greige, taupe and cream cabinets (which make me INTENSELY nervous for the same ‘trend-based’ reasons). And what my E-design clients are looking for is what many of your future house buyers will be looking for in an updated home – again, gray is not timeless or trend-proof. THE SCALE HAS TIPPED, WE’VE REACH THE TOP AND HAVE ALREADY STARTED DOWN THE HILL. That’s right, gray is slowly on its way out whether you’re happy to hear it or not. - Source: Internet Blanched Thyme is described as “calming and nourishing,” encouraging “a calm balance within yourself and within your home.” This is another shade that would make one of the best kitchen paint colors for a kitchen island or cabinets. See Jean Stoffer’s kitchens, below, for some great ways to incorporate organic green colors on kitchen cabinets and kitchen walls. - Source: Internet That’s right, I have gray cabinets and I desperately LOVE them and don’t regret them. When we remodelled our home four years ago, I knew I wanted gray cabinets so I CHOSE gray cabinets. However, here are a few things to consider… - Source: Internet To sample paint like a pro, Wadden suggests painting a 3-foot square in the space. “Look at it at different times of the day and in different lighting,” she says. “The various tones emerge depending on the light.” With the right color temperature and undertones, gray paint colors can make a gorgeous backdrop for any room. - Source: Internet For a more unconventional option, Wadden suggests a blue-toned gray called Mantra for its calming qualities. A new color from Sherwin-Williams, this gray paint offers relaxing, cool undertones. “Mantra is an ethereal blue-gray that’s reminiscent of a soft, efflorescent sky,” she says. “It relaxes me just by thinking about it!” - Source: Internet Wadden selected this color as a favorite, too, stating that Agreeable Gray is Sherwin-Williams’s most popular color. “It’s the perfect hue for any living space, whether it be a family room or bedroom, as it acts as a neutral backdrop,” she says. “This gray is less cool than others, which bodes well for the resurgence of warmer hues and beiges that we’re seeing.” - Source: Internet IF YOU’VE ALREADY PAINTED YOUR WALLS GRAY. Remember, painting a room is one of the least expensive updates. If you’ve painted your whole home gray and down the road, need/want to make a change, even changing a FEW ROOMS can give your home the shift it needs. - Source: Internet Krissy Peterson, an interior designer based in Redmond, Washington, believes that Classic Gray by Benjamin Moore is the perfect neutral. “Classic Gray is one of those amazing colors that adapts to its surroundings, which makes it really transitional,” she says. “I love that it doesn’t have undertones that can turn it too purple or pink. It’s a great basic gray that can go a little greige to coordinate with warmer colors.” - Source: Internet Before you hit panic mode, recognize that “more creative hues” don’t have to mean a full-on commitment to electric teal or zippy chartreuse (though power to you if that’s your thing). Instead, we’re all about embracing neutrals in fresh ways: Think bypassing standard whites and grays for dialed-down versions of your favorite colors. Going all-out with easygoing shades of blue, green, pink, or even purple, rather than playing it safe with white or gray, gives your rooms dimension and allows your personality to shine through. Here are three dos and don’ts for ditching white and gray and using your favorite color as a neutral. - Source: Internet After a long search for the perfect fit, Oregon-based designer Molly Kidd of Light and Dwell chose Naturel by Sherwin-Williams for her own kitchen cabinetry. “This one has all the things I love in a gray,” she says. “It’s soothing, not too blue or too taupe, and it brings warmth to the space.” - Source: Internet I have pretty strong feelings when it comes to wine, Cornuts, Ryan Reynolds and trends. If you LOVE gray and have ALWAYS loved gray, regardless of whether it’s trendy or not – paint your walls gray. If your home ONLY SUITS gray and no other colour – paint your walls gray. However, keep this one magical word in mind… - Source: Internet Chicago-based interior designer Jean Stoffer turned to Benjamin Moore’s statement color Englewood Cliffs when creating a sitting room for her clients. Stoffer says it was the ideal choice to coordinate with the new decor and to offer a respite from the open-concept kitchen, dining, and living space.“We love the depth and dimension that Englewood Cliffs paint adds to the space,” Stoffer says. “The undertones play nicely with the velvet emerald sofas and highlight our favorite antique brass details throughout the room. This gray creates beautiful movement and interest, which is why it’s one of our favorites!” - Source: Internet Look at BM Rodeo. It is a gray with green undertones. Just beautiful! The ever-popular Gray Owl is a soft gray with soft yellow undertones. Another BM favorite, Classic Gray is a gray that reads off white with soft pink undertones. And so does BM Cloud Cover. - Source: Internet Interior designer Becky Shea of New York City says Silver Chain by Benjamin Moore is one of her top gray paint recommendations for clients. “We selected it for this bedroom because it’s light and airy during daytime hours and then warm and cozy in the evening,” she says. “Anytime we step foot into this room, it makes us feel good. You take a deep breath, look out at the Hudson River, everything pauses, and you feel at peace.” - Source: Internet HOW-ever, try to incorporate other colors with gray. Lots of white, a taddy bit of black, moody blues, warm greens, browns, and greige (love), soft beiges, or bright complimentary colors. No wonder gold tones are back. Gray and gold are just so gorgeous together! - Source: Internet ‘It has a magical effect when used on the ceiling by visually melting it away and connecting with the sky itself. Bring the colour down on to the walls by about 20-30cm too to enhance the feeling of airy summer freshness.’ - Source: Internet If you’re designing a space around existing furniture and flooring materials, remember that these elements can also draw out hidden colors. To ensure a successful result, coordinate gray paint undertones to your interior finishings, suggests Sue Wadden, director of color marketing at Sherwin-Williams. “It’s important to consider whether the decor in the room is mostly warm or cool, and match the undertones accordingly,” she says. - Source: Internet ‘In the bedroom olive green can help to create a serene environment,’ says Charlotte Cosby, head of creative at Farrow \u0026 Ball. ‘lt’s also suited to rooms that overlook nature. The colours from the great outdoors will further enhance the green tones of the walls and create a relaxing outdoor feel in your home.’ - Source: Internet Just look at the image above. The gray in this room looks alive and anything but boring. Gray when mixed with other colors looks rich! - Source: Internet I think one of the biggest reasons gray has been so hugely popular is because of bloggers who post on Pinterest and Instagram. They certainly have a big influence on the decor world now. And many bloggers LOVE LOVE LOVE gray! - Source: Internet To make the gray paint selection process easier, consider your paint’s undertones and test the shade before committing. Undertones are the warm or cool colors added to paint to provide complexity and nuance. While they might not jump out at you initially, they often make a surprise appearance on the wall. - Source: Internet Paint colours play such a huge role in how we live within our homes. The colours we thoughtfully select for our walls serves as the backdrop to our everyday lives, which has never been more important than right now. More than purely decorative, colour is highly emotive meaning it can change how we feel in our own personal sanctuary, which is key to making a house feel like a home. - Source: Internet I know not all grays are like the violet/gray I first encountered but for me, gray is often cold and hard to live with. I know all you gray lovers will tell me that there are gorgeous grays on the market and you are so right. But gray, like the color white, is hard to get right! - Source: Internet The simplest way to explain greige is to say it is a mix of gray and beige. Paints like SW Agreeable Gray, Behr Toasty Gray, Benjamin Moore Edgecomb Gray, and SW Dorian Gray are all examples of gorgeous grays. They are toasty and so full of warm brown undertones. - Source: Internet The eighties had a love affair with mauves and blues and peaches (remember those colors?). The nineties loved the warmth of Tuscan colors, golds, terracotta, and sun-drenched French provincial hues. Then came the brown craze and the stainless steel craze and then finally the last decade has been all about gray and white! - Source: Internet Secondary rooms such as bedrooms, bathrooms and family rooms are great places to add a colour you love without committing to it on such a large scale that you have an ENTIRELY GRAY HOME. Basically, any room that isn’t in an open layout could be painted gray as it will be easy enough to repaint it down the road if needed. The KEY is to keep your hallways and open layout areas a colour that is moving FORWARD with the trends, rather than backwards. - Source: Internet IF YOU’VE ALREADY PAINTED YOUR CABINETS GRAY. Don’t worry. Would it be best if your cabinets weren’t gray? Yup, but it’s okay if you’re selling in the next two years or so. Will there be people who don’t like them? Sure, but there’s no product that’s totally fool-proof. Those who don’t like particular finishes will simply accommodate them in their future redecorating plans (but this CAN affect the offer they give you). - Source: Internet Use your walls like a landscape of surrounding lush forestry. Whether you live in the country or aspire to call it home, painting walls in lush green is a step closer to feeling at one with nature. All of the paint experts are in agreement that are homes will be embracing green more than ever next year. - Source: Internet You may think of gray paints as an easy option for the exterior or interior home, but the shade is more complex than you may think. A number of beautiful undertones, there are so many gray paint shades to consider when embarking on your next painting project. With neutrals being among the top paint colours in 2022, gray paints is very popular with homeowners looking to improve their curb appeal or refresh their homes. - Source: Internet Well, when it comes to exterior finishes like roofing, brick and stonework, gray is often the BEST COLOUR to suit these finishes. When the exterior of a home is well-coordinated, it will last longer. Exterior finishes also tend to have a longer lifespan in the trend world whereas interior finishes get a GOOD five to ten years…if they’re lucky. - Source: Internet Downpipe by Ball and Farrow is medium charcoal with blue undertones and Curbside is warmed-up charcoal by Magnolia Home. I love BM Kendell Charcoal because of its green undertones. I tend to love what green does to gray. And this rich warm charcoal from Behr called Carbon is a winner in my book! - Source: Internet Greet your guests with sophisticated style by combining hues from the same family. By using different blue tones on the walls, table, and accents, you can make a modern style statement the instant your guests step inside. Tour the rest of this home Photo: Laurey W.

Instead, bring in the safe-bet shades to make your new neutrals pop even more dramatically. A traditional white mantle or glossy white trim highlights the color of your <strong>walls</strong>, plus it calls attention to the fact that you thought outside the white-and-<strong>gray</strong> box. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&ldquo;The key to selecting the right <strong>gray</strong> is to focus more on the undertone of the color and the lighting in the space rather than the chip itself,&rdquo; says Cyndy Aldred, the blogger behind The Creativity Exchange. &ldquo;In darker rooms, <strong>gray</strong>s take on a warmer tone and transform the atmosphere.&rdquo; She also notes that if a room has an abundance of artificial lighting, <strong>gray</strong> <strong>walls</strong> can shift and appear green to the eye. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you plan on selling in the next 2+ years, want to paint NOW, and don’t plan on repainting before you sell, don’t paint your <strong>walls</strong> <strong>gray</strong>. By the time you list your home, the world will be THAT MUCH CLOSER to the warmer end of things and <strong>gray</strong> will make your home look dated compared to more UPDATED homes on the market – <strong>gray</strong> is NOT timeless or trend-proof. Instead, choose a warmer neutral that suits the finishes in your home (hopefully) or at the very least, find your home’s best white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Remember the all-<strong>gray</strong>, all the time look? That is what is dated. A trend is a trend usually because it is used and seen way too much. Fickle us, at some point we get bored with the color of the decade and want to move on to something new that we will probably overdo. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Flooring-wise, light toned woods are here to stay. Dark woods and <strong>gray</strong> woods are definitely on the way out. Look for light, natural warm toned woods. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>HECK YES. As mentioned earlier, if you want to use <strong>gray</strong> in your home, warm <strong>gray</strong> will have more longevity than cool <strong>gray</strong> (as long as it suits the finishes in your space). The exception is the DARKER end of the cool <strong>gray</strong> range, including some of the popular <strong>gray</strong>s with blue undertones, these are still kickin’ it as cabinets and feature <strong>walls</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Is <strong>gray</strong> paint going out of style in 2021? Homeowners are still choosing <strong>gray</strong> paint for their <strong>walls</strong>. Griege is surging to bring warmth to rooms. Designers are moving to off-white, sand and mushroom like colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A tried and true favorite, both Aldred and Wadden love Repose Gray by Sherwin-Williams. This reliable and ever-popular favorite gets top marks for versatility. &ldquo;I love Repose Gray because it&rsquo;s a true, neutral <strong>gray</strong> that has always been a top seller,&rdquo; Wadden says. &ldquo;It pairs well with textures and finishes, making it the perfect blank canvas for any space.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In areas with lots of wood elements, tread carefully when choosing light <strong>gray</strong> paint colors with greenish notes. &ldquo;Be mindful of the other aspects of the room, such as furniture, cabinets, and flooring,&rdquo; Wadden says. &ldquo;The green undertones in <strong>gray</strong> look very prominent when paired with wood.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, it was not lamb but mutton. Although there is a huge difference between lamb and mutton there is a very faint flavor that I just can’t get past. No matter how delicious lollipop lamb chops are I am forever scared! The same goes for the color <strong>gray</strong>! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Houston-based designer Mary Patton puts the dark <strong>gray</strong> paint color Plummett by Farrow and Ball on the top of her list. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a soft, soothing dark <strong>gray</strong>,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It works beautifully on cabinets, in bedrooms, or in living spaces. If you want something a little lighter, it also looks great cut by 50% with white.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your <strong>walls</strong> are already <strong>gray</strong> and you’re selling soon – don’t worry, it’s all good. Gray is still popular enough that your home won’t look outdated. However, if you have a room or two that need freshening up, I suggest transitioning into a more modest neutral or at least a good white paint colour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sara Barney of Austin, Texas-based BANDD Design chose Anonymous by Sherwin-Williams as her go-to <strong>gray</strong> paint color. &ldquo;I love this shade of <strong>gray</strong> because it adds the perfect touch of color while also keeping the room bright and sleek,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;We wanted to keep this kitchen neutral for the most part since we incorporated copper statement pieces throughout. This color was a perfect option to keep it looking fresh and modern.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gray Owl by Benjamin Moore gets the vote of interior designer Ariel Okin, based in New York City. &ldquo;Gray Owl is a beautiful true <strong>gray</strong> through and through. It&rsquo;s not too green and not too blue, and it hits the right balance between warm and cool,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I particularly like it in bedrooms for a clean and monochromatic palette of creams and <strong>gray</strong>s.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But if you’re reading this blog post, something tells me that you’re a bit worried about doing so (or you’re just here for my charm and wit, which is cool too). I’m just here to give you some well-intentioned advice that’s geared almost ENTIRELY towards RESALE. If you plan on living in your home forever and ever OR long enough that previous trends are irrelevant and your whole home will need updating anyway, then don’t worry – DO WHAT YOU LOVE, it’s your home! In fact, I’ll TELL you which <strong>gray</strong>s are the most beautiful! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Because more and more often, my Online Paint Colour Consulting clients are looking for white cabinets or at the very LEAST, warm greige, taupe and cream cabinets (which make me INTENSELY nervous for the same ‘trend-based’ reasons). And what my E-design clients are looking for is what many of your future house buyers will be looking for in an updated home – again, <strong>gray</strong> is not timeless or trend-proof. THE SCALE HAS TIPPED, WE’VE REACH THE TOP AND HAVE ALREADY STARTED DOWN THE HILL. That’s right, <strong>gray</strong> is slowly on its way out whether you’re happy to hear it or not. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blanched Thyme is described as “calming and nourishing,” encouraging “a calm balance within yourself and within your home.” This is another shade that would make one of the best kitchen paint colors for a kitchen island or cabinets. See Jean Stoffer’s kitchens, below, for some great ways to incorporate organic green colors on kitchen cabinets and kitchen <strong>walls</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>That’s right, I have <strong>gray</strong> cabinets and I desperately LOVE them and don’t regret them. When we remodelled our home four years ago, I knew I wanted <strong>gray</strong> cabinets so I CHOSE <strong>gray</strong> cabinets. However, here are a few things to consider… - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To sample paint like a pro, Wadden suggests painting a 3-foot square in the space. &ldquo;Look at it at different times of the day and in different lighting,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The various tones emerge depending on the light.&rdquo; With the right color temperature and undertones, <strong>gray</strong> paint colors can make a gorgeous backdrop for any room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For a more unconventional option, Wadden suggests a blue-toned <strong>gray</strong> called Mantra for its calming qualities. A new color from Sherwin-Williams, this <strong>gray</strong> paint offers relaxing, cool undertones. &ldquo;Mantra is an ethereal blue-<strong>gray</strong> that&rsquo;s reminiscent of a soft, efflorescent sky,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It relaxes me just by thinking about it!&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wadden selected this color as a favorite, too, stating that Agreeable Gray is Sherwin-Williams&rsquo;s most popular color. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the perfect hue for any living space, whether it be a family room or bedroom, as it acts as a neutral backdrop,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;This <strong>gray</strong> is less cool than others, which bodes well for the resurgence of warmer hues and beiges that we&rsquo;re seeing.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>IF YOU’VE ALREADY PAINTED YOUR WALLS GRAY. Remember, painting a room is one of the least expensive updates. If you’ve painted your whole home <strong>gray</strong> and down the road, need/want to make a change, even changing a FEW ROOMS can give your home the shift it needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Krissy Peterson, an interior designer based in Redmond, Washington, believes that Classic Gray by Benjamin Moore is the perfect neutral. &ldquo;Classic Gray is one of those amazing colors that adapts to its surroundings, which makes it really transitional,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I love that it doesn&rsquo;t have undertones that can turn it too purple or pink. It&rsquo;s a great basic <strong>gray</strong> that can go a little greige to coordinate with warmer colors.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before you hit panic mode, recognize that &ldquo;more creative hues&rdquo; don&rsquo;t have to mean a full-on commitment to electric teal or zippy chartreuse (though power to you if that&rsquo;s your thing). Instead, we&rsquo;re all about embracing neutrals in fresh ways: Think bypassing standard whites and <strong>gray</strong>s for dialed-down versions of your favorite colors. Going all-out with easygoing shades of blue, green, pink, or even purple, rather than playing it safe with white or <strong>gray</strong>, gives your rooms dimension and allows your personality to shine through. Here are three dos and don&rsquo;ts for ditching white and <strong>gray</strong> and using your favorite color as a neutral. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After a long search for the perfect fit, Oregon-based designer Molly Kidd of Light and Dwell chose Naturel by Sherwin-Williams for her own kitchen cabinetry. &ldquo;This one has all the things I love in a <strong>gray</strong>,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s soothing, not too blue or too taupe, and it brings warmth to the space.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I have pretty strong feelings when it comes to wine, Cornuts, Ryan Reynolds and trends. If you LOVE <strong>gray</strong> and have ALWAYS loved <strong>gray</strong>, regardless of whether it’s trendy or not – paint your <strong>walls</strong> <strong>gray</strong>. If your home ONLY SUITS <strong>gray</strong> and no other colour – paint your <strong>walls</strong> <strong>gray</strong>. However, keep this one magical word in mind… - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Chicago-based interior designer Jean Stoffer turned to Benjamin Moore&rsquo;s statement color Englewood Cliffs when creating a sitting room for her clients. Stoffer says it was the ideal choice to coordinate with the new decor and to offer a respite from the open-concept kitchen, dining, and living space.&ldquo;We love the depth and dimension that Englewood Cliffs paint adds to the space,&rdquo; Stoffer says. &ldquo;The undertones play nicely with the velvet emerald sofas and highlight our favorite antique brass details throughout the room. This <strong>gray</strong> creates beautiful movement and interest, which is why it&rsquo;s one of our favorites!&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Look at BM Rodeo. It is a <strong>gray</strong> with green undertones. Just beautiful! The ever-popular Gray Owl is a soft <strong>gray</strong> with soft yellow undertones. Another BM favorite, Classic Gray is a <strong>gray</strong> that reads off white with soft pink undertones. And so does BM Cloud Cover. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Interior designer Becky Shea of New York City says Silver Chain by Benjamin Moore is one of her top <strong>gray</strong> paint recommendations for clients. &ldquo;We selected it for this bedroom because it&rsquo;s light and airy during daytime hours and then warm and cozy in the evening,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Anytime we step foot into this room, it makes us feel good. You take a deep breath, look out at the Hudson River, everything pauses, and you feel at peace.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>HOW-ever, try to incorporate other colors with <strong>gray</strong>. Lots of white, a taddy bit of black, moody blues, warm greens, browns, and greige (love), soft beiges, or bright complimentary colors. No wonder gold tones are back. Gray and gold are just so gorgeous together! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;It has a magical effect when used on the ceiling by visually melting it away and connecting with the sky itself. Bring the colour down on to the <strong>walls</strong> by about 20-30cm too to enhance the feeling of airy summer freshness.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;re designing a space around existing furniture and flooring materials, remember that these elements can also draw out hidden colors. To ensure a successful result, coordinate <strong>gray</strong> paint undertones to your interior finishings, suggests Sue Wadden, director of color marketing at Sherwin-Williams. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to consider whether the decor in the room is mostly warm or cool, and match the undertones accordingly,&rdquo; she says. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>‘In the bedroom olive green can help to create a serene environment,’ says Charlotte Cosby, head of creative at Farrow & Ball. ‘lt’s also suited to rooms that overlook nature. The colours from the great outdoors will further enhance the green tones of the <strong>walls</strong> and create a relaxing outdoor feel in your home.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Just look at the image above. The <strong>gray</strong> in this room looks alive and anything but boring. Gray when mixed with other colors looks rich! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I think one of the biggest reasons <strong>gray</strong> has been so hugely popular is because of bloggers who post on Pinterest and Instagram. They certainly have a big influence on the decor world now. And many bloggers LOVE LOVE LOVE <strong>gray</strong>! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To make the <strong>gray</strong> paint selection process easier, consider your paint&rsquo;s undertones and test the shade before committing. Undertones are the warm or cool colors added to paint to provide complexity and nuance. While they might not jump out at you initially, they often make a surprise appearance on the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Paint colours play such a huge role in how we live within our homes. The colours we thoughtfully select for our <strong>walls</strong> serves as the backdrop to our everyday lives, which has never been more important than right now. More than purely decorative, colour is highly emotive meaning it can change how we feel in our own personal sanctuary, which is key to making a house feel like a home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I know not all <strong>gray</strong>s are like the violet/<strong>gray</strong> I first encountered but for me, <strong>gray</strong> is often cold and hard to live with. I know all you <strong>gray</strong> lovers will tell me that there are gorgeous <strong>gray</strong>s on the market and you are so right. But <strong>gray</strong>, like the color white, is hard to get right! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The simplest way to explain greige is to say it is a mix of <strong>gray</strong> and beige. Paints like SW Agreeable Gray, Behr Toasty Gray, Benjamin Moore Edgecomb Gray, and SW Dorian Gray are all examples of gorgeous <strong>gray</strong>s. They are toasty and so full of warm brown undertones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The eighties had a love affair with mauves and blues and peaches (remember those colors?). The nineties loved the warmth of Tuscan colors, golds, terracotta, and sun-drenched French provincial hues. Then came the brown craze and the stainless steel craze and then finally the last decade has been all about <strong>gray</strong> and white! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Secondary rooms such as bedrooms, bathrooms and family rooms are great places to add a colour you love without committing to it on such a large scale that you have an ENTIRELY GRAY HOME. Basically, any room that isn’t in an open layout could be painted <strong>gray</strong> as it will be easy enough to repaint it down the road if needed. The KEY is to keep your hallways and open layout areas a colour that is moving FORWARD with the trends, rather than backwards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>IF YOU’VE ALREADY PAINTED YOUR CABINETS GRAY. Don’t worry. Would it be best if your cabinets weren’t <strong>gray</strong>? Yup, but it’s okay if you’re selling in the next two years or so. Will there be people who don’t like them? Sure, but there’s no product that’s totally fool-proof. Those who don’t like particular finishes will simply accommodate them in their future redecorating plans (but this CAN affect the offer they give you). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Use your <strong>walls</strong> like a landscape of surrounding lush forestry. Whether you live in the country or aspire to call it home, painting <strong>walls</strong> in lush green is a step closer to feeling at one with nature. All of the paint experts are in agreement that are homes will be embracing green more than ever next year. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You may think of <strong>gray</strong> paints as an easy option for the exterior or interior home, but the shade is more complex than you may think. A number of beautiful undertones, there are so many <strong>gray</strong> paint shades to consider when embarking on your next painting project. With neutrals being among the top paint colours in 2022, <strong>gray</strong> paints is very popular with homeowners looking to improve their curb appeal or refresh their homes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Well, when it comes to exterior finishes like roofing, brick and stonework, <strong>gray</strong> is often the BEST COLOUR to suit these finishes. When the exterior of a home is well-coordinated, it will last longer. Exterior finishes also tend to have a longer lifespan in the trend world whereas interior finishes get a GOOD five to ten years…if they’re lucky. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Downpipe by Ball and Farrow is medium charcoal with blue undertones and Curbside is warmed-up charcoal by Magnolia Home. I love BM Kendell Charcoal because of its green undertones. I tend to love what green does to <strong>gray</strong>. And this rich warm charcoal from Behr called Carbon is a winner in my book! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Greet your guests with sophisticated style by combining hues from the same family. By using different blue tones on the <strong>walls</strong>, table, and accents, you can make a modern style statement the instant your guests step inside. Tour the rest of this home Photo: Laurey W.
