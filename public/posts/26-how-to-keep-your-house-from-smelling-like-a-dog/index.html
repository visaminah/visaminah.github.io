If anyone’s interested in cat odors or how we handle the litter boxes, let me know in the comments below! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you open up your front door, you want to be greeted by your lovable pooch - not his smell! Our canine companions bring warmth to the home, but they are definitely still animals. They drool, shed, and secrete oils (and worse) all over your furniture and floors. But mostly, many mutts themselves just kind of stink. Without intervention, your abode can start to smell more like a barn than a <strong>house</strong>. So, how do you get rid of that funky scent without banishing your fur-baby? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You should be washing your linens regularly, especially any that your pets use often (for instance, if you let them get on the bed or the couch). Vacuum up what hair you can and then toss the linens in the washer and run a cycle according to the tags. Clean your bed linens, pillowcases, couch cushion covers, blankets, curtains—everything that can go into the washing machine. You should also regularly wash your clothes to keep them <strong>smelling</strong> fresh and to cut down on dandruff and hair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ilsa and Stella tolerate this Waterless Pet Wash from Spruce (neither one are into taking baths, getting wet, or anything that involves them getting clean). You can imagine how much easier this is than fighting to give them a bath and they smell clean and just-bathed. Doesn’t Stella look so happy to be <strong>smelling</strong> fresh and clean? This is the soft, clean cloth I use to wipe clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hiring a cleaning company offers the benefit of experience, as well as special tools and cleaning products designed to eliminate smells at their source. Because each situation is different, speaking with a local <strong>house</strong> cleaning pro will help you get the most accurate price estimate for you. Just make sure you specify that you’d like to get rid of pet smells when you hire them, so they use the right tools and products for the job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Part of getting your home ready for sale is making it attractive to potential buyers. Your Realtor will likely give you advice on decluttering, staging, and curb appeal. And, if you own a dog or two, your real estate agent might give you some advice on how to get the dog smell out of your <strong>house</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Past smoking can potentially expose you to the effects of thirdhand smoke long after the last owners have left the <strong>house</strong>. According to the Cleveland Clinic, “When you smoke in a room or car, toxic chemicals like nicotine cling to walls, clothing, upholstery and other surfaces&mldr; Results of a study published in 2010 found that when this nicotine reacts with nitrous acid in the air, it forms carcinogens.” This can be especially concerning when you have children, due to the impact secondhand smoke can have on child development. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Accidents happen—it’s natural. Practice patience and use positive reinforcement with puppies and dogs that are being <strong>house</strong>trained. If your dog is already potty trained but has started to have accidents, take them to the vet to see if there is a medical cause. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Apart from how to get dog smell out of the <strong>house</strong>, a professional Realtor can help you decide what other steps you can take to get the highest price possible for your home.

You should also change out your air filters every month to keep it <strong>smelling</strong> good and keep your HVAC operating in good condition. If you really struggle with the air quality in your home, it might be worth investing in an air purifier, which clears tiny particles (including those caused by pets) out of the air.
