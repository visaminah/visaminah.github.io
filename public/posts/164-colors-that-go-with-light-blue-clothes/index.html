It can sometimes make light purple <strong>colors</strong> look washed out or make them appear gray. Use caution when pairing such light and dark shades together, and consider adding an element of white to the look to help keep the light purple from looking dull. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now that you’re across all things <strong>blue</strong>, it’s time to decide what colour palette you will match it with. While some colours naturally work well together, some definitely do not. Complementary colours (which are those that you&rsquo;ll find opposite each other on the colour wheel) often create a vibrant interior while analogous colours (which are close neighbours on the colour wheel) create a calming one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Red and <strong>blue</strong> are always striking. But if bright red and cerulean form a combination that’s a little loud for your taste, the muted nature of clay red just might work. Since clay red is close to being a neutral, you might be able to find clay-red coats like the one in the picture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Try using intense sunny yellow for a bold contrast or soft yellow for an airier look.

They work tirelessly to blend with literally any other shade under the sun. You can consider them your fuss-free foundation tones when deducing what <strong>colors</strong> go well together. They even pair well with those trickier statement shades, such as chartreuse. What’s not to love? Take a peek at how we leverage a handful of neutrals to create dynamic outfit duos. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Red can be paired with neutral <strong>colors</strong> like white or black quite easily. For classy outfits, go for grays, browns, or earthy tones. In summers, tangerines, <strong>blue</strong>s, and mustards look vibrant. It depends on where you are headed and what your personal preference is, but here’s a list with a little bit of everything. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now, you can still wear a darker <strong>blue</strong> shirt and opt for a darker green necktie, but you need to ensure the contrast is still there and the tie doesn’t get lost in the rest of the outfit. I would even say you can wear a light green tie in a darker <strong>blue</strong> shirt since it still looks good in most cases. However, wear a darker green tie if you want to feel safe with your choice - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is despite both shades belonging to the same color family. In both cases, the choice of tie color is relatively simple. The tie will build a bridge between the two <strong>blue</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I also love a patterned tie. When choosing a patterned tie, the trick is to mix two <strong>colors</strong>, one being the color of your shirt and the other a complementary or contrasting color. For example, with a <strong>blue</strong> shirt, you can wear a tie with different shades of <strong>blue</strong> since it will look flawless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Of the entire color palette, <strong>blue</strong> is the most controversial and mysterious color. How diverse are the shades of <strong>blue</strong>, so different associations it evokes in us. Light <strong>blue</strong> is like an endless sky, it is light and airy, and dark <strong>blue</strong> is heavy, a little gloomy, like a bottomless ocean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This striking combination often looks almost regal. But it’s also at home in more casual contexts. As you can see in the picture, these two <strong>colors</strong> make quite a statement when combined in a pattern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For a bolder (but more difficult) look, choose a pastel or bold-colored shirt. Next in line after white and light-colored shirts are pastel shirts. These <strong>colors</strong> are fairly light, but not as neutral as <strong>colors</strong> like white and light <strong>blue</strong> – pastel shirts give the wearer a chance to pull off striking – or clashing – combinations. Finally, bold, richly-colored dress shirts offer truly unique possibilities. Paired with an appropriate tie, they can give the wearer a more sophisticated look, but can look showy or ridiculous when paired with inappropriate ties. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re looking for a head-turning combination of <strong>colors</strong>, magenta and yellow is a great one to choose. Like cerulean and neon green, this is a nice combination for beachwear or activewear. But for slightly more formal occasions, wearing a pink dress with a yellow purse (or vice versa) is a great way to stand out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It can be split into two halves – “warm” <strong>colors</strong> and “cool” <strong>colors</strong>. Warm <strong>colors</strong> include reds, oranges, and yellows. Cool <strong>colors</strong> include <strong>blue</strong>s, greens, and purples. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One color combination we haven’t talked about yet is purple and black, which can also make a striking combination. Black works well with dark <strong>colors</strong> of purple since it can make these dark shades pop. This can make dark purple <strong>colors</strong> look more intense than they normally would against other color shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you like the energy of yellow but prefer something closer to a jewel tone, a golden shade of yellow like the one pictured is a great way to go. It pairs well with medium <strong>blue</strong> and even denim <strong>blue</strong>, so this look works well for casual outfits. And of course, if you like patterns, shirts or dresses that use this combination are a nice way to stand out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A bold choice for those looking to stand out from the crowd and become more visible. If you are tired of dull office outfits, then try adding a red strap, handbag or shoes to your <strong>blue</strong> dress. Do not overdo it with red and you should not do too much contrast, it can look defiant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As we’ve seen so far, <strong>blue</strong> and brown seem to pair well together regardless of shade. Chocolate brown and lighter <strong>blue</strong> form a dignified pairing that works well with formal looks. As you can see in the photo, a medium-<strong>blue</strong> tie looks great with a chocolate brown blazer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Juicy lime green color - for the same courageous women of fashion :) Such a combination of <strong>colors</strong> will definitely not leave you unnoticed. In this version, a brighter shade will always lead, and in order for the outfit to be balanced, the <strong>blue</strong> shade should not be too bright, but not too dark. The best choice is ultramarine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A light <strong>blue</strong> shirt looks excellent with a darker purple tie, and you want to avoid wearing a light purple necktie. I would avoid a purple tie regarding dark <strong>blue</strong> shades or even royal <strong>blue</strong>. It’s not that it looks terrible, but your outfit will be properly darker, and a purple bow tie looks much better with a light <strong>blue</strong> shirt because of the contrasting <strong>colors</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your body type is slim or skinny, boost it with extra confidence. Don’t hesitate to choose the <strong>blue</strong> suit. It will make you appear sharp, calm, and luxurious – all at the same time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Since both of these <strong>colors</strong> are dark, it’s a good idea to incorporate lighter <strong>colors</strong> alongside them to create a balance. Try putting together an outfit that incorporates a gradient of color. You can see this in the picture: the model wears a dark navy <strong>blue</strong> top, while her scarf includes teal, several shades of lighter <strong>blue</strong>-green, and white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Refer back to the color wheel and take a look at the “cool” <strong>colors</strong>. These are the <strong>blue</strong>s, greens, and purples. In general, cool <strong>colors</strong> have a calming and soothing effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue and cyan (turquoise) are related <strong>colors</strong>, they look great together. This option is suitable for office and for a walk. Dark <strong>blue</strong> trousers and a blouse of bright turquoise or <strong>blue</strong> color will suit fashionable women of any age. The color scheme is perfect for blondes. If you want to add some accessories, then stop on the following <strong>colors</strong> for them: white, black, yellow, orange, gold, red. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Look together very gently and elegantly. Beige is a neutral color, so any shades of <strong>blue</strong> will suit it. Brown leather accessories will complement the outfit. White and ocher color - may become additional in this combination. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to adding color to women’s wardrobes, pretty pastels and bold brights get the job done. Typically, these lively hues are what we think of when we’re looking to make an outfit really pop. When deciphering what <strong>colors</strong> go well together, these striking shades can be the most persnickety of the bunch. Yes, there’s definitely a way to overdo it on the neons and head-to-toe pastels may wash you out. It’s all about balance, and we’re happy to guide you to the ultimate equilibrium of color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When wearing a <strong>blue</strong> shirt with a <strong>blue</strong> tie, always opt for a darker <strong>blue</strong> necktie and a lighter <strong>blue</strong> shirt since it will complement well. Avoid wearing the same shades of <strong>blue</strong> for both pieces, or the tie will not be noticeable. You can also go for a tie with patterns and more than one shade of <strong>blue</strong> on it since it will look good, especially if you mix the color of the shirt with other <strong>blue</strong>s in the outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You’re looking for a shirt that will embolden your <strong>blue</strong> look. Thus, you can never go wrong with a crisp and clean white shirt matched with a <strong>blue</strong> suit. Period. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Of course, you need to vary the shades of <strong>blue</strong>. For example, if you wear a dark <strong>blue</strong> suit, choose a light, powder <strong>blue</strong> tie. On the other hand, a light <strong>blue</strong> suit will call for a darker <strong>blue</strong> tie. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pink shades surprise with their diversity. There are a lot of them and they differ from each other in their characteristics. If we talk about the combination with <strong>blue</strong> in clothes, then with brighter pink shades, the same bright or darker <strong>blue</strong> will look good. Pale pink pastel tones form more harmonious combinations with more muted and lighter heavenly shades, for example, cobalt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dark purple also works well with bright or dark <strong>colors</strong> that contrast with it. Dark yellows often pair well with dark purple, as do bright reds. You can also pair dark purple with <strong>blue</strong> tones, drawing out the cool tones in purple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As mentioned above, the color wheel largely divides <strong>colors</strong> into two camps, warm and cool <strong>colors</strong>. Using a color wheel, we can create color schemes that will help us achieve the all important concept of harmony. Below is a list of the major color schemes working from schemes with lower intensity and contrast to the boldest color schemes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gray and <strong>blue</strong> are two of the best complementary <strong>colors</strong> in your wardrobe. When you mix both <strong>colors</strong>, it looks perfect. For example, you can wear a light <strong>blue</strong> shirt with a dark gray tie or a dark <strong>blue</strong> shirt with a light gray tie. Both options look great, and it’s pretty difficult to get it wrong when matching both <strong>colors</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Also, regarding shirts and ties, I prefer to have one of the items totally plain without any patterns. So if your necktie is patterned, opt for a plain <strong>blue</strong> shirt, or if your <strong>blue</strong> shirt has stripes, dots, etc., you should opt for a simple tie. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another classic option. Perhaps such a neighborhood may seem gloomy or heavy to someone, but do not write off drawing conclusions. By combining these two <strong>colors</strong>, you can get a very stylish set, the main thing is that the <strong>blue</strong> is bright enough, you can add some accessories in metallic shades (gold or silver), red (a handbag, a strap or red shoes ) or purple handbag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For some reason, I wanted to allocate a separate block for this option. Probably because the combination of a different color (not necessarily <strong>blue</strong>) with black and white, seems especially effective and stylish. The black and white range means not only simple combinations of <strong>blue</strong>, black and white monochromatic clothes, but also the combination of <strong>blue</strong> with black and white patterns, drawings and prints. This may be the most familiar black and white vest , &ldquo;Peas&rdquo; or &ldquo;cell&rdquo;, which, together with our color look very special. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For a summer look, bright enough combinations with ultraviolet and ultramarine are also suitable. Orange + Blue + White make your look fresh, light, bright and positive. For the <strong>blue</strong> and white version fit orange accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As with light purple, dark purple clothes often go well with neutral <strong>colors</strong> like white or gray. Beige can be a bit trickier with dark purple but can work if you pair it with a warm-toned purple that has reddish hues. You’ll also want to avoid browns, oranges, and certain shades of red and green with dark purple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Regardless of the shade, <strong>blue</strong> and gray work well together. This is especially true of shades of <strong>blue</strong> and shades of cool gray. From a practical standpoint, charcoal gray is a great choice to pair with sky <strong>blue</strong>. This deep and dignified gray is a common color for blazers, suit jackets, and pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For the Fall & Winter Seasons, Silk & Woolen ties are your best complement . They will add a subdued look, generally with earthy <strong>colors</strong>. This, in addition to the rich textural variation provided, will offer the best finishing touch for your suiting ensembles during the colder months of the year. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a super chic look that you can both wear for cocktail parties or for girls’ night out. Although this dress doesn’t require you to show much skin at all, it does show your curves which makes the outfit a low-key sexy one. In detail, the dress is a sky <strong>blue</strong> lace fit and flare mini scalloped hem dress. Pair it with black ankle strap open toe heels to complete the outfit in an elegant way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What Pants Go Good With Light Blue Shirt? Wear black skinny jeans with light <strong>blue</strong> denim tops for a stylish, clean and fashion-forward look that’s both casual and stylish. A light <strong>blue</strong> button-down shirt is also commonly worn by men. Men should wear black or navy slacks when they want to look professional and put together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Forget the old adage, <strong>blue</strong> and green can definitely be seen when it comes to colour schemes. Ink, cobalt and emerald make a dramatic combination with brass and bold accents adding a luxe touch. A velvet couch or armchair ought to do the trick. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once the weather turns cooler, more people turn to darker, cooler <strong>colors</strong>. And for a more understated combination, gray and green are a good choice. To create a palette that verges on the monochromatic, pair a very dark green with dark charcoal. For higher contrast, try pairing lighter gray with dark green as shown in the picture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Like some other combinations on the list, this one works well when there’s a color gradient involved. Coral looks nice in an outfit that incorporates <strong>blue</strong>, green, and the spectrum of <strong>colors</strong> between. And of course, incorporating white is a fairly simple way to lighten up the look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Teaming a <strong>blue</strong> dress shirt and a black tie is a surefire way to inject style into your wardrobe. Complement your look with black leather oxford shoes and off you go looking boss. For an outfit that’s absolutely Bond-worthy, try pairing a <strong>blue</strong> dress shirt with a black tie. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now, some guys will tell you that wearing a brown tie with a <strong>blue</strong> shirt looks good. I think differently, at least when it comes to neckties. No matter what shade of <strong>blue</strong> or brown you try to match, it just doesn’t look on point regarding shirts and ties. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dark shades of <strong>blue</strong> don’t look great with a black tie since it will make the outfit darker. When it comes to light <strong>blue</strong> shirts, I would always pick a navy tie over a black one. That’s because a navy necktie matches a <strong>blue</strong> shirt much better, and it doesn’t give that professional and formal look that a black tie provides. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>An Orange Knitted Tie against a <strong>blue</strong> shirt provides for a bold, complementary color scheme!

Wearing just a sky <strong>blue</strong> dress with heels is actually a very good and simple option.

Gray can appear warm-toned, cool-toned, and have many different undertones in the fabric. You will want to ensure that your purple clothing has the same tones to avoid the gray appearing to be an entirely different shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When matching <strong>colors</strong>, a color wheel is a strong foundation upon which to understand the essentials. A color wheel is largely divided into two categories of <strong>colors</strong>; warm and cool <strong>colors</strong>. Warm <strong>colors</strong> exhibit more vibrance (red, orange and yellow), while cooler <strong>colors</strong> represent more calm (<strong>blue</strong>, green and purple). The goal of using the wheel is to create harmony, or balance, with respect to <strong>colors</strong> in your suit, shirt and tie ensemble . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Every man has at least one <strong>blue</strong> shirt in his wardrobe.

The only exception to this rule is for bright red <strong>colors</strong>, which will often pair well with light purple clothing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Try to choose a suit that keeps the number of <strong>colors</strong> in your outfit to no more than three. Finally, you may want to pick a suit that doesn’t add any new <strong>colors</strong> if your outfit is already packed with color.
