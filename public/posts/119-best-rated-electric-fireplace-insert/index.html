With every electric fireplace in the reviews below, you will see the models’ extra features listed. Overall, these include: - Source: Internet The PuraFlame Klaus Electric Fireplace Insert is about 35 inches wide and 27 inches high, which means it can fit easily within a standard fireplace with a little room to spare. It consists of wood, resin, and glass. And it is powder coated, making it durable, antique looking, and highly resistant to scratches and wear and tear. - Source: Internet The common misconception about electric fireplaces is that the ones with more color and brightness options are more realistic. This is not true at all. It’s very easy to install additional LED lights to add more color options, but those are only options. An addition of a pink or blue LED bulb won’t really do much to recreate a realistic flame. - Source: Internet In recent years, the importance of brand reputation has steadily increased. That’s because the US market has been flooded with lower-quality electric fireplaces that are not US-made. These new brands might offer electric fireplaces at ridiculously low prices (below $300 even), they might even have similar specs that Dimplex units, for example, but the quality and, even more importantly, reliability is often missing. - Source: Internet Classic stonework fireplaces may look great, but they have added disadvantages. Pollutants, harmful gasses, and regular ash cleaning are all drawbacks of owning a classic fireplace. Luckily, there is a solution! - Source: Internet Yes. It’s safe to turn on the fireplace overnight as it does not generate carbon monoxide fumes. However, it’s recommended to turn the fireplace off if you plan on leaving it alone for a long period. - Source: Internet As is the case with most art pieces, the Dimplex Opti-V Solo is not without its controversies. Case and point: this is a fireplace that doesn’t heat. A fireplace without a heating function is, according to some options, just for show. - Source: Internet Electric fireplaces are the safest kind of fireplaces. All other fireplaces – including gas, oil, wood, coal, even ethanol fireplaces – are associated with more risks. That’s primarily because they do burn solid or liquid fuels, and those can generate smoke and, even riskier, carbon monoxide that can be deadly. - Source: Internet Before buying an electric fireplace, there are factors to consider, like your budget, your heating needs, and if you’ll be willing to replace the fireplace in a year or two. Of course you don’t want to replace it so soon! That’s why each fireplace in our collection has been vetted for durability, quality, and heating technology. The same can’t always be said for our competitors. - Source: Internet In that case, the heating input wattage is switched from 1,500W to 750W (in an average unit). That setting burns through 50% less electricity; ie. an electric fireplace running on 750W will burn 0.75 kWh per hour (about $0.10 worth of electricity). - Source: Internet Like all the best Touchstone electric fireplaces, Sideline Elite also has a 1,500W electric power input. That’s enough to produce 5,118 BTU of heating output. Heating-wise, it can provide supplemental heat to places up to 500 sq ft (10 BTU per sq ft) or heat 170 sq ft places on its own (30 BTU per sq ft). The built-in thermostat enables you to set the temperature between 68°F and 88°F. - Source: Internet A 1,500W electric fireplace with a thermostat will run on 1,500W or less. That ‘or less’ is an important distinction. When the set temperature on the thermostat is reached, the electric fireplace equipped with a thermostat will lower the heating output. That’s because all additional heating would be unnecessary. - Source: Internet Brand reputation. Touchstone and Dimplex are considered to be top electric fireplace brands, and they can command top-dollar prices. All things considered, despite the higher costs, the Touchstone and Dimplex electric fireplaces are worth every penny. - Source: Internet Nothing ties the room together like a fireplace. In the past, the fireplace was the primary source of heat for cooking, hot water, and comfort. You had to deal with solid fuels like wood and coal, and the chimney was absolutely necessary. Without a doubt, electric fireplaces changed the game completely. - Source: Internet Safe Around Kids \u0026 Pets This fireplace is extremely easy to use around pets and small children. Unlike a traditional fireplace that burns wood or gas that gets very hot, this electric fireplace stays cool to the touch. Meaning that a child or a pet will not get burned when operating the fireplace as directed and used with common sense. Being as there is no real fire, the surfaces do not get hot and burn in the same way a traditional fireplace would. This fireplace is extremely safe to use around small children and pets and is a great addition to a safe family home. - Source: Internet If you want your fireplace insert to have a range of features, this model from R.W.FlAME is the one for you. - Source: Internet Best of all, you won’t have to drag wood into your house, fret about stray sparks setting your home ablaze, or clean up ashes. With an electric fireplace, all you have to do is flick a switch and you’re safely enjoying realistic flames and, if you choose, added warmth. In fact, the most complicated thing about electric fireplaces is deciding which one you want to purchase. With that in mind, we’ve decided to share not only our favorite models, but what you should keep in mind when choosing one. - Source: Internet Most electric fireplaces run on 1,500W and are connected to a 120V outlet. To power that fireplace, you need to send more than 10 amps of electric current through the nichrome heating coils. That amount of current heating up metal wires does produce some residual (but very low on a decibel scale) sounds. - Source: Internet The VIVOHOE fireplace heater controls the humidity and temperature. And even when you shut it off, the fan will continue to work for an additional minute, so it distributes the remaining heat into the room. You don’t have to worry about it disturbing your sleep or concentration because it is silent. - Source: Internet Touchstone and Dimplex are considered to be top electric fireplace brands, and they can command top-dollar prices. All things considered, despite the higher costs, the Touchstone and Dimplex electric fireplaces are worth every penny. Width of the unit. Shorter 24″ units are cheaper than the longest 100″ units; that’s pretty much self-explanatory. - Source: Internet This is an especially important feature of wall-mounting electric fireplaces. Wi-Fi enabled electric fireplaces. This is what the best fireplace overall – #1 Touchstone Sideline Elite – has. You can change the temperature (68°F to 88°F) on the built-in thermostat or play around with flame options via iPhone or Android smartphone. - Source: Internet This is what the best fireplace overall – #1 Touchstone Sideline Elite – has. You can change the temperature (68°F to 88°F) on the built-in thermostat or play around with flame options via iPhone or Android smartphone. Hybrid-FX™ flame technology. This is a patented flame technology by Modern Flames included in the #3 Modern Flames Slimline unit. - Source: Internet Example: One of the most important factors – the most important one, in fact – is the brand reputation of an electric fireplace manufacturer (covered under #4 factor). This is not exactly a specification per se but it is a vital factor if you want to buy a top-rated electric fireplace; hence it’s designated as a primary factor. You can’t really go wrong with Touchstone or Dimplex, for example. - Source: Internet Arguably the best ones are made by Dimplex, of course. The Dimplex V series has the reputation of being the artistic series of electric fireplaces. The Dimplex Opti-V Solo is the best high-end electric fireplace money can buy. - Source: Internet Nobody really likes to be bothered with extensive installations, especially when it comes to electric fireplace mantels. Just a quick plug-in into a 120-volt outlet and the fireplace should start glowing. And the glow should give a realistic feel with realistic-looking flames. GMHome EF-30AKF has both of those. - Source: Internet The unit allows plenty of customization. You can change color themes according to your taste. Using the prism mode, the fireplace freezes on your preferred hue. - Source: Internet With wall-mounted electric fireplaces, the slimmer is usually better. The Modern Flames Spectrum Slimline is the slimmest electric fireplace with the Hybrid-FX™ flame tech. Its depth dimension is less than 5 inches (4.6 inches, to be exact). That doesn’t only make it more visually appealing; it also makes the installation (either wall-mounting or recessed installation) much easier. - Source: Internet And that’s exactly what Dimplex Opti-V Solo aspires to be. This is not a heating unit. If you can afford several thousand dollars for an electric fireplace, you probably already have adequate heating. The lack of heating is just to show ‘hey, this is not a robust heating device; it’s an art piece’. - Source: Internet You can choose between 4 models; namely 50″, 60″, 74″, and 100″. Modern Flames has enough brand recognition and a good reputation to price their fireplaces on the same level as Touchstone and even Dimplex. This is also the case with Modern Flames Spectrum Slimline; the Hybrid-FX™ and the slim design do add to the cost, however. - Source: Internet Choosing an electric fireplace with adequate dimensions is a key consideration. Depending on your situation (ie. where do you intend to install a fireplace), you have to tally up those inches before you choose a model. - Source: Internet Also, for your convenience, you can use the power, flame, or heat control remote control. And there’s also a programmable thermostat at the side of the fireplace insert. It will enable you to determine the temperature settings, embers, and flame levels. - Source: Internet The best electric fireplace should incorporate everything just right; the heating power, the aesthetic appeal, width options, realistic flame, and so on. Touchstone’s flagship model – the Touchstone Sideline Elite – does just that. On top of everything else, the Touchstone Sideline Elite is one of the modern electric fireplaces with built-in Wi-Fi connectivity and smartphone control. - Source: Internet In short, all the reasons why R.W.Flame is one of the most popular and best-selling electric fireplaces are quite obvious. It has all the right specs, wide array of flame options, and it’s a lot cheaper than comparable big brand electric fireplaces: - Source: Internet Holographic Technology State-of-the-art theme park technology comes home in the world’s first holographic electric fireplace.

Enjoy the subtle details of wispy smoke and burning embers with a level of detail unheard-of for electric fireplaces. - Source: Internet All of that electric power input is meant for heating. The electric current heats up the nichrome heating coils, located below the flames, and fans blow up to warm air into the room. Because the energy efficiency of electrical heating is above 99% (almost all of the electricity is directly transformed into heat), we can calculate that 1,500W of electric input can generate up to 5,118 BTU/hr of heating output (1 Watt = 3.412 BTU). - Source: Internet The electric firebox utilizes a patented pulsating ember technology and LED inner glow. As a result, it creates an experience similar to what a real fireplace would produce because the logs and embers glow in concert. However, unlike a real fireplace, it doesn’t have any gas emissions or particulates, making it one of the best options if you prefer an eco-friendly fireplace insert. - Source: Internet You can choose between ‘Herringbone Brick’ and ‘Weathered Concrete’ design; both further give a feeling of a real homely hearth. Width-wise, you can choose between 24″, 30″, 36″, and 42″ models. The 36″ model is especially popular and considered the best 36″ electric fireplace insert currently on the market. - Source: Internet The important step here is making sure the measurements are correct. The right dimensions will ensure that the fireplace fits and looks good. If the dimensions are off then the insert may not fit or could leave gaps between the cabinets. - Source: Internet Now, as we mentioned, modern electric fireplaces are a bit about heating, but a lot about interior design.

It’s safe to operate as the front glass panel remains cold, even when the fireplace is in use. This is great for parents or pet owners concerned about safety. - Source: Internet Note: Freestanding electric fireplaces can be considered a subtype of electric fireplace mantels. However, most freestanding models are made by manufacturers who specialize in electric fireplaces. For example, you will see a superb freestanding fireplace made by Dimplex; you won’t see a respectable company like Dimplex to manufacture electric fireplace mantels. - Source: Internet The insert design is also shorter and higher than the wall-mounted design. That gave Dimplex space to put in ambers and it also allowed for the generation of bigger flames. The combination of these ambers and bigger flames makes the flames in the Dimplex Revillusion RBF look much more realistic. In fact, due to these two factors, the Dimplex Revillusion RBF has arguably the most realistic flames among all electric fireplaces. - Source: Internet Let’s start with the power. While most electric fireplaces can take only 1,500W input, the Dimplex Revillusion RBF is capable of handling 1,000W more than that (2,575W in total). That means the heating output is almost 9,000 BTU (8,794 BTU, to be exact).

These cabinets often come disassembled, so you will need to piece them together at home. - Source: Internet The electric fireplace insert has front-facing heater vents, so it can be placed under a flatscreen TV if the design calls for it. If you don’t have a recessed wall, the unit has included brackets that can be mounted on a wall. It’s also completely cool to the touch, keeping parents and pet owners satisfied. - Source: Internet Buying a 3,000W electric fireplace (they are few of these on the market as it is) is overkill. Such a fireplace could potentially generate almost 10,000 BTU/hr. However, the fan system would hardly be capable of distributing the generated heat evenly enough across the room in which the electric fireplace is placed. - Source: Internet Older electric fireplace models didn’t come with the heating off feature. That meant that every time you wanted to enjoy the flames, you also had to (sometimes unnecessarily) heat the rooms you’re in and pay for up to $0.20/hour for electricity. - Source: Internet of a real fireplace but the sound of one, too, with the crackling sounds it gives off.

With every <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong> in the reviews below, you will see the models’ extra features listed. Overall, these include: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The PuraFlame Klaus Electric Fireplace Insert is about 35 inches wide and 27 inches high, which means it can fit easily within a standard <strong>fireplace</strong> with a little room to spare. It consists of wood, resin, and glass. And it is powder coated, making it durable, antique looking, and highly resistant to scratches and wear and tear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The common misconception about <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong>s is that the ones with more color and brightness options are more realistic. This is not true at all. It’s very easy to install additional LED lights to add more color options, but those are only options. An addition of a pink or blue LED bulb won’t really do much to recreate a realistic flame. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In recent years, the importance of brand reputation has steadily increased. That’s because the US market has been flooded with lower-quality <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong>s that are not US-made. These new brands might offer <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong>s at ridiculously low prices (below $300 even), they might even have similar specs that Dimplex units, for example, but the quality and, even more importantly, reliability is often missing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Classic stonework <strong>fireplace</strong>s may look great, but they have added disadvantages. Pollutants, harmful gasses, and regular ash cleaning are all drawbacks of owning a classic <strong>fireplace</strong>. Luckily, there is a solution! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yes. It’s safe to turn on the <strong>fireplace</strong> overnight as it does not generate carbon monoxide fumes. However, it’s recommended to turn the <strong>fireplace</strong> off if you plan on leaving it alone for a long period. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As is the case with most art pieces, the Dimplex Opti-V Solo is not without its controversies. Case and point: this is a <strong>fireplace</strong> that doesn’t heat. A <strong>fireplace</strong> without a heating function is, according to some options, just for show. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Electric <strong>fireplace</strong>s are the safest kind of <strong>fireplace</strong>s. All other <strong>fireplace</strong>s – including gas, oil, wood, coal, even ethanol <strong>fireplace</strong>s – are associated with more risks. That’s primarily because they do burn solid or liquid fuels, and those can generate smoke and, even riskier, carbon monoxide that can be deadly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before buying an <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong>, there are factors to consider, like your budget, your heating needs, and if you’ll be willing to replace the <strong>fireplace</strong> in a year or two. Of course you don’t want to replace it so soon! That’s why each <strong>fireplace</strong> in our collection has been vetted for durability, quality, and heating technology. The same can’t always be said for our competitors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In that case, the heating input wattage is switched from 1,500W to 750W (in an average unit). That setting burns through 50% less <strong>electric</strong>ity; ie. an <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong> running on 750W will burn 0.75 kWh per hour (about $0.10 worth of <strong>electric</strong>ity). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Like all the best Touchstone <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong>s, Sideline Elite also has a 1,500W <strong>electric</strong> power input. That’s enough to produce 5,118 BTU of heating output. Heating-wise, it can provide supplemental heat to places up to 500 sq ft (10 BTU per sq ft) or heat 170 sq ft places on its own (30 BTU per sq ft). The built-in thermostat enables you to set the temperature between 68°F and 88°F. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A 1,500W <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong> with a thermostat will run on 1,500W or less. That ‘or less’ is an important distinction. When the set temperature on the thermostat is reached, the <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong> equipped with a thermostat will lower the heating output. That’s because all additional heating would be unnecessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Brand reputation. Touchstone and Dimplex are considered to be top <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong> brands, and they can command top-dollar prices. All things considered, despite the higher costs, the Touchstone and Dimplex <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong>s are worth every penny. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Nothing ties the room together like a <strong>fireplace</strong>. In the past, the <strong>fireplace</strong> was the primary source of heat for cooking, hot water, and comfort. You had to deal with solid fuels like wood and coal, and the chimney was absolutely necessary. Without a doubt, <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong>s changed the game completely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Safe Around Kids & Pets This <strong>fireplace</strong> is extremely easy to use around pets and small children. Unlike a traditional <strong>fireplace</strong> that burns wood or gas that gets very hot, this <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong> stays cool to the touch. Meaning that a child or a pet will not get burned when operating the <strong>fireplace</strong> as directed and used with common sense. Being as there is no real fire, the surfaces do not get hot and burn in the same way a traditional <strong>fireplace</strong> would. This <strong>fireplace</strong> is extremely safe to use around small children and pets and is a great addition to a safe family home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want your <strong>fireplace</strong> insert to have a range of features, this model from R.W.FlAME is the one for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Best of all, you won&rsquo;t have to drag wood into your house, fret about stray sparks setting your home ablaze, or clean up ashes. With an <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong>, all you have to do is flick a switch and you&rsquo;re safely enjoying realistic flames and, if you choose, added warmth. In fact, the most complicated thing about <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong>s is deciding which one you want to purchase. With that in mind, we&rsquo;ve decided to share not only our favorite models, but what you should keep in mind when choosing one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong>s run on 1,500W and are connected to a 120V outlet. To power that <strong>fireplace</strong>, you need to send more than 10 amps of <strong>electric</strong> current through the nichrome heating coils. That amount of current heating up metal wires does produce some residual (but very low on a decibel scale) sounds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The VIVOHOE <strong>fireplace</strong> heater controls the humidity and temperature. And even when you shut it off, the fan will continue to work for an additional minute, so it distributes the remaining heat into the room. You don’t have to worry about it disturbing your sleep or concentration because it is silent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Touchstone and Dimplex are considered to be top <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong> brands, and they can command top-dollar prices. All things considered, despite the higher costs, the Touchstone and Dimplex <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong>s are worth every penny. Width of the unit. Shorter 24″ units are cheaper than the longest 100″ units; that’s pretty much self-explanatory. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is an especially important feature of wall-mounting <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong>s. Wi-Fi enabled <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong>s. This is what the best <strong>fireplace</strong> overall – #1 Touchstone Sideline Elite – has. You can change the temperature (68°F to 88°F) on the built-in thermostat or play around with flame options via iPhone or Android smartphone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is what the best <strong>fireplace</strong> overall – #1 Touchstone Sideline Elite – has. You can change the temperature (68°F to 88°F) on the built-in thermostat or play around with flame options via iPhone or Android smartphone. Hybrid-FX™ flame technology. This is a patented flame technology by Modern Flames included in the #3 Modern Flames Slimline unit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Example: One of the most important factors – the most important one, in fact – is the brand reputation of an <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong> manufacturer (covered under #4 factor). This is not exactly a specification per se but it is a vital factor if you want to buy a top-rated <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong>; hence it’s designated as a primary factor. You can’t really go wrong with Touchstone or Dimplex, for example. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Arguably the best ones are made by Dimplex, of course. The Dimplex V series has the reputation of being the artistic series of <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong>s. The Dimplex Opti-V Solo is the best high-end <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong> money can buy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Nobody really likes to be bothered with extensive installations, especially when it comes to <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong> mantels. Just a quick plug-in into a 120-volt outlet and the <strong>fireplace</strong> should start glowing. And the glow should give a realistic feel with realistic-looking flames. GMHome EF-30AKF has both of those. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The unit allows plenty of customization. You can change color themes according to your taste. Using the prism mode, the <strong>fireplace</strong> freezes on your preferred hue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With wall-mounted <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong>s, the slimmer is usually better. The Modern Flames Spectrum Slimline is the slimmest <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong> with the Hybrid-FX™ flame tech. Its depth dimension is less than 5 inches (4.6 inches, to be exact). That doesn’t only make it more visually appealing; it also makes the installation (either wall-mounting or recessed installation) much easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>And that’s exactly what Dimplex Opti-V Solo aspires to be. This is not a heating unit. If you can afford several thousand dollars for an <strong>electric</strong> <strong>fireplace</strong>, you probably already have adequate heating.

Some allow users to change the flicker speed of the flames, the color of the fire and its brightness, but other units may only allow you to turn the flames on and off. Likewise, the temperature control may have anywhere from just two settings to a wide variety controlled by an adjustable manual or digital thermostat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once upon a time, <strong>fireplace</strong>s were the heart of every American home. Because they provided the house&rsquo;s sole heat source, they were where families gathered in the evening hours to chat, play games, and enjoy each other&rsquo;s company. However, with the advent of steam heat, <strong>fireplace</strong>s fell out of favor, but the coziness they provided was never forgotten.
