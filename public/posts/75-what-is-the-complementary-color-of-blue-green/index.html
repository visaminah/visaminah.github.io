The three primary colors are red, blue, and yellow. These three colors are essentially the parents of all the other colors. - Source: Internet Of course, your choice of green is equally as important at the color you pair it with. Lime greens are zesty and energetic, while sages are calm and relaxing. Emerald greens are sophisticated and luxurious, while mint green can be playful and fun. - Source: Internet The complementary color is blue. Therefore, the split complementary colors are orange and green-yellow. What color complements blue? The complementary color is orange. Therefore, the split complementary colors are purple and blue-cyan. - Source: Internet Using a color wheel, you can calculate the specific amount of split complementary color schemes. There are 12 color blocks, and each color has a complementary partner. This partner has its neighbor. For example, starting with the dominant color blue, you can go around the twelve-block wheel to determine the split complementary colors. There are ay variations for each color on the color wheel so your options are endless! - Source: Internet The Lab color system defines a color by lightness along one axis (the Lin Lab) and hue along two separate a and b axes. One runs from red to green,and the other runs from yellow to blue. The idea is that no color can be redand green at the same time, or yellow and blue at the same time. - Source: Internet saturation (also known as chroma, or tone) refers to relative purity; when a pure, vivid, strong shade of red is mixed with a variable amount of white, weaker or paler reds are produced, each having the same hue but a different saturation; such paler colors are called unsaturated colors. You can define the amount of saturation of a given using a chromaticity diagram. For example, suppose you had a red color and you slowly increased the amount of blue and green light reaching the eye, then the mixture of the red, blue and green would contribute to the perception of white. White plus red would give pink. The hue would not have been altered, but the saturation would be lower - Source: Internet We have discussed how to use the split complementary color theory to devise what works well together and how to choose a dominant base color. We have then learned how to choose additional colors to work as a support for the focus color. For example, you want to introduce a pattern to create texture in your color palette. When looking at a color scheme of yellow, green, and red-violet, the base color would be red-violet, and the green and yellow shades would be used as accent colors for patterned pillows or a patterned color throw. - Source: Internet This is more of a contemporary color combination and can go well in a child’s bedroom as the colors are vibrant and modern, but not overpowering. You can add red-violet as a headboard or drawer panels. A floral comforter or duvet that brings in red-orange and green. You can also use a neutral color wall paint and curtains as a nice backdrop to all the colors. Consider adding white pillows with subtle designs that incorporate all three colors. - Source: Internet Blue’s cool color temperature stands out sharply against the warm finish of wood floors, furnishings, or trim. For medium- to dark-tone wood finishes, choose a strong shade of blue that won’t pale in comparison. In this open kitchen, deep azure cabinetry contrasts with richly stained wood floors to create a cozy, modern cooking space. Open shelving and large windows keep the dark blue cabinetry from overpowering the design. - Source: Internet In order to understand what a split complementary color scheme is, we must first answer the question: “What is a complementary color scheme?” To help you understand, we will look at the basic color wheel. A color wheel has the primary colors which consist of blue, yellow, and red. It also contains secondary colors which are green, pink, violet, and orange. These colors are spread out to form a circle. T - Source: Internet : These four colors are all evenly spaced apart from one another on the color wheel. Red, orange, green, and blue are good examples. Square Colors : Using the color wheel again, these four colors are determined using a square shape. - Source: Internet When you are talking about paint, markers, or other pigments, magenta, yellow, and cyan are the true primary colors. Although cyan is close to blue and magenta is close to red, they are not the same colors. In addition, red and blue can be made from the CYM primary colors. - Source: Internet Neighbors on the color wheel, green and blue are cool colors that form a refreshing combination. Choose vibrant shades of these analogous colors on walls and furniture for a bold look. In this dramatic sitting room, vivid cerulean blue wall color is balanced by an equally bold apple green. Inspired by the artwork, textiles in a deep apricot geometric print accent the velvet club chairs. - Source: Internet There is something disconcerting about this wheel, in that the two squares(representing RGB and CMY) are not duals of each other, like RGB and CMY are.This has the consequence that complementary colors are not the same distancefrom each other: green and magenta and blue and yellow are four semitones apart,but red and cyan are five semitones apart. So, for the heck of it, we’re gonnathrow in some more colors for no good reason, giving the color wheel on the right. - Source: Internet ‘Green goes very well with natural textures, and in particular pale wood. A sea-green works so well with raw timber, for instance.’ explains Sarah. - Source: Internet Blue and red form an all-American pairing that suits nearly any space. In this cheerful fireplace area, a pair of crimson velvet chairs pop against navy patterned pillows and an inky blue accent wall, creating a dynamic look. For more formal spaces like the dining room, go for darker shades such as navy and maroon that read more sophisticated than patriotic. Lighter tones, including powder blue and salmon, work well in bathrooms or bedrooms to create a soft, comforting atmosphere. - Source: Internet You will find green opposite red on the color wheel. Therefore, blue-green and green-yellow are the split complementary colors of red. What color complements orange? You will find blue opposite the color orange on the color wheel. Therefore, blue-violet and blue-green are the split complementary colors for orange. - Source: Internet At the heart of color theory, complementary colors are the opposite hues on the color wheel. In their most basic form, they are one primary color and the secondary color that is created by mixing the other two primaries. For instance, the complementary color to yellow is purple, which is a mix of blue and red. - Source: Internet Soft shades of blue naturally evoke calm feelings associated with the sea. Partner light blues with a sandy-colored neutral or light-washed wood for a feeling reminiscent of the seashore. Repeat both tan and pale blue with fabrics, bedding, and furniture to create a relaxing retreat in a master or guest bedroom. - Source: Internet You were probably first introduced to the most basic color theory concept back in elementary school when you were given a palette of primary colors to paint with. Red, blue, and yellow are primary colors— and they can’t be created through mixing colors. Mix them all together and you get brown. But mix them and you can create all other colors. - Source: Internet The kitchen is one of the main gathering spots of the house, so it warrants a color scheme the entire family can live with. Because orange sits opposite to blue on the color wheel, it’s a natural complement to blue. This pleasing combination also offers an energizing contrast that’s perfect for a bustling kitchen. Consider livening up white cabinetry and countertops by painting the kitchen island blue, then layer in hits of orange through stool seating, rugs, kitchen towels, and other accessories. - Source: Internet Red and green aren’t the only colors with psychological power: The color wheel can also be sliced into warm and cool colors. People associate cooler colors like blue with peace and calm. Warm colors like red are more energetic and associated with passion. - Source: Internet Introduce a dose of femininity with shades of pink, coral, or apricot. The palette of this cozy sitting room is inspired by the striped fabric on decorative pillows. The soft, watery blue is repeated on the painted walls, and the bright coral coats the cheerful entry door. The colorful combination is lively, inviting, and distinctly beachy. - Source: Internet In neutral rooms, even a small dose of blue can add another layer of personality. If you prefer to stick to neutral paint colors and furnishings, bring in blue through small accessories, such as a table runner, decorative lamp, or a throw blanket. To maintain the neutral look, choose a soft, muted shade of blue that won’t feel out of place. If you decide you love the color in the space, feel free to go bigger by repainting the walls or purchasing a blue accent chair. - Source: Internet Green and blue have both had their moments, but why not go for the best of both worlds? Blue green paints are perfect for creating a serene, tranquil vibe in any room in your house. From robin’s egg to teal to turquoise, blue greens come in a variety of shades. And while they add a lot of vibrant color to your space, you don’t have to take a risk to use them in your home—they work in traditional spaces just as much as they do in eclectic, bold ones. - Source: Internet Yellow would be the complement of purple. So, split complementary colors would be yellow-green and yellow-orange. What color complements orange? Blue is the complementary color with blue-green and blue-purple or violet being the split complementary colors. - Source: Internet There are six tertiary colors in all. These are the colors you get when you mix primary and secondary colors together, which is why they are known by two hued names. The tertiary colors are blue-green, red-violet, yellow-orange, red-orange, red-purple, blue-green, and yellow-green. - Source: Internet The traditional color wheel is recognized by most of us. However, there are various additional color theories we can use to determine split complementary colors. The three theories that are mostly used include the RYB or traditional color wheel, the CMYK model which is cyan, yellow, magenta, and black, and then the RGB model which is red, green, and blue. Here is what the RGB and CMYK color wheels look like: - Source: Internet Of course, my understanding of YIQ was lacking, and that color wheel doesnot resemble YIQ at all. YIQ actually looks a lot more like this color wheelinstead. The primaries are orange,green, cyan, andviolet. The secondaries arerose, yellow,aquamarine, and blue.The tertiaries are magenta,red, gold,chartreuse, two other greensI don’t care to name,azure, and indigo. - Source: Internet From yellow to blue, we have a pretty satisfactory progression. Which isgood, because the “ribbons” of these colors on the spectrum are pretty thin.However, before and after yellow and blue, the “notes” bunch up. We can fudgeit and bring those notes up and down, because we have some leeway with those(though not nearly half as much as I’m kidding myself). - Source: Internet ‘From a color pairing perspective, of course this harmony extends to combining green with neutrals. As mentioned, green sits in the center of the wheel so can be combined with both cold and warm tones. As an example - combining verdigris green with a chalky, blue-toned grey will create a cool, calm scheme, whereas pairing it with a warmer, yellow-toned beige will create an earthy, outdoorsy feel.’ - Source: Internet Located on blue’s side of the color wheel, purple is another cool color that makes a pleasing companion. Because the two tones are so similar, the resulting color scheme is both colorful and soothing. Pair rich purple with striking turquoise for a jewel-like effect in a bedroom or living room. If you prefer paler blue tones, opt for saturated shades of purple to avoid the washed-out look of too many pastels. You can also add contrast to a blue color scheme by choosing warmer purple tones, such as orchid as opposed to indigo, to counteract the coolness of blue. - Source: Internet Since teal is part of the blue color family, it helps to bring calmness and tranquility to a space. The color is also reminiscent of the seaside. Also having an undertone of green, it is a refreshing and renewing color that will combine nicely with its split complementary colors. Orange and teal are complementary colors, so these would add nice contrasting colors to a room. Just remember to bring in your orange and red colors as accent colors, so you do not overpower or add too much energy to a room. - Source: Internet Even once you’ve narrowed in on a color, it can be difficult to find the perfect shade. That’s why we called in the professionals. Here, we’ve rounded up the best blue green paints that interior designers love to help you find the right shade for your space, no matter your decor style. - Source: Internet To the left is an attempt by me to unify the HSV/HSL/HSB color wheel withthe color wheel taught in art classes. The RGB primary and secondary colorsand traditional primary and secondary colors are all represented as primaryand secondary colors in this system. The primaries are red,yellow, cyan, andviolet, and the secondaries areorange, green,blue, and magenta(making this the dual of the “Apple II Video Display Theory” color wheel).The tertiaries are scarlet, gold,chartreuse, aquamarine,azure, indigo,purple, and rose. - Source: Internet One other thing you will notice is that a pair of complementary colors is made up of one cool color and one warm color. Orange, reds, and yellows are the warm colors, while blues, greens, and purples are the cool colors. This helps create what is known as simultaneous contrast, the highest contrasts available on the color wheel. - Source: Internet ‘Greens with a blue base are impactful, so introducing soft tones of clay white and chalky grey in furniture and accessories bring a calming feel,’ explains Sarah Spiteri, Livingetc’s editorial director. ‘Greens with a yellow undertone, such as olive, pop alongside gold or bronze, enhancing their warmth.’ - Source: Internet Now let’s dive into how designers can use color theory to enhance their projects. Think about the last time you filled out a contact form on a website. Miss a field, and a red error message likely pops up. On the contrary, if you need to re-enter a password for verification, and you enter everything correctly, a green message signals you to proceed. In this case, not only does color communicate how to use your product, but also draws on psychology to evoke emotional responses (green = good, red = bad). - Source: Internet Split complementary colors can be located on a color wheel. Look for a specific color, for example, red, then the complementary color will be green. On either side of the green, you will find blue-green and yellow-green, and these are your split complementary colors. - Source: Internet You will find orange opposite blue on the color wheel. Therefore, red-orange and yellow-orange are the split complementary color for blue. What color complements purple? You will find yellow opposite the color purple on the color wheel. Therefore, yellow-orange and yellow-green are the split complementary colors for purple. - Source: Internet If we wanted to keep red, green, and blue as primaries, this could be doneby promoting aquamarine to a secondary color, resulting in this color wheel.The primaries once again become red,green, and blue, but nowthere are two sets of secondaries, one being cyan,magenta, and yellow,with the other being a close approximation of traditional secondaries,orange, aquamarine,and violet. The tertiary colors arescarlet, gold,chartreuse, the two greenswithout a name from the YIQ color wheel,azure, indigo,purple, and rose. - Source: Internet You can easily bring in colors using texture and different patterns. Consider a color combination of red-violet, green, and yellow. The red-violet is your base color, while the green and yellow colors are slightly muted and brought into the room using striped fabrics, pillows, and upholstery. - Source: Internet While rich jewel-like greens and blues work together whether, more vibrant, primary and pastel tones can also work in the right scheme. ‘The color scheme for this kitchen is fresh, bold, bright and fun,’ says interior designer Cortney Bishop (opens in new tab). They key to making this combination work? ‘Grounding the pastel palette,’ Cortney suggests. ‘Be thoughtful to pick colors you can thread through the home in fabrics and other home accents - cabinetry, trimwork - for this.’ - Source: Internet Green and yellow are adjacent to each other on the color wheel, so rooms in this palette are harmonious and easy to live with. ‘When pairing colors, we strive for a similar base - so there’s a relationship between shades,’ explains architect and interior designer Noa Santos, founder of Nainoa (opens in new tab) and designer of this refined green living room. ‘In this case the colors, though different, feel like they are a part of the same family.’ - Source: Internet When thinking of the colors orange, blue-green, and red, they may seem a bit boring. But if we change the hue or tone of those colors, they may be a little less dull! For example, swap the blue for teal and the orange for a burnt orange! This changes the entire ensemble. Use one color as the dominant color in your split complementary color scheme, and then add the accent colors as accessories. The options are endless, so have fun! - Source: Internet A split complementary color scheme is simply a color theory method in which to calculate colors that will work well together using a color wheel. You begin to buy choosing your dominant color, in this case, we choose the color red. Our second color is across from red on the color wheel, green. When looking at the color green, on either side you will find yellow and blue. These become the split complementary colors of red. - Source: Internet : This consists of base colors and three colors that are all the same distance from each other. There are two sets of complementary colors, for example, green, blue, orange, and red. Square Colors : These are four colors that are squarely spaced on the color wheel. - Source: Internet ‘Sage green is the optimal color choice right now. It harnesses the calming energy inherent in green but anchors it with an earthiness and depth not present in more vivid hues.’ explains Sarah Spiteri. - Source: Internet As a rule of thumb cooler-leaning greens and yellow-toned greens like lime, fern greens, jade greens and emerald greens work best with crisp true whites. You have more choice with more muted, dusky greens like sage and pistachio. They will usually work both with a bright white to add a freshness to these more muted tones or an off-white for a more warm, cocooning feel. - Source: Internet To the left is the HSV/HSL/HSB color wheel. The primary colors are the RGBprimaries, red, green,and blue. The secondary colors are the CMYK primaries,cyan, magenta, andyellow. The tertiary colors areorange, chartreuse,aquamarine, azure,violet, and rose. - Source: Internet The complementary color to green is Magenta. Therefore, the split complementary colors are rose and purple. What color complements red? The complementary color for red in this instance will be cyan. Therefore, the split complementary colors would be blue-cyan and green-cyan. - Source: Internet ‘Green and pink are complementary colors, sitting opposite each other on the wheel. This means that the scheme is high impact,’ explains Sarah. Get your proportions right for a truly restorative space - a generous amount of green against touches of pink is gorgeous. Nature-inspired patterns, such as florals or botanicals, are particularly effective when decorating with this combination.’ - Source: Internet Purple and green may sound like a bold look but as Sarah says, it’s one that ‘can be very charming, particularly in a smaller room where you want to make an impact and embrace coziness. Botanical greens and jewel-toned emeralds look amazing with plum - these colors are a wonderful foil for each other.’ - Source: Internet Notice that red and green are three semitones apart, as are green and blue,and blue and F. Human beings have three types of cones in their retinas fordetecting color: one for red, one for green, and one for blue. Birds have afourth type of cone that detects ultraviolet light. Therefore F is ultraviolet,because reasons, and we can say F# is infrared if we like, or evensquant or octarine. - Source: Internet When creating a space for interior design, using the concept of split complementary colors is extremely helpful. For example, you can use blue as your dominant color and look for which colors complement blue. The complementary colors will be yellow-orange and red-orange. The blue could be used as an accent wall, and then accessories could be done in the split complementary colors. Accessories could include items such as pillows, a vase, and lamp shades, the options are endless! - Source: Internet Let’s start with a quick complementary colors definition. On a standard RYB (red, yellow, blue) color wheel, complementary colors are those that sit directly across from each other. These create the highest possible contrast compared to any other pairings on the wheel—think of it as an “opposites attract” thing. - Source: Internet When working with the color wheel, it is easy to determine what color complements purple. The purple block sits directly opposite the color yellow. This will be its ideal complementary color, but the split complementary color scheme will be purple with yellow-orange and yellow-green. - Source: Internet Color bias or color temperature is also important, and the complementary colors will be considered either cool or warm. Greens and blues, as most of us know, are cool colors, while reds and oranges are warm colors. Complementary colors do not need to be just two hues! - Source: Internet If you’re a true-blue fan of the color, feel free to mix multiple shades of blue into a monochromatic scheme. To make sure the combo plays well together, look for blues with similar undertones, such as blue-green turquoise and dark teal. Repeat the hues across walls, curtains, rugs, and other decor elements to create a rich, layered look. Use a variety of fabric textures and vary the scale of patterns to keep the design from looking stagnant. - Source: Internet ‘One of my all-time favorite color schemes is a sage green with an earthy pale pink. These colors are all luxuriously rich and soothing, inviting you to be cozy and relaxed in your home.’ says color expert Annie Sloan (opens in new tab). - Source: Internet o determine what your complementary color palette will be using a color wheel, decide on a dominant color for your project. For example, if you choose the color red, the opposite color to red on the color wheel will be green. These are complementary colors. - Source: Internet Blue and white form a crisp color combination that creates a clean feeling, which is ideal for spaces like the bathroom. Here, traditional elements, including beaded-board walls and hexagon floor tiles, take on a more contemporary feel when balanced by patterned blue wallpaper. The fresh bathroom color combination turns the small space into a focal point. - Source: Internet Cyan, Yellow, and Magenta are important colors, and some people don’t even know what they are. Some people might call magenta purple or pink and cyan a light blue. People are not taught the language they need to talk about colors. Any color can be made using cyan, yellow, magenta, and white. - Source: Internet As this expert advice hopefully proves, there’s a right tone and shade of almost every color that will work with versatile green. However, there are some shades that can be challenging to put with green, just for the connotations these colour combinations have. This tends to particularly apply to a green shade mixed from primary yellow and blues. - Source: Internet ‘In this case, the space needed to be exciting but also needed to have a soothing quality that the family could always enjoy,’ says Katie. ‘We did this by softening the brighter values of the red and green by pulling in wood tones and by adding in warmth with the metal finishes. We knew that our best approach to using these bold colors was in knowing they will stand out but also keeping in mind that they need to feel like they belong.’ - Source: Internet Consider, yellow as your base color, so your complementary colors are then red-purple and blue-purple. You might want to use more of your split complementary colors and add in accents of yellow. In a room, maybe you can use yellow as various décor items like pillows or wall hangings. Let us use blue as another example, your complementary colors are then yellow-orange and red-orange. You can use blue as your base color and bring in the other colors as items throughout the room to bring in more energy and light. - Source: Internet The way the Apple II’s video worked (what I called “Apple II VideoDisplay Theory”) was the subject of a discussion on comp.sys.apple2.I created the color wheel to the left during this discussion, based on myobservations. The primaries are magenta,orange, green, andblue, and the secondaries arered, yellow,cyan, and violet. - Source: Internet Complementary colors is the name given to opposite colors on the color wheel. Take a look at the color wheel image again and you’ll understand what we mean. An example of complementary colors or opposite colors on the complementary color wheel is red and green. The sharp contrast between two complementary colors makes designs and works of art pop. - Source: Internet You can also use the complementary color to make a hue less vibrant. The more you add, the more neutral it becomes. For instance, adding a green paint to a red one will create a burnt sienna; add a little more and it becomes a darker sienna. If you mix the two paints in equal parts, you will get a warm-toned dark brown. These neutrals can be manipulated further by mixing in white, grey, or black. - Source: Internet ‘I can wax poetic forever when considering green in an interior,’ says interior designer Ghislaine Viñas. ‘Green is one of those incredibly versatile colors that can be both soothing and activating – and used in combination can create a great balance.’ - Source: Internet To the left is the color wheel taught in art classes. The primary colorsare red, yellow, andblue. The secondary colors areorange, green, andviolet. The tertiary colors arescarlet, gold,chartreuse, cyan,indigo, and magenta. - Source: Internet ‘Pairing green with a vivid orange will give more energy to a space; contrasting complementary colors emphasizes the qualities of each and creates a bold statement look. I’d use a strong black, too, to give a solidly masculine mid-century modern scheme. It’s calming because it’s strong and looks very put together.’ says Annie Sloan. - Source: Internet Hugh Metcalf Deputy Editor As Livingetc’s deputy editor, Hugh is in constant communication with the greatest designers in the world.

The three primary colors are red, <strong>blue</strong>, and yellow. These three colors are essentially the parents of all the other colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Of course, your choice of <strong>green</strong> is equally as important at the color you pair it with. Lime <strong>green</strong>s are zesty and energetic, while sages are calm and relaxing. Emerald <strong>green</strong>s are sophisticated and luxurious, while mint <strong>green</strong> can be playful and fun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The complementary color is <strong>blue</strong>. Therefore, the split complementary colors are orange and <strong>green</strong>-yellow. What color complements <strong>blue</strong>? The complementary color is orange. Therefore, the split complementary colors are purple and <strong>blue</strong>-cyan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Using a color wheel, you can calculate the specific amount of split complementary color schemes. There are 12 color blocks, and each color has a complementary partner. This partner has its neighbor. For example, starting with the dominant color <strong>blue</strong>, you can go around the twelve-block wheel to determine the split complementary colors. There are ay variations for each color on the color wheel so your options are endless! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Lab color system defines a color by lightness along one axis (the Lin Lab) and hue along two separate a and b axes. One runs from red to <strong>green</strong>,and the other runs from yellow to <strong>blue</strong>. The idea is that no color can be redand <strong>green</strong> at the same time, or yellow and <strong>blue</strong> at the same time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>saturation (also known as chroma, or tone) refers to relative purity; when a pure, vivid, strong shade of red is mixed with a variable amount of white, weaker or paler reds are produced, each having the same hue but a different saturation; such paler colors are called unsaturated colors. You can define the amount of saturation of a given using a chromaticity diagram. For example, suppose you had a red color and you slowly increased the amount of <strong>blue</strong> and <strong>green</strong> light reaching the eye, then the mixture of the red, <strong>blue</strong> and <strong>green</strong> would contribute to the perception of white. White plus red would give pink. The hue would not have been altered, but the saturation would be lower - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We have discussed how to use the split complementary color theory to devise what works well together and how to choose a dominant base color. We have then learned how to choose additional colors to work as a support for the focus color. For example, you want to introduce a pattern to create texture in your color palette. When looking at a color scheme of yellow, <strong>green</strong>, and red-violet, the base color would be red-violet, and the <strong>green</strong> and yellow shades would be used as accent colors for patterned pillows or a patterned color throw. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is more of a contemporary color combination and can go well in a child’s bedroom as the colors are vibrant and modern, but not overpowering. You can add red-violet as a headboard or drawer panels. A floral comforter or duvet that brings in red-orange and <strong>green</strong>. You can also use a neutral color wall paint and curtains as a nice backdrop to all the colors. Consider adding white pillows with subtle designs that incorporate all three colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue&rsquo;s cool color temperature stands out sharply against the warm finish of wood floors, furnishings, or trim. For medium- to dark-tone wood finishes, choose a strong shade of <strong>blue</strong> that won&rsquo;t pale in comparison. In this open kitchen, deep azure cabinetry contrasts with richly stained wood floors to create a cozy, modern cooking space. Open shelving and large windows keep the dark <strong>blue</strong> cabinetry from overpowering the design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In order to understand what a split complementary color scheme is, we must first answer the question: “What is a complementary color scheme?” To help you understand, we will look at the basic color wheel. A color wheel has the primary colors which consist of <strong>blue</strong>, yellow, and red. It also contains secondary colors which are <strong>green</strong>, pink, violet, and orange. These colors are spread out to form a circle. T - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>: These four colors are all evenly spaced apart from one another on the color wheel. Red, orange, <strong>green</strong>, and <strong>blue</strong> are good examples. Square Colors : Using the color wheel again, these four colors are determined using a square shape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you are talking about paint, markers, or other pigments, magenta, yellow, and cyan are the true primary colors. Although cyan is close to <strong>blue</strong> and magenta is close to red, they are not the same colors. In addition, red and <strong>blue</strong> can be made from the CYM primary colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Neighbors on the color wheel, <strong>green</strong> and <strong>blue</strong> are cool colors that form a refreshing combination. Choose vibrant shades of these analogous colors on walls and furniture for a bold look. In this dramatic sitting room, vivid cerulean <strong>blue</strong> wall color is balanced by an equally bold apple <strong>green</strong>. Inspired by the artwork, textiles in a deep apricot geometric print accent the velvet club chairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There is something disconcerting about this wheel, in that the two squares(representing RGB and CMY) are not duals of each other, like RGB and CMY are.This has the consequence that complementary colors are not the same distancefrom each other: <strong>green</strong> and magenta and <strong>blue</strong> and yellow are four semitones apart,but red and cyan are five semitones apart. So, for the heck of it, we&rsquo;re gonnathrow in some more colors for no good reason, giving the color wheel on the right. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Green goes very well with natural textures, and in particular pale wood. A sea-<strong>green</strong> works so well with raw timber, for instance.&rsquo; explains Sarah. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue and red form an all-American pairing that suits nearly any space. In this cheerful fireplace area, a pair of crimson velvet chairs pop against navy patterned pillows and an inky <strong>blue</strong> accent wall, creating a dynamic look. For more formal spaces like the dining room, go for darker shades such as navy and maroon that read more sophisticated than patriotic. Lighter tones, including powder <strong>blue</strong> and salmon, work well in bathrooms or bedrooms to create a soft, comforting atmosphere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You will find <strong>green</strong> opposite red on the color wheel. Therefore, <strong>blue</strong>-<strong>green</strong> and <strong>green</strong>-yellow are the split complementary colors of red. What color complements orange? You will find <strong>blue</strong> opposite the color orange on the color wheel. Therefore, <strong>blue</strong>-violet and <strong>blue</strong>-<strong>green</strong> are the split complementary colors for orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At the heart of color theory, complementary colors are the opposite hues on the color wheel. In their most basic form, they are one primary color and the secondary color that is created by mixing the other two primaries. For instance, the complementary color to yellow is purple, which is a mix of <strong>blue</strong> and red. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Soft shades of <strong>blue</strong> naturally evoke calm feelings associated with the sea. Partner light <strong>blue</strong>s with a sandy-colored neutral or light-washed wood for a feeling reminiscent of the seashore. Repeat both tan and pale <strong>blue</strong> with fabrics, bedding, and furniture to create a relaxing retreat in a master or guest bedroom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You were probably first introduced to the most basic color theory concept back in elementary school when you were given a palette of primary colors to paint with. Red, <strong>blue</strong>, and yellow are primary colors— and they can’t be created through mixing colors. Mix them all together and you get brown. But mix them and you can create all other colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The kitchen is one of the main gathering spots of the house, so it warrants a color scheme the entire family can live with. Because orange sits opposite to <strong>blue</strong> on the color wheel, it&rsquo;s a natural complement to <strong>blue</strong>. This pleasing combination also offers an energizing contrast that&rsquo;s perfect for a bustling kitchen. Consider livening up white cabinetry and countertops by painting the kitchen island <strong>blue</strong>, then layer in hits of orange through stool seating, rugs, kitchen towels, and other accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Red and <strong>green</strong> aren’t the only colors with psychological power: The color wheel can also be sliced into warm and cool colors. People associate cooler colors like <strong>blue</strong> with peace and calm. Warm colors like red are more energetic and associated with passion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Introduce a dose of femininity with shades of pink, coral, or apricot. The palette of this cozy sitting room is inspired by the striped fabric on decorative pillows. The soft, watery <strong>blue</strong> is repeated on the painted walls, and the bright coral coats the cheerful entry door. The colorful combination is lively, inviting, and distinctly beachy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In neutral rooms, even a small dose of <strong>blue</strong> can add another layer of personality. If you prefer to stick to neutral paint colors and furnishings, bring in <strong>blue</strong> through small accessories, such as a table runner, decorative lamp, or a throw blanket. To maintain the neutral look, choose a soft, muted shade of <strong>blue</strong> that won&rsquo;t feel out of place. If you decide you love the color in the space, feel free to go bigger by repainting the walls or purchasing a <strong>blue</strong> accent chair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Green and <strong>blue</strong> have both had their moments, but why not go for the best of both worlds? Blue <strong>green</strong> paints are perfect for creating a serene, tranquil vibe in any room in your house. From robin&rsquo;s egg to teal to turquoise, <strong>blue</strong> <strong>green</strong>s come in a variety of shades. And while they add a lot of vibrant color to your space, you don&rsquo;t have to take a risk to use them in your home—they work in traditional spaces just as much as they do in eclectic, bold ones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yellow would be the complement of purple. So, split complementary colors would be yellow-<strong>green</strong> and yellow-orange. What color complements orange? Blue is the complementary color with <strong>blue</strong>-<strong>green</strong> and <strong>blue</strong>-purple or violet being the split complementary colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are six tertiary colors in all. These are the colors you get when you mix primary and secondary colors together, which is why they are known by two hued names. The tertiary colors are <strong>blue</strong>-<strong>green</strong>, red-violet, yellow-orange, red-orange, red-purple, <strong>blue</strong>-<strong>green</strong>, and yellow-<strong>green</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The traditional color wheel is recognized by most of us. However, there are various additional color theories we can use to determine split complementary colors. The three theories that are mostly used include the RYB or traditional color wheel, the CMYK model which is cyan, yellow, magenta, and black, and then the RGB model which is red, <strong>green</strong>, and <strong>blue</strong>. Here is what the RGB and CMYK color wheels look like: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Of course, my understanding of YIQ was lacking, and that color wheel doesnot resemble YIQ at all. YIQ actually looks a lot more like this color wheelinstead. The primaries are orange,<strong>green</strong>, cyan, andviolet. The secondaries arerose, yellow,aquamarine, and <strong>blue</strong>.The tertiaries are magenta,red, gold,chartreuse, two other <strong>green</strong>sI don&rsquo;t care to name,azure, and indigo. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>From yellow to <strong>blue</strong>, we have a pretty satisfactory progression. Which isgood, because the &ldquo;ribbons&rdquo; of these colors on the spectrum are pretty thin.However, before and after yellow and <strong>blue</strong>, the &ldquo;notes&rdquo; bunch up. We can fudgeit and bring those notes up and down, because we have some leeway with those(though not nearly half as much as I&rsquo;m kidding myself). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;From a color pairing perspective, of course this harmony extends to combining <strong>green</strong> with neutrals. As mentioned, <strong>green</strong> sits in the center of the wheel so can be combined with both cold and warm tones. As an example - combining verdigris <strong>green</strong> with a chalky, <strong>blue</strong>-toned grey will create a cool, calm scheme, whereas pairing it with a warmer, yellow-toned beige will create an earthy, outdoorsy feel.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Located on <strong>blue</strong>&rsquo;s side of the color wheel, purple is another cool color that makes a pleasing companion. Because the two tones are so similar, the resulting color scheme is both colorful and soothing. Pair rich purple with striking turquoise for a jewel-like effect in a bedroom or living room. If you prefer paler <strong>blue</strong> tones, opt for saturated shades of purple to avoid the washed-out look of too many pastels. You can also add contrast to a <strong>blue</strong> color scheme by choosing warmer purple tones, such as orchid as opposed to indigo, to counteract the coolness of <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Since teal is part of the <strong>blue</strong> color family, it helps to bring calmness and tranquility to a space. The color is also reminiscent of the seaside. Also having an undertone of <strong>green</strong>, it is a refreshing and renewing color that will combine nicely with its split complementary colors. Orange and teal are complementary colors, so these would add nice contrasting colors to a room. Just remember to bring in your orange and red colors as accent colors, so you do not overpower or add too much energy to a room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Even once you&rsquo;ve narrowed in on a color, it can be difficult to find the perfect shade. That&rsquo;s why we called in the professionals. Here, we&rsquo;ve rounded up the best <strong>blue</strong> <strong>green</strong> paints that interior designers love to help you find the right shade for your space, no matter your decor style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To the left is an attempt by me to unify the HSV/HSL/HSB color wheel withthe color wheel taught in art classes. The RGB primary and secondary colorsand traditional primary and secondary colors are all represented as primaryand secondary colors in this system. The primaries are red,yellow, cyan, andviolet, and the secondaries areorange, <strong>green</strong>,<strong>blue</strong>, and magenta(making this the dual of the &ldquo;Apple II Video Display Theory&rdquo; color wheel).The tertiaries are scarlet, gold,chartreuse, aquamarine,azure, indigo,purple, and rose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One other thing you will notice is that a pair of complementary colors is made up of one cool color and one warm color. Orange, reds, and yellows are the warm colors, while <strong>blue</strong>s, <strong>green</strong>s, and purples are the cool colors. This helps create what is known as simultaneous contrast, the highest contrasts available on the color wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Greens with a <strong>blue</strong> base are impactful, so introducing soft tones of clay white and chalky grey in furniture and accessories bring a calming feel,&rsquo; explains Sarah Spiteri, Livingetc&rsquo;s editorial director. &lsquo;Greens with a yellow undertone, such as olive, pop alongside gold or bronze, enhancing their warmth.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now let’s dive into how designers can use color theory to enhance their projects. Think about the last time you filled out a contact form on a website. Miss a field, and a red error message likely pops up. On the contrary, if you need to re-enter a password for verification, and you enter everything correctly, a <strong>green</strong> message signals you to proceed. In this case, not only does color communicate how to use your product, but also draws on psychology to evoke emotional responses (<strong>green</strong> = good, red = bad). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Split complementary colors can be located on a color wheel. Look for a specific color, for example, red, then the complementary color will be <strong>green</strong>. On either side of the <strong>green</strong>, you will find <strong>blue</strong>-<strong>green</strong> and yellow-<strong>green</strong>, and these are your split complementary colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You will find orange opposite <strong>blue</strong> on the color wheel. Therefore, red-orange and yellow-orange are the split complementary color for <strong>blue</strong>. What color complements purple? You will find yellow opposite the color purple on the color wheel. Therefore, yellow-orange and yellow-<strong>green</strong> are the split complementary colors for purple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If we wanted to keep red, <strong>green</strong>, and <strong>blue</strong> as primaries, this could be doneby promoting aquamarine to a secondary color, resulting in this color wheel.The primaries once again become red,<strong>green</strong>, and <strong>blue</strong>, but nowthere are two sets of secondaries, one being cyan,magenta, and yellow,with the other being a close approximation of traditional secondaries,orange, aquamarine,and violet. The tertiary colors arescarlet, gold,chartreuse, the two <strong>green</strong>swithout a name from the YIQ color wheel,azure, indigo,purple, and rose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can easily bring in colors using texture and different patterns. Consider a color combination of red-violet, <strong>green</strong>, and yellow. The red-violet is your base color, while the <strong>green</strong> and yellow colors are slightly muted and brought into the room using striped fabrics, pillows, and upholstery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While rich jewel-like <strong>green</strong>s and <strong>blue</strong>s work together whether, more vibrant, primary and pastel tones can also work in the right scheme. &lsquo;The color scheme for this kitchen is fresh, bold, bright and fun,&rsquo; says interior designer Cortney Bishop (opens in new tab). They key to making this combination work? &lsquo;Grounding the pastel palette,&rsquo; Cortney suggests. &lsquo;Be thoughtful to pick colors you can thread through the home in fabrics and other home accents - cabinetry, trimwork - for this.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Green and yellow are adjacent to each other on the color wheel, so rooms in this palette are harmonious and easy to live with. &lsquo;When pairing colors, we strive for a similar base - so there’s a relationship between shades,&rsquo; explains architect and interior designer Noa Santos, founder of Nainoa (opens in new tab) and designer of this refined <strong>green</strong> living room. &lsquo;In this case the colors, though different, feel like they are a part of the same family.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When thinking of the colors orange, <strong>blue</strong>-<strong>green</strong>, and red, they may seem a bit boring. But if we change the hue or tone of those colors, they may be a little less dull! For example, swap the <strong>blue</strong> for teal and the orange for a burnt orange! This changes the entire ensemble. Use one color as the dominant color in your split complementary color scheme, and then add the accent colors as accessories. The options are endless, so have fun! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A split complementary color scheme is simply a color theory method in which to calculate colors that will work well together using a color wheel. You begin to buy choosing your dominant color, in this case, we choose the color red. Our second color is across from red on the color wheel, <strong>green</strong>. When looking at the color <strong>green</strong>, on either side you will find yellow and <strong>blue</strong>. These become the split complementary colors of red. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>: This consists of base colors and three colors that are all the same distance from each other. There are two sets of complementary colors, for example, <strong>green</strong>, <strong>blue</strong>, orange, and red. Square Colors : These are four colors that are squarely spaced on the color wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Sage <strong>green</strong> is the optimal color choice right now. It harnesses the calming energy inherent in <strong>green</strong> but anchors it with an earthiness and depth not present in more vivid hues.&rsquo; explains Sarah Spiteri. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As a rule of thumb cooler-leaning <strong>green</strong>s and yellow-toned <strong>green</strong>s like lime, fern <strong>green</strong>s, jade <strong>green</strong>s and emerald <strong>green</strong>s work best with crisp true whites. You have more choice with more muted, dusky <strong>green</strong>s like sage and pistachio. They will usually work both with a bright white to add a freshness to these more muted tones or an off-white for a more warm, cocooning feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To the left is the HSV/HSL/HSB color wheel. The primary colors are the RGBprimaries, red, <strong>green</strong>,and <strong>blue</strong>. The secondary colors are the CMYK primaries,cyan, magenta, andyellow. The tertiary colors areorange, chartreuse,aquamarine, azure,violet, and rose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The complementary color to <strong>green</strong> is Magenta. Therefore, the split complementary colors are rose and purple. What color complements red? The complementary color for red in this instance will be cyan. Therefore, the split complementary colors would be <strong>blue</strong>-cyan and <strong>green</strong>-cyan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Green and pink are complementary colors, sitting opposite each other on the wheel. This means that the scheme is high impact,&rsquo; explains Sarah. Get your proportions right for a truly restorative space - a generous amount of <strong>green</strong> against touches of pink is gorgeous. Nature-inspired patterns, such as florals or botanicals, are particularly effective when decorating with this combination.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple and <strong>green</strong> may sound like a bold look but as Sarah says, it&rsquo;s one that &lsquo;can be very charming, particularly in a smaller room where you want to make an impact and embrace coziness. Botanical <strong>green</strong>s and jewel-toned emeralds look amazing with plum - these colors are a wonderful foil for each other.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Notice that red and <strong>green</strong> are three semitones apart, as are <strong>green</strong> and <strong>blue</strong>,and <strong>blue</strong> and F. Human beings have three types of cones in their retinas fordetecting color: one for red, one for <strong>green</strong>, and one for <strong>blue</strong>. Birds have afourth type of cone that detects ultraviolet light. Therefore F is ultraviolet,because reasons, and we can say F# is infrared if we like, or evensquant or octarine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When creating a space for interior design, using the concept of split complementary colors is extremely helpful. For example, you can use <strong>blue</strong> as your dominant color and look for which colors complement <strong>blue</strong>. The complementary colors will be yellow-orange and red-orange. The <strong>blue</strong> could be used as an accent wall, and then accessories could be done in the split complementary colors. Accessories could include items such as pillows, a vase, and lamp shades, the options are endless! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Let’s start with a quick complementary colors definition. On a standard RYB (red, yellow, <strong>blue</strong>) color wheel, complementary colors are those that sit directly across from each other. These create the highest possible contrast compared to any other pairings on the wheel—think of it as an “opposites attract” thing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When working with the color wheel, it is easy to determine what color complements purple. The purple block sits directly opposite the color yellow. This will be its ideal complementary color, but the split complementary color scheme will be purple with yellow-orange and yellow-<strong>green</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Color bias or color temperature is also important, and the complementary colors will be considered either cool or warm. Greens and <strong>blue</strong>s, as most of us know, are cool colors, while reds and oranges are warm colors. Complementary colors do not need to be just two hues! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;re a true-<strong>blue</strong> fan of the color, feel free to mix multiple shades of <strong>blue</strong> into a monochromatic scheme. To make sure the combo plays well together, look for <strong>blue</strong>s with similar undertones, such as <strong>blue</strong>-<strong>green</strong> turquoise and dark teal. Repeat the hues across walls, curtains, rugs, and other decor elements to create a rich, layered look. Use a variety of fabric textures and vary the scale of patterns to keep the design from looking stagnant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;One of my all-time favorite color schemes is a sage <strong>green</strong> with an earthy pale pink. These colors are all luxuriously rich and soothing, inviting you to be cozy and relaxed in your home.&rsquo; says color expert Annie Sloan (opens in new tab). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>o determine what your complementary color palette will be using a color wheel, decide on a dominant color for your project. For example, if you choose the color red, the opposite color to red on the color wheel will be <strong>green</strong>. These are complementary colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue and white form a crisp color combination that creates a clean feeling, which is ideal for spaces like the bathroom. Here, traditional elements, including beaded-board walls and hexagon floor tiles, take on a more contemporary feel when balanced by patterned <strong>blue</strong> wallpaper. The fresh bathroom color combination turns the small space into a focal point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cyan, Yellow, and Magenta are important colors, and some people don’t even know what they are. Some people might call magenta purple or pink and cyan a light <strong>blue</strong>. People are not taught the language they need to talk about colors. Any color can be made using cyan, yellow, magenta, and white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As this expert advice hopefully proves, there&rsquo;s a right tone and shade of almost every color that will work with versatile <strong>green</strong>. However, there are some shades that can be challenging to put with <strong>green</strong>, just for the connotations these colour combinations have. This tends to particularly apply to a <strong>green</strong> shade mixed from primary yellow and <strong>blue</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;In this case, the space needed to be exciting but also needed to have a soothing quality that the family could always enjoy,&rsquo; says Katie. &lsquo;We did this by softening the brighter values of the red and <strong>green</strong> by pulling in wood tones and by adding in warmth with the metal finishes. We knew that our best approach to using these bold colors was in knowing they will stand out but also keeping in mind that they need to feel like they belong.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Consider, yellow as your base color, so your complementary colors are then red-purple and <strong>blue</strong>-purple. You might want to use more of your split complementary colors and add in accents of yellow. In a room, maybe you can use yellow as various décor items like pillows or wall hangings. Let us use <strong>blue</strong> as another example, your complementary colors are then yellow-orange and red-orange. You can use <strong>blue</strong> as your base color and bring in the other colors as items throughout the room to bring in more energy and light. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The way the Apple II&rsquo;s video worked (what I called &ldquo;Apple II VideoDisplay Theory&rdquo;) was the subject of a discussion on comp.sys.apple2.I created the color wheel to the left during this discussion, based on myobservations. The primaries are magenta,orange, <strong>green</strong>, and<strong>blue</strong>, and the secondaries arered, yellow,cyan, and violet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Complementary colors is the name given to opposite colors on the color wheel. Take a look at the color wheel image again and you’ll understand what we mean. An example of complementary colors or opposite colors on the complementary color wheel is red and <strong>green</strong>. The sharp contrast between two complementary colors makes designs and works of art pop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can also use the complementary color to make a hue less vibrant. The more you add, the more neutral it becomes. For instance, adding a <strong>green</strong> paint to a red one will create a burnt sienna; add a little more and it becomes a darker sienna. If you mix the two paints in equal parts, you will get a warm-toned dark brown. These neutrals can be manipulated further by mixing in white, grey, or black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;I can wax poetic forever when considering <strong>green</strong> in an interior,&rsquo; says interior designer Ghislaine Viñas. &lsquo;Green is one of those incredibly versatile colors that can be both soothing and activating – and used in combination can create a great balance.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To the left is the color wheel taught in art classes. The primary colorsare red, yellow, and<strong>blue</strong>. The secondary colors areorange, <strong>green</strong>, andviolet. The tertiary colors arescarlet, gold,chartreuse, cyan,indigo, and magenta. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Pairing <strong>green</strong> with a vivid orange will give more energy to a space; contrasting complementary colors emphasizes the qualities of each and creates a bold statement look. I’d use a strong black, too, to give a solidly masculine mid-century modern scheme. It’s calming because it’s strong and looks very put together.&rsquo; says Annie Sloan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hugh Metcalf Deputy Editor As Livingetc&rsquo;s deputy editor, Hugh is in constant communication with the greatest designers in the world. This year, he has been out to Milan to meet the most innovative interiors brands and been reporting on new design ideas constantly for both the print and digital versions of Livingetc. He was able to use these contacts and this insight to get to the heart of what to pair with <strong>green</strong> right now. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Artists use this to their advantage all the time. For example, sunsets with gradients from deep <strong>blue</strong>s to bright oranges are more eye-catching because they rely on simultaneous contrast. Similarly, if your tube of red paint isn&rsquo;t bright enough, paint something <strong>green</strong> next to it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Note that <strong>green</strong> is not indicated in the figure; this is because materials that appear <strong>green</strong> actually absorb in the red and the <strong>blue</strong> (i.e., about 650 nm and 425 nm) band shape and color - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=http://www.tileideaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/blue_grey_bathroom_tiles_19.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="What Is The Complementary Color Of Blue Green - 15 Blue Green Paint Colors Designers Use for the Dreamiest Spaces">
