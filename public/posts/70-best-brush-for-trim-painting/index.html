As for further searchable items pertaining to best brush for trim painting, they will likewise have anything to do with What paint brush should I use? For a smooth finish, a perfect line and more!. 70 Things You Should Know About Best Brush For Trim Painting | Best Brush For Water-Based Paint Even in my own home, I chose to brush all of our trim when I painted it. It looks great and I am completely happy with it. To me, the difference between spraying and brushing was not worth the extra work. - Source: Internet My second favorite for interior painting is the angled Purdy XL in the Dale style. This brush is awesome for painting base board, door frames, window sash, door panels, and cabinets. If you clean it well after each use, the bristles stay soft and maintain shape for a long time. - Source: Internet It can be used with all paints and stains. It can be used for both interior and exterior projects. The bristle ends are tipped and flagged to help create crisp cut-in lines but also leave a smooth finish. It’s a wonderful brush to start with when building your collection! - Source: Internet I’ve grown very fond of using ceramic enamel paint on trim and baseboards. It comes in a semi-gloss or satin finish and dries to a hard, durable finish. It dries quickly and offers easy clean up. Our painter introduced me to this type of paint two years ago and it’s been my go-to choice of paint for trim since! - Source: Internet TIP 3. Select a brush that has multiple length bristles. The variations in the length of each bristle help create a slim tip not a blunt edge. It makes the cutting in corners and around trim and baseboards easier. - Source: Internet We’re interviewing painters for our new master suite and four additional bedrooms. We don’t want any of the trim to be rolled. Two painters we’ve spoken to only use brushes, but last night we met with someone and I felt I needed to specify brushes only. The gentleman responded that they first roll but then use a brush immediately so you can’t tell they were rolled. This is all new wood, and once you get that pebbly surface on wood, it’s hard to ge rid of. - Source: Internet The main thing that can wrong when using this type of brush is to put too much paint on your paintbrush. That will lead to globs, drips, or a build-up of paint as you drag your brush along your edge. That’s why we always like to wipe the excess paint off in the can AND brush a little extra off elsewhere on the wall or trim before pressing our brush to our edge. This helps make sure you have the right amount of paint on your brush when you begin cutting in. It make mean you don’t get full coverage in one coat, but that’s better than having lots of drips or globs. - Source: Internet NOTE: Be sure to apply a coat of primer before you begin painting. Latex based primer goes on latex paint and oil-based primer works best with oil based paints. If you are planning on painting a small spot or patch, or painting over compound used for repairing a small drywall patch, then consider buying a disposal and inexpensive paint brush. - Source: Internet A professional house painter will tell you that you can not use a paint brush made of natural bristles with Latex Paints. Natural Bristles don’t work well with latex paint because the natural paint brush bristles tend to soak up the water in the latex paint and the bristles on the brush will actually become limp. Natural Bristles work best with oil based paints or varnishes. - Source: Internet Trim and areas with an irregular shape must be painted with more precision than walls, where you can use heavy and deliberate strokes to cover more. Consider the trim’s size to choose the right paintbrush. This is where having a set of brushes comes in handy. - Source: Internet Using a roller is generally more efficient than using a paintbrush since you cover more area faster. This is true with big paint jobs like walls. However, a paint roller just won’t get into places like trim edges, so it is not always the most efficient option. - Source: Internet One of the hardest parts of painting is getting really clean, crisp lines. When you are painting a wall, it can be a struggle to make a perfect line along the trim and ceiling. I’ll tell you a secret: The paint brush that you use makes a HUGE difference! - Source: Internet At the end of the day, cutting a straight line is a skill achieved through experience and practice. A professional paint brush is an important part of this, but without skill and a steady hand, the cut lines will look wavy, regardless of the brush being used. However, these brushes are great options for achieving professional results with your painting project. - Source: Internet When you’re finished painting, work out any remaining paint on your brush by painting sheets of newspaper until it’s fairly dry. Clean the brush with water for latex paint and paint thinner for oil-based paint. Then wash the brush with soap and water and slap the brush against your hand to bring the bristles back into alignment. Lastly, wrap the brush in paper towel or a newspaper and secure it with tape or a rubber band. - Source: Internet And….finally! Here we are! Are you ready for the painting techniques for how to paint trim without brush strokes? I bet you didn’t know there were so many decisions to be made. But in reality, everything we talked about so far will set you up for success so that the next few tips and tricks are attainable. - Source: Internet You’ll want to start by gathering your materials. As we’ve already discussed, the materials you choose will determine how easily you can paint trim without brush strokes. If you choose low-quality brushes and paint, then your brush strokes will be more visible. - Source: Internet A paintbrush that is too wide will make it easier to make mistakes and get paint on the wall. Go for a smaller width, unless you live in a home with very thick molding. (Lucky you!) - Source: Internet WALL brushes are for longer strokes and help you cover more surface which makes them perfect for painting walls or ceilings. They have thicker bristles or filaments to hold more paint. Wall brushes are also designed with larger, thicker handles to reduce fatigue and assist in getting a nice long, smooth paint stroke. - Source: Internet The XL has nice flex and paint release when painting trim. When brushing door frames, using a premium leveling paint like Pro Classic, or Emerald urethane enamel, the paint lays out very nicely with minimal brush texture. The XL in the 2-inch, or 2 1/2-inch size, is my go-to brush for trim. - Source: Internet The polyester bristles on these brushes are easy to clean with water, but you’ll probably find yourself wanting to keep it fresh between coats. Luckily these short little brushes fit nicely in a snack-sized Ziploc bag. The tight seal keeps your brush from drying out – even days at a time! - Source: Internet Once you decide what type of paint you’d like to use, it’s time to decide what sheen to use on trim! The most common mistake for new DIYers is using the wrong sheen on trim and baseboards. If you choose to use a flat or matte sheen, then it will be much less durable. And if you have kids or pets, baseboards and trim take a beating! - Source: Internet In theory, spraying your trim is always going to leave you with a better finish. It will be smoother and leave a fantastic looking finish. In new construction, I always spray the trim, no questions asked. - Source: Internet If the trim is damaged, it might need more prep work. Cracks can be filled with paintable caulk. Scratches can be lightly sanded before painting. - Source: Internet Some paint brushes are created specifically for making really straight, crisp lines. Other paint brushes are made specifically for leaving really smooth finishes. The list goes on! - Source: Internet I decided to tackle this topic on the blog because we recently had all of our windows replaced! Much of the trim, which was already painted, got dinged up and marred, or had dirty spots from the install. Plus, some windows had the wrong trim color installed, that needed to be repainted. Bummer… - Source: Internet This angled brush is my absolute favorite for painting trim and walls. I have 4 of these brushes and I’ll never go back to a cheap brush. This brush makes painting trim so much easier and saves me so much time. - Source: Internet Synthetic brushes come in different materials, such as nylon, polyester and a blend of nylon and polyester. These brushes are easy to use and clean up well. Synthetic brushes work best for water-based paint. Natural-bristle brushes draw moisture out of the water-based paint, making it difficult to apply properly. - Source: Internet You have to use the right painting tool to ensure the best results. But choosing between a paint roller and a paintbrush is not always intuitive. So how do you choose between these two painting methods for your DIY projects? - Source: Internet Along those same lines, ensure that you are feathering out your start/stop points. Once you’ve finished a 2-3 foot section, move 2-3 feet down your trim and repeat, working backwards towards your already painted trim. Never start your brush stroke on already applied paint as it will show that starting point. - Source: Internet I’ve always been partial to the Purdy brand, having used their products for many years on my painting projects. While they’re not the best brushes on the market, if you take care of them, they’ll last through several paint jobs. Corona brushes are excellent too, but unfortunately, they’re not available at many stores. - Source: Internet Before painting trim, I always start by vacuuming the trim with the wand attachment on my vacuum. This removes a lot of the dust and dog hair. Then I use a microfiber cloth to remove the rest of the dust. - Source: Internet There is no magic or amazing tips here, just brush on your top coat using long even smooth strokes. Try to again find that sweet spot where you are applying plenty of top coat, but not so much that you have any runs. Avoid runs at all costs. - Source: Internet However, the cons of using oil based paint for trim often cause people to opt for latex. Oil based paint is odorous and is a more time intensive clean up. Plus, once you’ve painted with oil based paint, you should not paint overtop with latex as it won’t adhere well. So once you’ve chosen oil based paint for your trim, you’re all in! - Source: Internet When walking into your local home improvement store and heading down the paint aisles you’re usually hit with a huge array of choices for paint brushes. Big ones, small ones, black ones, white ones, choosing the right paint brush for your next house painting project can be easy with the following useful tips. We hope to help you spot the difference between the most used by professional house painters and the best quality bristles to get the painting done right. - Source: Internet Which is the right paint brush size to use. Most professional painters use a 2.5 inch brush as it is the handiest. The 2 inch brush is also convenient but in the end it is a personal preference that determines which is the right fit for you. - Source: Internet Slap off the excess paint and then cut in along the edges and on top/bottom of baseboards. Then, come back and fill in the middle. Hold your brush at an angle, and gently swipe your brush across the surface. Using this motion, rather than applying it straight on, will avoid any dab marks. - Source: Internet A paint brush is an important tool for any house painting project and professional painting results. It is equal in importance as picking out paint colours, knowing the type of paint sheen or finish to use and using the best quality paint products. Investing in the right paint brush makes all the difference in how the paint applies to the walls and ceilings, and a noticeable difference with every brush stroke. - Source: Internet Choose a brush that is wide enough to cover efficiently, yet narrow enough for control over the paint application. If you’re painting narrow trim, a wide brush doesn’t work well. A 2- to 2-1/2-inch brush is a good general size that works for a variety of projects. If you’re painting narrow trim or small spaces, opt for a 1-inch brush. Large, flat areas work best with a 4-inch brush so you can cover the surface faster. - Source: Internet The magic tool is the Purdy Clearcut Elite Paint Brush. Why is it so amazing? It has stiff bristles that help you create really crisp lines. It will help you easily navigate around trim, corners, ceilings and more. This is my second favorite Purdy paint brush (after the Nylox of course :)). - Source: Internet If you were painting kitchen cabinets, this is where I would talk about filling the grain of the wood to ensure the smoothest finish possible. But this is trim. Trust me, not worth the time and effort to fill the grain on your trim. - Source: Internet The most highly recommended sheens for trim are satin and semi-gloss. These are both durable options that clean up well. Satin has a slight luster that is less bold, yet still durable. Semi-gloss has a noticeable shine that helps trim work stand out more. - Source: Internet Next, repeat the same process with your finish coat of paint. Most trim only requires two coats of paint. If you are painting over a dark color and didn’t prime, it may require three. - Source: Internet A quality brush should be used to paint trim. There are several brands of paint brushes that I consider quality brushes, including Purdy, Zibra and Wooster. Overall, you want to make sure you buy a 2 to 2 1/2 inch angled brush for ease of use. I prefer soft bristles as well. The stiffer the bristles, the more brush strokes you will see. - Source: Internet I’ve painted a lot of trim over my 15-year painting career. I’ve brushed out trim in homes, I’ve sprayed trim and I’ve painted the trim in countless new construction homes. I have a lot of advice that will not only make your trim look amazing when completed, but will speed up your painting process and give you a finished product that will last for decades. - Source: Internet Do not fill gaps between the wall and the trim with spackle or gaps between trim boards. These gaps require a flexible caulk or they will crack almost immediately after the job is completed. But hold off on caulking, for now, caulking is step 6 for a reason. - Source: Internet I love this paintbrush for painting trim. I own about 4 of them because they’re my favorite paintbrush for latex paint. They’re great for cutting in paint as well! - Source: Internet In our last blog post, we discussed how to prep your walls for the best paint job . Now that your walls are ready to be transformed, you need to use the right paint brushes and applicators for a consistent, long-lasting finish. There are hundreds of different paint brushes and tools available today – how do you know which ones to choose? If you’re investing time and money into prepping and priming your walls, it only makes sense to purchase the right painting tools and do the job right. Before using any old brush, follow these tips on how to select the right painting tools. - Source: Internet One of the most overlooked elements for getting a professional finish when painting trim is caulking. Caulking fills in any gaps along the wall or window to give it a completed look. You can see the difference between trim that has been caulked and trim that hasn’t in my post on how to modernize a space with painted trim. - Source: Internet So it needed a fresh coat of paint. You can see how well the bathroom and dining room painted trim turned out. Now on to the rest of the house! - Source: Internet Some people would recommend using a similar method to paint trim as they use to paint walls. Cut in with a brush, roll on the middle. However, I find that using a roller to paint trim is more work than it’s worth. Typically, it is difficult to get clean lines when using two different tools on a small surface like trim work and baseboards. - Source: Internet Painting trim without brush strokes is possible due to your prep work. You want the surface of your trim to be as smooth as possible. Any high spots, splintering, or rough surfaces will show a different appearance in the paint and your brush strokes immediately. - Source: Internet No matter what type of paintbrush you choose, focus on the construction quality for the best results. Look for dense bristles throughout the ferrule. Test the brush by bending it back near the base. A solid paint brush springs back. A tapered design with a slim profile at the end and flagged tips allow for excellent control and even coverage. - Source: Internet Even though the process of painting trim is relatively simple, there are a surprising number of elements that go into getting a clean and smooth finish. New DIYers often grab the first can of paint they see on the shelf and hope for the best. But with these tips you’ll get it right the first time and avoid any long term regret. Because I’ll tell you what, you do NOT want to have to paint your trim twice. - Source: Internet If your trim is in decent shape and just needs a touch up, clean it well before painting. I use a microfiber cloth to remove any dust or dog hair. If it’s dirty, a damp cloth works well for cleaning the trim. - Source: Internet This makes a big difference when it comes to speeding up your job while maintaining a perfect finish. For large exterior surfaces, use a wide flat brush with a thickness of 3/4″ to 1″. To cut in at the corners of exterior and interior walls, use a thin brush with tapered edges. For woodwork and moulding, use brushes between 1″ and 2 1/2″ wide. And for window frames and trim, use angled sash brushes. - Source: Internet Next, get your materials ready. You will want to use a painting roller, paintbrushes, and mineral spirits or another paint thinner. You will also need small containers to clean your tools with mineral spirits or soap and water once you are done. - Source: Internet After you’ve prepared your trim for painting, you may need to prime it. If you are painting over raw wood, you will want to prime your trim before painting. This gives your final top coat the best adhesion and longevity. - Source: Internet The bristle ends affect how well the paint brush picks up paint and releases it onto the painted surface. Flagged or exploded bristles on higher-end brushes let you pick up more paint with each dip. The split ends also help the paint go on smoothly without brush marks. - Source: Internet The best paint brush for a smooth finish is the Purdy Nylox Glide brush. It has super soft bristles that do not leave brush marks. It’s perfect to use with latex paint. Projects that are perfect for this paint brush include painting cabinets, trim, furniture and doors. - Source: Internet Similarly, make sure not to over-brush. This simply means, once you’ve applied a stroke of paint, don’t brush back over it more than 2-3 times. If you do this, you will spread your paint too thin, causing brush strokes to be visible. - Source: Internet Using a quality paintbrush makes it a lot easier to cut in straight lines along trim edges and ceiling corners. Cheap brushes from the dollar store won’t last very long, and won’t produce neat lines like a premium brush. When you paint every day (like me), having a good angled paintbrush for cutting-in is a must. - Source: Internet The choice between natural and synthetic bristles is an important one. Natural bristles have a flagging or splitting at the tips, which helps produce a smooth finish and holds plenty of paint. Natural-bristle brushes are better suited for oil-based or solvent-based paints. The natural bristles are stronger, so they stand up to the chemicals and let you apply the paint without leaving marks. - Source: Internet When applying latex-based paint, it’s best to use brushes that have synthetic bristles. They hold their shape better and maintain proper stiffness. Even though quality polyester brushes are usually more expensive, they are well worth the initial cost. If you clean and store them properly, they will continue to apply paint smoothly for many years. - Source: Internet Quality paintbrushes are much easier to clean and last a lot longer than cheap brushes. They allow you to paint without brush strokes. In fact, a good quality paintbrush almost does the work for you! - Source: Internet Tip: If you have an old brush that’s turned stiff you can still bring it back to life. Simply soak it in hot vinegar for about half hour. It will soften most of the paint residue and restore the paint brush for you to be able to use again. - Source: Internet Most latex paints will clean up easily with some warm water. Just rinse it until no paint remains on the bristles, shake off the excess water and leave to air dry. If using oil paints then the paint brush needs to be cleaned with a paint thinner. Avoid soaking the brush past the metal band in the middle that holds the bristles from falling out as it may cause damage to the brush and the bristles may fall out. Check the labels on any paint cans or solvents or special directions. - Source: Internet Caulking the gaps in your trim vastly improves the final look of your painted trim. Gaps show up as a black contrast to your white paint and the caulk makes the installation look perfect. It also allows for a razor sharp tape lines when you go to paint your walls. - Source: Internet Try one on for size at the store before you buy and see which one feels most comfortable in your hand. Note that if your using a quart of a paint can the 2.5 is the largest you will be able to fit into the can. Consider purchasing an angled paint brush to help you cut straight lines around the windows, doors, molding and ceilings. - Source: Internet TIP 1. The most used paint brush by professional house painters is a 2.5 inch brush. Because of it’s angled bristles it makes a sharp tip for straight cut lines when cutting in corners or for around trim. - Source: Internet I would love to meet someone who loves painting trim.

It looks great and I am completely happy with it. To me, the difference between spraying and <strong>brush</strong>ing was not worth the extra work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>My second favorite for interior painting is the angled Purdy XL in the Dale style. This <strong>brush</strong> is awesome for painting base board, door frames, window sash, door panels, and cabinets. If you clean it well after each use, the bristles stay soft and maintain shape for a long time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It can be used with all paints and stains. It can be used for both interior and exterior projects. The bristle ends are tipped and flagged to help create crisp cut-in lines but also leave a smooth finish. It’s a wonderful <strong>brush</strong> to start with when building your collection! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I’ve grown very fond of using ceramic enamel paint on <strong>trim</strong> and baseboards. It comes in a semi-gloss or satin finish and dries to a hard, durable finish. It dries quickly and offers easy clean up. Our painter introduced me to this type of paint two years ago and it’s been my go-to choice of paint for <strong>trim</strong> since! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>TIP 3. Select a <strong>brush</strong> that has multiple length bristles. The variations in the length of each bristle help create a slim tip not a blunt edge. It makes the cutting in corners and around <strong>trim</strong> and baseboards easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We&rsquo;re interviewing painters for our new master suite and four additional bedrooms. We don&rsquo;t want any of the <strong>trim</strong> to be rolled. Two painters we&rsquo;ve spoken to only use <strong>brush</strong>es, but last night we met with someone and I felt I needed to specify <strong>brush</strong>es only. The gentleman responded that they first roll but then use a <strong>brush</strong> immediately so you can&rsquo;t tell they were rolled. This is all new wood, and once you get that pebbly surface on wood, it&rsquo;s hard to ge rid of. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The main thing that can wrong when using this type of <strong>brush</strong> is to put too much paint on your paint<strong>brush</strong>. That will lead to globs, drips, or a build-up of paint as you drag your <strong>brush</strong> along your edge. That’s why we always like to wipe the excess paint off in the can AND <strong>brush</strong> a little extra off elsewhere on the wall or <strong>trim</strong> before pressing our <strong>brush</strong> to our edge. This helps make sure you have the right amount of paint on your <strong>brush</strong> when you begin cutting in. It make mean you don’t get full coverage in one coat, but that’s better than having lots of drips or globs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>NOTE: Be sure to apply a coat of primer before you begin painting. Latex based primer goes on latex paint and oil-based primer works best with oil based paints. If you are planning on painting a small spot or patch, or painting over compound used for repairing a small drywall patch, then consider buying a disposal and inexpensive paint <strong>brush</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A professional house painter will tell you that you can not use a paint <strong>brush</strong> made of natural bristles with Latex Paints. Natural Bristles don’t work well with latex paint because the natural paint <strong>brush</strong> bristles tend to soak up the water in the latex paint and the bristles on the <strong>brush</strong> will actually become limp. Natural Bristles work best with oil based paints or varnishes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Trim and areas with an irregular shape must be painted with more precision than walls, where you can use heavy and deliberate strokes to cover more. Consider the <strong>trim</strong>’s size to choose the right paint<strong>brush</strong>. This is where having a set of <strong>brush</strong>es comes in handy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Using a roller is generally more efficient than using a paint<strong>brush</strong> since you cover more area faster. This is true with big paint jobs like walls. However, a paint roller just won’t get into places like <strong>trim</strong> edges, so it is not always the most efficient option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the hardest parts of painting is getting really clean, crisp lines. When you are painting a wall, it can be a struggle to make a perfect line along the <strong>trim</strong> and ceiling. I’ll tell you a secret: The paint <strong>brush</strong> that you use makes a HUGE difference! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At the end of the day, cutting a straight line is a skill achieved through experience and practice. A professional paint <strong>brush</strong> is an important part of this, but without skill and a steady hand, the cut lines will look wavy, regardless of the <strong>brush</strong> being used. However, these <strong>brush</strong>es are great options for achieving professional results with your painting project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you’re finished painting, work out any remaining paint on your <strong>brush</strong> by painting sheets of newspaper until it’s fairly dry. Clean the <strong>brush</strong> with water for latex paint and paint thinner for oil-based paint. Then wash the <strong>brush</strong> with soap and water and slap the <strong>brush</strong> against your hand to bring the bristles back into alignment. Lastly, wrap the <strong>brush</strong> in paper towel or a newspaper and secure it with tape or a rubber band. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>And….finally! Here we are! Are you ready for the painting techniques for how to paint <strong>trim</strong> without <strong>brush</strong> strokes? I bet you didn’t know there were so many decisions to be made. But in reality, everything we talked about so far will set you up for success so that the next few tips and tricks are attainable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You’ll want to start by gathering your materials. As we’ve already discussed, the materials you choose will determine how easily you can paint <strong>trim</strong> without <strong>brush</strong> strokes. If you choose low-quality <strong>brush</strong>es and paint, then your <strong>brush</strong> strokes will be more visible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A paint<strong>brush</strong> that is too wide will make it easier to make mistakes and get paint on the wall. Go for a smaller width, unless you live in a home with very thick molding. (Lucky you!) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>WALL <strong>brush</strong>es are for longer strokes and help you cover more surface which makes them perfect for painting walls or ceilings. They have thicker bristles or filaments to hold more paint. Wall <strong>brush</strong>es are also designed with larger, thicker handles to reduce fatigue and assist in getting a nice long, smooth paint stroke. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The XL has nice flex and paint release when painting <strong>trim</strong>. When <strong>brush</strong>ing door frames, using a premium leveling paint like Pro Classic, or Emerald urethane enamel, the paint lays out very nicely with minimal <strong>brush</strong> texture. The XL in the 2-inch, or 2 1/2-inch size, is my go-to <strong>brush</strong> for <strong>trim</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The polyester bristles on these <strong>brush</strong>es are easy to clean with water, but you’ll probably find yourself wanting to keep it fresh between coats. Luckily these short little <strong>brush</strong>es fit nicely in a snack-sized Ziploc bag. The tight seal keeps your <strong>brush</strong> from drying out – even days at a time! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once you decide what type of paint you’d like to use, it’s time to decide what sheen to use on <strong>trim</strong>! The most common mistake for new DIYers is using the wrong sheen on <strong>trim</strong> and baseboards. If you choose to use a flat or matte sheen, then it will be much less durable. And if you have kids or pets, baseboards and <strong>trim</strong> take a beating! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In theory, spraying your <strong>trim</strong> is always going to leave you with a better finish. It will be smoother and leave a fantastic looking finish. In new construction, I always spray the <strong>trim</strong>, no questions asked. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If the <strong>trim</strong> is damaged, it might need more prep work. Cracks can be filled with paintable caulk. Scratches can be lightly sanded before painting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some paint <strong>brush</strong>es are created specifically for making really straight, crisp lines. Other paint <strong>brush</strong>es are made specifically for leaving really smooth finishes. The list goes on! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I decided to tackle this topic on the blog because we recently had all of our windows replaced! Much of the <strong>trim</strong>, which was already painted, got dinged up and marred, or had dirty spots from the install. Plus, some windows had the wrong <strong>trim</strong> color installed, that needed to be repainted. Bummer… - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This angled <strong>brush</strong> is my absolute favorite for painting <strong>trim</strong> and walls. I have 4 of these <strong>brush</strong>es and I’ll never go back to a cheap <strong>brush</strong>. This <strong>brush</strong> makes painting <strong>trim</strong> so much easier and saves me so much time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Synthetic <strong>brush</strong>es come in different materials, such as nylon, polyester and a blend of nylon and polyester. These <strong>brush</strong>es are easy to use and clean up well. Synthetic <strong>brush</strong>es work best for water-based paint. Natural-bristle <strong>brush</strong>es draw moisture out of the water-based paint, making it difficult to apply properly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You have to use the right painting tool to ensure the best results. But choosing between a paint roller and a paint<strong>brush</strong> is not always intuitive. So how do you choose between these two painting methods for your DIY projects? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Along those same lines, ensure that you are feathering out your start/stop points. Once you’ve finished a 2-3 foot section, move 2-3 feet down your <strong>trim</strong> and repeat, working backwards towards your already painted <strong>trim</strong>. Never start your <strong>brush</strong> stroke on already applied paint as it will show that starting point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I&rsquo;ve always been partial to the Purdy brand, having used their products for many years on my painting projects. While they&rsquo;re not the best <strong>brush</strong>es on the market, if you take care of them, they&rsquo;ll last through several paint jobs. Corona <strong>brush</strong>es are excellent too, but unfortunately, they&rsquo;re not available at many stores. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before painting <strong>trim</strong>, I always start by vacuuming the <strong>trim</strong> with the wand attachment on my vacuum. This removes a lot of the dust and dog hair. Then I use a microfiber cloth to remove the rest of the dust. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There is no magic or amazing tips here, just <strong>brush</strong> on your top coat using long even smooth strokes. Try to again find that sweet spot where you are applying plenty of top coat, but not so much that you have any runs. Avoid runs at all costs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, the cons of using oil based paint for <strong>trim</strong> often cause people to opt for latex. Oil based paint is odorous and is a more time intensive clean up. Plus, once you’ve painted with oil based paint, you should not paint overtop with latex as it won’t adhere well. So once you’ve chosen oil based paint for your <strong>trim</strong>, you’re all in! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When walking into your local home improvement store and heading down the paint aisles you’re usually hit with a huge array of choices for paint <strong>brush</strong>es. Big ones, small ones, black ones, white ones, choosing the right paint <strong>brush</strong> for your next house painting project can be easy with the following useful tips. We hope to help you spot the difference between the most used by professional house painters and the best quality bristles to get the painting done right. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Which is the right paint <strong>brush</strong> size to use. Most professional painters use a 2.5 inch <strong>brush</strong> as it is the handiest. The 2 inch <strong>brush</strong> is also convenient but in the end it is a personal preference that determines which is the right fit for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Slap off the excess paint and then cut in along the edges and on top/bottom of baseboards. Then, come back and fill in the middle. Hold your <strong>brush</strong> at an angle, and gently swipe your <strong>brush</strong> across the surface. Using this motion, rather than applying it straight on, will avoid any dab marks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A paint <strong>brush</strong> is an important tool for any house painting project and professional painting results. It is equal in importance as picking out paint colours, knowing the type of paint sheen or finish to use and using the best quality paint products. Investing in the right paint <strong>brush</strong> makes all the difference in how the paint applies to the walls and ceilings, and a noticeable difference with every <strong>brush</strong> stroke. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Choose a <strong>brush</strong> that is wide enough to cover efficiently, yet narrow enough for control over the paint application. If you&rsquo;re painting narrow <strong>trim</strong>, a wide <strong>brush</strong> doesn&rsquo;t work well. A 2- to 2-1/2-inch <strong>brush</strong> is a good general size that works for a variety of projects. If you&rsquo;re painting narrow <strong>trim</strong> or small spaces, opt for a 1-inch <strong>brush</strong>. Large, flat areas work best with a 4-inch <strong>brush</strong> so you can cover the surface faster. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The magic tool is the Purdy Clearcut Elite Paint Brush. Why is it so amazing? It has stiff bristles that help you create really crisp lines. It will help you easily navigate around <strong>trim</strong>, corners, ceilings and more. This is my second favorite Purdy paint <strong>brush</strong> (after the Nylox of course :)). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you were painting kitchen cabinets, this is where I would talk about filling the grain of the wood to ensure the smoothest finish possible. But this is <strong>trim</strong>. Trust me, not worth the time and effort to fill the grain on your <strong>trim</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The most highly recommended sheens for <strong>trim</strong> are satin and semi-gloss. These are both durable options that clean up well. Satin has a slight luster that is less bold, yet still durable. Semi-gloss has a noticeable shine that helps <strong>trim</strong> work stand out more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Next, repeat the same process with your finish coat of paint. Most <strong>trim</strong> only requires two coats of paint. If you are painting over a dark color and didn’t prime, it may require three. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A quality <strong>brush</strong> should be used to paint <strong>trim</strong>. There are several brands of paint <strong>brush</strong>es that I consider quality <strong>brush</strong>es, including Purdy, Zibra and Wooster. Overall, you want to make sure you buy a 2 to 2 1/2 inch angled <strong>brush</strong> for ease of use. I prefer soft bristles as well. The stiffer the bristles, the more <strong>brush</strong> strokes you will see. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I’ve painted a lot of <strong>trim</strong> over my 15-year painting career. I’ve <strong>brush</strong>ed out <strong>trim</strong> in homes, I’ve sprayed <strong>trim</strong> and I’ve painted the <strong>trim</strong> in countless new construction homes. I have a lot of advice that will not only make your <strong>trim</strong> look amazing when completed, but will speed up your painting process and give you a finished product that will last for decades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Do not fill gaps between the wall and the <strong>trim</strong> with spackle or gaps between <strong>trim</strong> boards. These gaps require a flexible caulk or they will crack almost immediately after the job is completed. But hold off on caulking, for now, caulking is step 6 for a reason. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I love this paint<strong>brush</strong> for painting <strong>trim</strong>. I own about 4 of them because they’re my favorite paint<strong>brush</strong> for latex paint. They’re great for cutting in paint as well! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In our last blog post, we discussed how to prep your walls for the best paint job . Now that your walls are ready to be transformed, you need to use the right paint <strong>brush</strong>es and applicators for a consistent, long-lasting finish. There are hundreds of different paint <strong>brush</strong>es and tools available today – how do you know which ones to choose? If you’re investing time and money into prepping and priming your walls, it only makes sense to purchase the right painting tools and do the job right. Before using any old <strong>brush</strong>, follow these tips on how to select the right painting tools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the most overlooked elements for getting a professional finish when painting <strong>trim</strong> is caulking. Caulking fills in any gaps along the wall or window to give it a completed look. You can see the difference between <strong>trim</strong> that has been caulked and <strong>trim</strong> that hasn’t in my post on how to modernize a space with painted <strong>trim</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So it needed a fresh coat of paint. You can see how well the bathroom and dining room painted <strong>trim</strong> turned out. Now on to the rest of the house! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some people would recommend using a similar method to paint <strong>trim</strong> as they use to paint walls. Cut in with a <strong>brush</strong>, roll on the middle. However, I find that using a roller to paint <strong>trim</strong> is more work than it’s worth. Typically, it is difficult to get clean lines when using two different tools on a small surface like <strong>trim</strong> work and baseboards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Painting <strong>trim</strong> without <strong>brush</strong> strokes is possible due to your prep work. You want the surface of your <strong>trim</strong> to be as smooth as possible. Any high spots, splintering, or rough surfaces will show a different appearance in the paint and your <strong>brush</strong> strokes immediately. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>No matter what type of paint<strong>brush</strong> you choose, focus on the construction quality for the best results. Look for dense bristles throughout the ferrule. Test the <strong>brush</strong> by bending it back near the base. A solid paint <strong>brush</strong> springs back. A tapered design with a slim profile at the end and flagged tips allow for excellent control and even coverage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Even though the process of painting <strong>trim</strong> is relatively simple, there are a surprising number of elements that go into getting a clean and smooth finish. New DIYers often grab the first can of paint they see on the shelf and hope for the best. But with these tips you’ll get it right the first time and avoid any long term regret. Because I’ll tell you what, you do NOT want to have to paint your <strong>trim</strong> twice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your <strong>trim</strong> is in decent shape and just needs a touch up, clean it well before painting. I use a microfiber cloth to remove any dust or dog hair. If it’s dirty, a damp cloth works well for cleaning the <strong>trim</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This makes a big difference when it comes to speeding up your job while maintaining a perfect finish. For large exterior surfaces, use a wide flat <strong>brush</strong> with a thickness of 3/4″ to 1″. To cut in at the corners of exterior and interior walls, use a thin <strong>brush</strong> with tapered edges. For woodwork and moulding, use <strong>brush</strong>es between 1″ and 2 1/2″ wide. And for window frames and <strong>trim</strong>, use angled sash <strong>brush</strong>es. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Next, get your materials ready. You will want to use a painting roller, paint<strong>brush</strong>es, and mineral spirits or another paint thinner. You will also need small containers to clean your tools with mineral spirits or soap and water once you are done. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After you’ve prepared your <strong>trim</strong> for painting, you may need to prime it. If you are painting over raw wood, you will want to prime your <strong>trim</strong> before painting. This gives your final top coat the best adhesion and longevity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The bristle ends affect how well the paint <strong>brush</strong> picks up paint and releases it onto the painted surface. Flagged or exploded bristles on higher-end <strong>brush</strong>es let you pick up more paint with each dip. The split ends also help the paint go on smoothly without <strong>brush</strong> marks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best paint <strong>brush</strong> for a smooth finish is the Purdy Nylox Glide <strong>brush</strong>. It has super soft bristles that do not leave <strong>brush</strong> marks. It’s perfect to use with latex paint. Projects that are perfect for this paint <strong>brush</strong> include painting cabinets, <strong>trim</strong>, furniture and doors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Similarly, make sure not to over-<strong>brush</strong>. This simply means, once you’ve applied a stroke of paint, don’t <strong>brush</strong> back over it more than 2-3 times. If you do this, you will spread your paint too thin, causing <strong>brush</strong> strokes to be visible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Using a quality paint<strong>brush</strong> makes it a lot easier to cut in straight lines along <strong>trim</strong> edges and ceiling corners. Cheap <strong>brush</strong>es from the dollar store won&rsquo;t last very long, and won&rsquo;t produce neat lines like a premium <strong>brush</strong>. When you paint every day (like me), having a good angled paint<strong>brush</strong> for cutting-in is a must. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The choice between natural and synthetic bristles is an important one. Natural bristles have a flagging or splitting at the tips, which helps produce a smooth finish and holds plenty of paint. Natural-bristle <strong>brush</strong>es are better suited for oil-based or solvent-based paints. The natural bristles are stronger, so they stand up to the chemicals and let you apply the paint without leaving marks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When applying latex-based paint, it’s best to use <strong>brush</strong>es that have synthetic bristles. They hold their shape better and maintain proper stiffness. Even though quality polyester <strong>brush</strong>es are usually more expensive, they are well worth the initial cost. If you clean and store them properly, they will continue to apply paint smoothly for many years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Quality paint<strong>brush</strong>es are much easier to clean and last a lot longer than cheap <strong>brush</strong>es. They allow you to paint without <strong>brush</strong> strokes. In fact, a good quality paint<strong>brush</strong> almost does the work for you! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Tip: If you have an old <strong>brush</strong> that’s turned stiff you can still bring it back to life. Simply soak it in hot vinegar for about half hour. It will soften most of the paint residue and restore the paint <strong>brush</strong> for you to be able to use again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most latex paints will clean up easily with some warm water. Just rinse it until no paint remains on the bristles, shake off the excess water and leave to air dry. If using oil paints then the paint <strong>brush</strong> needs to be cleaned with a paint thinner. Avoid soaking the <strong>brush</strong> past the metal band in the middle that holds the bristles from falling out as it may cause damage to the <strong>brush</strong> and the bristles may fall out. Check the labels on any paint cans or solvents or special directions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Caulking the gaps in your <strong>trim</strong> vastly improves the final look of your painted <strong>trim</strong>. Gaps show up as a black contrast to your white paint and the caulk makes the installation look perfect. It also allows for a razor sharp tape lines when you go to paint your walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Try one on for size at the store before you buy and see which one feels most comfortable in your hand. Note that if your using a quart of a paint can the 2.5 is the largest you will be able to fit into the can. Consider purchasing an angled paint <strong>brush</strong> to help you cut straight lines around the windows, doors, molding and ceilings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>TIP 1. The most used paint <strong>brush</strong> by professional house painters is a 2.5 inch <strong>brush</strong>.
