Foster worked as an aide to <strong>architect</strong>s John E. Beardshaw & Partners in the 1950s. The other employees told him that if he wanted to work as an <strong>architect</strong>, he needed to create a portfolio of designs that included various points of view and workshop designs from Beardshaw’s business. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Foster relocated to the United Kingdom in 1963 and founded his own <strong>architect</strong>ural firm. Foster also worked on numerous projects with Richard Buckminster Fuller, the American <strong>architect</strong>, that became the catalyst in the formation of an ecologically conscious approach to <strong>architect</strong>ure. Initial designs by Foster revealed a complex, high-tech philosophy, yet since the turn of the century, his work has developed into more sharp-edged modernism. Foster presently serves on the board of Article 25, a charity that designs, builds, and manages creative, efficient, and sustainable structures in some of the world’s most hostile and volatile areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://petrofilm.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/extraordinary-renditions-map_B.33855202_std.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="How Much Money Does An Architect Make In South Africa - How Much Do Architects Earn Per Month"><p>Here are a few tips to help you find information about What do you do and how much do you get paid?
