Big wall decor, be it an oversized clock or a piece of DIY wall art, will anchor the room and take it from cramped to cozy. - Source: Internet A little wallpaper can go a long way. “Patterned wallpaper turns the entire wall into an art piece,” says Smith. “If you don’t want to commit to wallpaper, my favorite solution is to buy some funky or fun gift wrap and then frame pieces of it in a series, which gives you flexibility to change your wall décor often and play around with new aesthetics without breaking the bank.” - Source: Internet As I have shown you with floor plans, you can create a scale elevation drawing of your long wall plan.

However, try this themed grid approach if you want a tailored and organized gallery wall. This is more like a symmetrical and streamlined artwork display that offers a polished look. Otherwise, you can use frames in different shapes, colors, and sizes and put them in any manner (See the above image for reference). - Source: Internet Gone are the days when the wainscoting was considered stuffy and bulky.

Floating shelves create extra storage, and you can arrange them in many ways, offering an opportunity for functional decor. Other decorations like metal wall art or an oversized clock can fill empty space and add character to your living room. - Source: Internet 19 of 20 Go Wild With Paint Hector Manuel Sanchez Birmingham decorator Fran Keenan hand-painted this large-scale, Greek-key motif in a repeated pattern to look much like a true wallpaper. She’d intended to re-cover her sister’s old zebra-print sofa, but the more she looked at it, the more she thought it just worked. “There’s a lot of fun in not overthinking,” she adds. - Source: Internet Now, when it comes to large walls – that’s often perceived as a challenge. In all fairness, they can be intimidating; it’s really a problem of plenty. There are so many options when it comes to interior decoration and design, that making a decision (and the right one at that) can seem impossible. - Source: Internet When it comes to filling up the bare walls in your living room, you can also choose to create a well-organized and finely tailored gallery wall.

Glenn; Styling: Buffy Hargett Miller Covering an entire living room in luxe wallpaper is pricey. In her San Antonio home, designer Nicola McLaughlin instead framed two panels of de Gourney’s Badminton pattern to lend a refined accent. Gold and black frames contrast with the blue hues in this space. - Source: Internet This approach of one large painting often beats out the common layout of multiple small frames on one wall. It commands attention instantly and makes a bold statement. And, if you’re all about that minimalist vibe, this method of decoration works perfectly. - Source: Internet Take paint for instance. Painting a large wall in a living room in all one colour doesn’t do much to make the space look less huge, but using a variety of living room paint ideas in different ways can trick the eye into thinking it’s smaller than it is. The same goes for wallpaper – one repetitive print on a large space can feel a little never ending. - Source: Internet Entertainment walls have become an important living room feature, and now provide stiff competition for the traditional feature fireplace. TV lovers want their box in pride of place to achieve the optimum viewing angle, so increasingly the lounge fireplace is being bumped to a side wall or corner adornment. This interior reshuffle leaves space to imagine a new living room feature wall with the TV at its centre. It also presents extra requirements for storage of receiver and recorder equipment, plus movie media, consoles and games. So how do we achieve a modern vista beautiful enough to take the place of a mantelpiece, and on what do we now display our treasured items? - Source: Internet 02 of 20 Make a Bold Statement Evan Sklar A vibrant painting pops off the pastel blue walls of this pool house in Lexington, Kentucky.

Though Brittney’s fond of the print, she’s not so keen on its color scheme. “Even the things you don’t love can work in the right space,” she says. - Source: Internet It’s easy to get lost in all the complex decorating ideas out there, but you simply can’t go wrong with the basics. With their ability to brighten a room and show off a person’s unique tastes, paintings have always been a go-to for sprucing up blank walls. Whether you go landscape or portrait, contemporary or impressionist, a handpicked piece of art is the perfect way to fill your living room with character. - Source: Internet An oversized wall shouldn’t be thought of in isolation either. It should be the anchor that ties the room decor together. ‘When I see a room with one strong, dominant wall,’ agrees Bethan Harwood, Partner \u0026 Home Design Stylist at John Lewis \u0026 Partners (opens in new tab), ‘I’m itching to change up the other elements to balance it and bring the room together.’ - Source: Internet Light fixtures are an often-overlooked way to make a statement, so keep an eye out for attention-grabbing sconces, lamps, or overhead fixtures. For a painting or fireplace smack in the middle of the wall without much room on either side, try placing two intricately designed sconces on either side. By framing the feature in this way, you subtly draw attention toward it while filling in the gaps. - Source: Internet Plus, installing some glass sconces, such as the Murano Glass Chandelier and some floating shelves, can transform the entire space and brighten up the room. They’ll add a dramatic visual dimension to the room along with the sleek TV design.

A pair of sconces also goes perfectly well with modern and traditional living room styles. - Source: Internet For instance, you can create different geometric shapes and patterns, such as board and batten, as part of your wood plank design. Not only that, but you can also use different color palettes to decorate the wooden planks to create a colorful and cohesive look. Hence, you can use any color scheme to amp up the visual appearance of your wood panel design. - Source: Internet If you have a large wall in your living room that’s needing… well, a bit of love, you’ve come to the right place. Having a big empty wall is much like a blank canvas. Unless you have a clear idea on the look you’re planning to create, knowing how to break up a large wall in a living room can almost be harder to achieve than decorating in a far smaller space. - Source: Internet A single wall shelf, for example, offers a wealth of opportunities. Try leaning a set of art prints or your record collection on it to create a laidback display of your tastes and interests. Incorporating pieces at varying heights, like a slightly taller lamp or a few vining plants, engages the eye and creates visual interest without over-complicating the space. - Source: Internet Can’t find (or afford) any large-scale artwork to hang on your wall? Klugh says creating a salon-style display with smaller pieces is the next best thing. “Filling up your living room wall with a collage allows you to bring multiple pieces together to create one big art piece,” she says. “Depending on the sizes you are working with, the collage can be linear or organic—just remember to plan it out before putting it on the wall to ensure you achieve the desired effect.” - Source: Internet To introduce depth and dimension, Klugh recommends adding an architectural element, like baseboards or crown molding. “Buy some wood planks from your local home improvement store and install them on the wall in the pattern of your choice to add a layer of interest,” she says. “Adding an architectural element to your wall will help infuse some character into your space.” If you can’t add trims or moldings to your wall, Smith says floating shelves are a smart (and storage-savvy) alternative. - Source: Internet If you have floating shelves in your home, consider lining them with your favorite photos. “Adding floating shelves to the walls will allow you to use the space for storage,” adds Sara Barney of BANDD DESIGN. In addition to photos, you can use the area to show off pieces of art and other decorative accents in a functional way. - Source: Internet Wake up dull living room walls with creative decor ideas.

Coordinated colors allows the space to feel more cohesive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For instance, if you have a white living room <strong>wall</strong>, a cylindrical chandelier can help in enhancing the visual dimension and filling up the empty space in the room.

Or, maybe the subsequent owners might want to rip it all out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You could also do different colors and styling. This would be for a slightly smaller <strong>wall</strong>. I think it’s best if there’s a little breathing room, like 6″-12″, on either side of the piece of furniture.

She scored all the framed pieces from local antiques malls. &ldquo;I want everyone to realize that you can arrange something interesting out of imperfect finds,&rdquo; she says. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When choosing a piece, be mindful of the space on the <strong>wall</strong> you expect it to fill. If the painting is too big, it may overwhelm the room or be hard to situate nicely. Make sure to leave some breathing room between the painting and the ceiling and floor. Pieces that are too small, on the other hand, can look awkward. The solution? Buy multiple pieces and arrange them to create a stunning accent <strong>wall</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A folding screen can act as a statement piece while decorating the blank <strong>wall</strong> in your living room. A traditional folding screen might sound a bit odd, but it works beautifully as a <strong>wall</strong> decor without requiring any installation. Simply place it in the corner or line it along an empty <strong>wall</strong>, and the folding screen will become the main attraction of the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A large and oversized floor mirror can be a great way to <strong>decorate</strong> your large living room <strong>wall</strong> while adding an incredible visual texture to the room. It’s simple, it’s beautiful, and it’s so much more practical than going for large-scale artwork. Simply place it on the floor to brighten up the entire living room space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The mood board above is from the paint and palette collection. It’s one of my favorite boards. Plus, this is a reasonably long <strong>wall</strong> in a dining room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>17 of 20 Celebrate Architectural Features Hector Manuel Sanchez; Styling: Lisa Tudor/FT45 The living room of this New Orleans shotgun house plays with an assortment of neutral <strong>wall</strong> colors alongside a dramatic deep blue. The texture of old plaster is celebrated, rather than hidden, along with the partially exposed brick of the chimney. Interesting architectural features can serve as <strong>wall</strong> decor on their own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A large, empty living room <strong>wall</strong> can quickly turn into an eyesore, but a nuanced, artfully arranged one can upgrade the space as a whole. &ldquo;A thoughtfully <strong>decorate</strong>d <strong>wall</strong> in a living room is essential,&rdquo; says interior designer Nikki Klugh of Nikki Klugh Design Group. &ldquo;An especially large <strong>wall</strong> can serve as the focal point, so it&rsquo;s crucial to make sure it&rsquo;s designed in a way that makes an impact.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While floating bookshelves and hanging bike racks have their place, sometimes you want decor that’s simply, well, decorative. It goes without saying, but photography and paintings are great options for filling up a <strong>wall</strong> and adding a little pizzazz. Art containing subject matter or color palettes that complement those already present—ocean photography for a coastal-style living room, black-and-white paintings for a minimalist vibe—elevates the space and ties it all together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Plus, it’s quite easy to maintain the plant <strong>wall</strong> without worrying about water dripping from the built-in planters. You can also add some visual textures to the living room by installing the plant <strong>wall</strong> and hanging different indoor plants on this empty <strong>wall</strong>. So, it can be a great way to fill up the empty space in your living room and add some lush greenery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another way to <strong>decorate</strong> your big <strong>wall</strong> is Mirrors! Yes, they’re magical elements that are used for many purposes. From making a space seem spacious to filling an empty <strong>wall</strong>, mirrors can be used in many ways. These types of huge window-like mirrors will add depth to the living space or can be an ideal large <strong>wall</strong> decor idea for bedrooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>18 of 20 Make a Fireplace a Feature Laurey W. Glenn; Styling: Lizzie Cullen Cox This mountain home&rsquo;s fireplace makes a stunning statement in a wood-paneled room. Cladding the chimney and surrounding <strong>wall</strong> with stone from floor to ceiling made it the primary feature of the living room. A cowhide rug adds to the rustic feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When decorating a a large <strong>wall</strong>, living room <strong>wall</strong>paper ideas are an easy first port of call. And because you have a lot of space to cover, you can afford to have more fun with the pattern than you would in a smaller space. Lisa Honiball, owner Honey Interior Design (opens in new tab) agrees. ‘Of course, there’s <strong>wall</strong>paper,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;but don’t use a large feature <strong>wall</strong> as an excuse to chicken out of a scheme or <strong>decorate</strong> half-heartedly. Maximalists should still be embracing their love of colour and pattern and taking a fabulous <strong>wall</strong>paper around all four <strong>wall</strong>s!&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sometimes a painted accent <strong>wall</strong> is more than enough to turn the whole place around. No heavy artwork or <strong>wall</strong> hangings, just some fresh paint, will do the trick of decorating a large living room <strong>wall</strong>. But, before you start painting the <strong>wall</strong>, be careful about choosing the right color scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A living room, more than any other space in a home, needs to feel warm and inviting. A space to relax and unwind, yet smart enough to entertain and socialise in. Start by researching the best living room <strong>wall</strong> decor ideas can help you discover the ideal decor solution for your space and then adapt any of the following ideas to suit your style, needs and space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Living rooms often have a lot of square-edged pieces – coffee tables, TV, media consoles, etc. so adding some round baskets to a <strong>wall</strong> breaks things up and adds texture and softness. I love the look of a grouping of different shaped baskets like {this set of 8 <strong>wall</strong> baskets}: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Clever living room paint ideas are becoming more popular, mainly because we&rsquo;re getting braver with our colour choices but also because they&rsquo;re super easy to achieve. Use architectural features wherever possible - existing arches, dado rails, picture rails - they can all be taken advantage of and painted in a contrasting shade to adjacent <strong>wall</strong>s. Don&rsquo;t have any rails or panelling? Try creating a visual version with a super neat horizontal line across your living room <strong>wall</strong> using FrogTape painting tape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sharp neutrals, bold metallics, and minimalist pieces are all you need for a well-designed modern living room <strong>wall</strong>. Colors like white, navy, and slate gray instantly modernize a space and provide the perfect backdrop for other decor, whether you incorporate color or go neutral all the way. This design style can easily slip from sleek to sterile, so warm up the room with engaging art prints in understated frames. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is the first thought that comes to your mind while thinking about filling up a blank space on the <strong>wall</strong>. After all, this is what most of the designers suggest. From abstract paintings to textured artworks, you can hang a single large <strong>wall</strong> decor to cover a blank <strong>wall</strong>, and they can look great like this one: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Curtain panels go beautifully in living rooms and bedrooms for decorating and covering up any large <strong>wall</strong> space. If you have a blank <strong>wall</strong> that’s idly standing in the room, give it a new curtain makeover. Add some huge curtain panels using long rods and hang some curtains that go well with the entire interior decor of the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your TV is floating in a big, empty space, try to surround it with art, creating a gallery <strong>wall</strong>. When the TV is off, it’ll blend right in with the frames. This is an especially useful idea if you’re looking to design a living room that doesn’t focus on the TV. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At some point in life, we all face this situation of decorating a large blank <strong>wall</strong>! Many people also have a hate-love relationship with blank <strong>wall</strong>s. So if you’re also facing the same issues and are a little confused about how to <strong>decorate</strong> a big <strong>wall</strong>, don’t worry; you’re not alone. It’s one of the most common design and decoration dilemmas, and that’s why many homeowners face the same issues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Instead of classic tongue and groove <strong>wall</strong> panelling ideas, vertical panelling is an excellent choice for large <strong>wall</strong>s as it adds instant depth, warmth and interest. It&rsquo;s easy to install, as it comes in wide sections that you just fix to the <strong>wall</strong> and it provides great acoustic warmth, too. Perfect if you don&rsquo;t want to disturb the neighbours (or don&rsquo;t want them to disturb you). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Today in this blog, we will tell you some of the big <strong>wall</strong> decoration ideas. These easiest and creative techniques can be used on any <strong>wall</strong>, such as living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, and bathrooms. Let’s start with the awesome decor ideas for a large <strong>wall</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To that end, I made several boards for sharing some ideas for a big living room <strong>wall</strong>. At the top and left side, of some of them, you’ll see some boxes. Those represent one foot. Most of these <strong>wall</strong>s are about 18 to 20 feet. If your <strong>wall</strong> is bigger, you’ll probably need larger furniture, or it’s also okay to have a little breathing space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Folding screens and room dividers are standing sculpture pieces in themselves. That’s why they’ll also work as decor for your bare <strong>wall</strong>s. A <strong>wall</strong> divider is a space-saving accent piece that easily covers a boring <strong>wall</strong>. You don’t need to hang them or mount them; simply line them along the <strong>wall</strong> or put them in a corner. They’ll be a sophisticated focal point of your space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Moreover, a console table goes well with both modern and traditional styles of interior decoration. So, no matter the style of your living room space, a console table can be perfect for decorating the large empty <strong>wall</strong>. However, if you don’t have enough space to set up a large console table, you can also go for a set of benches or small stools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are a gardening enthusiast, you can transform the large blank living room <strong>wall</strong> into a unique plant <strong>wall</strong> that’ll add greenery to the room. Install planters with a wood pallet for hanging plants on the empty <strong>wall</strong>. The plant offers a natural and organic touch to the living room, enhancing its aesthetic appearance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At first glance, large <strong>wall</strong> decor might seem like a bad idea for a small <strong>wall</strong>, since you don’t want to crowd or overwhelm the room. However, the truth is that small pieces can leave a lot of empty <strong>wall</strong> space, making the room feel awkward and even smaller than it actually is. Big <strong>wall</strong> decor, be it an oversized clock or a piece of DIY <strong>wall</strong> art, will anchor the room and take it from cramped to cozy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A little <strong>wall</strong>paper can go a long way. &ldquo;Patterned <strong>wall</strong>paper turns the entire <strong>wall</strong> into an art piece,&rdquo; says Smith. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to commit to <strong>wall</strong>paper, my favorite solution is to buy some funky or fun gift wrap and then frame pieces of it in a series, which gives you flexibility to change your <strong>wall</strong> décor often and play around with new aesthetics without breaking the bank.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As I have shown you with floor plans, you can create a scale elevation drawing of your long <strong>wall</strong> plan. I use quarter-inch graph paper, but I find that 1/2″ scale is easier on the eyes for elevations. In that case, four squares will equal a square foot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can also mix in other interesting items while decorating the floating shelves, like placing small indoor plants or your favorite figurines to enhance the visual interest of the <strong>wall</strong> decor. It can be a great way to flaunt your personal preferences while decorating the living room <strong>wall</strong>. However, be careful while placing items on the floating shelves because you don’t want them to loom cluttered. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>That said, there are tons of other ways to create a beautiful, visually engaging space. Hanging tapestries or other woven artwork draws the eye upward, making them excellent choices if you want to dress up an awkwardly empty high spot on the <strong>wall</strong>. As a bonus, textile art introduces a new material into the room, adding a layer of interest. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Already have panelling installed but want to give it a little more&mldr;oomph? Try your hard at colour drenching. While painting the entire <strong>wall</strong> and mouldings in one shade might look a little empty on a plain <strong>wall</strong>, it is a perfect match for a panelled <strong>wall</strong> as the shadows cast from the natural light add plenty of decorative beauty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can go with any style or art of your liking and layout according to the <strong>wall</strong>. However, try this themed grid approach if you want a tailored and organized gallery <strong>wall</strong>. This is more like a symmetrical and streamlined artwork display that offers a polished look. Otherwise, you can use frames in different shapes, colors, and sizes and put them in any manner (See the above image for reference). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gone are the days when the wainscoting was considered stuffy and bulky. Nowadays, you can see many modern homes with wainscoting, and they look absolutely gorgeous. So if you’re thinking about how to bring life to your large blank <strong>wall</strong>, go with this big <strong>wall</strong> decoration idea. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hanging a paper mural can be just as mesmerizing and captivating as any <strong>wall</strong>paper. But, what is a <strong>wall</strong> mural? It’s a large <strong>wall</strong> art piece that’s pretty cheap because you don’t have to frame it to hang it on the big <strong>wall</strong> in your living room. Also, these <strong>wall</strong> murals are perfect for filling up the large space in any room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>‘Try textured or metallic paint,&rsquo; suggests Justyna Korczynska, Crown (opens in new tab) Colour Consultant. &lsquo;They add interest by subtly catching the light. If you’ve architectural elements, work with them to create a feature, or think about panelling – the highlights and shadows created add another level to a painted feature <strong>wall</strong>.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A huge piece covering the entire <strong>wall</strong> will command the eye and serve as an impressive focal point. You could also hang multiple paintings side by side or in a grid to add a little variety. While many artists sell complementary pieces that would look great together, you don’t necessarily have to buy a set. You can unify eclectically sourced paintings through their colors, styles, themes, or frames. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Not only that, but a mirror centerpiece also helps to reflect light across the entire living room space and brightens it up. Thus, the space automatically opens up with this <strong>wall</strong> decor idea and looks bigger. Always go for a mirror having a unique and bold shape so that it can stand out and be the central attraction of the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>07 of 20 Play with Pattern Laurey W. Glenn Richmond-based designer Janie Molster used a striking Suzani to dress up with wood-paneled <strong>wall</strong>s of her Nags Head summer home. Hanging a pretty textile curtain-style defines a seating area and breaks up the long, vertical lines of the <strong>wall</strong>s. It also adds a pop of color to an otherwise monochromatic space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want your living room to have a more decadent, sophisticated feel, look for detailed <strong>wall</strong> decor and precious materials. Even if you don’t have the intricate <strong>wall</strong> moldings often present in Parisian-style homes, you can emulate the look by filling your space with classy, vintage-inspired pieces. Antique mirrors and ornately framed art, for example, add an air of old-school luxury. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Similarly, placing tall plants, like a tall faux fig tree, can act as the statement piece and be the focal point in your living room. It will add a splash of greenery and make the room look fresh and organic. You can turn the entire place around by positioning a tall plant in front of the large, bare <strong>wall</strong>. It can perfectly complement a modern or traditional living room style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Large <strong>wall</strong>s are the ideal canvas. You literally have a huge blank space to work with, and visually appealing accents are a great route to take when it comes to decorating this canvas. If your living room has a large <strong>wall</strong>, consider using it as the backdrop for a vibrant and eye-catching statement art piece – but a big one. Whether it’s a landscape painting or modern art, pick your painting/ art piece of choice and make an exhibit worthy <strong>wall</strong> in your living room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Simplicity is key when it comes to modern design, so stick to sleek, minimal decor to avoid cluttering the space. Floating shelves create extra storage, and you can arrange them in many ways, offering an opportunity for functional decor. Other decorations like metal <strong>wall</strong> art or an oversized clock can fill empty space and add character to your living room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>19 of 20 Go Wild With Paint Hector Manuel Sanchez Birmingham decorator Fran Keenan hand-painted this large-scale, Greek-key motif in a repeated pattern to look much like a true <strong>wall</strong>paper. She&rsquo;d intended to re-cover her sister&rsquo;s old zebra-print sofa, but the more she looked at it, the more she thought it just worked. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of fun in not overthinking,&rdquo; she adds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now, when it comes to large <strong>wall</strong>s – that’s often perceived as a challenge. In all fairness, they can be intimidating; it’s really a problem of plenty. There are so many options when it comes to interior decoration and design, that making a decision (and the right one at that) can seem impossible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to filling up the bare <strong>wall</strong>s in your living room, you can also choose to create a well-organized and finely tailored gallery <strong>wall</strong>. A themed grid gallery <strong>wall</strong> works beautifully if you’re planning to have modern and sophisticated living room decor. Also, this gallery <strong>wall</strong> decor fits perfectly with classic-style and posh living rooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>09 of 20 Make Smart Substitutes Laurey W. Glenn; Styling: Buffy Hargett Miller Covering an entire living room in luxe <strong>wall</strong>paper is pricey. In her San Antonio home, designer Nicola McLaughlin instead framed two panels of de Gourney&rsquo;s Badminton pattern to lend a refined accent. Gold and black frames contrast with the blue hues in this space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This approach of one large painting often beats out the common layout of multiple small frames on one <strong>wall</strong>. It commands attention instantly and makes a bold statement. And, if you’re all about that minimalist vibe, this method of decoration works perfectly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Take paint for instance. Painting a large <strong>wall</strong> in a living room in all one colour doesn’t do much to make the space look less huge, but using a variety of living room paint ideas in different ways can trick the eye into thinking it’s smaller than it is. The same goes for <strong>wall</strong>paper – one repetitive print on a large space can feel a little never ending. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Entertainment <strong>wall</strong>s have become an important living room feature, and now provide stiff competition for the traditional feature fireplace. TV lovers want their box in pride of place to achieve the optimum viewing angle, so increasingly the lounge fireplace is being bumped to a side <strong>wall</strong> or corner adornment. This interior reshuffle leaves space to imagine a new living room feature <strong>wall</strong> with the TV at its centre. It also presents extra requirements for storage of receiver and recorder equipment, plus movie media, consoles and games. So how do we achieve a modern vista beautiful enough to take the place of a mantelpiece, and on what do we now display our treasured items? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>02 of 20 Make a Bold Statement Evan Sklar A vibrant painting pops off the pastel blue <strong>wall</strong>s of this pool house in Lexington, Kentucky. The artwork, a nod to the horse pastures surrounding the home, complements the interior&rsquo;s punchy color scheme. The large painting makes a statement and holds its own under a stunning chandelier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>13 of 20 Embrace Funky Finds Mary Craven A quirky red-and-yellow hat-lady print pops off the powder pink <strong>wall</strong>s of Brittney Forrister&rsquo;s Nashville bungalow. Though Brittney&rsquo;s fond of the print, she&rsquo;s not so keen on its color scheme. &ldquo;Even the things you don&rsquo;t love can work in the right space,&rdquo; she says. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s easy to get lost in all the complex decorating ideas out there, but you simply can’t go wrong with the basics. With their ability to brighten a room and show off a person’s unique tastes, paintings have always been a go-to for sprucing up blank <strong>wall</strong>s. Whether you go landscape or portrait, contemporary or impressionist, a handpicked piece of art is the perfect way to fill your living room with character. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>An oversized <strong>wall</strong> shouldn’t be thought of in isolation either. It should be the anchor that ties the room decor together. ‘When I see a room with one strong, dominant <strong>wall</strong>,’ agrees Bethan Harwood, Partner & Home Design Stylist at John Lewis & Partners (opens in new tab), ‘I’m itching to change up the other elements to balance it and bring the room together.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Light fixtures are an often-overlooked way to make a statement, so keep an eye out for attention-grabbing sconces, lamps, or overhead fixtures. For a painting or fireplace smack in the middle of the <strong>wall</strong> without much room on either side, try placing two intricately designed sconces on either side. By framing the feature in this way, you subtly draw attention toward it while filling in the gaps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Plus, installing some glass sconces, such as the Murano Glass Chandelier and some floating shelves, can transform the entire space and brighten up the room. They’ll add a dramatic visual dimension to the room along with the sleek TV design. So, creating a TV <strong>wall</strong> can be an excellent way to use the empty space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Store and flaunt your collection of hardcovers and paperbacks with a beautiful bookcase system that can be the focal point of the living room. It’s one of the easiest and most effective ways to <strong>decorate</strong> a large living room <strong>wall</strong>. Also, when it comes to home decor ideas, a bookcase system is ideal both in terms of practicality and style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Also, you can add a sculptural dimension to your otherwise bare living room by installing sconces having unique and interesting shapes. What’s more, <strong>wall</strong> lighting can help open up space in your living room and brighten it up. A pair of sconces also goes perfectly well with modern and traditional living room styles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For instance, you can create different geometric shapes and patterns, such as board and batten, as part of your wood plank design. Not only that, but you can also use different color palettes to <strong>decorate</strong> the wooden planks to create a colorful and cohesive look. Hence, you can use any color scheme to amp up the visual appearance of your wood panel design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you have a large <strong>wall</strong> in your living room that’s needing&mldr; well, a bit of love, you’ve come to the right place. Having a big empty <strong>wall</strong> is much like a blank canvas. Unless you have a clear idea on the look you’re planning to create, knowing how to break up a large <strong>wall</strong> in a living room can almost be harder to achieve than decorating in a far smaller space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A single <strong>wall</strong> shelf, for example, offers a wealth of opportunities. Try leaning a set of art prints or your record collection on it to create a laidback display of your tastes and interests. Incorporating pieces at varying heights, like a slightly taller lamp or a few vining plants, engages the eye and creates visual interest without over-complicating the space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Can&rsquo;t find (or afford) any large-scale artwork to hang on your <strong>wall</strong>? Klugh says creating a salon-style display with smaller pieces is the next best thing. &ldquo;Filling up your living room <strong>wall</strong> with a collage allows you to bring multiple pieces together to create one big art piece,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Depending on the sizes you are working with, the collage can be linear or organic—just remember to plan it out before putting it on the <strong>wall</strong> to ensure you achieve the desired effect.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To introduce depth and dimension, Klugh recommends adding an architectural element, like baseboards or crown molding. &ldquo;Buy some wood planks from your local home improvement store and install them on the <strong>wall</strong> in the pattern of your choice to add a layer of interest,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Adding an architectural element to your <strong>wall</strong> will help infuse some character into your space.&rdquo; If you can&rsquo;t add trims or moldings to your <strong>wall</strong>, Smith says floating shelves are a smart (and storage-savvy) alternative. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you have floating shelves in your home, consider lining them with your favorite photos. &ldquo;Adding floating shelves to the <strong>wall</strong>s will allow you to use the space for storage,&rdquo; adds Sara Barney of BANDD DESIGN. In addition to photos, you can use the area to show off pieces of art and other decorative accents in a functional way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wake up dull living room <strong>wall</strong>s with creative decor ideas. Transform stark, sterile spaces by adding warm, welcoming accents that will make the living room the most inviting space in the house.

Here are 20 of our best decorating tips for making a living room the most popular hangout space in the house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Whether you lean more boho or traditional, your <strong>wall</strong> decor will impact the room’s style in a big way. Light colors, simple designs, and light wood shelves or frames go well with contemporary, mid-century modern, Scandinavian, and rustic-style decor. Darker hues, metal accents, and rough textures like stone, on the other hand, complement modern decor perfectly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The grid gallery <strong>wall</strong> follows a theme and offers a streamlined and symmetrical artwork display. If you own any favorite art collection or series, the grid-themed style is the best way to <strong>decorate</strong> the gallery <strong>wall</strong>. Or, you can also arrange some botanical prints for creating a beautiful grid gallery <strong>wall</strong> in your living room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Look at the above Antonio Martin’s San Francisco home. It proves that your <strong>wall</strong>s can be anything but boring. Here beautiful 18th-century Portuguese tiles in aqua blue color have been used in the entryway and stairs areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Want to give your <strong>wall</strong>s a next lever makeover? Go with floating shelves! This is another quick, space-filling trick. You can go with a few floating shelves or just fill your <strong>wall</strong> with floating furniture.

Wall hangings include any piece of fabric, such as <strong>wall</strong> tapestries, rugs, or flags. They can be a perfect solution for decorating a huge <strong>wall</strong> that can’t be covered with only paintings or photos. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;What about a living <strong>wall</strong>?&rsquo; asks Bethan Harwood from John Lewis. &lsquo;I love them in open-plan spaces that lead out to a balcony or garden. You can also work one into a shelving unit, which is slightly easier to upkeep. I’d keep the pots and background monochrome so the plants can be the feature.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://www.gravetics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Gothic-style.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="How To Decorate A Long Wall In Living Room - 37 Ideas for Decorating a Blank Wall in Your Home"><p>Here are a few tips to help you find information about Living Room Wall Ideas:</p><ul><li>Look for good places to get information about 37 Ideas for Decorating a Blank Wall in Your Home.
