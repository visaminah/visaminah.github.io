As for other things that need to be looked up, they are about Metabo Cordless Framing Nailer and have something to do with metabo vs dewalt framing nailer. 34 Tips for Metabo Vs Dewalt Framing Nailer | Metabo Nail Gun The new Metabo HPT (formerly Hitachi) NR1890DCSM , 18V brushless paper collated framing nailer, marks Metabo HPT‚Äôs entrance into cordless framing. This new Metabo HPT cordless framing nailer eliminates the need for air hoses, compressors and gas fuel cartridges - not to mention waiting for ramp up. Built on the underpinnings of Hitachi‚Äôs reputation for quality pneumatic nailers, the NR1890DCSM comes equipped with Metabo HPT‚Äôs unique Air Spring Drive System; delivering more than enough power to flush drive clipped and offset round head framing nails from 2\" X 0.113 up to 3-1/2‚Äù X 0.131. - Source: Internet The Metabo HPT nailer, we tested, does not come with a rafter hook, a feature we feel is a MUST on a framing nailer (other Metabo HPT nailers do come with a hook). The RIDGID‚Äôs rafter hook is easy to swivel, but the team felt that the hook was too narrow, barely fits on 2x lumber. It also seems thinner and less durable. - Source: Internet For this application, we used 3-1/2‚Äù framing nails to fasten LVL headers together. We placed two 1-3/4‚Ä≥ thick LVLs together, with a 2√ó8 underneath and face nailed. Each nailer installed a series of 10 fasteners, to compile an average measurement for nail penetration. We used the same compressor on all nailers and cycled the compressor to achieve maximum tank air pressure, prior to starting each and every test. - Source: Internet The Makita, Milwaukee, and RIDGID stood out with the best placed, smoothest-to-operate depth of drive knob adjustment. On the Makita, we liked the visible scale that allows you to see the adjustment range. The Milwaukee and RIDGID both have a large adjustment wheel, but it‚Äôs hard to tell where in the depth adjustment you are compared to the other nailers. The Senco‚Äôs big knurled knob adjustment was the easiest to operate, and adjustment is smooth. It‚Äôs only negative is that it is directly in the line of sight. - Source: Internet Back in 2012 I reviewed the Paslode and Bostitch fuel powered framing nailers . At the time, I could take or leave cordless framing nailers, and didn‚Äôt end up using them after writing the article. In 2014 I reviewed the DeWalt cordless framing nailer. This gun doesn‚Äôt use an internal combustion engine, but the rotor of the brushless motor acts a flywheel. We ended up using this gun quite often, especially for pickup work. - Source: Internet Milwaukee had the best combination of ‚Äúease-of-use,‚Äù and safety and Makita followed in second place. Both nailers switch between firing modes by rotating switch. Milwaukee has a locking, rotating switch [push and twist], Makita has a simple switch with no lock or secondary actuation on the rotating mode switch. - Source: Internet The advantages of pneumatic nailers are clear regarding power, productivity and capacity. The disadvantages commonly expressed among tradesmen are weight, compressor, hose, and maintenance. ~ Stan Durlacher [TBBCrew] - Source: Internet We measured the decibel levels during the LVL header testing and recorded the results at a consistent, waist-high distance. Decibels were recorded at peak levels. As you can see below, these nailers are very close so we did not rank them. It‚Äôs important to note that all of these nailer require hearing protection. - Source: Internet 722 Likes, 27 Comments.

I Got That Good Stuff. - Source: Internet The RIDGID nailer did not perform well in our toe-nailing test. Power wasn‚Äôt the issue, and this nailer did well in our other tests. However, the RIDGID nailer was not able to sink toe-nails even at a maximum-depth setting and with the nose of the gun firmly buried in the wood. - Source: Internet The Metabo HPT nailer is smaller than the rest and easily fits between studs. The contact-tip was aggressive and gipped the wood well. The team found that the Metabo HPT was slightly underpowered, with inconsistent toe-nailing penetration. - Source: Internet Pricing fluctuates constantly so keep in mind the pricing listed here was at the time of this publication and may be different. Pricing listed is from independent retailers that we trust for great service so keep that in mind, some lower prices may be out there from less reputable retailers. There was a tie on pricing for this test but the nailers were different enough that we were able to rank one above all others based on the quality of the tool and outstanding value! - Source: Internet When toe-nailing, a nailer is held at approximately 60 degrees. Many framing nailer contact-tips slip in these situations, and the nailers with the most aggressive contact tip will toe-nail better. For toe-nailing framing applications, we used 3-1/2‚Äù nails to fasten 2√ó4 KD framing stud at an angle. - Source: Internet This feature prevents the nailer from firing when out of nails. Many manufacturers include this feature because it avoids unnecessary wear. It also eliminates the frustration of firing the nailer and discovering that the user has not set a nail. Bostitch is the only nailer without a dry fire lockout and was marked down for this. The team felt that lock-out is an important feature that Pros prefer. - Source: Internet Test 1: Testers set the nailers to approximately the ‚Äúmid depth of drive‚Äù setting to get a sense of the average depth of drive. Test 2: This test was used to rank the nailers. Each nailer was set to it‚Äôs maximum depth of drive and the average depth of drive was measured for each. - Source: Internet POWER Drives up to 400 nails per charge with compact 3.0Ah battery. Has high \u0026 stable driving power that allows the nailer to drive up to 3-1/2‚Äù nails FASTENERS 30¬∞ magazine holds approximately 47 paper strip collated nails and accepts 2\" up to 3-1/2\" in length AIR SPRING DRIVE SYSTEM Unique compressed air system drives each nail resulting in zero ramp up time, increased driving speed and less time between recoil CHOOSE CONTACT OR BUMP FIRE Easily transition between sequential mode and bump fire mode, when rapid nailing is preferred - Source: Internet Newer building materials like engineered lumber put today‚Äôs nailers to the test. Users can become frustrated when they have to follow up a pneumatic nailer by hand-banging ‚Äúproud‚Äù nails into LVL headers. Whether you‚Äôre looking to avoid this frustration and want a nailer that is powerful enough to penetrate engineered lumber, or your new to the game, and need a ‚Äúdo-it-all‚Äù framing nailer this Head-to-Head will guide you on the proper choice. This test will give you the information you need to choose the best full-size framing nailer. - Source: Internet The Milwaukee took first place with Makita close on their heels. The team felt that the two nailers were almost equal with the Milwaukee having a slightly better contact tip. Third place was the RIDGID and Senco. - Source: Internet The Milwaukee nailer is not new, and its stellar performance surprised the team. When it comes to pneumatic full-size framing nailers, the Milwaukee 7200-20 surely ranks at the top of the list when power, performance, ergonomics, and features are concerned. It came in at a total of 16 points, which was 6-points ahead of the second-placed Metabo HPT, and 7-points ahead of the third-place Makita. [See Chart Below] - Source: Internet Designed to handle like an air nailer, and capable of driving into the toughest materials, Metabo HPT‚Äôs Air Spring Drive System uses permanently sealed compressed air to drive each nail - resulting in zero ramp up time, and driving speeds up to 2 nails per second. The Metabo HPT NR1890DCSM is also equipped with a selective actuation button that allows the user to choose between bump or sequential modes. Other features on this cordless paper strip framing nailer include a tool-free depth of drive adjustment, on-board battery indicator, integrated pivoting rafter hook, and a side lock switch to prevent accidental firing. - Source: Internet Almost all of the nailers now have a tool-less adjustment dial. The BOSTITCH sports a unique tool-less ‚ÄúSLIDE‚Äù adjustment, which gives the user the benefit of speed, especially at extreme changes. We found the BOSTITCH adjustment easy, the tip completely slides in and out, but this could eventually be a concern due to the tip eventually falling out and get lost. The team felt that the nailers with a dial adjustment, a tried-and-true design, were more rugged and sensitive to minor tweaks, compared to the Bostitch slide model. - Source: Internet Metabo HPT and Porter Cable tied at $199.00. The team felt that the BEST nailer of the two, in almost all other tests, was the Metabo HPT and awarded it first place in this category. Coming in at third place was the Bostitch and Craftsman both listed at $219.00. - Source: Internet Three nailers tested have metal rafter hooks: Paslode, Senco, and Makita. The team felt that Paslode has the BEST hook. Paslode‚Äôs spring-loaded hook has a 2-1/2‚Ä≥ opening. This hook is not reversible, has a 180-degree swing, and three detent positions [it locks in a stored position, at 90 degrees, and also swings against the magazine.] - Source: Internet We get lots of comments about how we make the final rankings. As we‚Äôve stated, there are hundreds of ways to compare tools. The good news is we‚Äôve openly shared ALL the data from our tests, and you can rank the tools however you want. Don‚Äôt care about the price? No problem eliminate that from the matrix above and re-rank them. Hopefully, you‚Äôll find this Head-To-Head useful in comparing a wide range of full-size pneumatic framing nailers. - Source: Internet The Metabo HPT due to its lightweight design, was easier to position and maneuver and will obviously cause less shoulder and neck fatigue. All the other nailers were heavy for this task. The nailing pattern of two ring shank nails per joist/strapping connection makes for quick work with the advantages of a bump fire mode. However, one issue that does stand out for this task is the added weight of the other nailers, especially the Bostitch and Senco. The extra weight of these nailers can be a significant factor for user fatigue when using the tool for extended periods of time like nailing ceiling strapping. - Source: Internet Having a well-designed contact tip ensures the nailer does not slip and prevents nails from being installed incorrectly. The best contact tip in this test was the Senco. The Senco stood alone in this pack; it provided 360-degree coverage around the firing head and had more complex tangs to grip material without limiting access to tighter spaces. - Source: Internet During this evaluation there was no consensus on a preference for top-loading vs. bottom loading nailers. For top-loading, the team chose the Paslode and felt that the two steel guide rails facilitated smoother nail loading and were more durable. For bottom loading, the team felt the Milwaukee was superior and its nail pusher release button was the easiest to use and most accessible. - Source: Internet Our crew members do not use a no-mar tip on a framing nailer ‚Äì ever! If you were building a deck or dock using PT decking or maybe installing that horrible T-111 siding, maybe you would want to protect the wood surface. That said, the nailers with no-mar tips stored them in such a way as to guarantee they will get lost. As a result we decided not to score this category. - Source: Internet Framing contractors switch to a coil nailer for most sheathing applications like sub-floors, walls, and roofing. However, many carpenters own and operate ONLY one framing nailer. For those contractors, having the ability to adjust fastener depth when transitioning from framing walls to sheathing is important. In this situation, depth adjustment hurts the older style tools that require an Allen wrench depth adjustment over using a tool-less adjustment. - Source: Internet All three nailers had superior nailing mode selector switches. The Makita and Milwaukee had easier to use depth adjustments. The Metabo HPT has a clear line of sight, but the awkward placement of the depth adjustment is the trade-off. The location of the depth of drive does results in this nailer having the BEST sightline in our test. - Source: Internet For a full-size framer, most folks will agree that you want the nailer to have a two-strip nail capacity. All of these nailers hold two strips. Some had a slightly higher capacity. - Source: Internet Pneumatic nailers first started gaining ground in the construction world in the 1950‚Äôs. While the underlying technology hasn‚Äôt changed much; features, size, weight, and function have all been improved drastically. Even though pneumatic nailers can‚Äôt replace hammers on the job-site, they have become just as common. - Source: Internet Kickback is a product of a few factors, tool weight, the density of the material being nailed, size of the fastener, and the speed with which force is applied to the fastener. Kickback was a difficult problem to overcome in the early days of pneumatic nailers. In short, manufacturers needed to be able to overcome kickback, resulting in a few solutions developed around the same time but in the end, a ‚Äúpop-it‚Äù valve developed for ejection seats on fighter planes was adapted for use in nail guns and that is essentially the same technology used in pneumatic nailers today. - Source: Internet Thecompletely raises the bar for cordless framing nailers. It is designed so you no longer need the dirty hoses, loud compressors or expensive gas cartridges. It‚Äôs equipped with Metabo HPT‚Äôs unique Air Spring Drive System that delivers similar performance as a pneumatic nailer, but offers total cordless freedom. It uses sealed compressed air to drive each nail, which results in zero ramp up time, up to 2 nails driven per second, recoil that feels like a pneumatic nailer and best of all, there is no refilling of the air tank required.This cordless nailer is ideal for all construction framing applications but is particularly useful for punch-out work on a jobsite for quick in-and-out operation with minimal hassle and professional results. - Source: Internet Here are a few tips to help you find information about Metabo Nail Gun:\r- Look for good places to get information about Metabo HPT (Formerly Hitachi) NR1890DCSM 18V Cordless Paper Strip Framing Nailer, 2‚Äù to 3-1/2‚Äù.

This new Metabo HPT cordless framing <strong>nailer</strong> eliminates the need for air hoses, compressors and gas fuel cartridges - not to mention waiting for ramp up. Built on the underpinnings of Hitachi&rsquo;s reputation for quality pneumatic <strong>nailer</strong>s, the NR1890DCSM comes equipped with Metabo HPT‚Äôs unique Air Spring Drive System; delivering more than enough power to flush drive clipped and offset round head framing nails from 2" X 0.113 up to 3-1/2‚Äù X 0.131. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Metabo HPT <strong>nailer</strong>, we tested, does not come with a rafter hook, a feature we feel is a MUST on a framing <strong>nailer</strong> (other Metabo HPT <strong>nailer</strong>s do come with a hook). The RIDGID‚Äôs rafter hook is easy to swivel, but the team felt that the hook was too narrow, barely fits on 2x lumber. It also seems thinner and less durable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For this application, we used 3-1/2‚Äù framing nails to fasten LVL headers together. We placed two 1-3/4‚Ä≥ thick LVLs together, with a 2√ó8 underneath and face nailed. Each <strong>nailer</strong> installed a series of 10 fasteners, to compile an average measurement for nail penetration. We used the same compressor on all <strong>nailer</strong>s and cycled the compressor to achieve maximum tank air pressure, prior to starting each and every test. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Makita, Milwaukee, and RIDGID stood out with the best placed, smoothest-to-operate depth of drive knob adjustment. On the Makita, we liked the visible scale that allows you to see the adjustment range. The Milwaukee and RIDGID both have a large adjustment wheel, but it‚Äôs hard to tell where in the depth adjustment you are compared to the other <strong>nailer</strong>s. The Senco‚Äôs big knurled knob adjustment was the easiest to operate, and adjustment is smooth. It‚Äôs only negative is that it is directly in the line of sight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Back in 2012 I reviewed the Paslode and Bostitch fuel powered framing <strong>nailer</strong>s . At the time, I could take or leave cordless framing <strong>nailer</strong>s, and didn‚Äôt end up using them after writing the article. In 2014 I reviewed the DeWalt cordless framing <strong>nailer</strong>. This gun doesn‚Äôt use an internal combustion engine, but the rotor of the brushless motor acts a flywheel. We ended up using this gun quite often, especially for pickup work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Milwaukee had the best combination of ‚Äúease-of-use,‚Äù and safety and Makita followed in second place. Both <strong>nailer</strong>s switch between firing modes by rotating switch. Milwaukee has a locking, rotating switch [push and twist], Makita has a simple switch with no lock or secondary actuation on the rotating mode switch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The advantages of pneumatic <strong>nailer</strong>s are clear regarding power, productivity and capacity. The disadvantages commonly expressed among tradesmen are weight, compressor, hose, and maintenance. ~ Stan Durlacher [TBBCrew] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We measured the decibel levels during the LVL header testing and recorded the results at a consistent, waist-high distance. Decibels were recorded at peak levels. As you can see below, these <strong>nailer</strong>s are very close so we did not rank them. It‚Äôs important to note that all of these <strong>nailer</strong> require hearing protection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>722 Likes, 27 Comments.

I Got That Good Stuff. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The RIDGID <strong>nailer</strong> did not perform well in our toe-nailing test. Power wasn‚Äôt the issue, and this <strong>nailer</strong> did well in our other tests. However, the RIDGID <strong>nailer</strong> was not able to sink toe-nails even at a maximum-depth setting and with the nose of the gun firmly buried in the wood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Metabo HPT <strong>nailer</strong> is smaller than the rest and easily fits between studs. The contact-tip was aggressive and gipped the wood well. The team found that the Metabo HPT was slightly underpowered, with inconsistent toe-nailing penetration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pricing fluctuates constantly so keep in mind the pricing listed here was at the time of this publication and may be different. Pricing listed is from independent retailers that we trust for great service so keep that in mind, some lower prices may be out there from less reputable retailers. There was a tie on pricing for this test but the <strong>nailer</strong>s were different enough that we were able to rank one above all others based on the quality of the tool and outstanding value! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When toe-nailing, a <strong>nailer</strong> is held at approximately 60 degrees. Many framing <strong>nailer</strong> contact-tips slip in these situations, and the <strong>nailer</strong>s with the most aggressive contact tip will toe-nail better. For toe-nailing framing applications, we used 3-1/2‚Äù nails to fasten 2√ó4 KD framing stud at an angle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This feature prevents the <strong>nailer</strong> from firing when out of nails. Many manufacturers include this feature because it avoids unnecessary wear. It also eliminates the frustration of firing the <strong>nailer</strong> and discovering that the user has not set a nail. Bostitch is the only <strong>nailer</strong> without a dry fire lockout and was marked down for this. The team felt that lock-out is an important feature that Pros prefer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Test 1: Testers set the <strong>nailer</strong>s to approximately the ‚Äúmid depth of drive‚Äù setting to get a sense of the average depth of drive. Test 2: This test was used to rank the <strong>nailer</strong>s. Each <strong>nailer</strong> was set to it‚Äôs maximum depth of drive and the average depth of drive was measured for each. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>POWER Drives up to 400 nails per charge with compact 3.0Ah battery. Has high & stable driving power that allows the <strong>nailer</strong> to drive up to 3-1/2‚Äù nails FASTENERS 30¬∞ magazine holds approximately 47 paper strip collated nails and accepts 2" up to 3-1/2" in length AIR SPRING DRIVE SYSTEM Unique compressed air system drives each nail resulting in zero ramp up time, increased driving speed and less time between recoil CHOOSE CONTACT OR BUMP FIRE Easily transition between sequential mode and bump fire mode, when rapid nailing is preferred - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Newer building materials like engineered lumber put today‚Äôs <strong>nailer</strong>s to the test. Users can become frustrated when they have to follow up a pneumatic <strong>nailer</strong> by hand-banging ‚Äúproud‚Äù nails into LVL headers. Whether you‚Äôre looking to avoid this frustration and want a <strong>nailer</strong> that is powerful enough to penetrate engineered lumber, or your new to the game, and need a ‚Äúdo-it-all‚Äù framing <strong>nailer</strong> this Head-to-Head will guide you on the proper choice. This test will give you the information you need to choose the best full-size framing <strong>nailer</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Milwaukee took first place with Makita close on their heels. The team felt that the two <strong>nailer</strong>s were almost equal with the Milwaukee having a slightly better contact tip. Third place was the RIDGID and Senco. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Milwaukee <strong>nailer</strong> is not new, and its stellar performance surprised the team. When it comes to pneumatic full-size framing <strong>nailer</strong>s, the Milwaukee 7200-20 surely ranks at the top of the list when power, performance, ergonomics, and features are concerned. It came in at a total of 16 points, which was 6-points ahead of the second-placed Metabo HPT, and 7-points ahead of the third-place Makita. [See Chart Below] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Designed to handle like an air <strong>nailer</strong>, and capable of driving into the toughest materials, Metabo HPT‚Äôs Air Spring Drive System uses permanently sealed compressed air to drive each nail - resulting in zero ramp up time, and driving speeds up to 2 nails per second. The Metabo HPT NR1890DCSM is also equipped with a selective actuation button that allows the user to choose between bump or sequential modes. Other features on this cordless paper strip framing <strong>nailer</strong> include a tool-free depth of drive adjustment, on-board battery indicator, integrated pivoting rafter hook, and a side lock switch to prevent accidental firing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Almost all of the <strong>nailer</strong>s now have a tool-less adjustment dial. The BOSTITCH sports a unique tool-less ‚ÄúSLIDE‚Äù adjustment, which gives the user the benefit of speed, especially at extreme changes. We found the BOSTITCH adjustment easy, the tip completely slides in and out, but this could eventually be a concern due to the tip eventually falling out and get lost. The team felt that the <strong>nailer</strong>s with a dial adjustment, a tried-and-true design, were more rugged and sensitive to minor tweaks, compared to the Bostitch slide model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Metabo HPT and Porter Cable tied at $199.00. The team felt that the BEST <strong>nailer</strong> of the two, in almost all other tests, was the Metabo HPT and awarded it first place in this category. Coming in at third place was the Bostitch and Craftsman both listed at $219.00. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Three <strong>nailer</strong>s tested have metal rafter hooks: Paslode, Senco, and Makita. The team felt that Paslode has the BEST hook. Paslode‚Äôs spring-loaded hook has a 2-1/2‚Ä≥ opening. This hook is not reversible, has a 180-degree swing, and three detent positions [it locks in a stored position, at 90 degrees, and also swings against the magazine.] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We get lots of comments about how we make the final rankings. As we‚Äôve stated, there are hundreds of ways to compare tools. The good news is we‚Äôve openly shared ALL the data from our tests, and you can rank the tools however you want. Don‚Äôt care about the price? No problem eliminate that from the matrix above and re-rank them. Hopefully, you‚Äôll find this Head-To-Head useful in comparing a wide range of full-size pneumatic framing <strong>nailer</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Metabo HPT due to its lightweight design, was easier to position and maneuver and will obviously cause less shoulder and neck fatigue. All the other <strong>nailer</strong>s were heavy for this task. The nailing pattern of two ring shank nails per joist/strapping connection makes for quick work with the advantages of a bump fire mode. However, one issue that does stand out for this task is the added weight of the other <strong>nailer</strong>s, especially the Bostitch and Senco. The extra weight of these <strong>nailer</strong>s can be a significant factor for user fatigue when using the tool for extended periods of time like nailing ceiling strapping. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Having a well-designed contact tip ensures the <strong>nailer</strong> does not slip and prevents nails from being installed incorrectly. The best contact tip in this test was the Senco. The Senco stood alone in this pack; it provided 360-degree coverage around the firing head and had more complex tangs to grip material without limiting access to tighter spaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>During this evaluation there was no consensus on a preference for top-loading vs. bottom loading <strong>nailer</strong>s. For top-loading, the team chose the Paslode and felt that the two steel guide rails facilitated smoother nail loading and were more durable. For bottom loading, the team felt the Milwaukee was superior and its nail pusher release button was the easiest to use and most accessible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Our crew members do not use a no-mar tip on a framing <strong>nailer</strong> ‚Äì ever! If you were building a deck or dock using PT decking or maybe installing that horrible T-111 siding, maybe you would want to protect the wood surface. That said, the <strong>nailer</strong>s with no-mar tips stored them in such a way as to guarantee they will get lost. As a result we decided not to score this category. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Framing contractors switch to a coil <strong>nailer</strong> for most sheathing applications like sub-floors, walls, and roofing. However, many carpenters own and operate ONLY one framing <strong>nailer</strong>. For those contractors, having the ability to adjust fastener depth when transitioning from framing walls to sheathing is important. In this situation, depth adjustment hurts the older style tools that require an Allen wrench depth adjustment over using a tool-less adjustment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>All three <strong>nailer</strong>s had superior nailing mode selector switches. The Makita and Milwaukee had easier to use depth adjustments. The Metabo HPT has a clear line of sight, but the awkward placement of the depth adjustment is the trade-off. The location of the depth of drive does results in this <strong>nailer</strong> having the BEST sightline in our test. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For a full-size framer, most folks will agree that you want the <strong>nailer</strong> to have a two-strip nail capacity. All of these <strong>nailer</strong>s hold two strips. Some had a slightly higher capacity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pneumatic <strong>nailer</strong>s first started gaining ground in the construction world in the 1950‚Äôs. While the underlying technology hasn‚Äôt changed much; features, size, weight, and function have all been improved drastically. Even though pneumatic <strong>nailer</strong>s can‚Äôt replace hammers on the job-site, they have become just as common. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Kickback is a product of a few factors, tool weight, the density of the material being nailed, size of the fastener, and the speed with which force is applied to the fastener. Kickback was a difficult problem to overcome in the early days of pneumatic <strong>nailer</strong>s. In short, manufacturers needed to be able to overcome kickback, resulting in a few solutions developed around the same time but in the end, a ‚Äúpop-it‚Äù valve developed for ejection seats on fighter planes was adapted for use in nail guns and that is essentially the same technology used in pneumatic <strong>nailer</strong>s today. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Thecompletely raises the bar for cordless framing <strong>nailer</strong>s. It is designed so you no longer need the dirty hoses, loud compressors or expensive gas cartridges. It&rsquo;s equipped with Metabo HPT&rsquo;s unique Air Spring Drive System that delivers similar performance as a pneumatic <strong>nailer</strong>, but offers total cordless freedom. It uses sealed compressed air to drive each nail, which results in zero ramp up time, up to 2 nails driven per second, recoil that feels like a pneumatic <strong>nailer</strong> and best of all, there is no refilling of the air tank required.This cordless <strong>nailer</strong> is ideal for all construction framing applications but is particularly useful for punch-out work on a jobsite for quick in-and-out operation with minimal hassle and professional results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/8229/8227/products/801202a1-0b87-41de-aa45-b4f966caa6ed_530x@2x.jpg?v=1565813325" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Metabo Vs Dewalt Framing Nailer - metabo vs dewalt framing nailer">
