It is also inert, like peat moss, which means that it can hold on to nutrients for long, but it does not provide any itself. It is readily available as well, which is why it is a favorite with gardeners all over the world. - Source: Internet again because it is fibrous organic matter, it soaks with water and then releases it slowly. In fact, it can hold as much as 20 times of its weight in water. This quality, as well as its ability to retain nutrients, is helpful if your soil is sandy, which means that it does not hold on to moisture and nutrients. Peat moss can hold on to air; roots need to breathe as well as feed and drink and in the pores and spaces within the fibers of peat moss, air can find a good place to hide. - Source: Internet Peat moss is partially decomposed sphagnum moss plants, which are harvested from peat bogs. While peat moss is brown, like soil, it has a different texture and weight, it is light and spongy and crumbles into tiny splinters. It is difficult to wet, but once wet it retains water like a sponge, meaning it reduces drainage of water from soil. - Source: Internet Sandy soil will feel gritty to the touch and is problematic as it doesn’t retain moisture. Work the compost and topsoil into the sandy soil until it begins to cling together when squeezed, though it should still remain crumbly. Soil that is clay-heavy will stick together in clumps and does not drain well. It will need sand and fine compost added to it to improve drainage and boost nutrients. - Source: Internet A sandy soil also has so much air in it that microbes consume organic matter very quickly. Because sandy soils usually contain very little clay or organic matter, they don’t have much of a crumb structure. The soil particles don’t stick together, even when they’re wet. - Source: Internet This recipe from The Beginner’s Garden is perfect for experimentation. You may want to change the ratio between the regular gardening soil and the soil with the added fertilizer, but note that additives in bagged soil usually up the price. You may also want to play with the amount of topsoil and worm castings added, or replace the worm castings with another nutrient-rich amendment such as Lomi dirt. - Source: Internet How much compost should I add to my clay soil? Compost is the best soil amendment and should be the primary focus in improving clay soil. Add up to 3” to existing lawns and landscapes, and use compost as a topdressing around the drip ring of established plants. After each major addition of organic matter, the nitrogen in the soil will drop, so you may need to supplement with fertilizer on established lawns. Read our article on compost for more information. - Source: Internet Limestone: Limestone is an inexpensive and beneficial ingredient in many homemade soil recipes. Pulverized limestone helps neutralize a peat moss based soil’s pH. It’s recommended to add one-quarter cup of limestone for every six gallons of peat moss. - Source: Internet Some gardeners are blessed from the beginning with great garden soil, that’s great! This article is for those of us that must work at it. And, while we’re talking about it, keep in mind you can buy bulk garden soil which is great for those in a hurry, waited too late in the season, or simply want to go straight to planting. Our planter’s mix is a great option to jump-start your garden this year! - Source: Internet There are peat moss alternatives if you have concerns about the price of peat moss or its environmental impact. Compost offers similar benefits to peat moss in the garden and is a completely renewable resource. It also has the added benefit of reducing waste around your home and cutting down on the amount of material that goes into our landfills. - Source: Internet To improve sandy soil, you will want to add three to four inches of organic matter like compost, peat moss, and/ or manure. Work the organic matter you’ve chosen into the soil about 6 inches deep. Once you’ve planted, be sure to mulch around your plants to help retain moisture by cooling the soil. You’ll want to add 2-3 inches of matter each year. - Source: Internet Compost is a viable alternative to peat moss for gardeners who want to add organic material to their gardens. Compost improves the soil’s water holding capacity and aeration while adding important nutrients and microorganisms to the soil, and is usually free. As a compromise, some gardeners opt to use small amounts of peat moss in their seed starting soil mixes, as compost can contain weed seeds and pathogens if the pile does not reach the correct temperature. - Source: Internet Potatoes tend not to develop scab in acidic sandy soils, but they are thirsty plants. Less water, more often is a good rule of thumb. This advice doesn’t just apply to potatoes, but all vegetables grown on this type of soil. The same goes for fertilizer. You might want to consider installing irrigation to gradually water and feed your plants. - Source: Internet Soil life. Soil organisms include the bacteria and fungi, protozoa and nematodes, mites, springtails, earthworms and other tiny creatures found in healthy soil. These organisms are essential for plant growth. They help convert organic matter and soil minerals into the vitamins, hormones, disease-suppressing compounds and nutrients that plants need to grow. - Source: Internet Air. A healthy soil is about 25 percent air. Insects microbes, earthworms and soil life require this much air to live. The air in soil is also an important source of the atmospheric nitrogen that is utilized by plants. - Source: Internet The colour of sphagnum peat - white, brown or black, reflects its degree of decomposition, which can be measured on a scale called the von Post scale. The von Post scale classifies peats depending on the level of decomposition, and is divided into ten classes, from very slightly decomposed peat (H1-H2), slightly decomposed peat (H3-H4), medium decomposed peat (H5-H6), highly decomposed peat (H7- H8), until finally completely decomposed peat (H9-H10). For growing media, the best peats to use are those from H1 to H6. - Source: Internet To sterilize garden soil, remove any infected plants or weeds and then use a till or shovel to break up clumps. Next, give your soil a soak before covering it with a clear plastic sheet and weighing it down with rocks. Leave the soil for 4-8 weeks, giving the sun sufficient time to kill off unwanted bacteria and weeds. - Source: Internet Cover crops are used primarily to protect fallow (unused) soil. In the North, gardeners usually plant them at the end of the season so their soil is not bare over the winter. Cold-hardy crops such as vetch and winter rye are best for overwintering. They will begin growth again in spring, and need to be tilled in before you can plant your garden. - Source: Internet Silty Soil. Silty soils contain small irregularly shaped particles of weathered rock, which means they are usually quite dense and have relatively small pore spaces and poor drainage. They tend to be more fertile than either sandy or clayey soils. - Source: Internet The pH of peat moss is slightly acidic. Acid loving plants like blueberries and camellias benefit greatly from peat moss applications, although plants that require neutral or basic pHs may not benefit from too much peat moss in the soil without additional, more alkaline amendments. - Source: Internet Sandy Soil. Sand particles are large, irregularly shaped bits of rock. In a sandy soil, large air spaces between the sand particles allow water to drain very quickly. Nutrients tend to drain away with the water, often before plants have a chance to absorb them. For this reason, sandy soils are usually nutrient-poor. - Source: Internet Well-aerated soil has plenty of pore space between the soil particles or crumbs. Fine soil particles (clay or silt) have tiny spaces between them - in some cases too small for air to penetrate. Soil composed of large particles, like sand, has large pore spaces and contains plenty of air. But, too much air can cause organic matter to decompose too quickly. - Source: Internet Mediterranean herbs were made for thin, dry, sandy soils. This is one situation where improving the soil with organic matter is not required. Lavender, thyme and rosemary will cope just fine – in fact they’ll be happier – with a low-fertility bed that never becomes waterlogged in winter. - Source: Internet Different peats on the von Post scale, are physically and chemically different. For example dark or “black” highly decomposed sphagnum peat has the highest water holding capacity, whereas the white sphagnum peat has the highest air capacity. Calcium and magnesium concentrations as well as pH-values also vary between the different peat types. - Source: Internet Sphagnum moss grows in bogs. As the moss matures, old, dead plant material forms layers underneath the living moss. These deposits can grow to over 20’ in-depth, and form the material we call peat. - Source: Internet Coconut coir fiber: With a pH close to neutral, coconut coir fiber is simply ground up coconut husks. It’s considered to be a more sustainable soil material than other commonly used ingredients such as peat moss. But keep in mind that coir fiber tends to be more expensive. - Source: Internet The best vegetables to grow on sandy soil are those that can be grown right through the winter, because they help to bind the soil with their roots and protect it from wind, rain and snow with their leaves. Or sow an overwintering green manure. Even a carpet of weeds will do. What better excuse for delaying that final autumn weeding session? - Source: Internet The Perfect Soil Blend, created by former DIY Network star Joe Lamp’l, is best suited for raised bed gardening. To start, make sure you have high quality topsoil. If you need to buy topsoil, make sure to buy from a reputable brand or talk to the supplier about where their topsoil comes from. - Source: Internet Not everyone wants to grow veggies, and many who do still like to have dedicated flower beds to enjoy and to provide food for pollinators. This flower garden blend from Garden Squared will help your flowering plants flourish. Just make sure to remove any large clumps or rocks from the mix. Or, as with other blends on this list, buy screened topsoil. - Source: Internet Soil texture can range from very fine particles to coarse and gravelly. You don’t have to be a scientist to determine the texture of the soil in your garden. To get a rough idea, simply place some soil in the palm of your hand and wet it slightly, then run the mixture between your fingers. If it feels gritty, your soil is sandy; if it feels smooth, like moist talcum powder, your soil is silty; if it feels harsh when dry, sticky or slippery when wet, or rubbery when moist, it is high in clay. - Source: Internet There are a lot of different materials you can add to your gardening soil and the ingredients you choose will depend on the type of soil you’re starting with or whether you’re starting from scratch. Note that what works in one person’s garden might be completely different from what works in your’s. Read on to learn about eighteen common gardening soil ingredients and their benefits. - Source: Internet In a minute or two the sand portion of the soil will have settled to the bottom of the jar. Mark the level of sand on the side of the jar. - Source: Internet Though some gardeners may be blessed with perfect soil, most of us garden in soil that is less than perfect. If your soil has too much clay in it, is too sandy, too stony or too acidic, don’t despair. Turning a poor soil into a plant-friendly soil is not difficult to do, once you understand the components of a healthy soil. - Source: Internet As with most products, there are downsides associated with peat moss. The biggest is expense. While prices vary, peat moss is relatively expensive, especially if you plan on using large amounts. On the other hand, mixing your own potting soil can be cheaper than buying pre-mixed potting soil in the long run. - Source: Internet Blueberries are a popular acid-loving plant, and most growers swear by peat moss. However, the addition of peat moss has less to do with pH and more to do with how blueberry roots access nutrients. Peat moss helps encourage fungi on the roots that enable the plants to grow. - Source: Internet Another very valuable soil amendment is sand. You might intuitively think sand doesn’t make sense in a garden, and why would it, there isn’t much growing on your local beach. However, sand adds drainage and can break up heavier soils. Too much sand won’t be able to hold enough moisture, but 10% or so of sand into a soil mix can be a great additive. You can buy coarse sand (not play sand) at most hardware stores. - Source: Internet Sphagnum moss is used to line baskets, for arts \u0026 crafts, and as a soil amendment. Sphagnum moss can be milled and baled, or sold in loose in bags. Sphagnum moss has a neutral pH and helps with aeration. - Source: Internet Peat moss can be a useful amendment in clay soils IF you plan on doing regular soil tests. Peat moss can help with drainage by providing stable organic matter in the soil. However, it also increases the amount of water and nutrients clay will hold, which can cause root rots and nutrient toxicities. - Source: Internet Soil is probably the most important aspect of gardening. Having the right growing medium for your plants gives them a much higher success rate and can make your garden that much better. Over the past several years companies have started packaging soil mixes for many different types of situations. These bags give us a convenient way to amend our gardens without having to have a delivery of 2 or 3 yards of compost. A larger property might be able to use a large amount of soil amendments, but smaller gardens don’t need that volume. - Source: Internet Soil test results usually rate the levels of soil pH, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and sometimes nitrogen. (Most labs do not test for nitrogen because it is so unstable in the soil.) Some labs also offer tests for micronutrients such as boron, zinc and manganese. Unless you feel there may be a deficiency problem, you probably won’t need micronutrient testing. As a preventative measure, you can apply organic fertilizers that include micronutrients (such as greensand and kelp meal). - Source: Internet this makes it a good acidity corrector, especially with plants that cannot stand and alkaline soil. Peat moss helps break the ground; putting organic matter in the soil, and in all cases varying the texture of the soil, allows for better aeration, feeding and humidity retention. Because the fibers of peat moss beak down slowly, it has become popular with gardeners who want to correct the texture of clay soil in particular. - Source: Internet Powdered seaweed (kelp meal) releases its nutrients gradually into the soil. Liquid seaweed makes these nutrients immediately available. Seaweed is not a complete fertilizer because it doesn’t provide adequate nitrogen and phosphorus for most plants. But it is an excellent part of a balanced soil-building program. - Source: Internet Another blend from Eartheasy, but this time no expense is spared. If you have the budget, or if you only have a small garden area, this mix will ensure your beds will start out weed free and filled with tons of nutrients. Similar to the square foot gardening blend, however this mixture uses coconut coir instead of peat moss due to coconut coir’s increased sustainability. - Source: Internet It is best to till and amend bare soil late in the fall before the ground freezes. This will prevent weeds from germinating on bare soil, and it allows organic matter to begin to break down. The soil will be loose from tilling, and it is important to keep it from getting compacted. Don’t allow people to walk or drive on the tilled area, or else you will need to till again before planting, which can destroy the structure. - Source: Internet Although garden soil often contains topsoil along with organic matter like peat moss and compost, they can’t be used interchangeably. Topsoil is a naturally occurring material and often contains things like rocks, twigs and soil clumps. Meanwhile, garden soil is carefully cultivated and has a smooth consistency. - Source: Internet Small pore spaces permit water to migrate back upwards through the process of capillary action. In waterlogged soils, water has completely filled the pore spaces, forcing out all the air. This suffocates soil organisms as well as plant roots. - Source: Internet Peats from different sources also vary biologically, and vary in their microbial composition. Generally, blond or light-colored peats (H1-H2 on the von Post scale) are known to be very disease suppressive. This is because they can harbor high populations of ‘friendly’ microbes such as Trichoderma and Streptomyces species, which have shown to reduce the levels of pathogenic microbes in soil. - Source: Internet Application: There are several ways to prepare a seed starting mix from peat moss. The mix you use will vary, depending on your preferences. Soilless seed mixes use peat moss as the base with equal parts horticultural grade perlite or vermiculite, and add small amounts of lime and fertilizer to lower the PH and give your seeds some plant food. Potting mixes with soil use equal parts soil, peat moss, and perlite or vermiculite, along with any other fertilizers or amendments the gardener wishes to add. - Source: Internet The next step requires a little more work. Sandy soils are less fertile than other soil types, and more prone to drying out, because they’re made up of relatively large particles. This means there are cavernous gaps between the particles, making it easy for water (and water-soluble nutrients) to filter down through the soil, out of the reach of plant roots. We need to partially plug up those gaps and help the soil to hold on to water and nutrients. - Source: Internet The acidity in your soil affects the availability of nutrients to your plants. If the acidity is too high or too low, the nutrients can become chemically bound to the soil and unavailable for your plants to absorb as food. Acidity is measured on a pH scale with a pH of 6.5 to 6.8 being the best range for your plant’s growth. - Source: Internet Many nutrients are positively-charged ions. Cation-exchange-capacity (CEC) refers to the negative charge of the soil, which allows it to hold onto positively-charged nutrients. (source) - Source: Internet Clay soil is difficult to manage. When it’s wet, it’s a slippery, sticky mess. When it’s dry, you need a jackhammer to till a vegetable patch. - Source: Internet Peat moss is not sustainable; it takes Nature 500 years to make 10 inches of peat moss. This issue has become central in the gardening world, and especially in the organic community and among gardeners who are aware of sustainability. Its quarrying is now strictly limited and regulated in many countries, like in Canada, in fact. Most gardeners have that feeling of remorse when using it nowadays. - Source: Internet Smell, purity, colour and other visually detectable and are first inspected. Other parameters are then tested by laboratory analysis including, pH, moisture content, water absorption, structural analysis, bulk density, temperature and weed tests. Only peat which passes all the tests then enters into the production facility. - Source: Internet Their excretions also help to bind soil particles into the small aggregates that make a soil loose and crumbly. As a gardener, your job is to create the ideal conditions for these soil organisms to do their work. This means providing them with an abundant source of food (the carbohydrates in organic matter), oxygen (present in a well-aerated soil), and water (an adequate but not excessive amount). - Source: Internet Farmers often cope with hardpan by using a chisel plow to cut and break up this dense layer of soil. Home gardeners can break up and mix the hardpan layer by “double digging” the soil. This involves removing 10 to 12 inches of topsoil, and then working organic matter into the 12-inch layer of material that lies below. If the hardpan layer is not too deep, you can use a digging fork to puncture it and open up passages for air and water. - Source: Internet it far exceeds the price of comparable mediums, like coconut coir. In fact, you are more likely to find it mixed in with other mediums already. Peat moss tends to compact over time; under the pressure of water, peat moss becomes compact and thick, which means that it loses its aeration and absorption properties. This is remedied by mixing it with other media, especially perlite. - Source: Internet On average, peat moss only grows by 0.02 inches (which is only 0.5 millimeters) every year. It is therefore, a very, very slow process. - Source: Internet Sand: In some cases sand needs to be added to soil to help improve drainage. Coarse river sand increases the soil surface area, allowing roots to cling to it. Meanwhile, playground sand ensures a loose mix. - Source: Internet Although it only makes up a small fraction of the soil (normally 5 to 10 percent), organic matter is absolutely essential. It binds together soil particles into porous crumbs or granules which allow air and water to move through the soil. Organic matter also retains moisture (humus holds up to 90 percent of its weight in water), and is able to absorb and store nutrients. Most importantly, organic matter is food for microorganisms and other forms of soil life. - Source: Internet the fibers peat moss is made of decompose slowly, and because they have been “treated” underwater for a very, long time, they are even more difficult to break down. This means that it has a very long life in the ground. Peat moss is fully organic: by now you know that it is sourced from bogs and it is fully natural. However, the quarrying and transportation does burn a lot of fossil fuels, so, if it is produced organically, it is not harvested and delivered organically. - Source: Internet Peat moss is a carbon rich material, which makes it a good source of carbon in compost piles. The moisture retaining quality of peat moss also reduces the need for frequent watering, which makes it doubly valuable. The only downsides of using peat moss in compost are the expense and the environmental concerns associated with sphagnum peat moss. - Source: Internet because it has formed in an anaerobic environment and many bacteria need oxygen to live, it is free from pathogens that can harm the roots of your plants. Peat moss has long decomposition times; the fibers peat moss is made of decompose slowly, and because they have been “treated” underwater for a very, long time, they are even more difficult to break down. This means that it has a very long life in the ground. - Source: Internet Before deciding if you’re going to amend your soil, measure it with a soil meter. If it is indeed too alkaline and you want to add agricultural sulfur or iron sulfate, make sure you’re very careful. These substances can be dangerous to children and pets, as well as can harm your plants if used incorrectly. - Source: Internet To get the most accurate test results, take a soil sample from each garden area: lawn, flower garden, and vegetable garden. Spring and fall are the best times to perform a soil test. The soil is more stable, and these are good times to incorporate any recommended fertilizers. Many labs will give recommendations for specific organic amendments upon request. If not, you will have to compare labels to find organic substitutes for the chemical fertilizers that may be suggested. - Source: Internet Having a green thumb does not always translate to using environmentally green methods. Peat moss is a nonrenewable resource. Some gardeners have environmental concerns about peat moss that make it a poor choice for their gardens and is certainly an important factor to consider. - Source: Internet Using peat moss to improve soil conditions has the advantage that it lasts long (a decade, depending on how much you add, the quality, the soil, crop etc.) On the other hand, peat is mainly corrective and not regenerative. The best way to change your soil quality permanently is through regenerative techniques. - Source: Internet Every soil has unique physical characteristics, which are determined by how it was formed. The silty soil found in an old floodplain is inherently different from stony mountain soil; the clay soil that lay under a glacier for millions of years is unlike the sandy soil near an ocean. Some of these basic qualities can be improved with proper management—or made worse by abuse. - Source: Internet Changing the pH of your soil doesn’t happen overnight. It may take one or two seasons to get in the range you want, then you maintain it thereafter. Keep adding that organic material though as it will continue to add nutrients and help moderate any pH imbalances. - Source: Internet Fertilizer: A peat moss based soil mix is going to need fertilizer added to it since it will be low in nutrients. Natural fertilizer is made from ingredients such as mined minerals, animal by-products and plant manures. You can buy organic fertilizer to add to your homemade garden mix or create your own. - Source: Internet This is good news for homeowners with sandy soils. Sand is generally acidic and suffers from poor water holding capacity. Peat moss would help soils retain water, but has not been recommended for sandy soils because they are already acidic. - Source: Internet How can I improve my pH? Clay soils are naturally alkaline, but plants prefer acidic environments. Organic matter generally lowers pH, so consistent compost and peat moss amendments can lower pH gradually over time. However, for more reliable results, it is better to use sulfur to lower pH and rely on organic matter to help maintain lower pH values. Learn more about soil alkalinity here. - Source: Internet You can also use peat moss as a soil amendment. Dry, sandy soils benefit from adding peat moss to retain moisture, and peat moss improves drainage and prevents compaction in dry and wet soils alike. These qualities make peat moss particularly useful in vegetable gardens, where extremes of dry and wet can negatively impact the growth and production of vegetables. - Source: Internet If you want to create an in-ground garden, the native soil isn’t going to be sufficient to plant in as it likely will be too loose or too firm and not hold nearly enough nutrients. What exactly you add to it and in what quantities will depend on your existing soil, so first things first - start digging. If the area has a lot of sand or clay, you’ll need to amend it. - Source: Internet You can increase the amount of organic matter in your soil by adding compost, aged animal manures, green manures (cover crops), mulches or peat moss. Because most soil life and plant roots are located in the top 6 inches of soil, concentrate on this upper layer. To learn more about making your own compost, read All About Composting. - Source: Internet Peat moss can be purchased on its own, but it is often added as an ingredient to potting soil to lighten the soil and allow it to hold moisture better. It is often the main ingredient of soilless potting mixes. Because the bogs where peat moss is harvested are ecologically fragile, there is now a movement to limit the use of peat moss in gardening. - Source: Internet This is where peat moss truly shines. Clay soil is made up of tiny particles that pack together and form impenetrable layers. This makes it incredibly difficult for water to penetrate, and if it succeeds, it is just as hard to drain. - Source: Internet To improve the soil with too low acidity the common ingredient is sulfur, but you can also use high acidic organic matter like peat moss and pine needles. In sandy soil, use one pound of sulfur per one hundred square feet. In good soil, use one and a half to two pounds. In mostly clay, use two pounds. - Source: Internet under the pressure of water, peat moss becomes compact and thick, which means that it loses its aeration and absorption properties. This is remedied by mixing it with other media, especially perlite. Peat moss is poor in nutrients; it is not decomposing matter, which means that while you can use it to change the texture and properties of your soil, it is not the best choice if you have organic regeneration in mind. For example, earthworms are not attracted to peat moss, nor are many of the microorganisms that turn the soiled fertile. - Source: Internet Most essential plant nutrients are soluble at pH levels of 6.5 to 6.8, which is why most plants grow best in this range. If the pH of your soil is much higher or lower, soil nutrients start to become chemically bound to the soil particles, which makes them unavailable to your plants. Plant health suffers because the roots are unable to absorb the nutrients they require. - Source: Internet Identifying your soil type: Soils are generally described according to the predominant type of soil particle present: sand, silt or clay. By conducting a simple soil test, you can easily see what kind of soil you’re dealing with. You may want to repeat this test with several different soil samples from your lawn and garden. - Source: Internet In some cases you’ll want sandy soil, such as when growing succulents. Succulents naturally grow in dry regions and if your soil doesn’t drain quickly the roots of the plants can become waterlogged. You can buy succulent blends from most gardening centers, but if you want to save money you can make your own. - Source: Internet It’s better to use a potting soil mix in your indoor and outdoor containers. However, if you’re trying to save money by using what you already have, make sure to sift and dry the gardening soil before placing it in a pot. As for the reverse question, which is “Can I use potting soil in my garden?” The answer is essentially the same. You can, but it isn’t ideal as it may drain too quickly in a larger area. - Source: Internet I think one the best things you can add to your garden is dehydrated cow manure. This product is advantageous because it instantly brings valuable nutrients to your soil. While adding manure is great, you can add too much. If you have too much of a good thing the soil can become waterlogged and also have too much nitrogen, phosphate potassium and this can lead to various issues with growing many plants. - Source: Internet The most common way to raise the pH of your soil (make it less acidic) is to add powdered limestone. Dolomitic limestone will also add manganese to the soil. Apply it in the fall because it takes several months to alter the pH. - Source: Internet The most important benefit of peat moss is the material’s absorbency. Peat moss retains water much better than average soils, which increases the absorbency of any potting mixes and garden soils that use peat moss. - Source: Internet putting organic matter in the soil, and in all cases varying the texture of the soil, allows for better aeration, feeding and humidity retention. Because the fibers of peat moss beak down slowly, it has become popular with gardeners who want to correct the texture of clay soil in particular. Peat moss is sterile; because it has formed in an anaerobic environment and many bacteria need oxygen to live, it is free from pathogens that can harm the roots of your plants. - Source: Internet Peat moss is very difficult to break down, and the effects it has on porosity last much longer than compost. However, because it is difficult to break down, it doesn’t release nutrients into the soil. This is why you need to add peat moss and compost together to increase porosity and add nutrition. - Source: Internet The acidic pH of peat moss is beneficial to some plants but not beneficial to plants that prefer alkaline soils. For these plants, compost is a better peat moss alternative, as it has a more neutral or even alkaline pH, depending on the compost composition. - Source: Internet Growing your own food is such a rewarding experience, it’s no wonder gardening has seen an upswing in popularity. Even for those who prefer flowers to edibles, spending time amongst plants is a great way to destress and connect with nature. And while growing your own fruits and vegetables can be a great way to save money at the grocery store, you may end up spending your funds on gardening soil instead. Unless you learn to make your own! - Source: Internet In Europe, 90 %of the growing media used by professional growers are peat-based. In 2013, the total growing media market in EU, which includes amateur (hobby) use, was more than 34 million m3. Peat is also transported and used across the globe. From Northern Europe, peat is sent by ship to areas including the middle-east, Asia and even Australia where growers appreciate its unique properties, supporting a global horticulture industry. - Source: Internet Ideally, your soil should have a combination of large and small pore spaces. Again, organic matter is the key, because it encourages the formation of aggregate, or crumbs, or soil. Organic matter also absorbs water and retains it until it is needed by plant roots. - Source: Internet Incorporating large amounts of organic matter into your soil can cause a temporary loss in nitrogen. As the material decomposes, it draws nitrogen from the soil to support the process. Once decomposition is complete, nitrogen is released back to the soil and is available for plants. - Source: Internet To start, cover your gardening area with “brown materials” such as shredded dry leaves, shredded newspaper and peat moss. Then add a layer of “green materials” such as food scraps, garden trimmings and grass clippings on top. The brown materials layer should be about twice as thick as the green. Then repeat the process, continuing to layer until your overall pile is about two feet tall. Once the layers have decomposed to create uniform, compost-like material you can plant in it. - Source: Internet Clay textures can improve, but it takes time and sweat. The best thing you can add to a clay soil is organic matter. Compost is the best general-purpose soil amendment, but there are specific soil conditions where other organic materials would be beneficial. - Source: Internet To work out what kind of soil you have you need to perform a soil test. It’s incredibly complicated and difficult to do, requires much training and effort, and is not for the faint-hearted. Are you game? Okay then, here’s what you have to do: - Source: Internet Peat moss is also a sterile planting medium, which means that it does not contain harmful pathogens or weed seeds. This, combined with its absorbency, makes it ideal for starting seedlings and is why peat moss is an essential component in most seed starting mixes. - Source: Internet Liquid soil conditioners typically contain a blend of humic acid and catalytic enzymes, which are produced in a controlled environment by the same sort of microorganisms that are at work in your compost pile. When applied to your soil, their effect is similar to the effect you get when you add compost. Clay soils become easier to work and nutrients become more available; sandy soils are able to retain more water and nutrients. - Source: Internet it is not decomposing matter, which means that while you can use it to change the texture and properties of your soil, it is not the best choice if you have organic regeneration in mind. For example, earthworms are not attracted to peat moss, nor are many of the microorganisms that turn the soiled fertile. The acidity of peat moss does not suit all plants; most plants, as you know, love neutral to alkaline soil, and peat moss is acidic. - Source: Internet Aside from typically being less expensive than bagged gardening soil, creating your own mix means you can tailor your soil to your specific growing needs. Whether you have an in-ground garden, raised beds or containers, read on to find out which garden blend is best for you. Or skip ahead to learn about eighteen different soil ingredients and their uses. - Source: Internet Peat moss is a great seed starting medium. It is sterile, absorbent, and the homogeneous material is easy to work with. This keeps the seed bed uniformly moist, aiding in germination. Most seed starting mixes contain peat moss, and you can make your own seed starting mix by mixing peat moss with other soils or by making a peat moss based potting soil and adding fertilizer and vermiculite. - Source: Internet fertilizing or feeding the soil is a waste of time unless it can hold on to the nutrients. Fibers absorb them and then release them slowly to the roots of your plants. Peat moss holds on to water; again because it is fibrous organic matter, it soaks with water and then releases it slowly. In fact, it can hold as much as 20 times of its weight in water. This quality, as well as its ability to retain nutrients, is helpful if your soil is sandy, which means that it does not hold on to moisture and nutrients. - Source: Internet The quickest way to have a general idea of your soil type is to grab a small handful and make sure it’s damp (not soaking wet) take a pinch and rub it between your fingers. If it feels slimy and slippery, it has a high clay content. If it’s gritty, it’ll have more sand. Silt feels smooth like wet talcum powder. - Source: Internet Finally, peat has a low bulk density and is easy compressible. This makes it very fuel efficient for transporting over long distances. This helps to both keep prices down for growers, and to reduce its impact on climate change. - Source: Internet I won’t lie – sandy soils do need a lot of organic matter, frequently applied, to make a difference. The warmer your climate, the faster organic matter will break down, and the more often your soil will need replenishing. Start with at least two bucketfuls of organic matter per square yard each fall, added to the soil surface as a mulch where it will help to protect the soil from scouring rain and winds. - Source: Internet Improving your soil takes several seasons. But even with the best will in the world, it will always be sandy soil at heart. ‘Work with what you’ve got’ is good advice! So let’s take a look at which vegetables naturally grow well in sandy soil. - Source: Internet As with pretty much everything in gardening, there are plenty of different ways to mix gardening soil - with no one way being the “right” way. However, with some knowhow and a little trial and error you should be able to figure out the best soil for your specific situation. Read on to learn eleven different methods to get you started! - Source: Internet Soak the moss in a large bin or tub of water for 24 hours. Peat is difficult to saturate, especially in the soil. Soaking it first helps it incorporate into the soil instead of creating dry patches. - Source: Internet Lack of pore space means that clay soils are generally low in both organic matter and microbial activity. Plant roots are stunted because it is too hard for them to push their way through the soil. Foot traffic and garden equipment can cause compaction problems. Fortunately, most clay soils are rich in minerals which will become available to your plants once you improve the texture of the soil. - Source: Internet Green manures can also be planted on a new garden area the year before you plan to use it. They will choke out weeds and add a wealth of organic matter. Legumes, including field peas, soybeans, and alfalfa, will contribute both nitrogen and organic matter to the soil. Fast-growing grains and buckwheat produce the most organic matter and will smother competing weeds as they grow. - Source: Internet Not only is peat moss absorbent, it also does not compact, unlike other organic materials. Soil compaction is damaging to gardens and reduces water absorption and plant growth. Peat moss remains springy when it is wet and rehydrates easily, plus one application of peat moss can last for years. - Source: Internet Your local Cooperative Extension Service office may offer a professional soil testing service. The advantage is low cost and results that are specifically geared to your location. If this service is not available, you can also have your soil tested by an independent soil lab. If possible, choose one in your own region of the country. - Source: Internet Gardeners coping with sandy soil daydream about sticky clay! Light, free-draining, quick to warm up in spring…sounds like horticultural heaven, doesn’t it? But those of us who have actually had to work with sandy soil know better. Sand undoubtedly has its plus points, but it has its challenges, too. - Source: Internet Other amendments like peat can loosen soil and hold moisture. Many of the soil mixtures you can buy have a heavy amount of peat. I tend to add a bit of sand those bags. - Source: Internet Every soil has a different combination of these five basic components. By balancing them you can dramatically improve your soil’s healthy and your garden’s productivity. But first, you need to know what kind of soil you have. - Source: Internet For example, if your lawn and garden space is 35’ x 25’, you need to amend 875sq’. Each large bale of peat moss contains 3.8 cubic feet of material, which is enough to cover 90sq’ at a 1” depth. - Source: Internet Don’t confuse peat moss (also sphagnum peat moss) with sphagnum moss. They come from the same plants, any of the Sphagnopsida class but they are not the exact same thing. Peat moss is what ends up under the water of these plants, while sphagnum moss is collected from the still living floating parts of the plant. - Source: Internet Here are a few tips to help you find information about Amending Sandy Soil With Peat Moss:\r- Look for good places to get information about The Secret to Improving Sandy Soil.

It is also inert, like <strong>peat</strong> moss, which means that it can hold on to nutrients for long, but it does not provide any itself. It is readily available as well, which is why it is a favorite with gardeners all over the world. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>again because it is fibrous organic matter, it soaks with water and then releases it slowly. In fact, it can hold as much as 20 times of its weight in water. This quality, as well as its ability to retain nutrients, is helpful if your <strong>soil</strong> is sandy, which means that it does not hold on to moisture and nutrients. Peat moss can hold on to air; roots need to breathe as well as feed and drink and in the pores and spaces within the fibers of <strong>peat</strong> moss, air can find a good place to hide. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat moss is partially decomposed sphagnum moss plants, which are harvested from <strong>peat</strong> bogs. While <strong>peat</strong> moss is brown, like <strong>soil</strong>, it has a different texture and weight, it is light and spongy and crumbles into tiny splinters. It is difficult to wet, but once wet it retains water like a sponge, meaning it reduces drainage of water from <strong>soil</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sandy <strong>soil</strong> will feel gritty to the touch and is problematic as it doesn’t retain moisture. Work the compost and top<strong>soil</strong> into the sandy <strong>soil</strong> until it begins to cling together when squeezed, though it should still remain crumbly. Soil that is clay-heavy will stick together in clumps and does not drain well. It will need sand and fine compost added to it to improve drainage and boost nutrients. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A sandy <strong>soil</strong> also has so much air in it that microbes consume organic matter very quickly. Because sandy <strong>soil</strong>s usually contain very little clay or organic matter, they don&rsquo;t have much of a crumb structure. The <strong>soil</strong> particles don&rsquo;t stick together, even when they&rsquo;re wet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This recipe from The Beginner’s Garden is perfect for experimentation. You may want to change the ratio between the regular gardening <strong>soil</strong> and the <strong>soil</strong> with the added fertilizer, but note that additives in bagged <strong>soil</strong> usually up the price. You may also want to play with the amount of top<strong>soil</strong> and worm castings added, or replace the worm castings with another nutrient-rich amendment such as Lomi dirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>How much compost should I add to my clay <strong>soil</strong>? Compost is the best <strong>soil</strong> amendment and should be the primary focus in improving clay <strong>soil</strong>. Add up to 3” to existing lawns and landscapes, and use compost as a topdressing around the drip ring of established plants. After each major addition of organic matter, the nitrogen in the <strong>soil</strong> will drop, so you may need to supplement with fertilizer on established lawns. Read our article on compost for more information. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Limestone: Limestone is an inexpensive and beneficial ingredient in many homemade <strong>soil</strong> recipes. Pulverized limestone helps neutralize a <strong>peat</strong> moss based <strong>soil</strong>’s pH. It’s recommended to add one-quarter cup of limestone for every six gallons of <strong>peat</strong> moss. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some gardeners are blessed from the beginning with great garden <strong>soil</strong>, that’s great! This article is for those of us that must work at it. And, while we’re talking about it, keep in mind you can buy bulk garden <strong>soil</strong> which is great for those in a hurry, waited too late in the season, or simply want to go straight to planting. Our planter’s mix is a great option to jump-start your garden this year! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are <strong>peat</strong> moss alternatives if you have concerns about the price of <strong>peat</strong> moss or its environmental impact. Compost offers similar benefits to <strong>peat</strong> moss in the garden and is a completely renewable resource. It also has the added benefit of reducing waste around your home and cutting down on the amount of material that goes into our landfills. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To improve sandy <strong>soil</strong>, you will want to add three to four inches of organic matter like compost, <strong>peat</strong> moss, and/ or manure. Work the organic matter you’ve chosen into the <strong>soil</strong> about 6 inches deep. Once you’ve planted, be sure to mulch around your plants to help retain moisture by cooling the <strong>soil</strong>. You’ll want to add 2-3 inches of matter each year. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Compost is a viable alternative to <strong>peat</strong> moss for gardeners who want to add organic material to their gardens. Compost improves the <strong>soil</strong>’s water holding capacity and aeration while adding important nutrients and microorganisms to the <strong>soil</strong>, and is usually free. As a compromise, some gardeners opt to use small amounts of <strong>peat</strong> moss in their seed starting <strong>soil</strong> mixes, as compost can contain weed seeds and pathogens if the pile does not reach the correct temperature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Potatoes tend not to develop scab in acidic sandy <strong>soil</strong>s, but they are thirsty plants. Less water, more often is a good rule of thumb. This advice doesn’t just apply to potatoes, but all vegetables grown on this type of <strong>soil</strong>. The same goes for fertilizer. You might want to consider installing irrigation to gradually water and feed your plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Soil life. Soil organisms include the bacteria and fungi, protozoa and nematodes, mites, springtails, earthworms and other tiny creatures found in healthy <strong>soil</strong>. These organisms are essential for plant growth. They help convert organic matter and <strong>soil</strong> minerals into the vitamins, hormones, disease-suppressing compounds and nutrients that plants need to grow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Air. A healthy <strong>soil</strong> is about 25 percent air. Insects microbes, earthworms and <strong>soil</strong> life require this much air to live. The air in <strong>soil</strong> is also an important source of the atmospheric nitrogen that is utilized by plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The colour of sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> - white, brown or black, reflects its degree of decomposition, which can be measured on a scale called the von Post scale. The von Post scale classifies <strong>peat</strong>s depending on the level of decomposition, and is divided into ten classes, from very slightly decomposed <strong>peat</strong> (H1-H2), slightly decomposed <strong>peat</strong> (H3-H4), medium decomposed <strong>peat</strong> (H5-H6), highly decomposed <strong>peat</strong> (H7- H8), until finally completely decomposed <strong>peat</strong> (H9-H10). For growing media, the best <strong>peat</strong>s to use are those from H1 to H6. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To sterilize garden <strong>soil</strong>, remove any infected plants or weeds and then use a till or shovel to break up clumps. Next, give your <strong>soil</strong> a soak before covering it with a clear plastic sheet and weighing it down with rocks. Leave the <strong>soil</strong> for 4-8 weeks, giving the sun sufficient time to kill off unwanted bacteria and weeds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cover crops are used primarily to protect fallow (unused) <strong>soil</strong>. In the North, gardeners usually plant them at the end of the season so their <strong>soil</strong> is not bare over the winter. Cold-hardy crops such as vetch and winter rye are best for overwintering. They will begin growth again in spring, and need to be tilled in before you can plant your garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Silty Soil. Silty <strong>soil</strong>s contain small irregularly shaped particles of weathered rock, which means they are usually quite dense and have relatively small pore spaces and poor drainage. They tend to be more fertile than either sandy or clayey <strong>soil</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=5><li>The pH of <strong>peat</strong> moss is slightly acidic. Acid loving plants like blueberries and camellias benefit greatly from <strong>peat</strong> moss applications, although plants that require neutral or basic pHs may not benefit from too much <strong>peat</strong> moss in the <strong>soil</strong> without additional, more alkaline amendments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Sandy Soil. Sand particles are large, irregularly shaped bits of rock. In a sandy <strong>soil</strong>, large air spaces between the sand particles allow water to drain very quickly. Nutrients tend to drain away with the water, often before plants have a chance to absorb them. For this reason, sandy <strong>soil</strong>s are usually nutrient-poor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Well-aerated <strong>soil</strong> has plenty of pore space between the <strong>soil</strong> particles or crumbs. Fine <strong>soil</strong> particles (clay or silt) have tiny spaces between them - in some cases too small for air to penetrate. Soil composed of large particles, like sand, has large pore spaces and contains plenty of air. But, too much air can cause organic matter to decompose too quickly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Mediterranean herbs were made for thin, dry, sandy <strong>soil</strong>s. This is one situation where improving the <strong>soil</strong> with organic matter is not required. Lavender, thyme and rosemary will cope just fine – in fact they’ll be happier – with a low-fertility bed that never becomes waterlogged in winter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Different <strong>peat</strong>s on the von Post scale, are physically and chemically different. For example dark or “black” highly decomposed sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> has the highest water holding capacity, whereas the white sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> has the highest air capacity. Calcium and magnesium concentrations as well as pH-values also vary between the different <strong>peat</strong> types. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sphagnum moss grows in bogs. As the moss matures, old, dead plant material forms layers underneath the living moss. These deposits can grow to over 20’ in-depth, and form the material we call <strong>peat</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Coconut coir fiber: With a pH close to neutral, coconut coir fiber is simply ground up coconut husks. It’s considered to be a more sustainable <strong>soil</strong> material than other commonly used ingredients such as <strong>peat</strong> moss. But keep in mind that coir fiber tends to be more expensive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best vegetables to grow on sandy <strong>soil</strong> are those that can be grown right through the winter, because they help to bind the <strong>soil</strong> with their roots and protect it from wind, rain and snow with their leaves. Or sow an overwintering green manure. Even a carpet of weeds will do. What better excuse for delaying that final autumn weeding session? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Perfect Soil Blend, created by former DIY Network star Joe Lamp’l, is best suited for raised bed gardening. To start, make sure you have high quality top<strong>soil</strong>. If you need to buy top<strong>soil</strong>, make sure to buy from a reputable brand or talk to the supplier about where their top<strong>soil</strong> comes from. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Not everyone wants to grow veggies, and many who do still like to have dedicated flower beds to enjoy and to provide food for pollinators. This flower garden blend from Garden Squared will help your flowering plants flourish. Just make sure to remove any large clumps or rocks from the mix. Or, as with other blends on this list, buy screened top<strong>soil</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Soil texture can range from very fine particles to coarse and gravelly. You don&rsquo;t have to be a scientist to determine the texture of the <strong>soil</strong> in your garden. To get a rough idea, simply place some <strong>soil</strong> in the palm of your hand and wet it slightly, then run the mixture between your fingers. If it feels gritty, your <strong>soil</strong> is sandy; if it feels smooth, like moist talcum powder, your <strong>soil</strong> is silty; if it feels harsh when dry, sticky or slippery when wet, or rubbery when moist, it is high in clay. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are a lot of different materials you can add to your gardening <strong>soil</strong> and the ingredients you choose will depend on the type of <strong>soil</strong> you’re starting with or whether you’re starting from scratch. Note that what works in one person’s garden might be completely different from what works in your’s. Read on to learn about eighteen common gardening <strong>soil</strong> ingredients and their benefits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=4><li>In a minute or two the sand portion of the <strong>soil</strong> will have settled to the bottom of the jar. Mark the level of sand on the side of the jar. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Though some gardeners may be blessed with perfect <strong>soil</strong>, most of us garden in <strong>soil</strong> that is less than perfect. If your <strong>soil</strong> has too much clay in it, is too sandy, too stony or too acidic, don&rsquo;t despair. Turning a poor <strong>soil</strong> into a plant-friendly <strong>soil</strong> is not difficult to do, once you understand the components of a healthy <strong>soil</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol><li>As with most products, there are downsides associated with <strong>peat</strong> moss. The biggest is expense. While prices vary, <strong>peat</strong> moss is relatively expensive, especially if you plan on using large amounts. On the other hand, mixing your own potting <strong>soil</strong> can be cheaper than buying pre-mixed potting <strong>soil</strong> in the long run. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Blueberries are a popular acid-loving plant, and most growers swear by <strong>peat</strong> moss. However, the addition of <strong>peat</strong> moss has less to do with pH and more to do with how blueberry roots access nutrients. Peat moss helps encourage fungi on the roots that enable the plants to grow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another very valuable <strong>soil</strong> amendment is sand. You might intuitively think sand doesn’t make sense in a garden, and why would it, there isn’t much growing on your local beach. However, sand adds drainage and can break up heavier <strong>soil</strong>s. Too much sand won’t be able to hold enough moisture, but 10% or so of sand into a <strong>soil</strong> mix can be a great additive. You can buy coarse sand (not play sand) at most hardware stores. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sphagnum moss is used to line baskets, for arts & crafts, and as a <strong>soil</strong> amendment. Sphagnum moss can be milled and baled, or sold in loose in bags. Sphagnum moss has a neutral pH and helps with aeration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat moss can be a useful amendment in clay <strong>soil</strong>s IF you plan on doing regular <strong>soil</strong> tests. Peat moss can help with drainage by providing stable organic matter in the <strong>soil</strong>. However, it also increases the amount of water and nutrients clay will hold, which can cause root rots and nutrient toxicities. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Soil is probably the most important aspect of gardening. Having the right growing medium for your plants gives them a much higher success rate and can make your garden that much better. Over the past several years companies have started packaging <strong>soil</strong> mixes for many different types of situations. These bags give us a convenient way to amend our gardens without having to have a delivery of 2 or 3 yards of compost. A larger property might be able to use a large amount of <strong>soil</strong> amendments, but smaller gardens don’t need that volume. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Soil test results usually rate the levels of <strong>soil</strong> pH, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and sometimes nitrogen. (Most labs do not test for nitrogen because it is so unstable in the <strong>soil</strong>.) Some labs also offer tests for micronutrients such as boron, zinc and manganese. Unless you feel there may be a deficiency problem, you probably won&rsquo;t need micronutrient testing. As a preventative measure, you can apply organic fertilizers that include micronutrients (such as greensand and kelp meal). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>this makes it a good acidity corrector, especially with plants that cannot stand and alkaline <strong>soil</strong>. Peat moss helps break the ground; putting organic matter in the <strong>soil</strong>, and in all cases varying the texture of the <strong>soil</strong>, allows for better aeration, feeding and humidity retention. Because the fibers of <strong>peat</strong> moss beak down slowly, it has become popular with gardeners who want to correct the texture of clay <strong>soil</strong> in particular. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Powdered seaweed (kelp meal) releases its nutrients gradually into the <strong>soil</strong>. Liquid seaweed makes these nutrients immediately available. Seaweed is not a complete fertilizer because it doesn&rsquo;t provide adequate nitrogen and phosphorus for most plants. But it is an excellent part of a balanced <strong>soil</strong>-building program. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another blend from Eartheasy, but this time no expense is spared. If you have the budget, or if you only have a small garden area, this mix will ensure your beds will start out weed free and filled with tons of nutrients. Similar to the square foot gardening blend, however this mixture uses coconut coir instead of <strong>peat</strong> moss due to coconut coir’s increased sustainability. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It is best to till and amend bare <strong>soil</strong> late in the fall before the ground freezes. This will prevent weeds from germinating on bare <strong>soil</strong>, and it allows organic matter to begin to break down. The <strong>soil</strong> will be loose from tilling, and it is important to keep it from getting compacted. Don’t allow people to walk or drive on the tilled area, or else you will need to till again before planting, which can destroy the structure. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although garden <strong>soil</strong> often contains top<strong>soil</strong> along with organic matter like <strong>peat</strong> moss and compost, they can’t be used interchangeably. Top<strong>soil</strong> is a naturally occurring material and often contains things like rocks, twigs and <strong>soil</strong> clumps. Meanwhile, garden <strong>soil</strong> is carefully cultivated and has a smooth consistency. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Small pore spaces permit water to migrate back upwards through the process of capillary action. In waterlogged <strong>soil</strong>s, water has completely filled the pore spaces, forcing out all the air. This suffocates <strong>soil</strong> organisms as well as plant roots. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peats from different sources also vary biologically, and vary in their microbial composition. Generally, blond or light-colored <strong>peat</strong>s (H1-H2 on the von Post scale) are known to be very disease suppressive. This is because they can harbor high populations of ‘friendly’ microbes such as Trichoderma and Streptomyces species, which have shown to reduce the levels of pathogenic microbes in <strong>soil</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Application: There are several ways to prepare a seed starting mix from <strong>peat</strong> moss. The mix you use will vary, depending on your preferences. Soilless seed mixes use <strong>peat</strong> moss as the base with equal parts horticultural grade perlite or vermiculite, and add small amounts of lime and fertilizer to lower the PH and give your seeds some plant food. Potting mixes with <strong>soil</strong> use equal parts <strong>soil</strong>, <strong>peat</strong> moss, and perlite or vermiculite, along with any other fertilizers or amendments the gardener wishes to add. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The next step requires a little more work. Sandy <strong>soil</strong>s are less fertile than other <strong>soil</strong> types, and more prone to drying out, because they’re made up of relatively large particles. This means there are cavernous gaps between the particles, making it easy for water (and water-soluble nutrients) to filter down through the <strong>soil</strong>, out of the reach of plant roots. We need to partially plug up those gaps and help the <strong>soil</strong> to hold on to water and nutrients. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The acidity in your <strong>soil</strong> affects the availability of nutrients to your plants. If the acidity is too high or too low, the nutrients can become chemically bound to the <strong>soil</strong> and unavailable for your plants to absorb as food. Acidity is measured on a pH scale with a pH of 6.5 to 6.8 being the best range for your plant’s growth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Many nutrients are positively-charged ions. Cation-exchange-capacity (CEC) refers to the negative charge of the <strong>soil</strong>, which allows it to hold onto positively-charged nutrients. (source) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Clay <strong>soil</strong> is difficult to manage. When it’s wet, it’s a slippery, sticky mess. When it’s dry, you need a jackhammer to till a vegetable patch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat moss is not sustainable; it takes Nature 500 years to make 10 inches of <strong>peat</strong> moss. This issue has become central in the gardening world, and especially in the organic community and among gardeners who are aware of sustainability. Its quarrying is now strictly limited and regulated in many countries, like in Canada, in fact. Most gardeners have that feeling of remorse when using it nowadays. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Smell, purity, colour and other visually detectable and are first inspected. Other parameters are then tested by laboratory analysis including, pH, moisture content, water absorption, structural analysis, bulk density, temperature and weed tests. Only <strong>peat</strong> which passes all the tests then enters into the production facility. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Their excretions also help to bind <strong>soil</strong> particles into the small aggregates that make a <strong>soil</strong> loose and crumbly. As a gardener, your job is to create the ideal conditions for these <strong>soil</strong> organisms to do their work. This means providing them with an abundant source of food (the carbohydrates in organic matter), oxygen (present in a well-aerated <strong>soil</strong>), and water (an adequate but not excessive amount). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Farmers often cope with hardpan by using a chisel plow to cut and break up this dense layer of <strong>soil</strong>. Home gardeners can break up and mix the hardpan layer by &ldquo;double digging&rdquo; the <strong>soil</strong>. This involves removing 10 to 12 inches of top<strong>soil</strong>, and then working organic matter into the 12-inch layer of material that lies below. If the hardpan layer is not too deep, you can use a digging fork to puncture it and open up passages for air and water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>it far exceeds the price of comparable mediums, like coconut coir. In fact, you are more likely to find it mixed in with other mediums already. Peat moss tends to compact over time; under the pressure of water, <strong>peat</strong> moss becomes compact and thick, which means that it loses its aeration and absorption properties. This is remedied by mixing it with other media, especially perlite. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>On average, <strong>peat</strong> moss only grows by 0.02 inches (which is only 0.5 millimeters) every year. It is therefore, a very, very slow process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sand: In some cases sand needs to be added to <strong>soil</strong> to help improve drainage. Coarse river sand increases the <strong>soil</strong> surface area, allowing roots to cling to it. Meanwhile, playground sand ensures a loose mix. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although it only makes up a small fraction of the <strong>soil</strong> (normally 5 to 10 percent), organic matter is absolutely essential. It binds together <strong>soil</strong> particles into porous crumbs or granules which allow air and water to move through the <strong>soil</strong>. Organic matter also retains moisture (humus holds up to 90 percent of its weight in water), and is able to absorb and store nutrients. Most importantly, organic matter is food for microorganisms and other forms of <strong>soil</strong> life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>the fibers <strong>peat</strong> moss is made of decompose slowly, and because they have been “treated” underwater for a very, long time, they are even more difficult to break down. This means that it has a very long life in the ground. Peat moss is fully organic: by now you know that it is sourced from bogs and it is fully natural. However, the quarrying and transportation does burn a lot of fossil fuels, so, if it is produced organically, it is not harvested and delivered organically. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat moss is a carbon rich material, which makes it a good source of carbon in compost piles. The moisture retaining quality of <strong>peat</strong> moss also reduces the need for frequent watering, which makes it doubly valuable. The only downsides of using <strong>peat</strong> moss in compost are the expense and the environmental concerns associated with sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> moss. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>because it has formed in an anaerobic environment and many bacteria need oxygen to live, it is free from pathogens that can harm the roots of your plants. Peat moss has long decomposition times; the fibers <strong>peat</strong> moss is made of decompose slowly, and because they have been “treated” underwater for a very, long time, they are even more difficult to break down. This means that it has a very long life in the ground. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before deciding if you’re going to amend your <strong>soil</strong>, measure it with a <strong>soil</strong> meter. If it is indeed too alkaline and you want to add agricultural sulfur or iron sulfate, make sure you’re very careful. These substances can be dangerous to children and pets, as well as can harm your plants if used incorrectly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To get the most accurate test results, take a <strong>soil</strong> sample from each garden area: lawn, flower garden, and vegetable garden. Spring and fall are the best times to perform a <strong>soil</strong> test. The <strong>soil</strong> is more stable, and these are good times to incorporate any recommended fertilizers. Many labs will give recommendations for specific organic amendments upon request. If not, you will have to compare labels to find organic substitutes for the chemical fertilizers that may be suggested. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=4><li>Having a green thumb does not always translate to using environmentally green methods. Peat moss is a nonrenewable resource. Some gardeners have environmental concerns about <strong>peat</strong> moss that make it a poor choice for their gardens and is certainly an important factor to consider. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Using <strong>peat</strong> moss to improve <strong>soil</strong> conditions has the advantage that it lasts long (a decade, depending on how much you add, the quality, the <strong>soil</strong>, crop etc.) On the other hand, <strong>peat</strong> is mainly corrective and not regenerative. The best way to change your <strong>soil</strong> quality permanently is through regenerative techniques. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Every <strong>soil</strong> has unique physical characteristics, which are determined by how it was formed. The silty <strong>soil</strong> found in an old floodplain is inherently different from stony mountain <strong>soil</strong>; the clay <strong>soil</strong> that lay under a glacier for millions of years is unlike the sandy <strong>soil</strong> near an ocean. Some of these basic qualities can be improved with proper management—or made worse by abuse. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Changing the pH of your <strong>soil</strong> doesn’t happen overnight. It may take one or two seasons to get in the range you want, then you maintain it thereafter. Keep adding that organic material though as it will continue to add nutrients and help moderate any pH imbalances. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fertilizer: A <strong>peat</strong> moss based <strong>soil</strong> mix is going to need fertilizer added to it since it will be low in nutrients. Natural fertilizer is made from ingredients such as mined minerals, animal by-products and plant manures. You can buy organic fertilizer to add to your homemade garden mix or create your own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is good news for homeowners with sandy <strong>soil</strong>s. Sand is generally acidic and suffers from poor water holding capacity. Peat moss would help <strong>soil</strong>s retain water, but has not been recommended for sandy <strong>soil</strong>s because they are already acidic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>How can I improve my pH? Clay <strong>soil</strong>s are naturally alkaline, but plants prefer acidic environments. Organic matter generally lowers pH, so consistent compost and <strong>peat</strong> moss amendments can lower pH gradually over time. However, for more reliable results, it is better to use sulfur to lower pH and rely on organic matter to help maintain lower pH values. Learn more about <strong>soil</strong> alkalinity here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can also use <strong>peat</strong> moss as a <strong>soil</strong> amendment. Dry, sandy <strong>soil</strong>s benefit from adding <strong>peat</strong> moss to retain moisture, and <strong>peat</strong> moss improves drainage and prevents compaction in dry and wet <strong>soil</strong>s alike. These qualities make <strong>peat</strong> moss particularly useful in vegetable gardens, where extremes of dry and wet can negatively impact the growth and production of vegetables. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to create an in-ground garden, the native <strong>soil</strong> isn’t going to be sufficient to plant in as it likely will be too loose or too firm and not hold nearly enough nutrients. What exactly you add to it and in what quantities will depend on your existing <strong>soil</strong>, so first things first - start digging. If the area has a lot of sand or clay, you’ll need to amend it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can increase the amount of organic matter in your <strong>soil</strong> by adding compost, aged animal manures, green manures (cover crops), mulches or <strong>peat</strong> moss. Because most <strong>soil</strong> life and plant roots are located in the top 6 inches of <strong>soil</strong>, concentrate on this upper layer. To learn more about making your own compost, read All About Composting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat moss can be purchased on its own, but it is often added as an ingredient to potting <strong>soil</strong> to lighten the <strong>soil</strong> and allow it to hold moisture better. It is often the main ingredient of <strong>soil</strong>less potting mixes. Because the bogs where <strong>peat</strong> moss is harvested are ecologically fragile, there is now a movement to limit the use of <strong>peat</strong> moss in gardening. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is where <strong>peat</strong> moss truly shines. Clay <strong>soil</strong> is made up of tiny particles that pack together and form impenetrable layers. This makes it incredibly difficult for water to penetrate, and if it succeeds, it is just as hard to drain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To improve the <strong>soil</strong> with too low acidity the common ingredient is sulfur, but you can also use high acidic organic matter like <strong>peat</strong> moss and pine needles. In sandy <strong>soil</strong>, use one pound of sulfur per one hundred square feet. In good <strong>soil</strong>, use one and a half to two pounds. In mostly clay, use two pounds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>under the pressure of water, <strong>peat</strong> moss becomes compact and thick, which means that it loses its aeration and absorption properties. This is remedied by mixing it with other media, especially perlite. Peat moss is poor in nutrients; it is not decomposing matter, which means that while you can use it to change the texture and properties of your <strong>soil</strong>, it is not the best choice if you have organic regeneration in mind. For example, earthworms are not attracted to <strong>peat</strong> moss, nor are many of the microorganisms that turn the <strong>soil</strong>ed fertile. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most essential plant nutrients are soluble at pH levels of 6.5 to 6.8, which is why most plants grow best in this range. If the pH of your <strong>soil</strong> is much higher or lower, <strong>soil</strong> nutrients start to become chemically bound to the <strong>soil</strong> particles, which makes them unavailable to your plants. Plant health suffers because the roots are unable to absorb the nutrients they require. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Identifying your <strong>soil</strong> type: Soils are generally described according to the predominant type of <strong>soil</strong> particle present: sand, silt or clay. By conducting a simple <strong>soil</strong> test, you can easily see what kind of <strong>soil</strong> you&rsquo;re dealing with. You may want to re<strong>peat</strong> this test with several different <strong>soil</strong> samples from your lawn and garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In some cases you’ll want sandy <strong>soil</strong>, such as when growing succulents. Succulents naturally grow in dry regions and if your <strong>soil</strong> doesn’t drain quickly the roots of the plants can become waterlogged. You can buy succulent blends from most gardening centers, but if you want to save money you can make your own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s better to use a potting <strong>soil</strong> mix in your indoor and outdoor containers. However, if you’re trying to save money by using what you already have, make sure to sift and dry the gardening <strong>soil</strong> before placing it in a pot. As for the reverse question, which is “Can I use potting <strong>soil</strong> in my garden?” The answer is essentially the same. You can, but it isn’t ideal as it may drain too quickly in a larger area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I think one the best things you can add to your garden is dehydrated cow manure. This product is advantageous because it instantly brings valuable nutrients to your <strong>soil</strong>. While adding manure is great, you can add too much. If you have too much of a good thing the <strong>soil</strong> can become waterlogged and also have too much nitrogen, phosphate potassium and this can lead to various issues with growing many plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The most common way to raise the pH of your <strong>soil</strong> (make it less acidic) is to add powdered limestone. Dolomitic limestone will also add manganese to the <strong>soil</strong>. Apply it in the fall because it takes several months to alter the pH. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=2><li>The most important benefit of <strong>peat</strong> moss is the material’s absorbency. Peat moss retains water much better than average <strong>soil</strong>s, which increases the absorbency of any potting mixes and garden <strong>soil</strong>s that use <strong>peat</strong> moss. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>putting organic matter in the <strong>soil</strong>, and in all cases varying the texture of the <strong>soil</strong>, allows for better aeration, feeding and humidity retention.

Peat moss is sterile; because it has formed in an anaerobic environment and many bacteria need oxygen to live, it is free from pathogens that can harm the roots of your plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat moss is very difficult to break down, and the effects it has on porosity last much longer than compost. However, because it is difficult to break down, it doesn’t release nutrients into the <strong>soil</strong>. This is why you need to add <strong>peat</strong> moss and compost together to increase porosity and add nutrition. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=3><li>The acidic pH of <strong>peat</strong> moss is beneficial to some plants but not beneficial to plants that prefer alkaline <strong>soil</strong>s. For these plants, compost is a better <strong>peat</strong> moss alternative, as it has a more neutral or even alkaline pH, depending on the compost composition. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Growing your own food is such a rewarding experience, it’s no wonder gardening has seen an upswing in popularity. Even for those who prefer flowers to edibles, spending time amongst plants is a great way to destress and connect with nature. And while growing your own fruits and vegetables can be a great way to save money at the grocery store, you may end up spending your funds on gardening <strong>soil</strong> instead. Unless you learn to make your own! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In Europe, 90 %of the growing media used by professional growers are <strong>peat</strong>-based. In 2013, the total growing media market in EU, which includes amateur (hobby) use, was more than 34 million m3. Peat is also transported and used across the globe. From Northern Europe, <strong>peat</strong> is sent by ship to areas including the middle-east, Asia and even Australia where growers appreciate its unique properties, supporting a global horticulture industry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ideally, your <strong>soil</strong> should have a combination of large and small pore spaces. Again, organic matter is the key, because it encourages the formation of aggregate, or crumbs, or <strong>soil</strong>. Organic matter also absorbs water and retains it until it is needed by plant roots. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Incorporating large amounts of organic matter into your <strong>soil</strong> can cause a temporary loss in nitrogen. As the material decomposes, it draws nitrogen from the <strong>soil</strong> to support the process. Once decomposition is complete, nitrogen is released back to the <strong>soil</strong> and is available for plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To start, cover your gardening area with “brown materials” such as shredded dry leaves, shredded newspaper and <strong>peat</strong> moss. Then add a layer of “green materials” such as food scraps, garden trimmings and grass clippings on top. The brown materials layer should be about twice as thick as the green. Then re<strong>peat</strong> the process, continuing to layer until your overall pile is about two feet tall. Once the layers have decomposed to create uniform, compost-like material you can plant in it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Clay textures can improve, but it takes time and sweat. The best thing you can add to a clay <strong>soil</strong> is organic matter. Compost is the best general-purpose <strong>soil</strong> amendment, but there are specific <strong>soil</strong> conditions where other organic materials would be beneficial. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To work out what kind of <strong>soil</strong> you have you need to perform a <strong>soil</strong> test. It’s incredibly complicated and difficult to do, requires much training and effort, and is not for the faint-hearted. Are you game? Okay then, here’s what you have to do: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=4><li>Peat moss is also a sterile planting medium, which means that it does not contain harmful pathogens or weed seeds.

Or skip ahead to learn about eighteen different <strong>soil</strong> ingredients and their uses. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Peat moss is a great seed starting medium. It is sterile, absorbent, and the homogeneous material is easy to work with. This keeps the seed bed uniformly moist, aiding in germination. Most seed starting mixes contain <strong>peat</strong> moss, and you can make your own seed starting mix by mixing <strong>peat</strong> moss with other <strong>soil</strong>s or by making a <strong>peat</strong> moss based potting <strong>soil</strong> and adding fertilizer and vermiculite. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>fertilizing or feeding the <strong>soil</strong> is a waste of time unless it can hold on to the nutrients. Fibers absorb them and then release them slowly to the roots of your plants. Peat moss holds on to water; again because it is fibrous organic matter, it soaks with water and then releases it slowly. In fact, it can hold as much as 20 times of its weight in water. This quality, as well as its ability to retain nutrients, is helpful if your <strong>soil</strong> is sandy, which means that it does not hold on to moisture and nutrients. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The quickest way to have a general idea of your <strong>soil</strong> type is to grab a small handful and make sure it’s damp (not soaking wet) take a pinch and rub it between your fingers. If it feels slimy and slippery, it has a high clay content. If it’s gritty, it’ll have more sand. Silt feels smooth like wet talcum powder. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Finally, <strong>peat</strong> has a low bulk density and is easy compressible. This makes it very fuel efficient for transporting over long distances. This helps to both keep prices down for growers, and to reduce its impact on climate change. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I won’t lie – sandy <strong>soil</strong>s do need a lot of organic matter, frequently applied, to make a difference. The warmer your climate, the faster organic matter will break down, and the more often your <strong>soil</strong> will need replenishing. Start with at least two bucketfuls of organic matter per square yard each fall, added to the <strong>soil</strong> surface as a mulch where it will help to protect the <strong>soil</strong> from scouring rain and winds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Improving your <strong>soil</strong> takes several seasons. But even with the best will in the world, it will always be sandy <strong>soil</strong> at heart. ‘Work with what you’ve got’ is good advice!

Read on to learn eleven different methods to get you started! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Soak the moss in a large bin or tub of water for 24 hours. Peat is difficult to saturate, especially in the <strong>soil</strong>. Soaking it first helps it incorporate into the <strong>soil</strong> instead of creating dry patches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Lack of pore space means that clay <strong>soil</strong>s are generally low in both organic matter and microbial activity. Plant roots are stunted because it is too hard for them to push their way through the <strong>soil</strong>. Foot traffic and garden equipment can cause compaction problems. Fortunately, most clay <strong>soil</strong>s are rich in minerals which will become available to your plants once you improve the texture of the <strong>soil</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Green manures can also be planted on a new garden area the year before you plan to use it. They will choke out weeds and add a wealth of organic matter. Legumes, including field peas, soybeans, and alfalfa, will contribute both nitrogen and organic matter to the <strong>soil</strong>. Fast-growing grains and buckwheat produce the most organic matter and will smother competing weeds as they grow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=3><li>Not only is <strong>peat</strong> moss absorbent, it also does not compact, unlike other organic materials. Soil compaction is damaging to gardens and reduces water absorption and plant growth. Peat moss remains springy when it is wet and rehydrates easily, plus one application of <strong>peat</strong> moss can last for years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Your local Cooperative Extension Service office may offer a professional <strong>soil</strong> testing service. The advantage is low cost and results that are specifically geared to your location. If this service is not available, you can also have your <strong>soil</strong> tested by an independent <strong>soil</strong> lab. If possible, choose one in your own region of the country. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gardeners coping with sandy <strong>soil</strong> daydream about sticky clay! Light, free-draining, quick to warm up in spring&mldr;sounds like horticultural heaven, doesn’t it? But those of us who have actually had to work with sandy <strong>soil</strong> know better. Sand undoubtedly has its plus points, but it has its challenges, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Other amendments like <strong>peat</strong> can loosen <strong>soil</strong> and hold moisture. Many of the <strong>soil</strong> mixtures you can buy have a heavy amount of <strong>peat</strong>. I tend to add a bit of sand those bags. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Every <strong>soil</strong> has a different combination of these five basic components. By balancing them you can dramatically improve your <strong>soil</strong>&rsquo;s healthy and your garden&rsquo;s productivity. But first, you need to know what kind of <strong>soil</strong> you have. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For example, if your lawn and garden space is 35’ x 25’, you need to amend 875sq’. Each large bale of <strong>peat</strong> moss contains 3.8 cubic feet of material, which is enough to cover 90sq’ at a 1” depth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Don’t confuse <strong>peat</strong> moss (also sphagnum <strong>peat</strong> moss) with sphagnum moss. They come from the same plants, any of the Sphagnopsida class but they are not the exact same thing. Peat moss is what ends up under the water of these plants, while sphagnum moss is collected from the still living floating parts of the plant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=http://www.mysunnylawn.com/0/187172-4.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="How Much Peat Moss To Add To Sandy Soil - How Much Peat Moss To Add To Soil For Lawn">
