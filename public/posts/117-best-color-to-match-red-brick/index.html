Can you help”? - Source: Internet Brick houses have a long history in the United States. What is believed to be the oldest standing brick abode today is located in Massachusetts and dates back to 1680, which speaks to the enduring quality of this building material. Bricks were made by hand until the Industrial Revolution, when they became easier and cheaper to produce, leading to an increase in brick homes.

The choice is yours, after all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re keeping your <strong>red</strong> <strong>brick</strong> au natural, greige trim can give it a polished look. It’s one of the best <strong>brick</strong> and paint color combos in our book. In fact, many <strong>brick</strong>s naturally have specks of gray and beige stone in them, and mortar often appears greige from a distance. Painting your trim in Sandy Hook Gray by Benjamin Moore will pull out these tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the timeless and classic paint colors that will never go out of style with your <strong>red</strong> <strong>brick</strong> house is Sherwin Williams Iron Ore.

You can’t simply pair any random color swatch with your <strong>red</strong> <strong>brick</strong>. Hence, it’s ideal to pick a color from the <strong>brick</strong> itself to complement it and not work against it! (There’s a long list and I will be revealing that later) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Please Note – Any color <strong>brick</strong> is quite likely to be muted, subdued, and subtle.

Unfortunately, choosing the right paint color to pair with your exposed <strong>brick</strong> can be challenging. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Again, if you go with grey, play with contrasts to create depth.

What I love about a modern home design is the use of glass and black. You don’t see many traditional homes with black trim or glass walls, but with a modern design, it’s not uncommon to find both.

In our opinion, it’s one of the greatest <strong>brick</strong> and paint color combinations.

Benjamin Moore’s Sandy Hook Gray will bring out these tones in your trim. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Black And/Or White: You really can’t go wrong with these two colors.

But we hope these pics do help just a little. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Brick is a natural material with a mix of colors, so it generally has an undertone in the warm or cool spectrum. Find out what tones are in your <strong>brick</strong> before you head for the paint store. Or better yet bring a <strong>brick</strong> sample with you. Red <strong>brick</strong> that’s on the warm, orange side looks great next to a cool arctic white with a hint of blue or barely a touch of gray.

It’s the same trio as number 8 above, but it obviously looks way different when combined with bare <strong>brick</strong>. Revere Pewter, Iron Mountain, and Onyx are three neutrals that work well together. These paint colors help define a home’s architectural features without feeling too busy, even with a high-contrast <strong>red</strong> <strong>brick</strong> and light mortar base. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you don’t like the vibe of black paint color for your house with <strong>red</strong> <strong>brick</strong>, this charcoal gray must be next in line!

It’s all in how colors are used together that defines just how great your design can be. Combine textures and colors effectively, choose a color scheme that works well with the <strong>brick</strong>, and make sure the <strong>brick</strong> can stand out. Try to use general principles of design as a guide rather than a list of steadfast rules that you have to follow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once you know what kind of look you&rsquo;re going for and the areas you&rsquo;d like to paint, consider color theory. If you&rsquo;re working with <strong>red</strong> or orange <strong>brick</strong>, choose similar shades for an analogous or monochromatic color scheme. Or go for complementary shades of blue and green, which Mary Beth Wagner of Mary Beth Wagner Interiors recommends. &ldquo;However, slate grey would be my first choice to accent the <strong>brick</strong>!&rdquo; she shares. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple/Red - Purple-toned shades of <strong>red</strong> tend to be darker. Therefore, gray or tan walls work well with this color and beige is a really beautiful wall color with purple/<strong>red</strong> <strong>brick</strong>. Lean toward the lighter shades to avoid making the room feel dark. Finish the room with items that are light gray, various yellows and greens, beige, or rich brown. Also, try to avoid using blue or purple, especially in large amounts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Red <strong>brick</strong> is a growing trend in the kitchen most notably as a backsplash. The most popular cabinets paint used these days are white, gray or cream and <strong>brick</strong> just so happens to go beautifully with all of them. Kitchen design is leaning more modern and <strong>red</strong> <strong>brick</strong> adds a nice contrast to all that cold gray and white. Modern kitchens tend to be cold and <strong>red</strong> <strong>brick</strong> warms them right back up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The home’s facade is brought together by this warm, earthy <strong>brick</strong> and paint color mix. Instead of being a point of contrast, these paint hues work well together. On the <strong>brick</strong>, Olympic Mountains take center stage, Sandy Hook Gray adorns the soffits and fascia, and Simply White highlights the trim. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Above we see the <strong>red</strong> <strong>brick</strong> as the rooms mid tone. The white paint is naturally the light tone. The dark comes from accents like the black desk top, hinges, knobs, outlet plate and clock frame. Notice that each element stands out because of how the tones are varied. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This warm, earthy <strong>brick</strong> and paint color combination brings a sense of harmony to the home’s facade. Rather than serving as a point of contrast, these paint colors complement one another. Olympic Mountains takes center stage on the <strong>brick</strong>, Sandy Hook Gray adorns the soffits and fascia, and Simply White completes the look by highlighting the trim. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Think of your <strong>brick</strong> exterior as a neutral foundation onto which you can layer almost any color. Go traditional with white, black, or dark blues and greens. Be bold with orange or turquoise. Or paint your entire <strong>brick</strong> facade to create a whole new look. No matter which route you choose, keep in mind your home&rsquo;s architectural style, the surrounding environment, and the look you&rsquo;d like to create. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Limewash or pale <strong>brick</strong> isn’t for everyone. Alabaster is an excellent alternative to modernize your <strong>brick</strong> with a new white. It complements natural wood thanks to its warm beige undertones. This combination, together with the black-trim Marvin windows, drastically transforms the appearance of this property. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://talore-diamonds.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pear-vivid-green-234-2048x1721.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Best Color To Match Red Brick - best siding color to match red brick">
