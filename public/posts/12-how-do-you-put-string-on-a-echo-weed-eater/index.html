We use the machines on ordinary suburban lawn grasses such as blue grass, perennial ryegrass, and fescues in a variety of suburban and rural locations. However, our most severe testing occurred along the sloping bank of a sand floor drainage basin in southern New Jersey, where we used the trimmers to cut down knee-deep weeds and wild flowers. We also did considerable edging where sidewalks meet lawns. - Source: Internet When it comes to keeping a lawn neat and tidy, the string trimmer shines as a multi-purpose workhorse. Depending on the application, one could use it to mow down hard-to-access areas, trim up grass and weeds that a mower can’t quite reach, clear out thicker brush, and edge out lines for a cleaner-looking yard. So, what size string trimmer line should you use for trimming grass? - Source: Internet First, check your string supply Twist off the head of your lawn trimmer to check how much string you have. You may want to replace it if there is very little left. If you have quite a lot of string left, you may still want to take it out and restring it if it has come loose or been damaged. - Source: Internet One note for the cordless string trimmer users: thicker strings will have an effect on your power and runtime. As the thickness of the line jumps up, more wind resistance affects the cutting head, slowing down the speed at which the engine can rotate the cutting head. Higher voltage and beefier cordless trimmers (see: the EGO Power Head String Trimmer) will probably be able to manage thicker gauge string trimmer line more efficiently, but lower voltage models might struggle with a thicker line. Generally, it’s best to refer to the manufacturer’s recommendation for string size. - Source: Internet Learning how to string a Echo weed eater can be challenging if you’ve never attempted it before.

However, the Echo SRM-230 trimmer head features an easier design that does not require removing the the spool from the trimmer head. This design is both convenient and a time saver for residential and commercial operators alike. - Source: Internet Some line comes in a square or star shape. The edges of these string trimmer lines are sharper than rounded trimmer line, and cut through the grass rather than tear at it. Serrated line is also an option when it comes to a sharper trimmer line. It has teeth, similar to a kitchen knife, and “saws” through heavier grass and weeds with relative ease. - Source: Internet Generally speaking, a string trimmer uses a monofilament line to cut through grass, weeds…whatever. By spinning that line at a high speed, the cutting head generates enough centrifugal force to hold the line out at a stiff, horizontal angle. This lets it cut through most grasses quite easily. - Source: Internet Choose the right replacement string You can buy a string that aligns with the type of gardening you are doing. If you are cutting grass and weeds, you do not need anything more than basic weed eater string. If you are cutting tall grass or want to use your weed eater as a substitute for a lawnmower, you should buy a heavier string that will not break in extreme conditions. - Source: Internet So, what type of string trimmer line size should you use? The easiest answer: probably the heaviest and sharpest gauge that my trimmer can effectively turn without losing power to wind resistance. Assuming your string trimmer has the power, you won’t lose much cutting efficiency by using a heavier line.
