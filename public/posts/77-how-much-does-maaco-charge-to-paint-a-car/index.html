Posted: July 27th, 2015 06:07PM Anyone who thinks that throwing the <strong>paint</strong> in a gun and just <strong>paint</strong> it for a few hundred bucks than they need to go to a franchise like Maaco. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before <strong>paint</strong>ing, the surface of the vehicle should be cleaned, sanded and primed. Professional auto <strong>paint</strong>ing is typically done in a well-lit (and sometimes climate-controlled) <strong>paint</strong> booth, to minimize dust and debris that might mar the <strong>paint</strong> finish. Precision Restorations in Saint Louis, MO, provides a video demonstration of auto <strong>paint</strong>ing techniques[2] in a <strong>paint</strong> booth inside an auto body repair shop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>How much to <strong>paint</strong> Amount: $0.00 Posted by: Ryan22 in Virginia beach, VA.

I&rsquo;ve sent rough old trucks there just to keep them one color and cover up the wear some for preservation purposes only. It&rsquo;s pretty much a scuff and shoot job. They mask only the major points, over spray everywhere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Warranties can vary from six months to a year on low-cost <strong>paint</strong> jobs with basic <strong>paint</strong>, to five years or a lifetime warranty for custom <strong>paint</strong> jobs with high-end materials. The warranty terms will vary depending on the shop and the materials used; always ask what is covered. Discounts: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The bottom line is that you get what you pay for, nothing more. Go look at some of their work at the location you are considering, some are better than others. I certainly wouln&rsquo;t consider a color change with the $300 job, I tried that before, ended up with shades of the old color showing through the white <strong>paint</strong> in about a month or so. (I had hung a red front clip on a white work truck and sent it over to make it all one color for relettering, I ended up reshooting it myself the following winter. I would have been better off just <strong>paint</strong>ing the front clip with spray cans, it would have been less work in the end). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Paint job and body work for a 1951 chevy pickup Amount: $0.00 Posted by: Diego Rodriguez in Grand prairie, TX.

Was this post helpful to you? yes no Report prohibited or spam - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are a lot of reasons why you might be wondering how much it costs to <strong>paint</strong> a car. From normal aging to mystery scratches, over time the glossy finish of our car can fade along with the car&rsquo;s value. While we may never know exactly how all the scratches got on our car, we can know how much it costs to get a new <strong>paint</strong> job. We’ve done the research and have all the information you need to get a good idea of how much it costs to <strong>paint</strong> a car. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The cost of a standard <strong>paint</strong> job usually includes sanding the body and removing rust before <strong>paint</strong>ing to get an attractive finish. Standard costs range from $1,000 to $4,500. Showroom quality: This process involves sanding the bodywork down to the bare metal, removing all the rust and dents and then applying up to 24 coats of high-quality <strong>paint</strong>. The project may take up to a month, and the showroom-quality costs can run anywhere from $5,000 to as high as $20,000 in some cases. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Also, there are many types of finishes for automotive <strong>paint</strong>ing, e.g., enamels, urethane, and basecoat/clearcoat finishes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once you’ve gotten your new car <strong>paint</strong> job, it’s important to take good care of it in order for it to last a long time. One very simple way to care for your car is to take it to the car wash. Car washes are inexpensive, and when performed regularly, can add to the longevity of your car’s shine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the main things you need to consider is where you’ll <strong>paint</strong> the truck. Because you don’t have a climate-controlled booth, you need to evaluate your location’s dirt and dust content. The best place you could <strong>paint</strong> is in a very well-ventilated, clean garage. If you haven&rsquo;t got access to that, many people are able to use DEET and Citronella as bug repellants and apply Durabak in their front yard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I have yet to be able to collect on 100% of my time spent on doing a full <strong>paint</strong> job to a customer&rsquo;s car. I just can&rsquo;t justify charging a customer 1500 hours at 35 to $50 an hour. You can say that I do a lot of Charity work for the jobs I sometimes do. To the <strong>paint</strong>ers out there &ldquo;Charge what your worth but be worth what you charge.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While this may only cost you in the tens of dollars as opposed to hundreds for a typical DIY job or even thousands for a professional job, the finished look will reflect the price. Spray <strong>paint</strong> from a can will not last as long as other types of <strong>paint</strong>, often fading in uneven patches. Applying spray <strong>paint</strong> evenly on the body of your car from a normal spray <strong>paint</strong> can be very difficult. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><strong>paint</strong> job Amount: $1,000.00 Posted by: habi mogh in warren, NJ.

A budget <strong>paint</strong> job can usually be done fairly quickly. Maaco, the previously mentioned national chain, lists their timing as 2-3 business days, but many customers report getting their car even sooner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Changing the car’s color, e.g., from red to white, costs more than re<strong>paint</strong>ing with the same color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For older vehicles, the cost of a professional <strong>paint</strong> job may be excessive. In these cases, you may wish to try <strong>paint</strong>ing the vehicle yourself. The necessary materials are widely available from hardware and automotive stores for as little as $200.

However, the expense may be a wise investment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While it’s possible to <strong>paint</strong> your own vehicle, it involves patience, skill and a range of <strong>paint</strong>s and tools you may need to purchase specifically for the job. The result of your own <strong>paint</strong> job may not provide the high-quality vehicle facelift you are looking for. Do-it-yourself <strong>paint</strong> jobs are best suited for older vehicles or all-terrain vehicles that frequently pick up knocks and scratches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Additionally, the shop will typically not remove any trim pieces before <strong>paint</strong>ing, which may leave drastic edges from being taped off. Also, the shop will rarely <strong>paint</strong> the inside of the door jams or under the hood. This type of <strong>paint</strong> job can be affordable in a pinch, but for long-lasting and high-quality results, it’s best to pay more now rather than even more later. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you drive an old truck, it might not make sense to have a professional <strong>paint</strong> it.
