For example, whenever a <strong>green</strong> is mixed with a red, these two colors mixed make <strong>green</strong> a lesser shade of <strong>green</strong>. The opposite is also true, in regards to the color red and <strong>green</strong> make. When you have red and <strong>green</strong> mixed together, the red will be a lesser shade of red. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Just as white paint can mute your color choice, too much black will drown out the various elements in your perfect <strong>green</strong>.

The mellow hue perfectly combines the lively lime color as opposites attract. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue paint and yellow paint will instantly result in a shade of <strong>green</strong>. However, the kind of blue and yellow you choose will also depict what kind of <strong>green</strong> shade you get.

Another light <strong>green</strong> paint color from Benjamin Moore is the soft gray which projects a friendly and cozy appearance. The gray and greige undertones make it a perfect wall color that pairs perfectly with neutrals and earthy tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With its vibrant appearance, lime <strong>green</strong> pops next to black and works well with white.

The soft <strong>green</strong> makes it a great color for almost any room and also combines with stronger grays and blacks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In addition, pthalo <strong>green</strong> will darken your <strong>green</strong> quickly.
