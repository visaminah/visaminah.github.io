As for other things that need to be looked up, they are about what color shoes match with dark blue dress and have something to do with What Color to Wear with Navy Blue. 107 Tips for What Colors Match With Dark Blue Clothes | what colours go with navy blue clothes Though the Gentleman’s Gazette focuses on classic style, we’d be remiss not to mention the most popular article of casual clothing and probably the most popular blue fabric worn throughout the world–denim. We don’t specifically think of wearing gray with denim, but maybe we should take this page out of the classic menswear book and apply it to casual wear too. Blue jeans can easily be paired with a gray sports coat, provided the jeans are not overly distressed and the jacket casual enough, like something in an unstructured cotton or with sufficient texture. - Source: Internet One color combination we haven’t talked about yet is purple and black, which can also make a striking combination. Black works well with dark colors of purple since it can make these dark shades pop. This can make dark purple colors look more intense than they normally would against other color shades. - Source: Internet Short nails are a way to keep things simple. They can also be a way to feature strong or sparkly colors such as gold bridesmaid nails, or even black bridesmaid nails. You could balance bold or sparkly colors with short and simple nails. Short nails can be in any shape, square or oval. - Source: Internet Light purple clothes go with many different colors, depending on your mood. White, beige, and gray neutrals are all good color options as long as they have similar undertones to the purple you are wearing. For a pop of color, pair your light purple clothing with light yellow, light blue, or dark purple options. - Source: Internet A light gray shirt works well with navy blue pants as it creates a simple outfit that is elegant. This is a great color for going with any color of pants. You can wear navy blue or black pants with a grey shirt without it looking awkward or out of place. - Source: Internet You get blue when you combine yellow and green. Blue, yellow, and green are a combination of their respective bloodlines. Therefore, yellow as well as green can look good together with blue. - Source: Internet This is a great option if you want to keep your outfit casual and unique. The dark green shirt is a very bold, bright color but it doesn’t stand out too much. So it combines the best of both worlds when it comes to outfit colors! - Source: Internet Like all dark colors, navy blue is the perfect backdrop for making bright bold hues really pop. A sunny mustard yellow stands out so vividly against navy blue walls even just a splash of it becomes the focal point in a room. It’s also a lovely shade for warming up a navy blue color scheme as this steely blue living room demonstrates – the dark walls and cool grey sofa need that accent of something warmer to make this space feel more inviting. - Source: Internet Black does not always work well with light purple colors, however. It can sometimes make light purple colors look washed out or make them appear gray. Use caution when pairing such light and dark shades together, and consider adding an element of white to the look to help keep the light purple from looking dull. - Source: Internet Midnight blue, navy blue, and dark blue are examples of dark blue. Midnight blue is the deepest followed by navy blue. It would be easy to mistake one for the other. But with enough exposure, you will develop the eye to tell one from the other. - Source: Internet Your choice of color depends on a number of factors, but one of them is your skin tone. Warm skin tones should avoid blue and similar cool colors. If you have a cool skin tone, go ahead and wear blue. - Source: Internet The color blue can mean tranquility or seriousness and a bunch of other things in between. Blue is, on the one hand, a calming color. It provides you with a feeling of well-being. On the other hand, the color blue can represent something traditional and serious. In clothing, blue can have a wide range of meanings – especially in shades or tints. - Source: Internet The blue hue is associated with calm, intelligence, sincerity, and confidence. Blue is the color of the sky and ocean in nature. These create a sense of calm and security. - Source: Internet Now let’s look at the dark versions of the color blue. Technically, these are shades of blue. To make them, simply add any amount of black to the blue hue, that is, the blue base. - Source: Internet Beyond avoiding sharp contrast, try adding complexity and interest to your blue and gray combinations by introducing textures and patterns. Sure, you can start simply with a white shirt, solid tie, and a plain worsted wool suit, but this gets boring fast. An easy way to add a pattern while remaining classic is to use a gray glen check tie in silk (or wool for winter) with a navy suit. For a gray suit, get a navy grenadine tie in either a large or fine weave (garza grossa or garza fina) to inject texture. In the reverse scenario, pick up a silver grenadine for a blue suit. - Source: Internet Purple is made up of red and blue and therefore comes in many different shades with both warm and cool undertones. Your best chance of matching purple clothing is to choose colors that share the same undertones as the purple you have. Stick to warm colors with red-toned purples, and use cool colors with blue-toned purples. - Source: Internet A purple shirt might be unconventional for some, but wait until you try it with navy blue jeans. A purple shirt and navy blue trousers are a fun look to add to your everyday range of styling. Round off this look with a pair of dark brown leather tassel loafers. - Source: Internet Some people prefer darker colors such as black or burgundy bridesmaid nails and these are great too. Dark shades such as navy blue, dark green, or even dark purple are neutral choices that won’t steal the spotlight from the bride or the couple. Darker nail colors are great with a matte coat and look even better in shellac or gel nails with less chance of chipping. - Source: Internet As with light purple, dark purple clothes often go well with neutral colors like white or gray. Beige can be a bit trickier with dark purple but can work if you pair it with a warm-toned purple that has reddish hues. You’ll also want to avoid browns, oranges, and certain shades of red and green with dark purple. - Source: Internet Complementary colors are opposites on the color wheel. Because of their strong presence, they may appear clashing if used equally; Hence, one of the colors should be used as a small part of the entire scheme. As a small print or accessory, you can take one of the color combinations provided above, like aqua and purple, and use it on a smaller scale in your dressing. - Source: Internet Purple and white are a natural pair when it comes to planning outfits. If you’re looking for an even split between the two colors, try pairing white pants or skirts with a purple blouse. You can also do the opposite and pair purple bottoms with a white top to keep a similar divided look. - Source: Internet We’re well-documented fans of designing in a blue color scheme. As much as we’re partial to a bold pop of purple or a wash of muted green, there’s something about the color blue that just has astounding versatility. And if we were to play favorites, we’d have to say that navy blue—one of the most iconic shades ever—is the epitome of everything we love about this part of the color wheel. - Source: Internet The opposite move–a gray sports coat with navy trousers–is rarer, maybe because it is generally more difficult to pull off a lighter jacket with darker pants. However, there’s no reason to be dissuaded, as long as your blue pants don’t look like the bottom half of a suit. Here, a pattern can be your friend and using a gray sports coat that contains a pattern, again the classic glen check or Prince of Wales, will enhance your chances of success. - Source: Internet When choosing lipstick colors to pair with your navy blue dress, the key thing to remember is that navy blue is considered a cool color. Thus, it pairs best with lipstick colors that have a cool, pinkish undertone. It’s best to avoid any lipsticks with a noticeable orange tone – leave these on your vanity for another time. - Source: Internet A. Certainly, you can wear leather trucker jackets with blue jeans. This classic symbol of American heritage is really cool to wear. However, a denim trucker with jeans will look awkward, so avoid it. - Source: Internet The easiest way to coordinate blue and gray is to match the two in a suit and tie combination. It’s commonly said that when a man first ventures into the world of tailored clothing–or into the working world that demands such a dress code–he should begin with a navy blue suit. Using a gray tie with this navy suit is a surefire way to earn style points. - Source: Internet Purple and brown clothing combinations are one of the few that rarely seem to work. This is mostly because it is difficult to find tones of purple and brown that work well with each other. Brown tends to be much more warm-toned than most purples are, given that purple has strong influences of blue within it. - Source: Internet A. Blue is considered a basic color in jeans. Therefore you can pair anything with it, from casual tees to a crisp white shirt. A mandarin collar shirt will also look stunning with blue jeans if you have a broad neck and wide shoulders. You can even try several colors and styles ranging from white, black, and brown to sneakers and leather boots in shoes. - Source: Internet Accessories, including gloves, hats, and scarves, are another great way to use these two colors, and, again, you have two broad options. If you have a gray coat on, you could go monochromatic and select elegant gray cashmere-lined peccary gloves to match tones. Alternatively, go with a contrast and choose a pair of bold petrol blue leather gloves in lamb nappa leather. With a scarf, you may be able to “kill two birds with one stone” by purchasing a double-sided version, like this dark blue and gray one in alpaca from Fort Belvedere, which lets you contrast or blend with a flip of the cloth. - Source: Internet You’ll also want to pay attention to the undertones of the greens and purples you mix. Pairing a warm-tone green like an olive green won’t work with a blue-toned purple like periwinkle. Stick to colors that are both cool or both warm to make good combinations. - Source: Internet Yellow has an interesting relationship with blue. Yoy may have seen it with specific shades of yellow, mostly mustard and butter yellows, paired with deeper blue or cerulean blues. Also, you can add whites or more blue to the outfit. - Source: Internet Picture whitecaps breaking atop dark blue waves, and you’ll immediately realize why whites go so well with navy blue. White is a classic high-contrast partner that sets off the deep hue and gives navy a lively lift. Juxtapose navy blue furniture, decor, or cabinetry with a backdrop of crisp white walls for an energizing effect. Alternatively, you can balance dark, inky blue walls with white furniture, fabrics, and breezy sheer curtain panels. In addition to cool snow-white, off-whites and creams also make fine partners for navy blue. - Source: Internet Try a touch of metallic or shimmer. I absolutely love the way metallic shades catch the light – it adds intrigue. If you are anything like me, where your work outfit consists of dark colors or a monotone palette, a little metallic nail polish will add a feminine touch to your structured look. - Source: Internet We couldn’t not have a crisp white right up there as one of the best colors to pair with navy. It’s the oldest, most tried combination and we will never tire of it. Classic, clean, and crisp it’s a mix that lends itself to any room and any style, but it works particularly well in kitchens for a look that’s bold and yet timeless. Consider opting for a two-tone look, mixing dark navy cabinets with a true white island. - Source: Internet The color combination was one of the most popular ones. Apparently limey pastely green is very popular with blue, as well as mint green. Together, they look so beautiful and you can always balance them out with white or grey. - Source: Internet Lilac and lavender have been gaining quite a bit of traction recently, with trend forecasters predicted it’s likely to be the color of the year 2023. It’s a very calming hue, that much like pink does need something darker to ground it and give it a less saccharine quality. Hence why it works so well with navy blue. It has the same cool undertones but adds a softness to the darker shade and you can find lilac shades that are so subtle, they almost just act like a neutral. - Source: Internet The color wheel can be a helpful tool for determining what colors go with navy blue. For a complementary color scheme, look to blue’s opposite on the wheel: orange. The fiery hue introduces warmth that balances the cool depth of navy blue. Establish a bold, colorful look with a medium-tone shade of orange, such as tangerine or papaya, that will stand up well against its dark counterpart. Lighter shades like coral or cantaloupe make beautiful accent colors in coastal-style rooms. - Source: Internet Cool colors are green, blue and violet. On the color wheel, these colors are next to each other. Together, they create a calming effect. - Source: Internet Both being jewel-like tones, navy blue and deep rich purples are a sumptuous combination that would be perfect if you want to create a cozy but sophisticated living room or bedroom. Experiment with a deep aubergine on the walls and combine it with a statement piece of navy blue velvet furniture for a pairing that’s moody and dramatic but also so elegant and timeless. Add in some golden accents for extra glamour. - Source: Internet This all-American pairing is a classic color scheme for interiors. Combine red and white with navy blue to decorate patriotic country-style spaces and playful nautical-inspired kids’ rooms. Vibrant cherry red or scarlet accents can also provide striking contrast against navy blue in modern or eclectic designs. This look works well for busy areas like kitchens, entryways, and living rooms. Pairing navy blue with more muted shades of red, such as salmon, rich burgundy, or brick red, can help set a sophisticated tone that’s ideal for formal dining rooms. - Source: Internet A. The light blue jeans emphasize the more casual look, so they are perfect if you are wearing them for outdoor activities and hang out with friends. The dark-colored jeans comparatively look semi-formal, so it’s better to wear them to an event where you don’t want to look formal or casual either. - Source: Internet You should not be afraid of matching it the wrong way, because it is rather flexible. But still, be careful. We cannot insist on what color goes with navy blue is the best. - Source: Internet Don’t be afraid to try prints. An everyday blue denim pant perfectly complements prints such as stripes and checks dress shirts. Wear different colors that match or contrast the dark blue tone of the jeans, and finish the look with dark brown loafers or slip-ons. - Source: Internet Navy blue and blush pink are the classic hues to choose for the most sophisticated, grown-up look. The shades just work so well to balance each other out. The muted warm rosy tones of blush pink counteract any of the cooler tones of the deep blue and the navy prevents the pink from looking too sweet and sickly. - Source: Internet Should bridesmaids get nails done? Bridesmaids should get their nails done. While there is no standard rule about this, it is recommended for the bridal party to get their nails done a few days before the wedding. Do my nails have to match my bridesmaid dress? It is not compulsory for your nails to match your bridesmaid dress. In fact, it is often better to find a complementing color. Think color block and choose for instance a red or coral polish to go with a dark blue dress. - Source: Internet The blue hue is the color blue in its fully-blown saturated state. Compared to the other versions, it’s ‘colorful’ or vivid in this state. The blue hue belongs to the cold/cool half of the color wheel. Thus, it’s a cold color. - Source: Internet To create peaceful spaces, look outside for calming colors and earthen textures that complement navy blue. Nature-inspired elements such as rich wood furniture, straw-hued wicker and rattan accents, leather upholstery, warm neutral paint colors, and concrete-gray accents partner perfectly with navy blue hues. Pick neutral accessories and materials that are lighter or much darker than a room’s navy blue finishes and furniture to emphasize color differences and lend distinction to each element. No matter which colors you pair with navy, use contrast to avoid a muddied-up palette and supply resting places for the eye. - Source: Internet The combination of a light blue dress shirt and navy dress pants is a great choice when you need to look stylish yet exceptionally smart. And for business wear, it’s a classic pairing. To add style, partner this combination with a pair of black leather loafers. - Source: Internet Create a dynamic color scheme by pairing navy blue with a much lighter, brighter color. Shades of yellow, including soft butter yellow and rich mustard yellow, offer warmth and brilliance that stands out vividly against the cool, deep tones of navy blue. Use this color combination for an energizing effect in living spaces or bedrooms. Choose fabrics and materials with subtle differences in patterns and textures to layer in extra interest within a navy blue and yellow color scheme. - Source: Internet Of course, we had to include a classic nude lipstick on this list. It’s one of the best choices to wear with any outfit, and navy blue is no different. Opt for a nude shade with a slight tinge of pink to complement the blue tones of the dress. - Source: Internet In the case of purple, the colors on its immediate sides are blues and reds. Both blue and red are accent colors to purple and often pair well with the color. Looking across from purple, its direct opposite shade is yellow, which contrasts well. - Source: Internet Pants are a staple in a man’s closet, undoubtedly since they are available in different colors and can be worn on different occasions. But if being unconventional isn’t your jam and you’d rather stick to traditional colors, you could end up having just black or navy blue pants. So, for you to still create a fashion statement with navy blue pants and tops, you must know what shirt color goes with it. - Source: Internet Choose a color that contrasts with the navy blue shade of your pants. For example, if you’re wearing dark or black dress pants then a light or white colored shirt is ideal for creating an effective contrast. Make sure your shirt isn’t too flashy- otherwise it will dominate and take all the attention away from your outfit. - Source: Internet If you’re set on trying to find a combination that works, stick to earthy tones. Go for a warm-toned purple or mauve paired with a warm, medium brown color. Stick to brown colors commonly seen in leather handbags, especially those in a medium to the light color range. - Source: Internet A. With light blue jeans, wear dark color tees, flannels, hoodies, and turtlenecks. And pair light colors upper wear with dark color jeans. Usually, light grey, white, and beige color look gorgeous with dark blue jeans so consider them if you have never tried them. - Source: Internet Gray is another popular neutral shade that pairs well with certain purple colors. Gray works especially well with purple clothes that have a gray hue to them, especially lavender tones. You can also pair dark gray clothing with darker purple tones for a moody look. - Source: Internet The best pairings for green and purple are ones where the colors have similar undertones and intensity. Pastel greens can pair with pastel purples, while bright greens can pair best with bright purples. Just avoid mixing and matching the shades. - Source: Internet Dark purple also works well with bright or dark colors that contrast with it. Dark yellows often pair well with dark purple, as do bright reds. You can also pair dark purple with blue tones, drawing out the cool tones in purple. - Source: Internet Although blue and gray is usually a conservative combination, one of the boldest things you can do for your overall outfit is to wear these colors as footwear. Dark navy Oxfords are the best choice with a suit since they resemble a standard black business shoe with just a hint of added color, but they are difficult to find. Those with dandy impulses and in a less conservative environment could go with brighter blues, such as a blue wholecut Oxford or monk strap, paired with a light gray suit. - Source: Internet As you get older, your skin is more likely to be showing your bluish veins. I suggest avoiding pale or cool tones such as blues and greens or blue-based reds and plums. These will emphasize any veins that are visible. - Source: Internet Shades of purple vary widely, and some are more appropriate than others for the changing seasons. Pastel purples are popular in the spring, bright purples in summer, and earthy warm-toned purples in the fall. Winter is an excellent time for cool, blue-toned purples. - Source: Internet Socks are also a terrific option to coordinate blue and gray. As a rule, begin with the principle of matching socks to your pants, not your shoes. You can show some panache by wearing socks that contain the complementary color to your pants (for example, blue socks with gray trousers ) or, better yet, socks that contain both colors, like a light blue and light gray shadow stripe. - Source: Internet When it comes to matching colors, many designers and artists turn to the color wheel and basic color theory for choosing coordinating options. The color wheel contains all of the main colors of the rainbow, ranging from shades of red to shades of purple. By looking at the colors next to the color, you wish to match and the colors across from it, you should be able to choose colors that pair well. - Source: Internet Consequently, the color blue is the most comfortable color to work with on the color wheel. Wearing navy blue can give you a confident look. To create an original look, Egyptian blue will work amazingly well. - Source: Internet Most colors blend well with the primary colors that make them up. In the case of purple, which is made from a combination of blue and red dyes, blue is a natural pairing to make. In particular, the color blue emphasizes the cool tones of purple clothing. - Source: Internet The color wheel already tells us this is a combination that’s meant to work. Complementary colors sit opposite each other so orange was made to pair with blue, the warmth balancing out the cool of the navy. And it doesn’t have to be a dramatic high-contrasting scheme (although we do love how tangerines really zing against navy), a deep rusty orange looks beautiful against the moodier tones of a dark blue. - Source: Internet Today, I’m trying to exemplify many of the concepts we discussed. Most of my outfit elements have blue and gray in them; the largest of these would be my blue jacket and gray trousers. The jacket is a bit lighter than a standard navy, probably in something more like a medium to even a royal blue. It’s plain in color to ground the trousers which have a bit more texture in their weave. As mentioned previously, my shirt features a micro check pattern in light blue and dark gray, perhaps even almost black, but everything is working harmoniously within the color pairing. - Source: Internet Various shades of blue come together to form serene color schemes that remind us of clear blue skies over broad expanses of water. To design a successful monochromatic color combination, use a paint chip for guidance. Select your desired navy blue color first (which will likely be the darkest shade on the swatch), then incorporate lighter tints of the color throughout the space. Depending on your shade of navy, muted, dusty-blue shades or true blue hues can create attractive compositions. For a more tropical look, choose green-tinted colors, such as aqua and turquoise, to pair with navy blue. - Source: Internet There are a few colors that are universally flattering on most people, and we would say that burgundy is one of them. The rich hue makes it work with any skin tone, and the color combination of burgundy lipstick with navy blue is effortlessly chic. For a red carpet look, pair this with a sultry smokey eye makeup look. - Source: Internet A. White baggy button-down shirts and oversize t-shirts look wonderful with thin blue jeans. You can even go with an ash gray V-neck sweatshirt with a thin white tee underneath for a catchier look. - Source: Internet The most sophisticated method to combine gray and blue with a suit and tie, however, is to choose items that contain both colors together. For example, you can wear a navy suit with a gray windowpane pattern. By definition, Prince of Wales suiting fabric differs from a glen check because it contains an overcheck in an additional color, and a common version of this is a gray base pattern with the addition of a blue overcheck, giving you both in one shot. - Source: Internet One of my favorite places in the world is a nail salon! Yes, it sounds odd. But I absolutely love the array of nail polish bottles that greet you neatly lined up in a rainbow myriad. It truly takes you back to the days of opening a box of 64 crayons…However, with so many shades to choose from, it can be bewildering. This article features nail color ideas and the best nail colors to flatter your hands. - Source: Internet The second suit a man should own when starting a business wardrobe is a gray one, but here the recommendations vary between a mid-gray and a charcoal. In either case, you simply take the opposite approach as your first suit and coordinate with a blue tie. The entire range of gray presents a neutral backdrop for any mid – to navy blue tie to work. And, the fact that both blue and gray are cool colors ensures they will pair naturally. Even if your gray suit contains warmer brown tones, you’ll have no issues because blue also combines perfectly with brown. - Source: Internet Some people are afraid of wearing black with blue or navy. Blues look great with black, especially royal blue, teals, or ceruleans. Black and baby blue also have a lovely contrast. - Source: Internet A light version of blue contains both blue and white properties, making it a blend of both. For instance, white symbolizes purity, cleanliness, and openness. Lighter blues are a reflection of these properties. As a result, lighter blues become associated with peace, friendliness, approachability, youth, and loyalty. - Source: Internet Although pairing a gray tie with a blue suit and vice versa is nearly foolproof, there are some ways for you to make the most of this combination. For one thing, avoid too strong a contrast between the two colors, which is the general rule for any color coordination. So, if your suit is dark gray, avoid a really pale blue. - Source: Internet Blue on blue might sound bland, but going all over with a single color always has a surprisingly striking effect. Trying pairing navy blue furniture, whether that be a sofa or a headboard, with slightly lighter rich blue walls for a calming and cocooning look. Add some much-needed warmth with gold accents as can be seen here with the mirror and the lighting. - Source: Internet Printed silk ties with blue and gray geometric patterns or knit ties with both colors in them are likewise excellent options. I especially like the versatility of striped ties with either a repp pattern or large block stripes for this purpose. If you get a tie with stripes of both colors you can wear them easily with either gray or blue suits. - Source: Internet Orange is a scary color for a lot of people, but when done right, it can be a masterpiece. Orange and blue are a match made in heaven when worn together. When embraced, their brightness is their beauty and can be very powerful.

These colors include brown, orange, and certain shades of green and red. - Source: Internet It’s safe to say that all men should have a white shirt in their closet. The color white is so simple, yet it catches the attention of many people. The white shirt and the navy blue pants combo is ideal if you’re someone who appreciates the elegance of the monochrome.

If you begin with blue and gray, this is actually a piece of cake. Like the navy suit, the navy blazer is a staple, foundational item of menswear.

Purple is made through a combination of red and blue and can be created in various tones and intensities. This makes it a color that can be tailored to fit many different styles, skin tones, and seasons – making it a go-to choice for designers all year long. - Source: Internet You’ll want to stick to a pure white color, however.

The color blue works well as an accent piece for most men. Tie, shoes, scarf, wristwatch, and socks are among the items. - Source: Internet For formal occasions, silver or gold accessories are also good matches with a purple dress. Silver often works best with cool-toned colors and gold with warm-toned colors.

Orange sits just next to yellow on the color wheel and works particularly well with navy as the bright tones of the orange make the dark blue appear even deeper.’ says the designer and head of creative at Swyft (opens in new tab), Kelly Collins. - Source: Internet ‘When bringing navy into the home I suggest mixing it with soft natural shades, such as Farrow \u0026 Ball’s Skimming Stone, with its clay-like hue, this is the perfect natural color to make navy pop. With dusty blues set to be big in 2022, bring in on-trend touches of pale blue to harmonize the room, creating a serene and tranquil living space where navy stands proud.’ explains interior designer Juliette Thomas (opens in new tab). - Source: Internet In all these styles, you must have noticed one thing in common: the combination of brown shoes with blue jeans.

We don’t specifically think of wearing gray with denim, but maybe we should take this page out of the classic menswear book and apply it to casual wear too. Blue jeans can easily be paired with a gray sports coat, provided the jeans are not overly distressed and the jacket casual enough, like something in an unstructured cotton or with sufficient texture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One color combination we haven’t talked about yet is purple and black, which can also make a striking combination. Black works well with dark <strong>colors</strong> of purple since it can make these dark shades pop. This can make dark purple <strong>colors</strong> look more intense than they normally would against other color shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Short nails are a way to keep things simple. They can also be a way to feature strong or sparkly <strong>colors</strong> such as gold bridesmaid nails, or even black bridesmaid nails. You could balance bold or sparkly <strong>colors</strong> with short and simple nails. Short nails can be in any shape, square or oval. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Light purple clothes go with many different <strong>colors</strong>, depending on your mood. White, beige, and gray neutrals are all good color options as long as they have similar undertones to the purple you are wearing. For a pop of color, pair your light purple clothing with light yellow, light <strong>blue</strong>, or dark purple options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A light gray shirt works well with navy <strong>blue</strong> pants as it creates a simple outfit that is elegant. This is a great color for going with any color of pants. You can wear navy <strong>blue</strong> or black pants with a grey shirt without it looking awkward or out of place. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You get <strong>blue</strong> when you combine yellow and green. Blue, yellow, and green are a combination of their respective bloodlines. Therefore, yellow as well as green can look good together with <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a great option if you want to keep your outfit casual and unique. The dark green shirt is a very bold, bright color but it doesn’t stand out too much. So it combines the best of both worlds when it comes to outfit <strong>colors</strong>! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Like all dark <strong>colors</strong>, navy <strong>blue</strong> is the perfect backdrop for making bright bold hues really pop. A sunny mustard yellow stands out so vividly against navy <strong>blue</strong> walls even just a splash of it becomes the focal point in a room. It&rsquo;s also a lovely shade for warming up a navy <strong>blue</strong> color scheme as this steely <strong>blue</strong> living room demonstrates – the dark walls and cool grey sofa need that accent of something warmer to make this space feel more inviting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Black does not always work well with light purple <strong>colors</strong>, however. It can sometimes make light purple <strong>colors</strong> look washed out or make them appear gray. Use caution when pairing such light and dark shades together, and consider adding an element of white to the look to help keep the light purple from looking dull. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Midnight <strong>blue</strong>, navy <strong>blue</strong>, and dark <strong>blue</strong> are examples of dark <strong>blue</strong>. Midnight <strong>blue</strong> is the deepest followed by navy <strong>blue</strong>. It would be easy to mistake one for the other. But with enough exposure, you will develop the eye to tell one from the other. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Your choice of color depends on a number of factors, but one of them is your skin tone. Warm skin tones should avoid <strong>blue</strong> and similar cool <strong>colors</strong>. If you have a cool skin tone, go ahead and wear <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The color <strong>blue</strong> can mean tranquility or seriousness and a bunch of other things in between. Blue is, on the one hand, a calming color. It provides you with a feeling of well-being. On the other hand, the color <strong>blue</strong> can represent something traditional and serious. In clothing, <strong>blue</strong> can have a wide range of meanings – especially in shades or tints. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>blue</strong> hue is associated with calm, intelligence, sincerity, and confidence. Blue is the color of the sky and ocean in nature. These create a sense of calm and security. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now let’s look at the dark versions of the color <strong>blue</strong>. Technically, these are shades of <strong>blue</strong>. To make them, simply add any amount of black to the <strong>blue</strong> hue, that is, the <strong>blue</strong> base. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Beyond avoiding sharp contrast, try adding complexity and interest to your <strong>blue</strong> and gray combinations by introducing textures and patterns. Sure, you can start simply with a white shirt, solid tie, and a plain worsted wool suit, but this gets boring fast. An easy way to add a pattern while remaining classic is to use a gray glen check tie in silk (or wool for winter) with a navy suit. For a gray suit, get a navy grenadine tie in either a large or fine weave (garza grossa or garza fina) to inject texture. In the reverse scenario, pick up a silver grenadine for a <strong>blue</strong> suit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple is made up of red and <strong>blue</strong> and therefore comes in many different shades with both warm and cool undertones. Your best chance of matching purple clothing is to choose <strong>colors</strong> that share the same undertones as the purple you have. Stick to warm <strong>colors</strong> with red-toned purples, and use cool <strong>colors</strong> with <strong>blue</strong>-toned purples. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A purple shirt might be unconventional for some, but wait until you try it with navy <strong>blue</strong> jeans. A purple shirt and navy <strong>blue</strong> trousers are a fun look to add to your everyday range of styling. Round off this look with a pair of dark brown leather tassel loafers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some people prefer darker <strong>colors</strong> such as black or burgundy bridesmaid nails and these are great too. Dark shades such as navy <strong>blue</strong>, dark green, or even dark purple are neutral choices that won’t steal the spotlight from the bride or the couple. Darker nail <strong>colors</strong> are great with a matte coat and look even better in shellac or gel nails with less chance of chipping. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As with light purple, dark purple clothes often go well with neutral <strong>colors</strong> like white or gray. Beige can be a bit trickier with dark purple but can work if you pair it with a warm-toned purple that has reddish hues. You’ll also want to avoid browns, oranges, and certain shades of red and green with dark purple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Complementary <strong>colors</strong> are opposites on the color wheel. Because of their strong presence, they may appear clashing if used equally; Hence, one of the <strong>colors</strong> should be used as a small part of the entire scheme. As a small print or accessory, you can take one of the color combinations provided above, like aqua and purple, and use it on a smaller scale in your dressing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple and white are a natural pair when it comes to planning outfits. If you’re looking for an even split between the two <strong>colors</strong>, try pairing white pants or skirts with a purple blouse. You can also do the opposite and pair purple bottoms with a white top to keep a similar divided look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We&rsquo;re well-documented fans of designing in a <strong>blue</strong> color scheme. As much as we&rsquo;re partial to a bold pop of purple or a wash of muted green, there&rsquo;s something about the color <strong>blue</strong> that just has astounding versatility. And if we were to play favorites, we&rsquo;d have to say that navy <strong>blue</strong>—one of the most iconic shades ever—is the epitome of everything we love about this part of the color wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The opposite move–a gray sports coat with navy trousers–is rarer, maybe because it is generally more difficult to pull off a lighter jacket with darker pants. However, there’s no reason to be dissuaded, as long as your <strong>blue</strong> pants don’t look like the bottom half of a suit. Here, a pattern can be your friend and using a gray sports coat that contains a pattern, again the classic glen check or Prince of Wales, will enhance your chances of success. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When choosing lipstick <strong>colors</strong> to pair with your navy <strong>blue</strong> dress, the key thing to remember is that navy <strong>blue</strong> is considered a cool color. Thus, it pairs best with lipstick <strong>colors</strong> that have a cool, pinkish undertone. It’s best to avoid any lipsticks with a noticeable orange tone – leave these on your vanity for another time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A. Certainly, you can wear leather trucker jackets with <strong>blue</strong> jeans. This classic symbol of American heritage is really cool to wear. However, a denim trucker with jeans will look awkward, so avoid it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The easiest way to coordinate <strong>blue</strong> and gray is to match the two in a suit and tie combination. It’s commonly said that when a man first ventures into the world of tailored clothing–or into the working world that demands such a dress code–he should begin with a navy <strong>blue</strong> suit. Using a gray tie with this navy suit is a surefire way to earn style points. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple and brown clothing combinations are one of the few that rarely seem to work. This is mostly because it is difficult to find tones of purple and brown that work well with each other. Brown tends to be much more warm-toned than most purples are, given that purple has strong influences of <strong>blue</strong> within it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A. Blue is considered a basic color in jeans. Therefore you can pair anything with it, from casual tees to a crisp white shirt. A mandarin collar shirt will also look stunning with <strong>blue</strong> jeans if you have a broad neck and wide shoulders. You can even try several <strong>colors</strong> and styles ranging from white, black, and brown to sneakers and leather boots in shoes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Accessories, including gloves, hats, and scarves, are another great way to use these two <strong>colors</strong>, and, again, you have two broad options. If you have a gray coat on, you could go monochromatic and select elegant gray cashmere-lined peccary gloves to match tones. Alternatively, go with a contrast and choose a pair of bold petrol <strong>blue</strong> leather gloves in lamb nappa leather. With a scarf, you may be able to “kill two birds with one stone” by purchasing a double-sided version, like this dark <strong>blue</strong> and gray one in alpaca from Fort Belvedere, which lets you contrast or blend with a flip of the cloth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You’ll also want to pay attention to the undertones of the greens and purples you mix. Pairing a warm-tone green like an olive green won’t work with a <strong>blue</strong>-toned purple like periwinkle. Stick to <strong>colors</strong> that are both cool or both warm to make good combinations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yellow has an interesting relationship with <strong>blue</strong>. Yoy may have seen it with specific shades of yellow, mostly mustard and butter yellows, paired with deeper <strong>blue</strong> or cerulean <strong>blue</strong>s. Also, you can add whites or more <strong>blue</strong> to the outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Picture whitecaps breaking atop dark <strong>blue</strong> waves, and you&rsquo;ll immediately realize why whites go so well with navy <strong>blue</strong>. White is a classic high-contrast partner that sets off the deep hue and gives navy a lively lift. Juxtapose navy <strong>blue</strong> furniture, decor, or cabinetry with a backdrop of crisp white walls for an energizing effect. Alternatively, you can balance dark, inky <strong>blue</strong> walls with white furniture, fabrics, and breezy sheer curtain panels. In addition to cool snow-white, off-whites and creams also make fine partners for navy <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Try a touch of metallic or shimmer. I absolutely love the way metallic shades catch the light – it adds intrigue. If you are anything like me, where your work outfit consists of dark <strong>colors</strong> or a monotone palette, a little metallic nail polish will add a feminine touch to your structured look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We couldn&rsquo;t not have a crisp white right up there as one of the best <strong>colors</strong> to pair with navy. It&rsquo;s the oldest, most tried combination and we will never tire of it. Classic, clean, and crisp it&rsquo;s a mix that lends itself to any room and any style, but it works particularly well in kitchens for a look that&rsquo;s bold and yet timeless. Consider opting for a two-tone look, mixing dark navy cabinets with a true white island. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The color combination was one of the most popular ones. Apparently limey pastely green is very popular with <strong>blue</strong>, as well as mint green. Together, they look so beautiful and you can always balance them out with white or grey. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Lilac and lavender have been gaining quite a bit of traction recently, with trend forecasters predicted it&rsquo;s likely to be the color of the year 2023. It&rsquo;s a very calming hue, that much like pink does need something darker to ground it and give it a less saccharine quality. Hence why it works so well with navy <strong>blue</strong>. It has the same cool undertones but adds a softness to the darker shade and you can find lilac shades that are so subtle, they almost just act like a neutral. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The color wheel can be a helpful tool for determining what <strong>colors</strong> go with navy <strong>blue</strong>.

Bridesmaids should get their nails done. While there is no standard rule about this, it is recommended for the bridal party to get their nails done a few days before the wedding.

So, for you to still create a fashion statement with navy <strong>blue</strong> pants and tops, you must know what shirt color goes with it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Choose a color that contrasts with the navy <strong>blue</strong> shade of your pants.

Dark navy Oxfords are the best choice with a suit since they resemble a standard black business shoe with just a hint of added color, but they are difficult to find. Those with dandy impulses and in a less conservative environment could go with brighter <strong>blue</strong>s, such as a <strong>blue</strong> wholecut Oxford or monk strap, paired with a light gray suit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As you get older, your skin is more likely to be showing your bluish veins. I suggest avoiding pale or cool tones such as <strong>blue</strong>s and greens or <strong>blue</strong>-based reds and plums.

Winter is an excellent time for cool, <strong>blue</strong>-toned purples. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Socks are also a terrific option to coordinate <strong>blue</strong> and gray. As a rule, begin with the principle of matching socks to your pants, not your shoes. You can show some panache by wearing socks that contain the complementary color to your pants (for example, <strong>blue</strong> socks with gray trousers ) or, better yet, socks that contain both <strong>colors</strong>, like a light <strong>blue</strong> and light gray shadow stripe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to matching <strong>colors</strong>, many designers and artists turn to the color wheel and basic color theory for choosing coordinating options.

In particular, the color <strong>blue</strong> emphasizes the cool tones of purple clothing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The color wheel already tells us this is a combination that&rsquo;s meant to work. Complementary <strong>colors</strong> sit opposite each other so orange was made to pair with <strong>blue</strong>, the warmth balancing out the cool of the navy. And it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a dramatic high-contrasting scheme (although we do love how tangerines really zing against navy), a deep rusty orange looks beautiful against the moodier tones of a dark <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Today, I’m trying to exemplify many of the concepts we discussed. Most of my outfit elements have <strong>blue</strong> and gray in them; the largest of these would be my <strong>blue</strong> jacket and gray trousers. The jacket is a bit lighter than a standard navy, probably in something more like a medium to even a royal <strong>blue</strong>. It’s plain in color to ground the trousers which have a bit more texture in their weave. As mentioned previously, my shirt features a micro check pattern in light <strong>blue</strong> and dark gray, perhaps even almost black, but everything is working harmoniously within the color pairing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Various shades of <strong>blue</strong> come together to form serene color schemes that remind us of clear <strong>blue</strong> skies over broad expanses of water. To design a successful monochromatic color combination, use a paint chip for guidance. Select your desired navy <strong>blue</strong> color first (which will likely be the darkest shade on the swatch), then incorporate lighter tints of the color throughout the space. Depending on your shade of navy, muted, dusty-<strong>blue</strong> shades or true <strong>blue</strong> hues can create attractive compositions. For a more tropical look, choose green-tinted <strong>colors</strong>, such as aqua and turquoise, to pair with navy <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are a few <strong>colors</strong> that are universally flattering on most people, and we would say that burgundy is one of them. The rich hue makes it work with any skin tone, and the color combination of burgundy lipstick with navy <strong>blue</strong> is effortlessly chic. For a red carpet look, pair this with a sultry smokey eye makeup look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A. White baggy button-down shirts and oversize t-shirts look wonderful with thin <strong>blue</strong> jeans. You can even go with an ash gray V-neck sweatshirt with a thin white tee underneath for a catchier look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The most sophisticated method to combine gray and <strong>blue</strong> with a suit and tie, however, is to choose items that contain both <strong>colors</strong> together. For example, you can wear a navy suit with a gray windowpane pattern. By definition, Prince of Wales suiting fabric differs from a glen check because it contains an overcheck in an additional color, and a common version of this is a gray base pattern with the addition of a <strong>blue</strong> overcheck, giving you both in one shot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of my favorite places in the world is a nail salon! Yes, it sounds odd. But I absolutely love the array of nail polish bottles that greet you neatly lined up in a rainbow myriad. It truly takes you back to the days of opening a box of 64 crayons…However, with so many shades to choose from, it can be bewildering. This article features nail color ideas and the best nail <strong>colors</strong> to flatter your hands. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The second suit a man should own when starting a business wardrobe is a gray one, but here the recommendations vary between a mid-gray and a charcoal. In either case, you simply take the opposite approach as your first suit and coordinate with a <strong>blue</strong> tie. The entire range of gray presents a neutral backdrop for any mid – to navy <strong>blue</strong> tie to work. And, the fact that both <strong>blue</strong> and gray are cool <strong>colors</strong> ensures they will pair naturally. Even if your gray suit contains warmer brown tones, you’ll have no issues because <strong>blue</strong> also combines perfectly with brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some people are afraid of wearing black with <strong>blue</strong> or navy. Blues look great with black, especially royal <strong>blue</strong>, teals, or ceruleans. Black and baby <strong>blue</strong> also have a lovely contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A light version of <strong>blue</strong> contains both <strong>blue</strong> and white properties, making it a blend of both. For instance, white symbolizes purity, cleanliness, and openness. Lighter <strong>blue</strong>s are a reflection of these properties. As a result, lighter <strong>blue</strong>s become associated with peace, friendliness, approachability, youth, and loyalty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although pairing a gray tie with a <strong>blue</strong> suit and vice versa is nearly foolproof, there are some ways for you to make the most of this combination. For one thing, avoid too strong a contrast between the two <strong>colors</strong>, which is the general rule for any color coordination. So, if your suit is dark gray, avoid a really pale <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue on <strong>blue</strong> might sound bland, but going all over with a single color always has a surprisingly striking effect. Trying pairing navy <strong>blue</strong> furniture, whether that be a sofa or a headboard, with slightly lighter rich <strong>blue</strong> walls for a calming and cocooning look. Add some much-needed warmth with gold accents as can be seen here with the mirror and the lighting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Printed silk ties with <strong>blue</strong> and gray geometric patterns or knit ties with both <strong>colors</strong> in them are likewise excellent options. I especially like the versatility of striped ties with either a repp pattern or large block stripes for this purpose. If you get a tie with stripes of both <strong>colors</strong> you can wear them easily with either gray or <strong>blue</strong> suits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Orange is a scary color for a lot of people, but when done right, it can be a masterpiece. Orange and <strong>blue</strong> are a match made in heaven when worn together. When embraced, their brightness is their beauty and can be very powerful. For a more subtle look, you can pair a cerulean <strong>blue</strong> with tangerine or choose a deep or navy <strong>blue</strong> to tone down the intensity of the orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In most people’s wardrobe, <strong>blue</strong> is an unavoidable color. Many people say <strong>blue</strong> is their favorite color. It symbolizes dependability, stability, and trust, along with consistency, authority, and strength. There are numerous brands with <strong>blue</strong> logos (think Facebook) – this testifies to the confidence-inspiring power of <strong>blue</strong>. I love <strong>blue</strong>!

However, several <strong>colors</strong> are difficult to match with purple clothes and tend to clash. These <strong>colors</strong> include brown, orange, and certain shades of green and red. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s safe to say that all men should have a white shirt in their closet. The color white is so simple, yet it catches the attention of many people. The white shirt and the navy <strong>blue</strong> pants combo is ideal if you’re someone who appreciates the elegance of the monochrome. Don’t forget to complement this outfit idea with brown leather loafers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The same techniques mentioned above can be used when wearing sports coat and trouser combinations, though some men may be put off by the perceived difficulties of coordinating an additional article of clothing: pants in a different shade.

This radiant hue is especially helpful for lightening up dark navy <strong>blue</strong> <strong>colors</strong> to ward off a gloomy look. A large gold mirror on a navy <strong>blue</strong> wall, for example, will reflect light around the space to create an expansive effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another reason for purple’s popularity has been its flexibility. Purple is made through a combination of red and <strong>blue</strong> and can be created in various tones and intensities. This makes it a color that can be tailored to fit many different styles, skin tones, and seasons – making it a go-to choice for designers all year long. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You’ll want to stick to a pure white color, however.

Just be sure to stick to similar undertones in the <strong>colors</strong> you choose. Keep cool-toned purples separate from warm-tone purples since they will look like entirely different <strong>colors</strong> when placed side-by-side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src="https://designs.generalfinishes.com/sites/default/files/styles/post_main_image/public/post-images/scd-turquoise-erin-20190301-cabinet1-patina-green-milk-paint-general-finishes.jpg?itok=nFE_O804" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="What Colors Match With Dark Blue Clothes - What Color Goes With Blue Clothes">
