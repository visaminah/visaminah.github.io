Keep it around 5MB - 10MB to ensure it reaches your potential employer, and that if it does get there, it can be easily opened. Alternatively, of course you can put your architect portfolio online. - Source: Internet A stylish portfolio is critical for any designer. Other professions have the luxury of describing their skills and accolades in words, but designers can’t just describe their work; they have to show it. Designers are most often compared, chosen, and hired based on the impression that their portfolio makes. Even if your work samples are stellar, the portfolio itself is arguably your most important design work, and it should be just as impressive as the work within it. Below, we’ll use some straightforward techniques to help you create a stylish, professional portfolio layout. - Source: Internet For this longer version of your architectural portfolio, it is not necessary to try to outline every job you have ever done. The best bet is to highlight nine or ten of the jobs you are most proud of. Don’t be afraid of blank space and remember that you only need to outline things like design, process, and final solutions. In terms of text, less is usually more. - Source: Internet Jason Wu, a Masters student from Canada, has created an architecture portfolio that faithfully presents all his design work with a depth and clarity that is likely to impress any potential employer. Cleverly, he uses multiple representations to present different sections within a single structure.

Of course, that’s a critically important part of the equation, but it’s also about matching your style and inspiration with those of the people you will be working with. In other words, it’s not just about being a good architect, but being the type of good architect that fits that particular role or project. - Source: Internet Use attractive graphics and clear presentation, and ensure that your architectural portfolio is not too text heavy. Use a range of visuals including photos, technical detail drawings, and photorealistic renders. Even use sketches if that is one of your talents. - Source: Internet On top of that, there is a pleasing consistency to her architect portfolio.
