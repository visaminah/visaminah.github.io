In this office alcove, vintage blue canning jars of all sizes brighten a space with little light. When <strong>decorating</strong> up high, group same-color items to create big-impact displays that read as a collection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Here&rsquo;s another seasonal decoration idea from a reader, Tenley. She said, &ldquo;My husband found this old crate at the curb, thrown out by someone else, and brought it home. Little did he know it would cost Him dearly!! I purchased a variety of seasonal decorations which I display in it on top of my kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. I have decorations for every holiday. Need to get the Valentine decorations out now, huh?&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>07 of 16 Simply Striking Forget about adding soffits above your <strong>cabinets</strong>. Instead, leave wall space wide open, so you can take advantage of cabinet tops for displaying gorgeous accessories. These open-to-view areas are ideally suited to spotlighting impressive serving pieces that often go unseen and unappreciated when stored behind closed doors. White Kitchens We Love - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Showcase meals for the week, special events, or share family schedules. Painting the space above your <strong>cabinets</strong> with chalk paint is one <strong>decorating</strong> idea that’ll help keep you organized. Just be careful climbing all the way up there! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>03 of 16 Look to Books Enhance a kitchen&rsquo;s usefulness by including surfaces designed for stowing and showing off essentials. Here, dark-stained shelves convert a small kitchen-desk alcove into a home office. At the same time, a large open nook above neighboring <strong>cabinets</strong> displays colorful cookbooks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To cut down on too much room above your kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>, ask a cabinetmaker to stack another layer of cabinetry on top of your upper <strong>cabinets</strong>. Not only will you fill up some of that space, but you’ll also gain storage. To end up with the right proportions, make these <strong>cabinets</strong> roughly half as tall as the layer beneath them. Then consider accenting them with glass doors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Decorating above kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> is in style all the way! Just keep in mind that secret stashes should be as visible as their name implies…hidden and not seen. This is more achievable for those with higher ceilings and kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> that match that height. If you have lower <strong>cabinets</strong>, secret stashes are a big no! They only create a cluttered look that, let’s be honest, no one wants to see. If you insist on a hideaway for kitchens with lower <strong>cabinets</strong>, try using cubies or canisters! Still hidden and can add a stylish touch to your space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For most of us, that awkward space above the kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> is a constant design dilemma. It’s not exactly easy to access, but at the same time, it looks a little empty. While there isn’t one correct answer, there are definitely a few great options!

And the space above the kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>, where it seems as if something should go there…but what? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>An art gallery above your <strong>cabinets</strong> is “IN” and super innovative! Use the space above your <strong>cabinets</strong> to decorate and display your collection of art. Treat this space as a gallery wall and add in different heights and textures to really make the space appealing. Bringing in some surprising elements like brass frames for some extra pop will really dramatize the room. This option is great for lower <strong>cabinets</strong> with high ceilings, but this option can work for just about anyone. You can get creative with the art and if you are having trouble finding just the right pieces, try printing abstracts or making your own abstract masterpiece! This is a great way to save money without anyone knowing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Instead of putting a bunch of stuff in the space above your kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>, make a statement with lighting. Layering your lighting adds depth and dimension to any room, and the kitchen is no exception. For example, install a row of pot lights above the <strong>cabinets</strong> to create a downlit effect. Or opt for easy-to-install strip lighting above the <strong>cabinets</strong> to get the perfect nighttime ambiance without all the work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The addition of this display area above the kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> was allowed by the creation of this traditional looking molding. It’s just perfect to show a great collection of decorative plates. If your <strong>cabinets</strong> are square and plain at the top, adding an inexpensive molding is an cheap way to give them a better presence. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Storing breakable items on top of your kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> adds a personal touch to your decor - and keeps your stuff out of harms way.

These jars tie in some of the metallic elements from the kitchen’s decor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>04 of 16 Timeworn Touches Be creative!

A mantel-like niche lined with beaded board unites this room&rsquo;s <strong>cabinets</strong> and appliances while providing a perch for baskets and dishes. What&rsquo;s Your Decorating Style? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you love the look of <strong>cabinets</strong> that go all the way to the ceiling but don’t want to embark on a costly reno, get the look for less with faux cabinet fronts. Choose panels that match the rest of your <strong>cabinets</strong>, or add a little pizzaz with back-lit glass door fronts. The great thing about this look is you can install them and then forget about it. No dusting, watering or trying to remember what you have stored up there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most of the time the area just above the kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> and under the ceiling might be let open. This offers a shelf-like space that you can use or close in by a soffit. Decorating that space above the kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> is the perfect way to add personality to your kitchen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>10 of 16 Open to View Cabinets over the refrigerator and their contents are difficult for most people to reach.

That is, of course, if you have a green thumb. No one wants to stare at dead plants above your <strong>cabinets</strong>. Having a fresh variety of plants is nice and opt for ones that are easy to take care of (ivory, spider plant, philodendron, etc). If your green thumb isn’t so good, don’t worry, add some faux plants and garland instead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For a functional and unified look, line the top of your <strong>cabinets</strong> with matching baskets. Take the time to measure the space above your <strong>cabinets</strong>, so you get the right fit. You want it to look like the baskets were designed to accompany your <strong>cabinets</strong>. Choose baskets about an inch shorter than the space above the <strong>cabinets</strong>, so they’re easy to pull out. Get enough baskets to run the length of the room and you’ll gain a ton of extra storage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> end several inches below your ceiling, the empty space above them likely looks blah and awkward. Fortunately, with a few ideas, you can either play down this area or dress it up to add style and storage space. Here’s how to decorate the top of your kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> and blend it into your kitchen design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>12 of 16 Display Case Take advantage of out-of-reach openings to display sculptural pieces with similar colors or design periods. This kitchen has generous wall space accommodating tall <strong>cabinets</strong> topped with open shelves. A flat upper surface shows off a hefty glass vessel that contributes color and sparkle to the kitchen&rsquo;s streamlined design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://maricamckeel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/01_Crystal-Kitchen-Center-traditional-mudroom-entryway_s3x4.jpg.rend_.hgtvcom.966.1288.jpeg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Decorating Ideas For Above Kitchen Cabinets - decorating ideas for wall above kitchen cabinets">
