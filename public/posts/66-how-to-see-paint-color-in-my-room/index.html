Like all gray paint colors, Moonshine can be influenced by all the elements going on around it. For example, lighting, decor, and even what is outside of your window. Some grays can have “sneaky undertones” that show up and cause a bit of a stir. However, I like to think Moonshine is a color that doesn’t have anything sneaky coming your way. - Source: Internet When choosing the family room paint color, think about how you will use the space and when you will use it. If the family room is used primarily in the evening, choose a color that looks best using lamps and light fixtures. With artificial lighting, bolder colors show up better than muted colors; lighter colors will look subdued. If your family room is in use day and night, consider adding an accent wall to give it more visual variety. For inspiration, always go back to the color wheel for help choosing accents. - Source: Internet Benjamin Moore also has a line called Scuff-X, and the name pretty much says it all. It’s a super durable paint that protects your paint finish from dirty little hands and scuff marks. We chose this paint for crowns, frames, doors and base boards.

I am glad you stopped by. Obviously, you are here for a reason, and that reason is to learn about another beautiful paint color. - Source: Internet Moonshine has an LRV of 68.28, it’s not the highest nor is it the lowest. It’s a little higher than midway which is a great spot for paint colors to be. - Source: Internet One of the highest-rated offerings, The Home Depot’s easy-to-use home painting app allows you to test out colors for your interior or exterior project. Scroll through popular colors and get suggestions for shades based on the mood you want to set in the room. A color match option allows you to match paint colors to items around you by uploading a photo from your camera roll. You can save favorites or share them with friends. Easily order your choices by purchasing through the app or finding a store location close by. - Source: Internet I knew I wanted a warm white in our house, mainly because the original plan was to paint our whole house the same colour. So with our designer, we chose White Dove (OC-17) by Benjamin Moore early on in the process. It’s a popular colour amongst designers because it’s a soft white with a hint of grey and it just looks very classic. It also looks beautiful on trim and cabinets, which we ended up using too. - Source: Internet I’ve been noticing more and more black being used in homes lately and I’m definitely liking the trend. However, as with white paint colors, the shade from one color to the next can vary dramatically. I’ve been looking for just the right shade of black paint lately, which led me to this whole exploration of black paint colors. - Source: Internet Glidden’s paint color app opens with a “designer tip” before taking you to its main features, which include options to browse colors, find inspiration, color match, or take an interactive quiz.

As an added bonus, the app offers palettes inspired by different design styles ranging from mid-century modern to bohemian to glam. - Source: Internet This paint color app allows you to test out different shades by uploading a snapshot of your room or exterior or by choosing from a large catalog of paintable rooms separated into easy-to-find categories.

Several shades of blue paint colors made the list for PPG paint’s Trending Paint Colors for 2022, Sherwin Williams 2022 Color Collection, and Valspar’s 2022 Colors of the Year. Krylon’s 2022 Color of the Year was a vibrant blue-teal paint that would look striking sprayed on an outdoor bench, while Behr’s 2022 Color of the Year was a soft and minty blue-green shade that would be perfect in a bathroom or kids’ room. - Source: Internet Don’t forget, as much as lighting plays a major part in how a paint color will look at times, there are other determinants to be aware of. For instance, decor, furniture, fixtures, cabinetry, and floors. These are all elements that can affect and/or influence the way a paint color will look in your room. - Source: Internet Moonshine OC-56 is also known as MOONSHINE 2140-60. What do those numbers even mean? They are there telling you the color collection. So, OC is the Off-White Collection and the numbers (without letters) are the Color Preview Collection. - Source: Internet Whether used on accent furniture or hardware, adding contrast with black will also create interest.

If you haven’t had a chance to look at that yet, you should definitely check it out. - Source: Internet If you’re craving a new look for a room, changing up the wall color is an ideal high-impact, low-cost option (especially if you dust off your painting overalls and DIY the job). However, choosing the perfect shade can be a daunting process. When you can’t make it to the paint store and leave with your pockets stuffed with color swatches, there’s now a paint color app for that! Many apps, in fact, to make finding the right shade and even ordering paint online easier. - Source: Internet The family room or den is a welcoming, comfortable space in the house where everyone gathers. In some homes, the family room is used more often than a living room. Paint colors for the walls can go in several directions: warm and comforting with olive green or orange hues, breezy and calming with blues, or neutral, so the room’s accessories set the mood. Behr is a popular paint brand sold exclusively at Home Depot. - Source: Internet Behr’s ColorSmart app boasts “designer-coordinated color combinations” that you can preview in room scenes and on exteriors. To help you find the perfect shade, it allows you to color match from an uploaded photo. Or, if you have a color in mind to trial, simply scan the barcode on the back of a Behr paint swatch or brochure. Want to get a friend’s opinion? Save and share color projects on your social networks. Once you’ve made a decision, the paint color app will help you locate The Home Depot store closest to you to make your purchase. - Source: Internet Bring the look of nature inside with Fernwood Green. It’s a somewhat muted, medium tone green with yellow and beige undertones. This would be a great color for a bedroom, guest bathroom, or laundry room. - Source: Internet I didn’t know what to do because we had all settled on the paint colour quickly early on. I never predicted this would happen. I didn’t want this decision to affect the timeline of the build, so the pressure was on! - Source: Internet Just for fun I also put together a pretty color palette below that would be beautiful with to Seagull Gray. We painted the little round picture frame (on the cabinet) City Rain from the palette. You could use this palette in a variety of ways, on walls, trim, cabinets, furniture, as well as fabrics and accessories. - Source: Internet Studio McGee cites Soot as one of their favorite interior black paint colors, calling it a “moody gray-black that isn’t too cold”. You can see how they used it on the wall of this bathroom above. I’m torn between this color and Iron Mountain for my side table. - Source: Internet The flow of a particular color from one room to another helps to give your entire home a cohesive appearance. Today’s homes tend to have open floor plans where you can stand in one space and see the other. In this case, my best advice is to keep the color the same in an effort to make the two rooms feel more expansive. However, my lady’s lounge is closed off from the rest of the house which left my color options wide open. Instead of color, I considered texture and materials. - Source: Internet Easily upload photos of your project to get started on the Paint My Place paint color app. Not affiliated with any one brand, this app allows you to try out paint, roof, and fence colors from a variety of different brands. If you’re looking for endless color options, the paid version offers more than 50,000 paint choices from 32 brands, including some of our favorites such as Benjamin Moore, Valspar, PPG, and Sherwin Williams.

Save, email and share your color choices with friends, your interior designer, or a local painter or paint retailer. - Source: Internet Benjamin Moore Moonshine is a cool-toned paint color. But don’t let the term cool scare you. It’s not at all, nor is it anywhere near an icy cool gray color. The coolness of Moonshine gives it all its appeal. - Source: Internet “As the spaces in our homes continue to evolve, we uncover more opportunities to express our individuality and leverage the power of color to design environments that serve different functions and styles,” said Andrea Magno, Benjamin Moore Director of Color Marketing \u0026 Development. “October Mist 1495 and the corresponding Color Trends 2022 palette reflects an effortless harmony of colors, while inspiring unique combinations for any paint project.” - Source: Internet Instantly see any Sherwin-Williams color on your own walls, in real time.

Instead of physically going to your nearest paint store to grab your samples, you need to try Samplize Peel \u0026 Stick paint samples. Why should you try Samplize? Super affordable - Source: Internet Basements can be tricky to find the right paint color. For the most part, they tend to be darker with little to no natural light and they may have lower ceilings. Two quite challenging factors to work around. However, I am here to tell you good old Benjamin Moore Moony works on the basement walls. - Source: Internet WEST-FACING ROOMS – Early evening is when West-facing rooms have the most favorable light. Warmer tones might seem overwhelming because of the red-orange the light gives off. However, if the main use for the room is in the mornings, the colors won’t appear as strong as they would in the evening. - Source: Internet Blue just may be the most versatile shade on the color wheel. With its diverse range of undertones and ability to pair seamlessly with other hues, this color proves why it is a standout among designers. A rich midnight blue evokes a moody, reflective feeling that’s suitable for a home library, while a glossy aquamarine exudes just the right amount of energy within a living room. Delicate pastel blue walls can even transform modest bedrooms into peaceful and calming retreats that draw you in, and ocean-inspired blue hues are perfect for creating a spa-like bathroom. - Source: Internet As a self-professed color lover, I opted for both, the pastel sundress and the pretty room makeover. As a color expert, I’ve teamed up with Behr Paint in their ColorClinic to take you through the process of choosing paint colors for your home. For starters, Behr has several color tools to assist in your selection process, my favorite being the ColorSmart Mobile App, but there are a few steps to consider first. In my professional experience, choosing paint color is in fact the LAST step in the planning process. - Source: Internet When it came time to start the painting, our painter tested our paint colour in a kids room upstairs. I knew that paint looks different on walls than it does on trim, so we tested both. When I saw the sample in Taylor’s bedroom, I was disappointed because it looked so grey and yellow. It definitely wasn’t what I was envisioning, and I remember my heart sinking a little. - Source: Internet E. G.- I accidentally tapped on one color swatch a few times because no names are given (until color is selected) and I wasn’t sure “which black color” in that row that I had already looked at. I didn’t realize I had selected the same color until I clicked on it and then I could see the color name. I had to exit out of the picture completely and restart process just to choose another color. - Source: Internet The subtle blue/green undertone is not overbearing at all. Its adds to the sophistication of the color. If you are ok with a lovely cool undertone then you will absolutely fall for Moonshine. - Source: Internet We know Moonshine has some blue/green to it so we can expect to potentially see those colors show up in certain lighting. As you can see in the picture by @pleasantbaydesigns on Instagram, Moony is showing a bit green. I think it looks beautiful. There is a certain calm tranquillity that this color exudes while being elegantly serene and it’s proven in this photo.

Sometimes when you color match between paint manufacturers, the colors don’t come out accurately. This is because each brand uses different formulas to create its paint colors. - Source: Internet I wanted my new “lady lounge” to have a distinct air of femininity, freshness, and calm. Having a room painted in the palest of pinks was my true heart’s desire. Using the same paint color, BEHR PREMIUM PLUS ULTRA in Pale Cashmere, on the walls, bookcases, and trim work made my small space feel even larger. This product also has a built-in primer, which was especially important when painting over that old chalkboard wall. - Source: Internet White paint looks different in every house, in every room, and at every time of day. Yes, it was one of those pull your hair out of your head decisions for me. Did you watch my stories when I was going through the dreaded paint choices? - Source: Internet The color comes off on the cooler side. I tend to see more of a green/blue in the gray. But it is not too dark of a color for the space. I find it to be the perfect fit for my basement. - Source: Internet This simple app allows you to snap a photo of your space and upload it quickly, then use a paint bucket to test out different color options. A color picker allows you to swap out shades easily or use multiple colors at once to try out an accent wall—a tape tool lets you draw a line to help prevent bleeding into the areas you don’t want to “paint.” When you’re happy with your design, a shopping cart icon directs you to Walmart to purchase Glidden brand paints and painting tools. - Source: Internet As I mentioned before, comparing colors is a helpful way to see if a color is warm or cool, etc. I collected a few popular paint colors to compare Moonshine against. Let’s see how they stack up. - Source: Internet Are you a free spirit, a dreamer, or a naturalist?

The BEHR PREMIUM PLUS ULTRA line also has the highest rated zero VOC paint which means you can breathe easy knowing you’ve got one of the “greenest,” most environmentally-safe paints on the consumer market. - Source: Internet You can upload photos of your home’s exterior or interior or you can choose from a library of images. Then you can take that picture of your entire home, or just a single room, and change the paint color. With thousands of different color palettes you will be able to find the perfect shade for every facet of your home with our paint visualizer tool. - Source: Internet I think the bedroom is another fantastic place to use Moonshine. Again, it’s a neutral gray paint color so it allows you to play with color elsewhere. Also, it is a cool-toned paint color and cool tones are known for promoting more of a relaxing, peaceful atmosphere. The bedroom is exactly where you need a restful, chill vibe, right? - Source: Internet “Painting” the color onto photo. The tech is ok. It does leave a white outer line around “painted area”, so that can be distracting. I also had an actual paint swatch on the wall, so it had a white line around that swatch too. - Source: Internet The Benjamin Moore paint color Moonshine is a light near neutral gray paint color. At first glance, it resembles a soft slightly cool-toned gray color, and for the most part that is exactly what it is. But let it be known that near neutrals like BM Moonshine tend to be influenced by what’s going on around them. - Source: Internet Here’s the entire collection of color trends form 2022 from Benjamin Moore. There’s a nice mix of soft neutrals with a few pops of strong colors. And the overall palette is soothing and the colors are all beautiful. - Source: Internet I paint my basement walls with Moonshine. For reference, there are two small windows with a porch deck covering them. So there is basically no natural light. There are however high hats providing artificial light. - Source: Internet This is one of those paint colors that (in my eyes) will never go out of style. It is truly timeless. It’s so soft and beautiful and will make any space feel elegant. - Source: Internet From siding and shingles to fences, decks, and outdoor furniture, choosing the perfect stain color can be a challenge. Whether you’re looking for a modern natural look or a vintage weathered gray, this paint color app can help you find the right finish for your outdoor wood projects. Launch the ProjectPro online tool from any browser or mobile device. - Source: Internet As we’ve become more settled in other areas of our home, I started thinking about this room again. It wasn’t that we didn’t like it as it was, we really did. I was ready for a change, but I dislike redoing things that are already done, you know? But sometimes I just need to make myself get over that and do what I know I’ll love the most. So I got brave and asked my husband to repaint the room, ha! - Source: Internet To get started with this paint color app, upload a photo of the room or exterior you would like to paint or try the video visualizer, which uses your camera to show color options in real-time. A virtual fan deck allows you to scroll through Benjamin Moore’s collection of colors. If you are looking to step into your designer shoes, the company offers its ColorReader ($99) or ColorReader Pro ($249) expert grade color matching devices by Datacolor that can be purchased separately and synced up with the app. Users can place the ColorReader device on any flat surface to take a color measurement and the app will display the three closest paint color matches.

We will always provide updates with the latest content. This application also includes color ideas related to home. - Source: Internet Taking photos and allowing app to access certain photos worked fine. When looking over color swatches, the names of colors weren’t available to see (you’re going on small color swatch alone). Once you click on a color and it takes you to your chosen photo, there isn’t anyway to “undo” or “page back” if you don’t want that color. - Source: Internet I called Benjamin Moore to talk about their paint colours because, at this point, I thought we needed to select a different white, and they told me that Benjamin Moore white paints are tough to match because most painters start with a grey/white base. Not sure if this is true or not, as I haven’t fact-checked this, but it made so much sense in our case. I then decided to get a sample of the actual Benjamin Moore White Dove paint in their Aura line, and it made all the difference. - Source: Internet I have loved this paint color the moment I set my eyes on it. It’s soft, subtle, and seriously gorgeous. I have used this paint color in my home and let me tell you the love is real. So, of course, I HAD to dedicate a full in-depth post to the color that quickly stole my heart, and I so lovingly nicknamed Moony. (Any Harry Potter fans out there?) - Source: Internet Light, near neutrals like Moonshine may not be your best choice for an exterior paint color. Being that the color will be on the exterior, in direct sunlight, it has the potential to look very washed out. You will basically lose all sense of the color and it will end up looking white. - Source: Internet A good example of this would be comparing BM Moonshine to BM Revere Pewter. You can clearly see that Moonshine is the cooler paint color of the two. Revere Pewter is cooler in comparison. - Source: Internet Neutral paint colors tend to be the most effortless to find complementary colors for, especially grays. However, it’s inherent to be aware of any undertones the color has. When talking about Benjamin Moore Moonshine, there are blue/green undertones that can show up.

So the very first thing we did was paint our room a dark moody color we absolutely loved. - Source: Internet LRV is for sure important however it is 100 percent not the end all be all.

We are currently updating our <strong>color</strong> tools. If you have a specific <strong>color</strong> tool request or question, please go to behrpro.com/rep to find your nearest Architect & Design Rep. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Moonshine has subtle undertones of blue/green. Like all gray <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s, Moonshine can be influenced by all the elements going on around it. For example, lighting, decor, and even what is outside of your window. Some grays can have “sneaky undertones” that show up and cause a bit of a stir. However, I like to think Moonshine is a <strong>color</strong> that doesn’t have anything sneaky coming your way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When choosing the family room <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>, think about how you will use the space and when you will use it. If the family room is used primarily in the evening, choose a <strong>color</strong> that looks best using lamps and light fixtures. With artificial lighting, bolder <strong>color</strong>s show up better than muted <strong>color</strong>s; lighter <strong>color</strong>s will look subdued. If your family room is in use day and night, consider adding an accent wall to give it more visual variety. For inspiration, always go back to the <strong>color</strong> wheel for help choosing accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Benjamin Moore also has a line called Scuff-X, and the name pretty much says it all. It’s a super durable <strong>paint</strong> that protects your <strong>paint</strong> finish from dirty little hands and scuff marks. We chose this <strong>paint</strong> for crowns, frames, doors and base boards. Scroll down to the bottom for our full list of products. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Well hello again. Welcome back or for those of your who are new around here, very nice meeting you. I am glad you stopped by. Obviously, you are here for a reason, and that reason is to learn about another beautiful <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Moonshine has an LRV of 68.28, it’s not the highest nor is it the lowest. It’s a little higher than midway which is a great spot for <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s to be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the highest-rated offerings, The Home Depot’s easy-to-use home <strong>paint</strong>ing app allows you to test out <strong>color</strong>s for your interior or exterior project. Scroll through popular <strong>color</strong>s and get suggestions for shades based on the mood you want to set in the room. A <strong>color</strong> match option allows you to match <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s to items around you by uploading a photo from your camera roll. You can save favorites or share them with friends. Easily order your choices by purchasing through the app or finding a store location close by. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I knew I wanted a warm white in our house, mainly because the original plan was to <strong>paint</strong> our whole house the same colour. So with our designer, we chose White Dove (OC-17) by Benjamin Moore early on in the process. It’s a popular colour amongst designers because it’s a soft white with a hint of grey and it just looks very classic. It also looks beautiful on trim and cabinets, which we ended up using too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I’ve been noticing more and more black being used in homes lately and I’m definitely liking the trend. However, as with white <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s, the shade from one <strong>color</strong> to the next can vary dramatically. I’ve been looking for just the right shade of black <strong>paint</strong> lately, which led me to this whole exploration of black <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Glidden’s <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong> app opens with a “designer tip” before taking you to its main features, which include options to browse <strong>color</strong>s, find inspiration, <strong>color</strong> match, or take an interactive quiz. The <strong>color</strong> quiz helps you to select a palette with the option of having free <strong>paint</strong> swatches sent to your home to test in your space and lighting. As an added bonus, the app offers palettes inspired by different design styles ranging from mid-century modern to bohemian to glam. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong> app allows you to test out different shades by uploading a snapshot of your room or exterior or by choosing from a large catalog of <strong>paint</strong>able rooms separated into easy-to-find categories. Browse shades or <strong>color</strong> match from your photos to get started. Save or discard palettes easily while working, and share your final choices by uploading your rendering to social networks. Though a desktop app, the site also offers a fairly seamless experience through a mobile browser on a phone or tablet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s are both classic and on trend. Several shades of blue <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s made the list for PPG <strong>paint</strong>&rsquo;s Trending Paint Colors for 2022, Sherwin Williams 2022 Color Collection, and Valspar&rsquo;s 2022 Colors of the Year. Krylon&rsquo;s 2022 Color of the Year was a vibrant blue-teal <strong>paint</strong> that would look striking sprayed on an outdoor bench, while Behr&rsquo;s 2022 Color of the Year was a soft and minty blue-green shade that would be perfect in a bathroom or kids&rsquo; room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Don’t forget, as much as lighting plays a major part in how a <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong> will look at times, there are other determinants to be aware of. For instance, decor, furniture, fixtures, cabinetry, and floors. These are all elements that can affect and/or influence the way a <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong> will look in your room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Moonshine OC-56 is also known as MOONSHINE 2140-60. What do those numbers even mean? They are there telling you the <strong>color</strong> collection. So, OC is the Off-White Collection and the numbers (without letters) are the Color Preview Collection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Whether used on accent furniture or hardware, adding contrast with black will also create interest. The hardware in your house (curtain rods, door pulls, etc) can really pull a <strong>color</strong> palette together. Mixing metals is something else I touch on in my eBook, Picking Paint Colors Simplified. If you haven’t had a chance to look at that yet, you should definitely check it out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re craving a new look for a room, changing up the wall <strong>color</strong> is an ideal high-impact, low-cost option (especially if you dust off your <strong>paint</strong>ing overalls and DIY the job). However, choosing the perfect shade can be a daunting process. When you can’t make it to the <strong>paint</strong> store and leave with your pockets stuffed with <strong>color</strong> swatches, there’s now a <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong> app for that! Many apps, in fact, to make finding the right shade and even ordering <strong>paint</strong> online easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The family room or den is a welcoming, comfortable space in the house where everyone gathers. In some homes, the family room is used more often than a living room. Paint <strong>color</strong>s for the walls can go in several directions: warm and comforting with olive green or orange hues, breezy and calming with blues, or neutral, so the room&rsquo;s accessories set the mood. Behr is a popular <strong>paint</strong> brand sold exclusively at Home Depot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Behr’s ColorSmart app boasts “designer-coordinated <strong>color</strong> combinations” that you can preview in room scenes and on exteriors. To help you find the perfect shade, it allows you to <strong>color</strong> match from an uploaded photo. Or, if you have a <strong>color</strong> in mind to trial, simply scan the barcode on the back of a Behr <strong>paint</strong> swatch or brochure. Want to get a friend’s opinion? Save and share <strong>color</strong> projects on your social networks. Once you’ve made a decision, the <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong> app will help you locate The Home Depot store closest to you to make your purchase. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bring the look of nature inside with Fernwood Green. It’s a somewhat muted, medium tone green with yellow and beige undertones. This would be a great <strong>color</strong> for a bedroom, guest bathroom, or laundry room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I didn’t know what to do because we had all settled on the <strong>paint</strong> colour quickly early on. I never predicted this would happen. I didn’t want this decision to affect the timeline of the build, so the pressure was on! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Just for fun I also put together a pretty <strong>color</strong> palette below that would be beautiful with to Seagull Gray. We <strong>paint</strong>ed the little round picture frame (on the cabinet) City Rain from the palette. You could use this palette in a variety of ways, on walls, trim, cabinets, furniture, as well as fabrics and accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Studio McGee cites Soot as one of their favorite interior black <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s, calling it a “moody gray-black that isn’t too cold”. You can see how they used it on the wall of this bathroom above. I’m torn between this <strong>color</strong> and Iron Mountain for my side table. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The flow of a particular <strong>color</strong> from one room to another helps to give your entire home a cohesive appearance. Today’s homes tend to have open floor plans where you can stand in one space and see the other. In this case, my best advice is to keep the <strong>color</strong> the same in an effort to make the two rooms feel more expansive. However, my lady’s lounge is closed off from the rest of the house which left my <strong>color</strong> options wide open. Instead of <strong>color</strong>, I considered texture and materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Easily upload photos of your project to get started on the Paint My Place <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong> app. Not affiliated with any one brand, this app allows you to try out <strong>paint</strong>, roof, and fence <strong>color</strong>s from a variety of different brands. If you’re looking for endless <strong>color</strong> options, the paid version offers more than 50,000 <strong>paint</strong> choices from 32 brands, including some of our favorites such as Benjamin Moore, Valspar, PPG, and Sherwin Williams. A variety of <strong>paint</strong> “tools” and the ability to modify opacity allow for a precise virtual <strong>paint</strong>ing experience. Save, email and share your <strong>color</strong> choices with friends, your interior designer, or a local <strong>paint</strong>er or <strong>paint</strong> retailer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Benjamin Moore Moonshine is a cool-toned <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>. But don’t let the term cool scare you. It’s not at all, nor is it anywhere near an icy cool gray <strong>color</strong>. The coolness of Moonshine gives it all its appeal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“As the spaces in our homes continue to evolve, we uncover more opportunities to express our individuality and leverage the power of <strong>color</strong> to design environments that serve different functions and styles,” said Andrea Magno, Benjamin Moore Director of Color Marketing & Development. “October Mist 1495 and the corresponding Color Trends 2022 palette reflects an effortless harmony of <strong>color</strong>s, while inspiring unique combinations for any <strong>paint</strong> project.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Instantly see any Sherwin-Williams <strong>color</strong> on your own walls, in real time. With ColorSnap Visualizer’s Paint features, you can use augmented reality or a photo of your space, and tap the wall to change its <strong>color</strong> instantly. Other features let you match the <strong>color</strong>s in a photo and quickly get <strong>color</strong> details, like where to find it in our stores and what <strong>color</strong>s complement it. Get ready to make faster, more confident <strong>color</strong> decisions with ColorSnap—only from Sherwin-Williams. In addition to overall enhancements, you can now: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Quickly, let’s talk about testing <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s. Instead of physically going to your nearest <strong>paint</strong> store to grab your samples, you need to try Samplize Peel & Stick <strong>paint</strong> samples. Why should you try Samplize? Super affordable - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Basements can be tricky to find the right <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>. For the most part, they tend to be darker with little to no natural light and they may have lower ceilings. Two quite challenging factors to work around. However, I am here to tell you good old Benjamin Moore Moony works on the basement walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>WEST-FACING ROOMS – Early evening is when West-facing rooms have the most favorable light. Warmer tones might seem overwhelming because of the red-orange the light gives off. However, if the main use for the room is in the mornings, the <strong>color</strong>s won’t appear as strong as they would in the evening. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue just may be the most versatile shade on the <strong>color</strong> wheel. With its diverse range of undertones and ability to pair seamlessly with other hues, this <strong>color</strong> proves why it is a standout among designers. A rich midnight blue evokes a moody, reflective feeling that&rsquo;s suitable for a home library, while a glossy aquamarine exudes just the right amount of energy within a living room. Delicate pastel blue walls can even transform modest bedrooms into peaceful and calming retreats that draw you in, and ocean-inspired blue hues are perfect for creating a spa-like bathroom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As a self-professed <strong>color</strong> lover, I opted for both, the pastel sundress and the pretty room makeover. As a <strong>color</strong> expert, I’ve teamed up with Behr Paint in their ColorClinic to take you through the process of choosing <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s for your home. For starters, Behr has several <strong>color</strong> tools to assist in your selection process, my favorite being the ColorSmart Mobile App, but there are a few steps to consider first. In my professional experience, choosing <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong> is in fact the LAST step in the planning process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it came time to start the <strong>paint</strong>ing, our <strong>paint</strong>er tested our <strong>paint</strong> colour in a kids room upstairs. I knew that <strong>paint</strong> looks different on walls than it does on trim, so we tested both. When I saw the sample in Taylor’s bedroom, I was disappointed because it looked so grey and yellow. It definitely wasn’t what I was envisioning, and I remember my heart sinking a little. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>E. G.- I accidentally tapped on one <strong>color</strong> swatch a few times because no names are given (until <strong>color</strong> is selected) and I wasn’t sure “which black <strong>color</strong>” in that row that I had already looked at. I didn’t realize I had selected the same <strong>color</strong> until I clicked on it and then I could see the <strong>color</strong> name. I had to exit out of the picture completely and restart process just to choose another <strong>color</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The subtle blue/green undertone is not overbearing at all. Its adds to the sophistication of the <strong>color</strong>. If you are ok with a lovely cool undertone then you will absolutely fall for Moonshine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We know Moonshine has some blue/green to it so we can expect to potentially see those <strong>color</strong>s show up in certain lighting. As you can see in the picture by @pleasantbaydesigns on Instagram, Moony is showing a bit green. I think it looks beautiful. There is a certain calm tranquillity that this <strong>color</strong> exudes while being elegantly serene and it’s proven in this photo.

Sometimes when you <strong>color</strong> match between <strong>paint</strong> manufacturers, the <strong>color</strong>s don’t come out accurately. This is because each brand uses different formulas to create its <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I wanted my new “lady lounge” to have a distinct air of femininity, freshness, and calm. Having a room <strong>paint</strong>ed in the palest of pinks was my true heart’s desire. Using the same <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>, BEHR PREMIUM PLUS ULTRA in Pale Cashmere, on the walls, bookcases, and trim work made my small space feel even larger. This product also has a built-in primer, which was especially important when <strong>paint</strong>ing over that old chalkboard wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>White <strong>paint</strong> looks different in every house, in every room, and at every time of day. Yes, it was one of those pull your hair out of your head decisions for me. Did you watch my stories when I was going through the dreaded <strong>paint</strong> choices? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>color</strong> comes off on the cooler side. I tend to see more of a green/blue in the gray. But it is not too dark of a <strong>color</strong> for the space. I find it to be the perfect fit for my basement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This simple app allows you to snap a photo of your space and upload it quickly, then use a <strong>paint</strong> bucket to test out different <strong>color</strong> options. A <strong>color</strong> picker allows you to swap out shades easily or use multiple <strong>color</strong>s at once to try out an accent wall—a tape tool lets you draw a line to help prevent bleeding into the areas you don’t want to “<strong>paint</strong>.” When you’re happy with your design, a shopping cart icon directs you to Walmart to purchase Glidden brand <strong>paint</strong>s and <strong>paint</strong>ing tools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As I mentioned before, comparing <strong>color</strong>s is a helpful way to see if a <strong>color</strong> is warm or cool, etc. I collected a few popular <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s to compare Moonshine against. Let’s see how they stack up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Are you a free spirit, a dreamer, or a naturalist? Find the perfect <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong> to suit your persona with the Sherwin-Williams Color ID app feature that pairs personality traits with a coordinating <strong>color</strong> palette. Match yourself to one of their descriptions to find your “Color ID” and a selection of shades to go with it. Choose a <strong>color</strong> from this tool or the company’s wide library of shades to create and save palettes. See a photo on Pinterest of a room shade you adore? Snap a screenshot and use this home <strong>paint</strong>ing app to <strong>color</strong> match it for you to an existing chip. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Because my ceilings soared, I opted for a slightly darker <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>, Behr’s Seaside Villa. If my ceiling were lower, then I would have instead chosen a <strong>color</strong> lighter than the walls. The BEHR PREMIUM PLUS ULTRA line also has the highest rated zero VOC <strong>paint</strong> which means you can breathe easy knowing you’ve got one of the “greenest,” most environmentally-safe <strong>paint</strong>s on the consumer market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can upload photos of your home’s exterior or interior or you can choose from a library of images. Then you can take that picture of your entire home, or just a single room, and change the <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>. With thousands of different <strong>color</strong> palettes you will be able to find the perfect shade for every facet of your home with our <strong>paint</strong> visualizer tool. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I think the bedroom is another fantastic place to use Moonshine. Again, it’s a neutral gray <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong> so it allows you to play with <strong>color</strong> elsewhere. Also, it is a cool-toned <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong> and cool tones are known for promoting more of a relaxing, peaceful atmosphere. The bedroom is exactly where you need a restful, chill vibe, right? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=3><li>“Painting” the <strong>color</strong> onto photo. The tech is ok. It does leave a white outer line around “<strong>paint</strong>ed area”, so that can be distracting. I also had an actual <strong>paint</strong> swatch on the wall, so it had a white line around that swatch too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>The Benjamin Moore <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong> Moonshine is a light near neutral gray <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>. At first glance, it resembles a soft slightly cool-toned gray <strong>color</strong>, and for the most part that is exactly what it is. But let it be known that near neutrals like BM Moonshine tend to be influenced by what’s going on around them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Here’s the entire collection of <strong>color</strong> trends form 2022 from Benjamin Moore. There’s a nice mix of soft neutrals with a few pops of strong <strong>color</strong>s. And the overall palette is soothing and the <strong>color</strong>s are all beautiful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I <strong>paint</strong> my basement walls with Moonshine. For reference, there are two small windows with a porch deck covering them. So there is basically no natural light. There are however high hats providing artificial light. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is one of those <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s that (in my eyes) will never go out of style. It is truly timeless. It’s so soft and beautiful and will make any space feel elegant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>From siding and shingles to fences, decks, and outdoor furniture, choosing the perfect stain <strong>color</strong> can be a challenge. Whether you’re looking for a modern natural look or a vintage weathered gray, this <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong> app can help you find the right finish for your outdoor wood projects. Launch the ProjectPro online tool from any browser or mobile device. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As we’ve become more settled in other areas of our home, I started thinking about this room again. It wasn’t that we didn’t like it as it was, we really did. I was ready for a change, but I dislike redoing things that are already done, you know? But sometimes I just need to make myself get over that and do what I know I’ll love the most. So I got brave and asked my husband to re<strong>paint</strong> the room, ha! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To get started with this <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong> app, upload a photo of the room or exterior you would like to <strong>paint</strong> or try the video visualizer, which uses your camera to show <strong>color</strong> options in real-time. A virtual fan deck allows you to scroll through Benjamin Moore’s collection of <strong>color</strong>s. If you are looking to step into your designer shoes, the company offers its ColorReader ($99) or ColorReader Pro ($249) expert grade <strong>color</strong> matching devices by Data<strong>color</strong> that can be purchased separately and synced up with the app. Users can place the ColorReader device on any flat surface to take a <strong>color</strong> measurement and the app will display the three closest <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong> matches. For the DIYer or professional looking for speed and accuracy, these are great options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Support this application to develop by giving a positive rate. We will always provide updates with the latest content. This application also includes <strong>color</strong> ideas related to home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=2><li>Taking photos and allowing app to access certain photos worked fine. When looking over <strong>color</strong> swatches, the names of <strong>color</strong>s weren’t available to see (you’re going on small <strong>color</strong> swatch alone).
