This is a mold disaster waiting to happen. - Source: Internet As your air conditioner works, it is blowing cold air or warm air through the air ducts. Additionally, this can create a moisture barrier of condensation as the air inside the air duct meets the air being produced by the air conditioning unit. When the water vapor is created, it settles on the walls of the air ducts. This creates an environment that is conducive to mold growth. - Source: Internet Drain pans and cooling coils are potential components of your HVAC system that you can take a DIY mold removal approach with. Before tackling either one, be sure to wear a respirator and gloves.

Be sure to look at the coil yourself before they close the unit up, or ask for pictures to verify that the contractor has done a thorough job. Keep reading to learn all the questions to ask and how to avoid scams! - Source: Internet Water is present on the coil when the air conditioner is running. The water is deposited as moisture is removed from the air during cooling. Air filters inadequately prevent dust (aka ‘mold candy’) from being deposited on the coil, usually because they are of poor quality, do not fit properly, or are missing altogether. - Source: Internet Before You Start No matter which method you choose, make sure to wear a mask and gloves.

If mold is inside your air duct system, the spores can get blown to the vents, and eventually end up as a black dust. Also, mold can start growing on the air vents themselves because dust accumulates on the surface — which is a food source. Cleaning the visible mold on vents is recommended because the mold may release spores into the air, possibly causing harmful health issues. - Source: Internet Yes! Indoor air can retain household chemicals, volatile organic compounds (VOC’s), mold spores, pollen, microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOC’s), toxins, bacteria, viruses, and other irritants more easily than outdoor air. Infectious bacteria and viruses can cause disease.

As the distance the UV light is from the mold increases, the intensity of the light decreases and renders the process ineffective. - Source: Internet This process when done correctly supposedly kills 99% of the mold. Now let’s assume there is one million mold spores in an area. That means at the end of this process, there are still 10,000 living mold spores that are colonized and still reproducing in the “treated” area.
