The hotel is really geared up for and welcoming of <strong>families</strong> with connecting rooms available and also family rooms with two beds. This hotel is clean and comfortable and comes in at a great price for all it has on offer. The Holiday Inn is 350 yards from Ground Zero and the 9/11 Memorial & Museum and easy to get from here around the city using the subway. One of the great NYC family friendly hotels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We have rounded up the best family hotels in New York, situated across the city. Wherever possible one of our Family Hotel Expert team have stayed in the hotels we recommend and where we haven’t our selection is based on thorough research.

We don’t link to anything or anywhere we wouldn’t stay in ourselves with our own children (and wherever possible we have). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now, I fully realize that spending hours (or days) researching NYC hotels for <strong>families</strong> is not everyone’s cup of tea. For that reason, in the following post, I have tried to simplify things. In addition to my list of the best hotels for <strong>families</strong> in New York City, you will also find some quick tips on where to stay and how to save money. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>($$) The Hampton Inn Manhattan is a favorite of many business travelers and <strong>families</strong> who want to save a few dollars while still getting plenty of comforts. Instead of a continental breakfast you get a full hot breakfast buffet experience. Walking to the South Street Seaport, which is located at the tip of Manhattan, takes about 15 minutes, and this is where you can book trips around the Hudson Harbor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>SheBuysTravel Sarah Pittard recommends this location because “it solves a lot of the cost and space issues that <strong>families</strong> face.” With several FREE amenities like parking and wifi, plus large family suites with kitchens, the Residence Inn New York The Bronx is a great option for large <strong>families</strong>. Plus, you’ll be within 3 miles of family-friendly activities like the Bronx Zoo, New York Botanical Garden and Yankee Stadium. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Centrally located in the middle of Times Square, the Westin New York at Times Square is a great choice for <strong>families</strong>. The views of the NYC skyline are incredible and the rooms themselves are simple yet luxurious, with all the essentials. The hotel has terrific on-site dining and gym facilities. –Holly Fink, author at The Culture Mom - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Bronx has become quite popular with the younger professionals who want to escape the cost of living in Manhattan or Brooklyn. Additionally, they want a taste of the rich culture and nightlife that the Bronx offers. You find that many of the neighborhoods are great for <strong>families</strong> as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a luxurious hotel where every member of the family will feel properly pampered and one of the best hotels in NYC for <strong>families</strong>. Located in the heart of Downtown Manhattan there is a welcome gift for visiting children and lots of amenities in the room for them. Kids (and adults) will love the indoor heated pool with spectacular views across the city. If you’re looking for Manhattan family hotels with all the added luxury then you won’t be disappointed with the Four Seasons Hotel New York Downtown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What could be more exciting to a child than experiencing the floor to ceiling opulence of the Peninsula? Why, setting up a tent in the bedroom, of course. Camp Peninsula is just one of the numerous features that make this Fifth Avenue hotel especially attractive to <strong>families</strong>, where everything from scavenger hunts to cupcake decorating and cookery classes are organised. Other options include behind-the-scenes Broadway experiences and private tours of MoMA. The inviting indoor pool — something few New York hotels can provide — is another bonus. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The High Line Hotel, a historic boutique hotel in Chelsea with really easy access to the High Line features unique rooms with character and detail, on the small side. Great location for <strong>families</strong> since the High Line and the Hudson River Park offer plenty of space to run around. -Tarlie Harris, Trekaroo Travel Expert - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The quaint “downtown” has shops, cozy cafes and some delicious restaurants with the town surrounded by fields of farms and the nearby mountains. For young <strong>families</strong>, they have to navigate the “lack” of things to do in town by venturing further afield. But those who do will have adventures on the Aesopus River, hiking trails and nearby ski resorts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Move out of the centre of the city and the rewards are different: at the Rockaway, you’re just a block from the beach, overlooking Jamaica Bay. Manhattan’s easy to get to via the subway, train or ferry, but chances are you’ll want to hang around for the sand and the surf lessons — and exploring the great shops and affordable food trucks. During summer the hotel has daily activities focused on arts, movement and the community, aimed at seven to 11-year-olds. The hotel is geared to <strong>families</strong>, with a great pool with live entertainment and bunk-bed guest rooms and suites with kitchenettes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are many good schools in Park Slope. There are more than ten public schools in the neighborhood, including one educational campus with three high schools and one high school and middle school combination. There are also eleven private schools if <strong>families</strong> prefer them over a public school. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This hotel brings a winning combination: stylish, really kid-friendly and in a great location within the buzzing Meatpacking District. The last thing you want to do is traipse all over town, so its proximity to playgrounds and attractions that are ideal for <strong>families</strong>, such as the High Line, Hudson River Park’s bike paths and the Whitney Museum of American Art, is a bonus. Baby amenities are complimentary, there are free Nintendo Wii video games for older kids, and complimentary sofa beds for under-13s. Best of all, there’s a heated rooftop pool. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Just three blocks from Grand Central Station this is a really well located hotel. This is a good hotel with a really nice suite of rooms for <strong>families</strong> including two bedrooms and a lounge with a sofa bed. There is no breakfast here but there’s Greek yoghurt, granola and apples available through the day. When it comes to family hotels in New York this one provides a great amount of space in its suites. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The neighborhood is a top choice for <strong>families</strong> and young professionals alike because it’s just comfortable. The streets are beautiful. There are lots of parks and activities around. Plus, there are relatively direct subway routes to anywhere else you want to go in NYC. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can go big here and find a luxury, multi-million dollar home. But this area is also popular among <strong>families</strong> and new homeowners looking for something a little more affordable. Here are some of the houses for sale and apartments for rent in the area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a brilliant, well priced hotel where all the rooms come with a kitchenette to help to keep eating out costs down. This is one of the best family hotels in NYC for those who want to feel like they’re living in the city. It’s just a 10 minute walk from Grand Central Station and Times Square is only 15 minutes walk. They have a variety of rooms including those that will fit six. One of the real fuss-free NYC hotels for <strong>families</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At first glance, The Pierre may not seem an obvious choice for a hotel for <strong>families</strong>, being pretty traditional. Indeed, its wood-panelled lifts still have attendants, like something out of a 1940s B-movie. However, the 41-storey hotel, just moments from Central Park and close to museums, does lots to cater for children, including games and books, and a stuffed toy to take home. Kids also get biscuits and milk at turndown, and up to three children under the age of five can stay in their parents’ room for free. Extra beds for older children have a small charge, although cots are complimentary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a lovely, luxury hotel but without the super high price range of some of its five star counterparts. This is in a wonderful, central location – the National September 11 Memorial & Museum is less than half a mile away. With a living room for every single bedroom there is space here to really relax and at this price has to be one of the best New York city hotel suites for <strong>families</strong>. Some of the rooms have gorgeous views over the Hudson River. One of the best family hotels in Manhattan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With its Central Park views, classic NYC awning and circular entrance, elevator attendant, personal butler and maid service, and uniquely decorated 50 rooms, The Sherry Netherland is a Midtown splurge worthy of an iconic vacation. A long list of celebs have stayed here, but the Family Getaway Package, which includes luxurious all-suite accommodations, tickets to the Central Park Zoo, historic Carousel, NYC-themed gifts and Metro Passes, will make you think the 90-year-old hotel was designed just for <strong>families</strong>. –Katie Bodell, Trekaroo Blog Editor - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>($$) The Four Points by Sheraton Manhattan Chelsea is a hotel popular with <strong>families</strong> who stay in New York for a few days. As you can expect from a Sheraton property, the rooms are comfortable and spacious; the Westside Brewhouse is an Irish pub located within the hotel, and every room offers complimentary bottled water and gourmet coffee. Being located less than a mile away from the Chelsea Waterside Park on the Hudson River is one of the reasons many <strong>families</strong> choose to stay here. The hotel gym is open 24 hours a day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Visiting the Big Apple with kids? With hundreds of hotels popping up on websites, it can be tricky for parents to find a fabulous hotel that is close to the action and kid friendly. Here are some of the best NYC hotels for <strong>families</strong> that real Trekaroo parents and contributors have stayed at (and loved!) in NYC. We’ve done the hard work for you; all you have to do is book it and enjoy your big city getaway! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the major expenses that people living in cities face is their rent. Rent can be significantly higher for your family living in NYC since you need extra space for more people. Manhattan has a few top notch neighborhoods for <strong>families</strong>, but it is also the most expensive place to live in the city. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bordered with parks and playgrounds and boasting both a children’s museum and the famed dinosaurs at the American Museum of Natural History, this is an excellent neighborhood for <strong>families</strong>. Several hotels offer family accommodations and the area is served by two subway lines and several buses, making it easy to get around. Trendiest NYC Neighborhood: The Bowery - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As New York reopens in 2021, you’ll likely find room rates lower than they’ve been in years. That’s great news for <strong>families</strong> traveling to NYC. Check out our favorite kid-friendly hotels and additional resources for planning your New York City vacation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the coolest things about the Lotte New York Palace is its history. Built in 1882 as six townhouses surrounding a grand courtyard on Madison Avenue, the Lotte is steps away from Rockefeller Center, Grand Central and St. Patrick’s Cathedral. Many choose to stay at the hotel because it is iconic, but for <strong>families</strong>, it also makes a great starting point to exploring Manhattan with kids. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>($$) Hotel Beacon offers large suites complete with kitchenettes and seating areas that are very popular with <strong>families</strong> who stay in New York on museum tours. The sofa in the living rooms of suites unfolds into a bed. The American Museum of Natural History is only three blocks away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Consider how much time you will be spending in your hotel room. If it is a first New York City family vacation, you may not spend much time in your room at all. Will a comfortable bed and a decent pillow at the end of a long day of sightseeing do the trick? Or, is this a once-in-a-lifetime experience where you want to splurge on a gorgeous room at one of the best hotels in New York City for <strong>families</strong>? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Brooklyn tossed off its outer boro rep a long time ago and should be considered as a destintion in its own right for <strong>families</strong> looking to explore New York City. Wondering what to do?

Here are some great Brooklyn hotels for <strong>families</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Get your head around the fact that NYC family hotel rooms are extremely pricey in comparison to most other North American cities.

Very recently, an ecological park has come up by the end of Pier 26 that houses two kid-friendly playgrounds and a science park. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Within walking distance of Central Park, the Carlyle Hotel offers a luxury NYC vacation experience while also catering to <strong>families</strong>. In fact, this hotel goes the extra mile when it comes to kids by providing kid-friendly amenities. We especially love the inclusive kid-sized bathrobes. Pop into Bemelmans Bar before 6 pm (a cover charge is applied in the evening) and look at the murals. They were painted by “Madeline” author Ludwig Bemelmans in exchange for room and board in the 1940s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The rent in Park Slope is higher than the average Brooklyn rent cost of two thousand eight hundred dollars.

The hotel also has a complimentary shuttle in use twice a day to Wall Street and Broadway making it one of the great family hotels in New York City. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I generally use Tripadvisor – filtering first for reviews by <strong>families</strong> and typing kids into the search bar to narrow those reviews down even further. I also like to look at Tripadvisor’s Room Tips. All rooms are not created equal and requesting a high floor or a room away from the elevator could dramatically improve your experience, while usually costing you nothing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For budget loving <strong>families</strong> New York can be hard to find affordable accommodation in that is also family friendly.
