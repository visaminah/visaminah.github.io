Grey ceramic lighting and cushions help to tie the grey tones in seamlessly without them distracting from the main attraction of retro greens and <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Decorating with <strong>blue</strong> and white is a hallmark of coastal decor. However, if you’re looking for a more chic, contemporary take on the nautical look, try switching the white for grey. In this scheme, interior designer Tracy Morris (opens in new tab) wanted to use a palette of watery hues to allude to the coastal hometown of owners, so chose a warm grey as a base to set them off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;I like using warm greys to give depth to walls without dictating the room&rsquo;s furniture palette – light greys add a layer of softness while rich greys add depth. Coating the windows, doors and trim in the same grey wall color further unifies the backdrop to a Living Room and can give the illusion of a higher ceiling when painted in a contrasting color. I gravitate towards greys with less <strong>blue</strong> and more brown in them,&rsquo; says Catherine Fowlkes of the DC-based architecture firm, Fowlkes Studio (opens in new tab). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Green is next on the list of colours that offer many possibilities when combined with grey. Pairing a bright emerald green with grey – of varying shades – can give you a striking, refined, unobvious look. It may be trickier to figure out which shades work best together at first, but don’t give up! A little trial-and-error will eventually lead to an outstanding <strong>match</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;re looking to design with this well-loved color but feeling a bit overwhelmed by the options, never fear. Navy <strong>blue</strong> is a versatile color that pairs with everything from classic white to deep bordeaux. We&rsquo;ve rounded up some of our favorite hues to pair with navy, and some of them definitely aren&rsquo;t what you were expecting. Whether you opt for a traditional pairing or go for something unexpected and bold, navy <strong>blue</strong> comes through again and again. Which is probably why it&rsquo;s earned itself a spot in the pantheon to begin with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Not only do grey and black <strong>match</strong>, but they are also a <strong>match</strong> made in heaven! These two neutrals can be paired in almost any combination and create an eye-pleasing look. With so many shades to choose from, the options are endless. Going for contrasting shades may be the most obvious choice, and a great choice it is! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your wardrobe is built on a foundation of neutrals like mine is, chances are you have plenty of navy pieces stocked in your closet. After all, beyond black and white, navy <strong>blue</strong> is one of the most versatile shades you can wear. While it’s a foolproof classic worn on its own, it also complements an array of colors. So what are the colors to go best with navy <strong>blue</strong>? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A grey top is about the most versatile item in a closet – even if it’s a T-shirt, it can be dressed up or down. For a casual yet classy look, a grey top can be paired with your favorite pair of jeans. Complete the outfit with a pair of shoes to <strong>match</strong> the occasion – sandals or casual sneakers for an everyday look, heels, boots, or elegant flats for something more night-appropriate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Rated 5 out of 5 by stephh5 from Perfect shade This <strong>blue</strong> is just fab. It changes in the sunlight - from <strong>blue</strong> to gray, looking really sophisticated. I was between using this or french gray on my trim/door but I’m glad I went with the <strong>blue</strong>. It pairs well with New White (which is what I did for my siding). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;re able to recognize the color temperature of the gray you&rsquo;re considering, it will make choosing a complementary color palette that much simpler. Temperature or undertone incompatibility is almost always the culprit when colors don’t look “right” together. Consider charcoal gray as an alternative to black or dark <strong>blue</strong>: Charcoal gray can be the perfect dark color accent without being too deep or intense. It is also stunning as upholstered furniture or rugs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The key to a great <strong>match</strong> lies in coordinating the tones. Warm gray shades go well with other warm-toned colors, like taupe, blush pink, butter yellow, and burnt orange.

Finally, we’ll go over the most classic combination – pairing grey with your favorite pair of jeans. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want these two colors to really work in tandem in menswear, one color must always be darker than the other. This rule will allow the different colors to take up the majority of the look. It is so important to strike a proper balance between similar colors. Pair red and <strong>blue</strong> like this and you’ve got yourself a power move. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Light grey can be paired with almost any shade of <strong>blue</strong> – light to dark – and charcoal grey can create varying effects depending on the <strong>blue</strong> that is chosen to go with it. This colour combo can also be used in any and every season and appropriate for any occasion. Pro tip: for a <strong>blue</strong> and grey outfit, choose a warm-toned brown shoe to complete the look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before 2020 ended, Pantone announced the Colour of The Year. For 2021, they were actually two. One of them was Ultimate Grey. With so much focus on this colour, you can help but wonder what you can mix and <strong>match</strong> with it? What colors can you pair with grey clothes? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue is another color that was made to go with grey. A versatile color – in countless shades – sure to provide you with limitless options. Blue and grey are two cool tones that go together, so naturally, it is difficult to get this pairing wrong. We’ve already covered navy <strong>blue</strong> – which is a perfect choice for balancing with contrast, but light pastel and medium sky <strong>blue</strong> hues can create looks just as pleasing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another <strong>match</strong> for grey that can’t be ignored is yellow. The most cheerful color on the spectrum is the perfect <strong>match</strong> for the muted tone that grey provides. The neutral grey can help tone down a very bright shade of yellow; in contrast, a sunny shade of yellow can provide the perfect lift to a toned-down grey. With so many possibilities, try and choose shades that complement each other well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I guess white is our go to when it doubt, and rightfully so. However, with lighter and brighter shades of <strong>blue</strong> it looks exceptionally exceptional. You can play around with color in other elements of the outfit like the shoes or bags, but even a full white and <strong>blue</strong> outfit looks interesting and easy to wear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Despite common misconception that dark <strong>blue</strong> shades can make a room feel small and unwelcoming, they can in fact make a room feel bigger. Rich, dark <strong>blue</strong>s can instantly bring inviting warmth and won’t overpower a room.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can’t go wrong with pairing grey with grey. Whether you mix and <strong>match</strong> darker and lighter shades or go for a monochrome look instead. An all-grey outfit can look effortlessly casual, or dress it up by adding heels or a blazer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We&rsquo;re well-documented fans of designing in a <strong>blue</strong> color scheme. As much as we&rsquo;re partial to a bold pop of purple or a wash of muted green, there&rsquo;s something about the color <strong>blue</strong> that just has astounding versatility. And if we were to play favorites, we&rsquo;d have to say that navy <strong>blue</strong>—one of the most iconic shades ever—is the epitome of everything we love about this part of the color wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Right now, certain colors seem more popular than others (we&rsquo;re looking at you, hot pink), but one shade that never goes out of style is navy <strong>blue</strong>. It continues to be a mainstay in our wardrobe year-round, whether we&rsquo;re rocking a striped navy and white swimsuit by the beach or bundling up in a knit navy sweater. However, despite this neutral being such a classic, deciding what colors go with navy <strong>blue</strong> can sometimes feel tricky. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This was one of the most common and popular color combinations out there. Pinterest is full of <strong>blue</strong> and green outfit ideas and we&rsquo;ve also written an article before about wearing these two together&mldr;you can check it out in the link below. It seems that a limey pastely green is really popular with <strong>blue</strong> and so is mint green. They look so beautiful together and you can always balance it out with white or even some grey. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue and grey are the greatest of friends - they can complement each other in a colour scheme, and even blend into one another so seamlessly that you can barely tell where the boundary is. Dark greys and <strong>blue</strong>s can create a moody, storm-cloud atmosphere, while lighter duck egg shades are effortlessly elegant and soothing. Our favourite might have to be the middle ground of slate and petrol tones, where small changes in lighting can make the difference between perceiving the colour as grey or as <strong>blue</strong>. There&rsquo;s something for all tastes in this colour combination, so scroll down for our best-loved ways to pull it off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Opting for dark <strong>blue</strong>s and greys can create a scheme with drama and impact as well as a cozy and inviting feeling. Alternatively, if bold and dark isn&rsquo;t for you, then combining light and airy <strong>blue</strong>s and greys also works effectively, creating an elegant and sophisticated look that is soothing, explains Emma Detering. &lsquo;The brighter shades and muted hues help create a calming space that can be updated time and time again with more affordable accessories to refresh the look. You can really add texture and dimension to this by layering light and airy linens and natural textures that pay homage to the coastal look.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another neutral option that can be combined with almost any palette, but you need to consider some of the nuances. White looks more attractive with cold shades—think <strong>blue</strong>, light <strong>blue</strong>, black, graphite. However, beige and sand will work too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When choosing a specific gray shade for your room&rsquo;s color palette, you should start by choosing a tone of color. Warm grays are slightly tinted with either orange, yellow, or red, making them appear a bit cozier—they may even look almost beige. Cooler-toned grays have been cut with shades of <strong>blue</strong>, green, or purple. The resulting gray hue feels clean, crisp, and modern. True to its &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; title, gray really goes with almost every other color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Glamorous yet relaxed, a grey-on-white scheme can make a surprisingly bold style statement. The first thing to bare in mind, however, is that not all greys and whites <strong>match</strong>, so it&rsquo;s often best to stick with a pure white that will complement everything from &lsquo;greige&rsquo; to silver. Consider the best white paint for walls, because choosing the right shade will make or break the overall look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grey is essential in any wardrobe – its versatility in pairing with other colours and textures is un<strong>match</strong>ed. Grey can handle the brightest brights and loudest prints and still create a well-put-together look. Even outfits in varying shades of grey will be sophisticated and well-balanced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After taking a peek at some street style inspiration, we&rsquo;ve realized it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Red, pink, beige, black — mysteriously, all the colors go with navy <strong>blue</strong>. Don&rsquo;t believe us? Here are a few great navy outfit ideas to prove it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Define <strong>blue</strong>-greys with an indigo <strong>blue</strong> accent. The darkness of the indigo will highlight the <strong>blue</strong> undertones in the grey, if you want a cooler shade. When used in a bedroom you can always layer linen throws, wool blankets, wicker baskets and felt cushions to cosy up the look. A <strong>blue</strong> patterned wallpaper helps to add personality to the scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fashion insiders have shown us a range of colors that work.

Jeans come in all sorts of washes, from very dark – navy to acid washed – basically white, all hues complemented beautifully with a grey tank, blouse, or sweater. Jeans paired with a grey top can make up an outfit for any occasion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A well-put-together wardrobe should be centered around a few staple pieces. These garments should include various items that can be mixed and <strong>match</strong>ed easily with many other options. One of the most important things about these base items is that they should come in neutral tones – making them the most versatile and reliable options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&ldquo;We get this question all the time, and guys often find it hard to believe that <strong>blue</strong> and black can look great in the same outfit,&rdquo; says Thread stylist Millie Rich. &ldquo;Dark shades naturally work well together, so there&rsquo;s no danger of clashing, and the combination of <strong>blue</strong> and black looks particularly sophisticated.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>By reds, we mean all the different tones of red, especially because this is a tricky color pairing and so you need to find the perfect shade of <strong>blue</strong> with the perfect shade of red or even burgundy. We found that a really bright red with a royal <strong>blue</strong> go beautifully together, but is definitely a statement. For a more subtle look, you can go for more muted raspberry reds or the ones that are borderline burgundy. You can also keep the red subtle in your outfit, like as an accessory, bag or shoes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Lemon yellow and soft smoke <strong>blue</strong> complement each other so perfectly. The tone of each of these colors is gentle which draws you into a room. This shade of yellow (above), which I call Hay, is so fresh, making you feel happy, full of hope and sunshine. On the other hand <strong>blue</strong> if often seen as peaceful and secure,&rsquo; says fabric designer Vanessa Arbuthnott (opens in new tab). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Decorating with white is guaranteed to make spaces feel brighter and lighter but they can feel cold. Adding in a variety of delicate tones of grey and <strong>blue</strong> through textiles and furniture can help to gently lift the space preventing it from feeling stark and austere.

Giving Sulking Room Pink, Inchyra Blue and Green Smoke as examples. &lsquo;However, if you want to keep the palette more monochromatic, layer tones of grey like Ammonite with Mole’s Breath.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Many guys don’t really like this color, as it can come off as too feminine. However, if you’ve bought a light pink shirt or sweater, it’s relatively easy to combine with other colors. Keep in mind that bright shades require accuracy. Soft shades of the palette can be safely worn with <strong>blue</strong>, grey, white, beige, brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Street casual style isn’t too strict, but minimalism prevails, so muted shades are preferable to bright ones. You can safely combine neutral and more expressive colors, for example, grey and burgundy. The most popular here will be <strong>blue</strong>, black, brown, and white to refresh the outfit as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A lot of people fear wearing <strong>blue</strong> and navy with black&mldr;a fashion rule i&rsquo;ve broken way too many times and enjoyed doing so. Blues can actually look really beautiful with black, especially a bright royal <strong>blue</strong>, a teal or cerulean. There&rsquo;s also something really beautiful about the contrast between black and a baby <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>’When introducing colour accents to lighter greys, think about the undertones of the pairing first and then the contrast you wish to achieve.

David Harris, design director at Andrew Martin, says that, &lsquo;dark <strong>blue</strong>s, greens and greys work really well with marble, brass and walnut.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;re thinking of pairing grey and <strong>blue</strong> with other colors then, &lsquo;go for something well balanced like our ‘French Grey’ family,&rsquo; says Ruth Mottershead, creative director of Little Greene (opens in new tab). &lsquo;These greys can be paired with other shades with ease, combining well with <strong>blue</strong>s, greens and pinks. Accent colors should be used to highlight and work in tandem with the base shade rather than against it.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With browns the shade is also essential. Light brown tones look good paired with a cream shade, <strong>blue</strong>, and white. Dark ones will make an exciting contrast with <strong>blue</strong>, black, burgundy, dark greens. All brown options look gorgeous with white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>‘Our clients were moving from a coastal location. I knew we were going to use many tones of <strong>blue</strong> in the house, so I needed a clean backdrop that would bring out the <strong>blue</strong> tones – Benjamin Moore (opens in new tab)’s Revere Pewter was the perfect complement! This warm paint balanced the cool tones in the fabrics and rugs creating the perfect backdrop for this home.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Orange is really scary for a lot of people, but when done right it can be a masterpiece.

The grey retains an air of sophistication to stop the <strong>blue</strong>s becoming too coastal when layered together. Painted furniture, statement artwork and soft furnishings are a great way to add this deep <strong>blue</strong> without it overpowering. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Together <strong>blue</strong> and grey work well with lots of other colors, so it&rsquo;s not a wonder the palette is popular for decorating. &lsquo;Blues work well on their own or can really come to life when combined with other shades within the palette for a harmonious interior; off-white, greens and greys are classic combinations but contrasting pinks and reds are increasing in popularity for a layered look.&rsquo; says Dominic Myland, director of Mylands Paints. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can position yourself as a calm, strong-willed, reliable man with intelligence using <strong>blue</strong> clothes, as well as its relevant shades, ranging from <strong>blue</strong> to indigo <strong>blue</strong>.
