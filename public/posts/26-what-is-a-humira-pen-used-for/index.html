Patient ‘assistance programmes’ are limited in the US, so it has been reported that compliance is suffering as patients skip doses they cannot afford. Phase III clinical trials are extremely expensive though so in many respects with the evolution of the lifecycle and added indications, there is some justification for the price increases for Humira.” - Source: Internet This is the most critical part of the whole process.

In Europe, when the patents for biologics Enbrel and Remicade expired, there was a resulting decrease of 10%-15% in the cost of therapy, a trend which Humira will likely mirror.” - Source: Internet What Happens If I Overdose on Humira?
