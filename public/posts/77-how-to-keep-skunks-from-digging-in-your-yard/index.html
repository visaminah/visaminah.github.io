The skunk’s markings are very individualized. Photo via Ame Vanorio - Source: Internet Do you have a skunk living on your property? Despite their generally gentle disposition and effectiveness at keeping down small-rodent populations, very few people want a skunk living around their house. Their famous defensive odour can pose a real hazard for dogs and small children, they wreak havoc on vegetable gardens and poultry, and they can be a rabies carrier as well. Fortunately, skunks are usually fairly easy to get rid of, even if approaching them head-on is not recommended. - Source: Internet . These will affect a skunk’s fur, which they do not like to get oil on. Chilli and cayenne pepper. Mix either with water and spray or simply sprinkle powder flakes in areas you want to keep skunks away from. This irritates a skunk’s sense of smell. - Source: Internet Another way to keep skunks off your property is a motion-activated security light. Skunks are nocturnal, and shun bright light, so an unexpected blast from a floodlight is likely to send them scampering. You can also try to eliminate habitats they find appealing by filling in holes and clearing away overgrown brush and woodpiles. Ultimately, skunks, like most animals, are going to take up residence in the area most convenient to them. A few simple steps should be enough to make sure that residence isn’t yours. - Source: Internet Some gardeners will tell you to put citrus peels around to deter skunks. I’m here to tell you that technique doesn’t work. My baby skunks love citrus fruit. If it’s a fruit – any fruit – they eat it! - Source: Internet This spray is biodegradable, and it will not hurt the skunk or your garden and plants. It has a base scent of putrescent whole egg solids, cloves, and garlic oil (all smells that skunks hate.) - Source: Internet The first step in knowing how to keep skunks away is understanding how you get skunks in your yard. For starters, skunks will forage for food in your garbage cans and trash bags so moving them into the garage or locking them up will help keep skunks at bay. Additionally, skunks love to forage for food (especially grubs) and are attracted by freshly planted yards or freshly laid sod as this makes it easier for them to dig. - Source: Internet You can use predator urine such as American Heritage Industries Red Fox Urine and spread it around your garden. This will help scare away skunks. These products, as strange as they may sound, are easily available online or in wildlife stores! - Source: Internet – Foxes and dogs are skunks’ natural predators, so their urine is a natural repellent. The good news is that you don’t have to collect the urine yourself since many hardware stores sell products containing fox or dog urine. Citrus Peels – Orange and lemon peels have natural repellent qualities. Scatter them around your yard and under your deck or porch. - Source: Internet The acid produced from citrus fruits repels skunks because it is a scent that they do not find pleasant. It makes for a fantastic natural deterrent. You can make your own remedy which consists of using fruits such as lemons and oranges to ward away skunks. - Source: Internet Sometimes getting rid of skunks takes more than the options listed above. If you’re unsuccessful in keeping skunks away, contact a pest company. If the skunk is behaving irregularly or erratically, contact your local wildlife authority. - Source: Internet Skunks also like to use underground dens for resting, hiding, giving birth, and rearing their young. And while skunks can and will dig their own burrows, they will generally move into abandoned burrows dug by squirrels, foxes, or coyotes. And it’s worth noting that skunks like to make their dens under porches and other dark, low spaces – so blocking off these areas will help keep skunks away. - Source: Internet Patch holes around your foundation. Skunks are great diggers. If you’re using fencing or mesh to close off certain areas, bury the material at least one and a half to two feet down. It’s important to make sure skunks are outside before you seal up access points, or you may end up with animals trapped under or inside your house. - Source: Internet The best way to protect your plants from skunks is to have a good garden fence. You can use several types of fences specifically for skunks. You might also use a one-type-fits-all model that blocks out a variety of garden trespassers. - Source: Internet Examine tracks, burrows, or nests. This is also a great way to identify digging or burrowing animals. The presence of tracks leading to a burrow, the shape of the burrow’s entrance, and nearby odor can all help differentiate between the diggers. - Source: Internet Solar Ultrasonic Animal Repellent – This solar-powered skunk deterrent offers a humane way of getting rid of pests. The ultrasonic sounds create an unpleasant living environment for the skunks. The device is quiet, as its frequency is so high it’s undetectable to a human ear. - Source: Internet They sound like a real pest, but skunks do have benefits in the garden. They eat a number of damaging bugs. Japanese beetle larvae are a favorite snack. They will also eat cutworms, hornworms, yellow jackets, and cabbage worms. - Source: Internet We often smell a skunk before we see it. The odor that comes from a skunk is both unpleasant and unmistakable. And if you’re trying to sell your house or moving into a new one, you’ll really need to know how to keep skunks away. - Source: Internet Along the same lines, I have heard that castor oil or oils that contain capsaicin repel skunks. I haven’t tested this strategy so you may have to experiment. The theory is that the smell messes with the skunk’s ability to sniff out its dinner, so it will leave. - Source: Internet Skunks take pride in their beautiful white and black fur. They do not like to get it oily, so another effective scent is to spray your grass with vegetable oil. Both the scent of the oils and its texture will ward away any skunks who want to keep their fur silky and smooth. - Source: Internet Spring is skunk breeding season! By summer, most skunks have had their kittens, and are really raising a stink. Skunks can become a nuisance when they decide to live under a structure or spray the family pet. Skunks around your structure can also enter your house. - Source: Internet You may have cleaned your best bbq and made sure you’ve removed pet bowls and have shut your trash cans, but if you don’t wash out your recycling properly, you’ll still be seeing skunks around, attracted by the smell of those leftovers. There are other great reasons to wash out your recycling (this increases the chance it’ll actually get recycled, for one). But smelly recycling will attract skunks, raccoons, and rats (yikes). - Source: Internet Mother skunks have been observed teaching their children to scratch at the entrance of the beehive. When the guard bees come out to investigate, the skunks eat them. The skunks do this at night because the bees that leave the hive are at a disadvantage. Bees don’t navigate well at night. - Source: Internet We can eliminate or reduce these wildlife attracting smells. We can trap skunks and other critters for you all year long, but that will not solve your problem. What good does it do to continuously remove an overabundant, automatically replenishing commodity? - Source: Internet Skunks love dog and cat food. They also enjoy feeding on the roaches and other bugs that pet food attracts. If you have outdoor pets, feed them during the day, and then remove any uneaten food before evening, when skunks are most active. Store bird and pet food in an outdoor storage building or in your garage. Ensure these items are kept in sealed containers in hard to access places to prevent an easy meal for skunks. - Source: Internet – Soak rags in ammonia and place them under your deck or porch to deter skunks. Pepper sprays – Sold to also repel squirrels and other small animals, pepper strays are effective skunk repellents. Spray them on trees or other areas where you think skunks have been. - Source: Internet A skunk’s odor is unmistakable regardless of whether the creature is living under your house, in the woodpile on your porch, digging for bugs under the garage or making a home in the shed. The good news about a skunk hanging around is that it eats termites, grubs, beetles, grasshoppers, crickets, roaches, mice, rats and other annoying pests. Of course, the bad news is that a skunk’s smell is so powerful it can be detected from as far as a mile away. - Source: Internet Mix either with water and spray or simply sprinkle powder flakes in areas you want to keep skunks away from. This irritates a skunk’s sense of smell. Citrus fruits like lemon and orange peels. Skunks do NOT like the smell of acidic citrus fruits like lemons and oranges. Bonus: your garden and house will smell super fresh! - Source: Internet You can prevent this by sealing up the underside with hardware cloth. Don’t use chicken wire. Chicken wire is only good for chickens. Other animals such as skunks, raccoons, and opossums can easily rip through it. - Source: Internet When you are learning how to get rid of skunks, it is important to make sure that skunks are causing your lawn problems in the first place. ‘You will most likely smell a skunk before you see them as they leave faint musky smells under buildings or in areas of the garden they have set up a home,’ explains Rachel Crow, garden editor for Homes \u0026 Gardens. ‘What’s more, you may see small, shallow holes in your lawn that result from the animals digging for food.’ - Source: Internet The key element to making a fence skunk proof is that it must extend into the ground. Remember skunks are diggers. Like groundhogs, they will dig under the fence to get to the goodies. - Source: Internet Let’s say a skunk or a family of skunks have found their way into your yard. Yikes! They love the cozy feel of the space beneath your porch, or maybe they rummage through your trash and eat all the cat food you’ve left out for strays. No need to fret! - Source: Internet Like all wildlife, skunks are susceptible to rabies. The skunk is one of four wild animals (besides raccoons, bats, and foxes) considered to be primary carriers of the rabies virus. Skunks have also been known to carry the bacterial disease leptospirosis. - Source: Internet According to Benny, ‘one of the best ways to keep skunks away is to install yard or garden lights. They are nocturnal and don’t like the light. To work they have to be kept on all night.’ - Source: Internet First, the bad news. According to Dickens, ’there is no way to completely eliminate them from coming into someone’s yard as skunks are foragers and constantly looking for their next meal.’ - Source: Internet Food isn’t the only thing that draws skunks to your yard. They may be seeking out a space for a cozy and quiet nest. If you have crawl space under your porch or deck, you’re basically providing them with a ready-made home. - Source: Internet ‘A great way to get rid of skunks naturally is by allowing family pets to explore the garden,’ Rachel continues. ‘Animals such as dogs scent the area and warn the skunk of a nearby predator, discouraging them from spending time on your property. Furthermore, a dog’s loud bark and boisterous activity can scare skunks away.’ - Source: Internet Many of our customers have found success placing ammonia-soaked rags around the yard to repel skunks. The intense scent of ammonia makes it seem that another, larger predator has already marked the territory. Ammonia stations are made by soaking rags in ammonia and placing them in metal containers such as baking trays, old coffee cans etc., so the ammonia won’t leak out into the ground. - Source: Internet Determine the time of day when the damage is occurring. This can easily narrow down your search for the unwanted diggers. Typically, raccoons and skunks are grub-eating, nocturnal diggers. - Source: Internet Ensure these items are kept in sealed containers in hard to access places to prevent an easy meal for skunks. Make sure garbage cans have tight-fitting lids. Skunks aren’t good climbers, so keeping garbage can openings sealed and off the ground are great deterrents. - Source: Internet Dig DeFence® products were created to provide an underground addition to fencing that would prevent dogs from digging under the fence. Bruha has taken this product and modified it into a heavier, commercial grade barrier that can be used to prevent wild animals such as coyotes, raccoons and other nuisance wildlife from digging under your fence, home, deck, shed or other vulnerable area. Dig Defence Animal Control can also be used to protect airport runways and prevent hillside erosion. - Source: Internet The notorious, foul spray of skunks can sometimes make them seem like a bigger nuisance than they really are. Not that they aren’t troublesome, but skunks will go out of their way to avoid contact with humans. Because of this, it’s not terribly difficult to learn how to keep skunks out of your yard, but actually implementing effective skunk prevention or removal can be tough. - Source: Internet First, we will be inspecting for burrows, runways, droppings, tracks, and of course - odors. We also have special cameras to inspect burrows for nests and occupants. Second, we will concentrate on how you want to proceed - to take care of the problem just this time, or for good. Last, but most important, we will start altering your building and surrounding area to make certain that skunks cannot get inside ever again; we remove skunks for good. - Source: Internet We’ve yet to meet an animal that likes the smell of citrus – which makes it a powerful tool (that’s completely harmless) in getting rid of skunks, cats, and many other animals you don’t want around your flower beds. Camden Benoit, the CEO and Founder of Sustainably Off-Grid (opens in new tab), reports success with orange and lemon peels. Admittedly, the peels have to be changed weekly to have any effect, but ‘at the end of the month, the skunks were gone, and I haven’t seen them since.’ - Source: Internet There are many ways to discourage skunks from setting up a home on your land, and many work to deter them once they have burrowed too. With so many methods using items you likely already have in your home, there is little reason to use lethal methods of removal. Here, we have explored how to get rid of skunks from your garden and beneath your property so that you can enjoy your backyard ideas in peace. - Source: Internet Now that the skunk has moved along, make sure you aren’t inadvertently attracting a new one. Trash bins with a latch will make your garbage less appealing. Also, avoid leaving leftover pet food lying around, since skunks love dog and cat food. Bird feeders can attract them as well, so it may be wise to empty those for a while. - Source: Internet However, you are more likely to smell a skunk than you are to see one. The unmistakable scent is another identifier when checking for skunks. If you find tracks, yard erosion, and that pungent odor, you can safely assume that skunks are the culprit. - Source: Internet Much like getting rid of moles , skunks are attracted to your garden for it’s bounteous food sources. One of the best ways to prevent skunks is to treat garden pests to make your yard an unfavorable location to set up a home. ‘For smaller areas, it may be worth investing in good fencing, particularly for your vegetable garden ideas .’ Rachel suggests. - Source: Internet Prevention is key to keeping skunks away. Close off any areas under your home, garage, or shed where a skunk can burrow. Always keep trash cans securely shut. Lawn maintenance, including grub prevention, will decrease skunks foraging for food. - Source: Internet To repel skunks, you’ll want to spray vinegar around your property line and hard surfaces, such as your patio, deck, and house siding. Don’t spray vinegar directly on your plants. Additionally, make sure your grass is still green afterward if you do end up spraying vinegar on your greenery. - Source: Internet Clarissa Benny, Certified Pest Control Technician at HouseGrail.com (opens in new tab), also warns that ‘skunks spray when they’re scared so you may want to steer clear of this idea.’ - Source: Internet Researching how to get rid of skunks? Our sympathies. These curious and courageous animals can become a bit of a nightmare if they take a liking to your backyard. Not only do they make a mess in a similar way to raccoons, but they are famous for spraying their sulfurous, rotten-eggs-and-onion scent if they feel threatened. So, you’ve guessed it: yelling at skunks to go away will make things worse, so you need a better strategy to drive them away. - Source: Internet Surround mulched areas with a wire mesh fence to keep skunks from tearing up your mulch. Push a metal stake into the soil at one corner of your garden, and add another stake every 24 inches along the perimeter. Unroll fine wire mesh against the stakes, and attach at the top and bottom of each stake with a zip tie. Wire mesh is small enough to prevent skunks from digging through your mulch as they search for bugs. - Source: Internet Log piles, lumber piles, and building materials can also serve as hiding places for skunks. Store these in a shed or a bin. Large bushes also provide good shelter for skunks, so you may want to trim back the branches to make them less inviting. - Source: Internet Skunks are intelligent and easy going animals. I enjoy working with them. In the big picture of wildlife getting into the garden, skunks are probably one of the easiest to deter. - Source: Internet Removing wood and rock piles from porches and patios and clearing away debris around the home helps reduce sites for skunks to establish a den. Skunks have even been known to camp out in junked cars. Get rid of bugs and rodents. These are favorite foods among skunks. If a skunk’s food source disappears, it may move on. - Source: Internet Close off spaces around your house that make possible homes for skunks – under decks, porches, and other sheltered areas. Use rocks, fencing or plywood to barricade those places. Skunks are excellent diggers and can squeeze themselves into small holes, so make sure any holes or cracks are sealed tightly. - Source: Internet Another sign is shallow, circular holes in your yard. Skunks dig perfectly circular holes in search of grubs and other larvae. You may also notice a footprint much like a cat’s, with five toes. Another clue? If your dog or neighborhood dogs are barking in the night, it could be because they’re barking at a skunk (or skunks.) - Source: Internet This should always be your first and main step, regardless of the specific animal that’s begun frequenting your backyard. We spoke to Roger Dickens, Technical Expert at Bird \u0026 Wildlife Control Rentokil (opens in new tab), explains that skunks’ preferred food is grubs in your lawn: ‘in the early spring, as ground temperatures rise and the soil becomes soft, skunks emerge from their dens and begin digging for grubs.’ - Source: Internet You may think that ammonia is used only for deep cleaning your house. Believe it or not, ammonia can also be used to repel skunks. You can place ammonia-soaked rags or cotton balls around your yard, and the smell will make the skunk flee as it is another unpleasant scent for their sensitive nose. - Source: Internet If you have a family of skunks on your property, or they’ve managed to burrow underneath your porch or outbuildings, leave it to a professional to handle. Check out our nationwide pest control finder to get connected with a wildlife pro near you in seconds. Using our partner network helps support pestpointers.com! - Source: Internet – Sold to also repel squirrels and other small animals, pepper strays are effective skunk repellents. Spray them on trees or other areas where you think skunks have been. Fox and dog urine – Foxes and dogs are skunks’ natural predators, so their urine is a natural repellent. The good news is that you don’t have to collect the urine yourself since many hardware stores sell products containing fox or dog urine. - Source: Internet The scent of spices like chili and cayenne both smell bad to skunks and bothers their sensitive noses too. The capsaicin in these peppers is the main component that infuriates a skunk’s senses, but you DON’T have to use just base stripped capsaicin. You can use the actual powders! - Source: Internet However, you likely will need to be a bit more creative in your understanding of what a food source is – skunks certainly are. Jeremy Yamaguchi of Lawn Love (opens in new tab) reminds us that skunks ‘are similar to raccoons in that they are “opportunists,” meaning that they will pretty much take advantage of anything that might benefit them in some way.’ - Source: Internet If you’re still worried about how to keep skunks away, you can easily avoid an unpleasant skunk encounter by keeping your property free from factors like grubs and other food sources that attract skunks. But if a skunk decides to move in, you can get rid of this unwelcome guest by using a safe and humane skunk repellent. However, if you feel that the skunk is acting strangely, it may have rabies, so contact your local wildlife authority for assistance. - Source: Internet ‘Skunk’s naturally timid nature means that bright lights, especially those on a motion sensor, can startle them and encourage them to move on,’ explains Rachel. What’s more, the nocturnal skunk’s eyes are sensitive, so bright lights can strain their vision, making staying in the area more unpleasant without physically harming them. Consider using floodlights in your outdoor lighting ideas to discourage a range of pests including skunks. - Source: Internet Animals require food, water, and shelter for survival. They’re hungry for worms, insects, and grubs in your yard, and they’re thirsty for the water that has collected in the bird bath out back. Consider how to manage these resources in order to manage the animals digging. - Source: Internet Skunks have claws that are perfect for digging. If you find 3- to 4-inch deep holes throughout your garden and lawn, there is a good possibility you have skunks on the hunt for grubs. These nocturnal animals are most active at night and will dig in soft soil. - Source: Internet You likely will find that any one method on its own is not very effective at keeping skunks away. Most animals are adaptable and will put up with some annoyance and discomfort if they’re interested in something in your yard. For best results, combine several remedies at once to drive them away for good. - Source: Internet You’ve done your research in learning how to keep skunks away and have done your best to keep your property a skunk-free zone. Unfortunately, the skunk has other plans. Once you realize you have a skunk camped out in your yard, you’ll need to know how to get rid of skunks. - Source: Internet If you don’t have cayenne pepper in your house, you can also use chili powder. Mix it with water, pour it into a spray bottle (glass works best), and spray it around the areas where you want to repel skunks. This should be just as effective as cayenne pepper. - Source: Internet From what I see, skunks feed nocturnally so they’re gonna be out at night. That’s why I’m usually doing this just right before it’s late in the evening. And hopefully the stunt will not come back tonight or early tomorrow morning because every single time that I’ve seen the skunk it has been out early in the morning or late at night. - Source: Internet Skunks are found all over the U.S. and might be most recognizable by their musky odor, second only to their black and white coloring. There are a dozen species of skunks, but the most common is the striped skunk. - Source: Internet Skunks do not like emitting their spray just as much as we do not like getting sprayed by it. Their glands take over a week to refill, so they’d rather not waste it if they don’t need to. Baby skunks can spray as young as one month old but only do so if scared or threatened. - Source: Internet The video below shows a skunk raiding a hive. The skunk catches one bee at a time so it doesn’t make a big impact on the population. I find it humorous that the videographer keeps saying the skunk doesn’t know he’s there because they don’t see well. That’s true, but skunks smell quite well! - Source: Internet Benny advises that skunks don’t like water, ‘so a good way to get rid of them is to install a motion detector sprinkler. The skunk moving through the yard will set off the sensor and turn on the sprinkler. The combination of the sound and noise should send the skunk scurrying off.’ - Source: Internet In literally, just toss them around the area and as soon as I did this, I didn’t see the skunk anymore. They were headed been about a week and a half that the orange peels were on the ground. Then as soon as I picked them up the next day, I saw the skunk digging up holes right in the next morning. - Source: Internet Following are some suggestions on where to begin your search for data on Getting Rid Of Skunks:\rYou should try to find How To Repair Skunk Damage To Lawn-related information from reputable places.

The skunk’s markings are very individualized. Photo via Ame Vanorio - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Do you have a skunk living on your property? Despite their generally gentle disposition and effectiveness at keeping down small-rodent populations, very few people want a skunk living around their house. Their famous defensive odour can pose a real hazard for dogs and small children, they wreak havoc on vegetable gardens and poultry, and they can be a rabies carrier as well. Fortunately, <strong>skunks</strong> are usually fairly easy to get rid of, even if approaching them head-on is not recommended. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>. These will affect a skunk’s fur, which they do not like to get oil on. Chilli and cayenne pepper. Mix either with water and spray or simply sprinkle powder flakes in areas you want to keep <strong>skunks</strong> away from. This irritates a skunk’s sense of smell. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another way to keep <strong>skunks</strong> off your property is a motion-activated security light. Skunks are nocturnal, and shun bright light, so an unexpected blast from a floodlight is likely to send them scampering. You can also try to eliminate habitats they find appealing by filling in holes and clearing away overgrown brush and woodpiles. Ultimately, <strong>skunks</strong>, like most animals, are going to take up residence in the area most convenient to them. A few simple steps should be enough to make sure that residence isn’t yours. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some gardeners will tell you to put citrus peels around to deter <strong>skunks</strong>. I’m here to tell you that technique doesn’t work. My baby <strong>skunks</strong> love citrus fruit. If it’s a fruit – any fruit – they eat it! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This spray is biodegradable, and it will not hurt the skunk or your garden and plants. It has a base scent of putrescent whole egg solids, cloves, and garlic oil (all smells that <strong>skunks</strong> hate.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The first step in knowing how to keep <strong>skunks</strong> away is understanding how you get <strong>skunks</strong> in your yard. For starters, <strong>skunks</strong> will forage for food in your garbage cans and trash bags so moving them into the garage or locking them up will help keep <strong>skunks</strong> at bay. Additionally, <strong>skunks</strong> love to forage for food (especially grubs) and are attracted by freshly planted yards or freshly laid sod as this makes it easier for them to dig. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can use predator urine such as American Heritage Industries Red Fox Urine and spread it around your garden. This will help scare away <strong>skunks</strong>. These products, as strange as they may sound, are easily available online or in wildlife stores! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>– Foxes and dogs are <strong>skunks</strong>’ natural predators, so their urine is a natural repellent. The good news is that you don’t have to collect the urine yourself since many hardware stores sell products containing fox or dog urine. Citrus Peels – Orange and lemon peels have natural repellent qualities. Scatter them around your yard and under your deck or porch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The acid produced from citrus fruits repels <strong>skunks</strong> because it is a scent that they do not find pleasant. It makes for a fantastic natural deterrent. You can make your own remedy which consists of using fruits such as lemons and oranges to ward away <strong>skunks</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sometimes getting rid of <strong>skunks</strong> takes more than the options listed above. If you’re unsuccessful in keeping <strong>skunks</strong> away, contact a pest company. If the skunk is behaving irregularly or erratically, contact your local wildlife authority. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Skunks also like to use underground dens for resting, hiding, giving birth, and rearing their young. And while <strong>skunks</strong> can and will dig their own burrows, they will generally move into abandoned burrows dug by squirrels, foxes, or coyotes. And it’s worth noting that <strong>skunks</strong> like to make their dens under porches and other dark, low spaces – so blocking off these areas will help keep <strong>skunks</strong> away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Patch holes around your foundation. Skunks are great diggers. If you&rsquo;re using fencing or mesh to close off certain areas, bury the material at least one and a half to two feet down. It&rsquo;s important to make sure <strong>skunks</strong> are outside before you seal up access points, or you may end up with animals trapped under or inside your house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best way to protect your plants from <strong>skunks</strong> is to have a good garden fence. You can use several types of fences specifically for <strong>skunks</strong>. You might also use a one-type-fits-all model that blocks out a variety of garden trespassers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Examine tracks, burrows, or nests. This is also a great way to identify <strong>digging</strong> or burrowing animals. The presence of tracks leading to a burrow, the shape of the burrow’s entrance, and nearby odor can all help differentiate between the diggers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Solar Ultrasonic Animal Repellent – This solar-powered skunk deterrent offers a humane way of getting rid of pests. The ultrasonic sounds create an unpleasant living environment for the <strong>skunks</strong>. The device is quiet, as its frequency is so high it’s undetectable to a human ear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>They sound like a real pest, but <strong>skunks</strong> do have benefits in the garden. They eat a number of damaging bugs. Japanese beetle larvae are a favorite snack. They will also eat cutworms, hornworms, yellow jackets, and cabbage worms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We often smell a skunk before we see it. The odor that comes from a skunk is both unpleasant and unmistakable. And if you’re trying to sell your house or moving into a new one, you’ll really need to know how to keep <strong>skunks</strong> away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Along the same lines, I have heard that castor oil or oils that contain capsaicin repel <strong>skunks</strong>. I haven’t tested this strategy so you may have to experiment. The theory is that the smell messes with the skunk’s ability to sniff out its dinner, so it will leave. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Skunks take pride in their beautiful white and black fur. They do not like to get it oily, so another effective scent is to spray your grass with vegetable oil. Both the scent of the oils and its texture will ward away any <strong>skunks</strong> who want to keep their fur silky and smooth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Spring is skunk breeding season! By summer, most <strong>skunks</strong> have had their kittens, and are really raising a stink. Skunks can become a nuisance when they decide to live under a structure or spray the family pet. Skunks around your structure can also enter your house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You may have cleaned your best bbq and made sure you&rsquo;ve removed pet bowls and have shut your trash cans, but if you don&rsquo;t wash out your recycling properly, you&rsquo;ll still be seeing <strong>skunks</strong> around, attracted by the smell of those leftovers. There are other great reasons to wash out your recycling (this increases the chance it&rsquo;ll actually get recycled, for one). But smelly recycling will attract <strong>skunks</strong>, raccoons, and rats (yikes). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Mother <strong>skunks</strong> have been observed teaching their children to scratch at the entrance of the beehive. When the guard bees come out to investigate, the <strong>skunks</strong> eat them. The <strong>skunks</strong> do this at night because the bees that leave the hive are at a disadvantage. Bees don’t navigate well at night. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We can eliminate or reduce these wildlife attracting smells. We can trap <strong>skunks</strong> and other critters for you all year long, but that will not solve your problem. What good does it do to continuously remove an overabundant, automatically replenishing commodity? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Skunks love dog and cat food. They also enjoy feeding on the roaches and other bugs that pet food attracts. If you have outdoor pets, feed them during the day, and then remove any uneaten food before evening, when <strong>skunks</strong> are most active. Store bird and pet food in an outdoor storage building or in your garage. Ensure these items are kept in sealed containers in hard to access places to prevent an easy meal for <strong>skunks</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>– Soak rags in ammonia and place them under your deck or porch to deter <strong>skunks</strong>. Pepper sprays – Sold to also repel squirrels and other small animals, pepper strays are effective skunk repellents. Spray them on trees or other areas where you think <strong>skunks</strong> have been. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A skunk’s odor is unmistakable regardless of whether the creature is living under your house, in the woodpile on your porch, <strong>digging</strong> for bugs under the garage or making a home in the shed. The good news about a skunk hanging around is that it eats termites, grubs, beetles, grasshoppers, crickets, roaches, mice, rats and other annoying pests. Of course, the bad news is that a skunk’s smell is so powerful it can be detected from as far as a mile away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Mix either with water and spray or simply sprinkle powder flakes in areas you want to keep <strong>skunks</strong> away from. This irritates a skunk’s sense of smell. Citrus fruits like lemon and orange peels. Skunks do NOT like the smell of acidic citrus fruits like lemons and oranges. Bonus: your garden and house will smell super fresh! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can prevent this by sealing up the underside with hardware cloth. Don’t use chicken wire. Chicken wire is only good for chickens. Other animals such as <strong>skunks</strong>, raccoons, and opossums can easily rip through it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you are learning how to get rid of <strong>skunks</strong>, it is important to make sure that <strong>skunks</strong> are causing your lawn problems in the first place. ‘You will most likely smell a skunk before you see them as they leave faint musky smells under buildings or in areas of the garden they have set up a home,’ explains Rachel Crow, garden editor for Homes & Gardens. ‘What’s more, you may see small, shallow holes in your lawn that result from the animals <strong>digging</strong> for food.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The key element to making a fence skunk proof is that it must extend into the ground. Remember <strong>skunks</strong> are diggers. Like groundhogs, they will dig under the fence to get to the goodies. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Let’s say a skunk or a family of <strong>skunks</strong> have found their way into your yard. Yikes! They love the cozy feel of the space beneath your porch, or maybe they rummage through your trash and eat all the cat food you’ve left out for strays. No need to fret! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Like all wildlife, <strong>skunks</strong> are susceptible to rabies. The skunk is one of four wild animals (besides raccoons, bats, and foxes) considered to be primary carriers of the rabies virus. Skunks have also been known to carry the bacterial disease leptospirosis. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>According to Benny, &lsquo;one of the best ways to keep <strong>skunks</strong> away is to install yard or garden lights. They are nocturnal and don&rsquo;t like the light. To work they have to be kept on all night.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>First, the bad news. According to Dickens, &rsquo;there is no way to completely eliminate them from coming into someone’s yard as <strong>skunks</strong> are foragers and constantly looking for their next meal.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Food isn&rsquo;t the only thing that draws <strong>skunks</strong> to your yard. They may be seeking out a space for a cozy and quiet nest. If you have crawl space under your porch or deck, you&rsquo;re basically providing them with a ready-made home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>‘A great way to get rid of <strong>skunks</strong> naturally is by allowing family pets to explore the garden,’ Rachel continues. ‘Animals such as dogs scent the area and warn the skunk of a nearby predator, discouraging them from spending time on your property. Furthermore, a dog’s loud bark and boisterous activity can scare <strong>skunks</strong> away.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Many of our customers have found success placing ammonia-soaked rags around the yard to repel <strong>skunks</strong>. The intense scent of ammonia makes it seem that another, larger predator has already marked the territory. Ammonia stations are made by soaking rags in ammonia and placing them in metal containers such as baking trays, old coffee cans etc., so the ammonia won’t leak out into the ground. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Determine the time of day when the damage is occurring. This can easily narrow down your search for the unwanted diggers. Typically, raccoons and <strong>skunks</strong> are grub-eating, nocturnal diggers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ensure these items are kept in sealed containers in hard to access places to prevent an easy meal for <strong>skunks</strong>. Make sure garbage cans have tight-fitting lids. Skunks aren&rsquo;t good climbers, so keeping garbage can openings sealed and off the ground are great deterrents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dig DeFence® products were created to provide an underground addition to fencing that would prevent dogs from <strong>digging</strong> under the fence. Bruha has taken this product and modified it into a heavier, commercial grade barrier that can be used to prevent wild animals such as coyotes, raccoons and other nuisance wildlife from <strong>digging</strong> under your fence, home, deck, shed or other vulnerable area. Dig Defence Animal Control can also be used to protect airport runways and prevent hillside erosion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The notorious, foul spray of <strong>skunks</strong> can sometimes make them seem like a bigger nuisance than they really are. Not that they aren’t troublesome, but <strong>skunks</strong> will go out of their way to avoid contact with humans. Because of this, it’s not terribly difficult to learn how to keep <strong>skunks</strong> out of your yard, but actually implementing effective skunk prevention or removal can be tough. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>First, we will be inspecting for burrows, runways, droppings, tracks, and of course - odors. We also have special cameras to inspect burrows for nests and occupants. Second, we will concentrate on how you want to proceed - to take care of the problem just this time, or for good. Last, but most important, we will start altering your building and surrounding area to make certain that <strong>skunks</strong> cannot get inside ever again; we remove <strong>skunks</strong> for good. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We&rsquo;ve yet to meet an animal that likes the smell of citrus – which makes it a powerful tool (that&rsquo;s completely harmless) in getting rid of <strong>skunks</strong>, cats, and many other animals you don&rsquo;t want around your flower beds. Camden Benoit, the CEO and Founder of Sustainably Off-Grid (opens in new tab), reports success with orange and lemon peels. Admittedly, the peels have to be changed weekly to have any effect, but &lsquo;at the end of the month, the <strong>skunks</strong> were gone, and I haven&rsquo;t seen them since.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are many ways to discourage <strong>skunks</strong> from setting up a home on your land, and many work to deter them once they have burrowed too. With so many methods using items you likely already have in your home, there is little reason to use lethal methods of removal. Here, we have explored how to get rid of <strong>skunks</strong> from your garden and beneath your property so that you can enjoy your backyard ideas in peace. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now that the skunk has moved along, make sure you aren’t inadvertently attracting a new one. Trash bins with a latch will make your garbage less appealing. Also, avoid leaving leftover pet food lying around, since <strong>skunks</strong> love dog and cat food. Bird feeders can attract them as well, so it may be wise to empty those for a while. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, you are more likely to smell a skunk than you are to see one. The unmistakable scent is another identifier when checking for <strong>skunks</strong>. If you find tracks, yard erosion, and that pungent odor, you can safely assume that <strong>skunks</strong> are the culprit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Much like getting rid of moles , <strong>skunks</strong> are attracted to your garden for it’s bounteous food sources. One of the best ways to prevent <strong>skunks</strong> is to treat garden pests to make your yard an unfavorable location to set up a home. ‘For smaller areas, it may be worth investing in good fencing, particularly for your vegetable garden ideas .’ Rachel suggests. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Prevention is key to keeping <strong>skunks</strong> away. Close off any areas under your home, garage, or shed where a skunk can burrow. Always keep trash cans securely shut. Lawn maintenance, including grub prevention, will decrease <strong>skunks</strong> foraging for food. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To repel <strong>skunks</strong>, you’ll want to spray vinegar around your property line and hard surfaces, such as your patio, deck, and house siding. Don’t spray vinegar directly on your plants. Additionally, make sure your grass is still green afterward if you do end up spraying vinegar on your greenery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Clarissa Benny, Certified Pest Control Technician at HouseGrail.com (opens in new tab), also warns that &lsquo;<strong>skunks</strong> spray when they&rsquo;re scared so you may want to steer clear of this idea.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Researching how to get rid of <strong>skunks</strong>? Our sympathies. These curious and courageous animals can become a bit of a nightmare if they take a liking to your backyard. Not only do they make a mess in a similar way to raccoons, but they are famous for spraying their sulfurous, rotten-eggs-and-onion scent if they feel threatened. So, you&rsquo;ve guessed it: yelling at <strong>skunks</strong> to go away will make things worse, so you need a better strategy to drive them away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Surround mulched areas with a wire mesh fence to keep <strong>skunks</strong> from tearing up your mulch. Push a metal stake into the soil at one corner of your garden, and add another stake every 24 inches along the perimeter. Unroll fine wire mesh against the stakes, and attach at the top and bottom of each stake with a zip tie. Wire mesh is small enough to prevent <strong>skunks</strong> from <strong>digging</strong> through your mulch as they search for bugs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Log piles, lumber piles, and building materials can also serve as hiding places for <strong>skunks</strong>. Store these in a shed or a bin. Large bushes also provide good shelter for <strong>skunks</strong>, so you may want to trim back the branches to make them less inviting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Skunks are intelligent and easy going animals. I enjoy working with them. In the big picture of wildlife getting into the garden, <strong>skunks</strong> are probably one of the easiest to deter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Removing wood and rock piles from porches and patios and clearing away debris around the home helps reduce sites for <strong>skunks</strong> to establish a den. Skunks have even been known to camp out in junked cars. Get rid of bugs and rodents. These are favorite foods among <strong>skunks</strong>. If a skunk’s food source disappears, it may move on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Close off spaces around your house that make possible homes for <strong>skunks</strong> – under decks, porches, and other sheltered areas. Use rocks, fencing or plywood to barricade those places. Skunks are excellent diggers and can squeeze themselves into small holes, so make sure any holes or cracks are sealed tightly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another sign is shallow, circular holes in your yard. Skunks dig perfectly circular holes in search of grubs and other larvae. You may also notice a footprint much like a cat’s, with five toes. Another clue? If your dog or neighborhood dogs are barking in the night, it could be because they’re barking at a skunk (or <strong>skunks</strong>.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This should always be your first and main step, regardless of the specific animal that&rsquo;s begun frequenting your backyard. We spoke to Roger Dickens, Technical Expert at Bird & Wildlife Control Rentokil (opens in new tab), explains that <strong>skunks</strong>&rsquo; preferred food is grubs in your lawn: &lsquo;in the early spring, as ground temperatures rise and the soil becomes soft, <strong>skunks</strong> emerge from their dens and begin <strong>digging</strong> for grubs.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You may think that ammonia is used only for deep cleaning your house. Believe it or not, ammonia can also be used to repel <strong>skunks</strong>. You can place ammonia-soaked rags or cotton balls around your yard, and the smell will make the skunk flee as it is another unpleasant scent for their sensitive nose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you have a family of <strong>skunks</strong> on your property, or they’ve managed to burrow underneath your porch or outbuildings, leave it to a professional to handle. Check out our nationwide pest control finder to get connected with a wildlife pro near you in seconds. Using our partner network helps support pestpointers.com! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>– Sold to also repel squirrels and other small animals, pepper strays are effective skunk repellents. Spray them on trees or other areas where you think <strong>skunks</strong> have been. Fox and dog urine – Foxes and dogs are <strong>skunks</strong>’ natural predators, so their urine is a natural repellent. The good news is that you don’t have to collect the urine yourself since many hardware stores sell products containing fox or dog urine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The scent of spices like chili and cayenne both smell bad to <strong>skunks</strong> and bothers their sensitive noses too. The capsaicin in these peppers is the main component that infuriates a skunk’s senses, but you DON’T have to use just base stripped capsaicin. You can use the actual powders! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, you likely will need to be a bit more creative in your understanding of what a food source is – <strong>skunks</strong> certainly are. Jeremy Yamaguchi of Lawn Love (opens in new tab) reminds us that <strong>skunks</strong> &lsquo;are similar to raccoons in that they are “opportunists,” meaning that they will pretty much take advantage of anything that might benefit them in some way.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re still worried about how to keep <strong>skunks</strong> away, you can easily avoid an unpleasant skunk encounter by keeping your property free from factors like grubs and other food sources that attract <strong>skunks</strong>. But if a skunk decides to move in, you can get rid of this unwelcome guest by using a safe and humane skunk repellent. However, if you feel that the skunk is acting strangely, it may have rabies, so contact your local wildlife authority for assistance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>‘Skunk’s naturally timid nature means that bright lights, especially those on a motion sensor, can startle them and encourage them to move on,’ explains Rachel.
