The last one is a piece of leather that is usable to sit on or to start fire on so that I can transport this to a bigger pile of wood. I used the TLH as a platform on my upper-leg to sharpen the axe on. This prevents the axe cutting me by accident and protects my pants. It has a little leather rope so I can tie it around my leg to secure it. - Source: Internet But the best thing for working with the axe is the finger notch below the head. I can get a good grip on the head because of this and work very precise and safe. For creating the spoon I don’t really need a knife except for the part that holds the fluid, then I use my Morakniv Carving Hook knife. That the notch of the axehead protects the fingers is positive for the safety too. - Source: Internet The Hultafors Åby Forest Axe has an axehead that weights 700 grams and an handle that measures 61 cm. In total I weighted the Hultafors Åby Forest Axe at 1091 grams on my precise scale. The axe comes in a nice box and has a good leather sheet that protects the sharp edge of the axe. And you and me or the backpack during transport of the axe. - Source: Internet The axehead is – as mentioned above already – made from Swedish steel. Hultafors does not state the hardness (Rockwell) of the head. In practice I have noticed that is pretty hard and that the Åby holds it’s sharpness really well. But in due time every edge will get blunt and then sharpening is necessary. - Source: Internet In the video you are able to see how the axe is made. If you ever have the change: visit a working commercial forge. The noise, the smell. Man and machine working perfectly together as a well choreographed ballet. It will make you understand that forging is a craft and that these axes are more expensive than the ones that pop out of a fully automated ‘factory’. - Source: Internet It took me about 15 minutes to fell the 40 cm stem. See the video! The punch that is delivered by the combination of 700 grams Swedish steel axehead and the 61 cm American Hickory linseed oil treated handle is more than capable. This was for me the first time that I felled a tree that big and it is an experience I think everybody should have. But only after permission or on your own land! - Source: Internet The Gransfors Bruks Small Forest Axe is Swedish quality and craftsmanship. This axe is very well made and functional. Great for any job. - Source: Internet In the two years that I have been using the Hultafors Åby Forest Axe, I’ve done a lot of stuff with it. Because of the relative light axehead I did not expect the axe to be a really good axe for felling trees. But the axe has proven me wrong. In Sweden – on holiday again – I chopped some small Birch trees for spoon making – more on this later – and at the Jannesland Campsite I was allowed by the Dutch owner to fell a nice big tree that had to go anyway. - Source: Internet The rear of the axehead is flat with slight round edges. Thanks to the weight and the long handle it has proven to be practical whenever I needed to hammer a wedge in log. And also on the campsite with pitching tents. Be careful thought with aluminium pegs: the impact of the axehead is quite severe. - Source: Internet Hultafors Åby Forest Axe in short The Åby Forest Axe is the perfect mix between a small hatchet with a light axehead and a bigger, heavier axe for serious felling and chopping. It is comfortable, precise, easy to sharpen, well balanced and very multifunctional. Design 9.2 - Source: Internet At home I have quite a few axes. It started a long time ago with a regular cheapie from the hardware DIY store. The kind of axe that does a job but doesn’t do anything well except being cheap. My knowledge of axes changed when I visited on holiday a Scandinavian Outdoor shop and I was introduced to the axes of Gränsfors Bruk. I bought the small Gränsfors Wildlife Hatchet and since that day I am hooked on handcrafted axes. - Source: Internet So I felled a tree, but that is not what I use an axe for normally. In The Netherlands we are not allowed to cut anything in a forrest that is still living and even with fallen dead wood you often need permission. On the places that I have permission or on holidays in the Nordics I use an axe to chop wood that has fallen to the ground already. Mostly wood that we need for starting a campfire. And in this the Hultafors Åby Forest Axe is superduper too. - Source: Internet The sharpening of the Åby Forest Axe is pretty easy with both accessories. The alloy of the axe is hard but sharpening friendly. If you want to learn more on this: watch the video I made on Sharpening an axe. - Source: Internet The Gransfors Small Forest Axe arrives razor sharp right out of the box and will stay that way even after cutting limbs and chopping trees. Easily splits firewood and is small and light enough to be carried in a small backpack or on your belt. If you want one camping and bushcraft axe to do it all, this is it. - Source: Internet The axehead is made from Swedish steel at Hults Bruk. Hults Bruk is the name of the village where the Hultafors axes are made in de Hults Bruk forge. In the year that I started the review, me and my family passed the forge – dating back to 1697! – on our way back home. Since I am a journalist I am curious and bold enough to stop at the factory to see how the axe that I am reviewing is made. And although it was holiday there too, they welcomed me very friendly and all four of us got the tour. - Source: Internet What I do like about the Hultafors Åby Forest Axe is the shape of the axehead and the handle. The head is slim and the cutting edge is quite straight. Because of this the head is useable as a chisel too. Changing the round branche shape in to a flat shape as a basis for a spoon is easy. - Source: Internet Following are some suggestions on where to begin your search for data on Hultafors Åby Forest Ax Review:\rYou should try to find Gränsfors Bruk Small Forest Ax (420)-related information from reputable places.
