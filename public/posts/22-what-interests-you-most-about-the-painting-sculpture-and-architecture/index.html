Collaborating can be useful in many art jobs because it allows you to incorporate other artists’ styles and ideas into your work and, on projects like murals or large sculptures, can improve efficiency. In your answer, describe a time you worked successfully with another artist. If you haven’t worked directly with other artists, you can explain how you’d share duties and how you might inspire one another’s creative process. - Source: Internet Roman panel and fresco paintings survived in greater number than Greek paintings. The 1748 excavation of Pompeii, a Roman city that was buried almost instantaneously in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE, led to the groundbreaking discovery of many relatively well-preserved frescos in noted Roman residences, including the House of the Vettii, the Villa of Mysteries, and the House of the Tragic Poet. Fresco paintings brought a sense of light, space, and color into interiors that, lacking windows, were often dark and cramped. Preferred subjects included mythological accounts, tales from the Trojan war, historical accounts, religious rituals, erotic scenes, landscapes, and still lifes. Additionally, walls were sometimes painted to resemble brightly colored marble or alabaster panels, enhanced by illusionary beams or cornices. - Source: Internet Despite the splintering of the empire, great wealth led to royal patronage of the arts, particularly in sculpture, painting, and architecture. Alexander the Great’s official sculptor had been Lysippus who, working in bronze after Alexander’s death, created works that marked a transition from the Classical to the Hellenistic style. Some of the most famous works of Greek art, including the Venus de Milo (130-100 BCE) and the Winged Victory of Samothrace (200-190 BCE) were created in the era. - Source: Internet Some of the most famous painted Roman portraits are the Fayum mummy portraits, named for the place in Egypt where they were found, that covered the faces of the mummified dead. Preserved by Egypt’s arid climate, the portraits constitute the largest surviving group of portrait panel painting from the Classical era. Most of the mummy portraits were created between the 1st century BCE and the 3rd century CE and reflect the intertwining of Roman and Egyptian traditions, during the time when Egypt was under Rome’s rule. Though idealized, the paintings display remarkably individualistic and naturalistic characteristics. - Source: Internet Scholars still debate how the Mycenaean civilization declined, and theories include invasions, internal conflict, and natural disasters. The era was followed by what has been called the Greek Dark Ages, though it is also known as the Homeric Age and the Geometric period. The term Homeric Age refers to Homer whose poems narrated the Trojan War and its aftermath. The term Geometric period refers to the era’s style of vase painting, which primarily employed geometric motifs and patterns. - Source: Internet Influenced by the Egyptians, the Greeks in the Archaic period began making life-sized sculptures, but rather than portraying pharaohs or gods, Greek sculpture largely consisted of kouroi, of which there were three types - the nude young man, the dressed and standing young woman, and a seated woman. Famous for their smiling expressions, dubbed the “Archaic smile”, the sculptures were used as funerary monuments, public memorials, and votive statues. They represented an ideal type rather than a particular individual and emphasized realistic anatomy and human movement, as New York Times art critic Alastair Macaulay wrote, “The kouros is timeless; he might be about to breathe, move, speak.” - Source: Internet Greek sculpture influenced Renaissance artists Michelangelo, Albrecht Dürer, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and the later Baroque artists, including Bernini. The discoveries at Pompeii informed the aesthetic theories of Johann Joachim Winckelmann in the 18th century and the development of Neoclassicism, as seen in Antonio Canova’s sculptures. The modern sculptor Auguste Rodin was influenced primarily by the Parthenon Marbles, of which he wrote, they “had…a rejuvenating influence, and those sensations caused me to follow Nature all the more closely in my studies.” Artists from the Futurist Umberto Boccioni, the Surrealist Salvador Dalí, and the multifaceted Pablo Picasso, to, later, Yves Klein, Sanford Biggers, and Banksy all cited Greek art as an influence. - Source: Internet While Classical Art is noted primarily for its sculpture and architecture, Greek and Roman artists made innovations in both fresco and panel painting. Most of what is known of Greek painting is ascertained primarily from painting on pottery and from Etruscan and later Roman murals, which are known to have been influenced by Greek artists and, sometimes, painted by them, as the Greeks established settlements in Southern Italy where they introduced their art. Hades Abducting Persephone (4th century BCE) in the Vergina tombs in Macedonia is a rare example of a Classical era mural painting and shows an increased realism that parallels their experiments in sculpture. - Source: Internet The Romans also revived a method of Greek glass painting to use for portraiture. Most of the images were the size of medallions or roundels cut out of a drinking vessel. Wealthy Romans would have drinking cups made with a gold glass portrait of themselves and, following the owner’s death, the portrait would be cut out in a circular shape and cemented into the catacomb walls as a tomb marker. - Source: Internet Unlike a painting, sculpture is three dimensional art, allowing you to view a piece from all angles. Whether celebrating an historic figure or created as a work of art, sculpture is all the more powerful due to its physical presence. The top famous sculptures of all time are instantly recognizable, created by artists spanning centuries and in mediums ranging from marble to metal. - Source: Internet Vase painting was a noted element of Greek art and provides the best example of how Greek painting focused primarily on portraying the human form and evolved toward increased realism. The earliest style was geometric, employing patterns influenced by Mycenaean art, but quickly turned to the human figure, similarly stylized. An “Orientalizing” period followed, as Eastern motifs, including the sphinx, were adopted to be followed by a black figure style, named for its color scheme, that used more accurate detail and figurative modeling. - Source: Internet “Pantheon” means “relating to the gods,” and scholars continue to debate whether this meant the temple was dedicated to all the gods or followed tradition in being dedicated to a specific god. Specific dedications to single gods were considered more provident since, if any mishap struck, the people would know which god had been offended and could offer sacrifices. When Agrippa first built the temple, it was part of the Agrippa complex (29-19 BCE) that also included the Baths of Agrippa and the Basilica of Neptune, and it is thought that the façade is what remains of his original structure. The building is one of the best preserved from the Imperial Roman era, as it was turned into a Christian church in the 7th century, though it has also been altered, and many of the relief sculptures of gilded bronze were melted down. - Source: Internet Additionally, the emphasis on individuality resulted in a more personalized art, and individual artists, including Phidias, Praxiteles, and Myron, became celebrated. Funerary sculpture began depicting real people (instead of idealized types) with emotional expression, while at the same time, bronze works idealized the human form, particularly the male nude. Praxiteles, though, pioneered the female nude in his Aphrodite of Knidos (4th century BCE), a work that has been referenced time and time again in the ensuing centuries. - Source: Internet Figurative sculpture was the greatest artistic innovation of the Archaic period as it emphasized realistic, though idealized, figures. Influenced by Egyptian sculpture, the Greeks transformed the frontal poses of pharaohs and other notables into works known as kouros (young men) and kore (young women), life-sized sculptures that were first developed in the Cyclades islands in the 7th century BCE. During the late Archaic period, individual sculptors, including Antenor, Kritios, and Nesiotes, were celebrated, and their names preserved for posterity. - Source: Internet century, art historical and classical tradition have been intimately entwined. While Greek and Roman sculpture and ruins are linked with the purity of white marble in the Western mind, most of the works were originally polychrome, painted in multiple, lifelike colors. 18th century excavations unearthed a number of sculptures with traces of color, but noted art historians dismissed the findings as anomalies. It was only in the late 20th century that scholars accepted that life-size statues and entire temple friezes were, in fact, brightly painted with numerous colors and decorations, raising many new questions about the assumptions of Western art history and revealing that centuries of classical imitations were not in fact imitations but rather based on nostalgic ideals of the past. - Source: Internet Along with sculpture in the round, the Greeks employed relief sculpture to decorate the entablatures of temples with extensive friezes that often depicted mythological and legendary battles and mythological scenes. Created by Phidias, the Parthenon Marbles (c. 447-438 BCE), also known as the Elgin Marbles, are the most famous examples. Created on metopes, or panels, the relief sculptures decorated the frieze lining the interior chamber of the temple and, renowned for their realism and dynamic movement, had a noted influence upon later artists, including Auguste Rodin. - Source: Internet Richly illustrated and clearly focused, this book surveys the genesis, development, and culmination of modern European/American painting, sculpture, architecture, and conceptual art from Post-Impressionism through the most recent developments in the 1990s. It avoids the typical encyclopedic approach of surveys in favor of examining selected but highly representative works in greater depth and from an enlarged spectrum of critical discourse. Organized along chronological lines, topics explore the ideas, forms, events, artists, and works with each chapter devoted to a style, movement, or decade from Cezanne, Seurat, Gauguin, and Van Gogh through Minimalism and the general reaction known as Post-Modernism. Ideal for readers with a “general” interest in art. \" - Source: Internet Studying art history is really not about memorizing dates, artists’ names, art movements, etc. Instead, it drives you to analyze paintings, photographs, sculptures, etc. To support your analysis, you must build rational and convincing arguments, hence developing your critical thinking. - Source: Internet Example: “I love collaborating with artists like dancers and musicians when I have a gallery show because these mutually beneficial projects give audience members a deeper understanding of our art. When a gallery allows it, I present many of my sculptures with accompanying performative dance and music from various genres to set the mood and tell a deeper story. Lately, I’ve been collaborating with a local dance company to create a series of sculptures based on their dancers and help create choreography to present with my pieces.” - Source: Internet Many Roman sculptures were copies of Greek originals, but their own contribution to Classical sculpture came in the form of portraiture. Emphasizing a realistic approach, the Romans felt that depicting notable men as they were, warts and all, was a sign of character. In contrast, in Imperial Rome, portraiture turned to idealistic treatments, as emperors, beginning with Augustus, wanted to create a political image, showing them as heirs of both classical Greece and Roman history. As a result, a Greco-Roman style developed in sculptural relief as seen in the Augustan Ara Pacis (13 BCE). - Source: Internet Example: “As the child of a chef, I’ve always been interested in how food can influence my art. My most recent projects use pigments from produce, herbs and edible flowers as watercolor paint. I think food waste is an important topic to discuss, so many of my pieces focus on showing the life cycle of produce and still-life paintings of people cooking real recipes with these products.” - Source: Internet Classical Art encompasses the cultures of Greece and Rome and endures as the cornerstone of Western civilization. Including innovations in painting, sculpture, decorative arts, and architecture, Classical Art pursued ideals of beauty, harmony, and proportion, even as those ideals shifted and changed over the centuries. While often employed in propagandistic ways, the human figure and the human experience of space and their relationship with the gods were central to Classical Art. - Source: Internet Following are some suggestions on where to begin your search for data on What Are Some Of The Things You Recognize In The Artwork:\rYou should try to find Why Painting Is More Functional Than Statues-related information from reputable places.

The modern sculptor Auguste Rodin was influenced primarily by the Parthenon Marbles, of which he wrote, they &ldquo;had&mldr;a rejuvenating influence, and those sensations caused me to follow Nature all the more closely in my studies.&rdquo; Artists from the Futurist Umberto Boccioni, the Surrealist Salvador Dalí, and the multifaceted Pablo Picasso, to, later, Yves Klein, Sanford Biggers, and Banksy all cited Greek art as an influence. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While Classical Art is noted primarily for its <strong>sculpture</strong> and architecture, Greek and Roman artists made innovations in both fresco and panel <strong>painting</strong>. Most of what is known of Greek <strong>painting</strong> is ascertained primarily from <strong>painting</strong> on pottery and from Etruscan and later Roman murals, which are known to have been influenced by Greek artists and, sometimes, painted by them, as the Greeks established settlements in Southern Italy where they introduced their art. Hades Abducting Persephone (4th century BCE) in the Vergina tombs in Macedonia is a rare example of a Classical era mural <strong>painting</strong> and shows an increased realism that parallels their experiments in <strong>sculpture</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Romans also revived a method of Greek glass <strong>painting</strong> to use for portraiture. Most of the images were the size of medallions or roundels cut out of a drinking vessel. Wealthy Romans would have drinking cups made with a gold glass portrait of themselves and, following the owner&rsquo;s death, the portrait would be cut out in a circular shape and cemented into the catacomb walls as a tomb marker. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Unlike a <strong>painting</strong>, <strong>sculpture</strong> is three dimensional art, allowing you to view a piece from all angles. Whether celebrating an historic figure or created as a work of art, <strong>sculpture</strong> is all the more powerful due to its physical presence. The top famous <strong>sculpture</strong>s of all time are instantly recognizable, created by artists spanning centuries and in mediums ranging from marble to metal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Vase <strong>painting</strong> was a noted element of Greek art and provides the best example of how Greek <strong>painting</strong> focused primarily on portraying the human form and evolved toward increased realism. The earliest style was geometric, employing patterns influenced by Mycenaean art, but quickly turned to the human figure, similarly stylized. An &ldquo;Orientalizing&rdquo; period followed, as Eastern motifs, including the sphinx, were adopted to be followed by a black figure style, named for its color scheme, that used more accurate detail and figurative modeling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&ldquo;Pantheon&rdquo; means &ldquo;relating to the gods,&rdquo; and scholars continue to debate whether this meant the temple was dedicated to all the gods or followed tradition in being dedicated to a specific god. Specific dedications to single gods were considered more provident since, if any mishap struck, the people would know which god had been offended and could offer sacrifices. When Agrippa first built the temple, it was part of the Agrippa complex (29-19 BCE) that also included the Baths of Agrippa and the Basilica of Neptune, and it is thought that the façade is what remains of his original structure. The building is one of the best preserved from the Imperial Roman era, as it was turned into a Christian church in the 7th century, though it has also been altered, and many of the relief <strong>sculpture</strong>s of gilded bronze were melted down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Additionally, the emphasis on individuality resulted in a more personalized art, and individual artists, including Phidias, Praxiteles, and Myron, became celebrated. Funerary <strong>sculpture</strong> began depicting real people (instead of idealized types) with emotional expression, while at the same time, bronze works idealized the human form, particularly the male nude. Praxiteles, though, pioneered the female nude in his Aphrodite of Knidos (4th century BCE), a work that has been referenced time and time again in the ensuing centuries. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Figurative <strong>sculpture</strong> was the greatest artistic innovation of the Archaic period as it emphasized realistic, though idealized, figures. Influenced by Egyptian <strong>sculpture</strong>, the Greeks transformed the frontal poses of pharaohs and other notables into works known as kouros (young men) and kore (young women), life-sized <strong>sculpture</strong>s that were first developed in the Cyclades islands in the 7th century BCE. During the late Archaic period, individual sculptors, including Antenor, Kritios, and Nesiotes, were celebrated, and their names preserved for posterity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>century, art historical and classical tradition have been intimately entwined. While Greek and Roman <strong>sculpture</strong> and ruins are linked with the purity of white marble in the Western mind, most of the works were originally polychrome, painted in multiple, lifelike colors. 18th century excavations unearthed a number of <strong>sculpture</strong>s with traces of color, but noted art historians dismissed the findings as anomalies. It was only in the late 20th century that scholars accepted that life-size statues and entire temple friezes were, in fact, brightly painted with numerous colors and decorations, raising many new questions about the assumptions of Western art history and revealing that centuries of classical imitations were not in fact imitations but rather based on nostalgic ideals of the past. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Along with <strong>sculpture</strong> in the round, the Greeks employed relief <strong>sculpture</strong> to decorate the entablatures of temples with extensive friezes that often depicted mythological and legendary battles and mythological scenes. Created by Phidias, the Parthenon Marbles (c. 447-438 BCE), also known as the Elgin Marbles, are the most famous examples. Created on metopes, or panels, the relief <strong>sculpture</strong>s decorated the frieze lining the interior chamber of the temple and, renowned for their realism and dynamic movement, had a noted influence upon later artists, including Auguste Rodin. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Richly illustrated and clearly focused, this book surveys the genesis, development, and culmination of modern European/American <strong>painting</strong>, <strong>sculpture</strong>, architecture, and conceptual art from Post-Impressionism through the most recent developments in the 1990s. It avoids the typical encyclopedic approach of surveys in favor of examining selected but highly representative works in greater depth and from an enlarged spectrum of critical discourse. Organized along chronological lines, topics explore the ideas, forms, events, artists, and works with each chapter devoted to a style, movement, or decade from Cezanne, Seurat, Gauguin, and Van Gogh through Minimalism and the general reaction known as Post-Modernism. Ideal for readers with a &ldquo;general&rdquo; interest in art. " - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Studying art history is really not about memorizing dates, artists’ names, art movements, etc. Instead, it drives you to analyze <strong>painting</strong>s, photographs, <strong>sculpture</strong>s, etc. To support your analysis, you must build rational and convincing arguments, hence developing your critical thinking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Example: &ldquo;I love collaborating with artists like dancers and musicians when I have a gallery show because these mutually beneficial projects give audience members a deeper understanding of our art. When a gallery allows it, I present many of my <strong>sculpture</strong>s with accompanying performative dance and music from various genres to set the mood and tell a deeper story. Lately, I&rsquo;ve been collaborating with a local dance company to create a series of <strong>sculpture</strong>s based on their dancers and help create choreography to present with my pieces.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Many Roman <strong>sculpture</strong>s were copies of Greek originals, but their own contribution to Classical <strong>sculpture</strong> came in the form of portraiture. Emphasizing a realistic approach, the Romans felt that depicting notable men as they were, warts and all, was a sign of character. In contrast, in Imperial Rome, portraiture turned to idealistic treatments, as emperors, beginning with Augustus, wanted to create a political image, showing them as heirs of both classical Greece and Roman history. As a result, a Greco-Roman style developed in sculptural relief as seen in the Augustan Ara Pacis (13 BCE). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Example: &ldquo;As the child of a chef, I&rsquo;ve always been interested in how food can influence my art. My most recent projects use pigments from produce, herbs and edible flowers as watercolor paint. I think food waste is an important topic to discuss, so many of my pieces focus on showing the life cycle of produce and still-life <strong>painting</strong>s of people cooking real recipes with these products.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Classical Art encompasses the cultures of Greece and Rome and endures as the cornerstone of Western civilization. Including innovations in <strong>painting</strong>, <strong>sculpture</strong>, decorative arts, and architecture, Classical Art pursued ideals of beauty, harmony, and proportion, even as those ideals shifted and changed over the centuries. While often employed in propagandistic ways, the human figure and the human experience of space and their relationship with the gods were central to Classical Art. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://static.demilked.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/today-i-learned-interesting-facts-fb73.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="What Interests You Most About The Painting Sculpture And Architecture - Name An Artist Whose Works You Really Like">
