These can concentrate light in specific spots and do not distribute evenly, which can be a problem. Indirect light fixtures that hang from the ceiling are a great solution for home <strong>office</strong>s, as are globe or pendant ceiling lights.

Task lights do what they say and give you the required light to perform specific tasks. In your home <strong>office</strong> this is likely to be reading, writing or working at a computer screen. Although task <strong>lighting</strong> is important, you should not rely on it solely as this will very quickly give you eyestrain – adding ambient <strong>lighting</strong> into the mix will soften the more focused task light. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some of the best desk lamps look more like tech products than home decor. The Simple Designs Lantern Glass Shade Desk Lamp, however, prioritizes style with its industrial-looking hardware and transparent glass shade.

But it’ll look great, and provide excellent accent <strong>lighting</strong> to any room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>LED lights are marvellous for many reasons, including their power efficiency, brightness and long life. However, in recent years there have been concerns over the detrimental effects of LED <strong>lighting</strong> on eyes, particularly when it comes to retina damage. There are also concerns that the blue light, a wavelength found in bright white LEDs, can interfere with your body’s circadian rhythm, resulting in disturbed sleep patterns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to continue embracing the sunlight in your home <strong>office</strong>, try adjusting your desk to that it runs parallel to the windows. Just be aware that if your screen is heavily backlit it can put you at risk of a headache or migraine. To save yourself an issue altogether, blinds, sheer curtains, and voile soften the intensity of sunrays whilst still letting natural light in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For example, if you have a window behind your computer, having direct sunlight shining on your screen can be very distracting and make it difficult to work comfortably. In this case, indirect <strong>lighting</strong> (such as from a desk lamp) may be more ideal.

Avoid harsh fluorescent lights. They can be hard on the eyes and may cause headaches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When formulating a home <strong>office</strong> <strong>lighting</strong> plan, you will need a combination of different light fittings to supplement the natural light you have available. Depending on your chosen location this could include desk lamps, ceiling lights, wall lights, spotlights, downlights and floor lamps. Aim for a balance of light that incorporates both ambient <strong>lighting</strong> (general or background light) and task <strong>lighting</strong> (directional light for reading and close work). A flexible <strong>lighting</strong> scheme that gives you sufficient light to work comfortably throughout the day without glare but bright enough to be able to read documents would be ideal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The wide LED head also means this lamp offers great coverage, so you can see everything across the desk. It’s highly flexible too, with a ball-joint connecting the head to the stand and two other points which can be adjusted in the stand.
