To get a very elegant and fashionable effect, classic red lips will be the perfect makeup for a green <strong>dress</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>, our eyes often adjust to see the image as darker so you are likely to see the <strong>dress</strong> as . If you see the <strong>dress</strong> in shadow, or if you think that the <strong>dress</strong> appears to be just out of the sunlight, your eyes will often pick up brighter colors. Eyes will often compensate for shadow to pick out brighter colors.

Due to this, make sure that your diamond accessories are kept simple and classic as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>‚Äì if your <strong>dress</strong> is colorful, opt for a softer nail polish shade and vice versa.

Other objects in an image or even in our line of sight help us perceive things the way they are because our brains pick up on contrasting colors much easier than similar colors.
