Leaving wood unprotected lowers the interior moisture content and allows the pores to open and accept more sealer or stain. Unfortunately, it also contributes to weathering. - Source: Internet When you’re looking for superior protection for your wood deck that won’t break the bank, this Preserva Wood stain and sealer is a great choice for both new decks and older ones. If your deck is made from porous wood like cedar, fir, or redwood, this organic oil-based stain will settle deep into the grain to protect it. You’ll be able to enjoy the look of that natural grain with this clear stain for many years, thanks to its solid shield against damage from moisture and UV rays. - Source: Internet The best deck stain for most homeowners is Arborcoat by Benjamin Moore, which is easy to apply and provides excellent protection against the elements. The brand is known for its high-quality paint, so it’s not too surprising that you’d rely on its products for your wood staining needs, too. Unlike other stains that have a limited range of colors and finishes, Arborcoat comes in thousands of colors in translucent, semi-transparent, semi-solid, and solid finishes. - Source: Internet However, with semi-transparent stains, you will need to take care with the application. Manual brushing is often the best option since spraying can result in blotching. Semi-transparent stain also beads up water, preventing moisture from penetrating the wood’s cellular structure. - Source: Internet But one aspect of cedar’s weathering process that doesn’t appeal to some homeowners is that it turns gray unevenly and looks blotchy. While this process is not apparent over small areas, it is noticeable when you are looking at wide expanses, such as siding. This effect is even more pronounced between different sides of the house, where the siding may experience sun, wind, or precipitation at different rates. - Source: Internet After 20 minutes, mop up any stain that hasn’t penetrated. To avoid spontaneous combustion, put stain-soaked rags in a sealed can filled with water. Dispose of the container at a hazardous-waste center. - Source: Internet Red cedar dust can cause breathing problems or exacerbate the condition in people who already suffer from asthma. Volatile compounds within the wood have been identified with this condition. When sawing, sanding, planing, or undertaking other activities with western red cedar, be sure to use a twin cartridge respirator, not a paper mask. - Source: Internet This clear stain from Cabot is a good option for DIYers looking to finish a deck for the first time. Cleanup is easy with a little soap and water. This is also a good way to protect other hard porous surfaces in your yard, such as brick, concrete, and stone. - Source: Internet The best deck stain and sealer will protect the wood better if it contains some solids (resins, etc) to cover and block the sun. The more solids in your deck stain, the better your protection. So this is a factor that you have to balance with your desire to have a low-maintenance deck. - Source: Internet If you’re looking for an environmentally friendly product with low volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the Defy Extreme Semi-Transparent Exterior Wood Stain fits the bill. This water-based stain is 250 VOC compliant, and it settles into the wood to create a protective shield, making it a great option for fences, siding, furniture, and other outdoor surfaces aside from your deck. Two coats of Defy create a beautiful matte finish that puts the natural wood grain on display—just prep the wood by cleaning it before you apply. If your deck has an existing layer of stain, you’ll have to strip it before applying a layer of Defy. - Source: Internet Moreover, we have to avoid a thick quantity of stains. To achieve this, you can use the stain with thinner to lessen its consistency. Also, we need to wipe out extra stains. - Source: Internet Semi-solid deck stain. This product comes in between transparent and solid deck stains. More protection than a transparent stain, and less than an opaque stain. If you go this route, give a look for Cabot Semi-Solid. There are not many choices out there as most folks go semi-transparent or full solid (and paint). - Source: Internet Jump below to the complete list with details: best deck stain and sealer. (Also, check out our page all about deck tools and other supplies.) - Source: Internet When the weather is too hot (above 90 degrees Fahrenheit) or too cold (below 40 degrees), it can affect the drying time of deck stain. Between 40 and 90 degrees is a wide range, but even more important than temperature is the humidity level. The lower the humidity, the better your stain coat will dry and cure. - Source: Internet Clear toner is great for new, high-end redwood or cedar decking, but on weatherbeaten or inexpensive decking, like this pressure-treated pine, semitransparent stain is the ticket to an upscale look. Flood TWF-Semi in Dusty Trail; flood.com - Source: Internet Solid color stains have solid particles, but not nearly as many as paint. Thus, solid color stains let some of the cedar’s grain show through, but none of the color. What you get is a very uniform opaque color. The upside is that solid color stains will block most of the damaging ultraviolet light. Plus, this type of stain is excellent at repelling water. - Source: Internet If you do decide to color your wood, there are several options. Most cedar treatments are much like house paint in that they are composed of pigments and solids. The more solids in the treatment, the longer the cedar will last. - Source: Internet Sealers for wood are meant to protect it from damage. They act as a layer of protection for your wood and include shellac, stain, oil, and paint. Additionally, they also help add depth of color to the wood and prevent the grain from rising. - Source: Internet Protection from ultraviolet rays is a huge factor when considering a cedar wood sealer or any sealer, for that matter. UV rays can affect any outdoor wooden décor; therefore, for any structures outdoor, make sure to get a sealer that provides UV protection. If not, they may cause your sealer to peel off and crack, exposing the wood. - Source: Internet Aside from clear, stains come in a variety of colors, depending on the brand.“It’s best to consider a deck color that is the same shade as your home’s trim,” Clarke says. “This will highlight your deck’s structure and character while making it stand out against the color of your house for a unified look and feel.” - Source: Internet You can safeguard wood in one of two ways: either with paint, which seals it under an opaque film, or, perhaps better, with exterior stain. The beauty of stain is that it’s easy to apply, resistant to peeling, and brings out wood’s texture or grain. But stain comes in a bewildering number of types. Some are as clear as bourbon; others are as milky as paint. Some form a film on top of the wood; others leave behind nothing but a hint of surface color. - Source: Internet We pros save an enormous amount of time by spraying the stain with a low-pressure insecticide sprayer. I take my time and protect non-decking with plastic sheets and tape and paper. This saves a large amount of time: no cleaning overspray in the end: that’s a drag. Read the list of deck tools, and just pick what you need. - Source: Internet This two-in-one stain and sealant has plenty of UV protection and stands up to heavy foot traffic. It also offers waterproofing, forming a seal that resists mold, mildew, and water damage. Plus, cleanup is easy—simply use soap and water. You’ll feel confident with the long-lasting results, especially with Olympic’s six-year warranty for decks and eight-year warranty for fences and siding. - Source: Internet This two-in-one sealer and stain seeps into the wood fibers of your deck or other exterior wood surfaces to prevent cracking, peeling, and chipping over time. The product is easy to apply because it absorbs quickly into the wood so you don’t have to worry about streaky coverage. Its oil base is free from linseed or vegetable oils, which are known algae and fungus starters in wood. The drying time is quick—it’s ready for rain in just minutes—and the result is an attractive flat finish. - Source: Internet Last but not least, this all-in-one cedar wood sealer acts as a stain to protect your exterior woodwork. It also has waterproof properties and advanced polymers that prevent it from fading. It can resist UV rays as well as mildew. It can also be used on damp or freshly cleaned wood with zero complications. Like other sealers, it also allows the grain on your structure to show. - Source: Internet Wood sealers work best through penetration. Once you put the product on to your desired surface, it gets soaked into the wood. Therefore, when it becomes stiff, it reinforces and fills the wood surface. Depending on how porous your wood is what the consistency of your cedar wood sealer is, the penetration, as a result, should be good enough. - Source: Internet These products fall into two categories: cleaners and restorers. Among the leading makers are Thompson’s, Wolman, and ZAR. Cleaners contain detergent and bleach and work best on dirt and mildew. Restorers contain oxalic acid and are ideal for removing tannin streaks and stains around nail- and screwheads in cedar and redwood decks. Both come in liquid and crystal form and cost about $15 for enough to make 5 gallons of solution (good for 750 to 1,000 square feet of deck area). - Source: Internet Waterborne acrylic stains stand up best to the sun. Oil stains penetrate deeply, even in tropical hardwoods. New, hybrid blends do both and are low in VOCs. - Source: Internet You can stain a cedar wood white and easily stain it; plus, there is no need for an extra coating of paint, and there will be no imperfections and smudges on it. So it is better to stain your wood with white color. White color can also give a good finish and is easily removable in case of transparent stain. - Source: Internet Staining a deck isn’t the most difficult of home projects, but timing it with the weather forecast can be a real chore. That issue is solved when you choose Olympic Maximum for your next exterior wood finishing project, be it your deck, siding, fence, or furniture. Its weather-ready formulation can be applied when the temperature drops to 35 degrees and when it goes as high as 120 (though we can’t imagine doing anything but plopping in a deck chair under an umbrella in that heat). This semi-transparent stain can be used on all types of wood, whether old or new, treated or untreated. Just apply one layer and your deck or other wood surfaces are rain-ready in only eight hours. - Source: Internet Make sure that your structure is dry and clean before you apply the cedar wood sealer. If you apply it to wet wood, it may not turn out ideal. Similarly, grime or dirt on the wooden surface can make it extremely hard to get an excellent final finish. Therefore, first wash the wood using your hands instead of a power washer, which may cause damage. Before you start, let it dry completely. - Source: Internet Basically it’s a lightly pigmented, semitransparent oil-based stain that contains a special bleaching agent. Once it’s brushed onto new, uncoated softwood siding, such as cedar, fir, or cypress, the surface changes to a light gray in about 6 months to a year. Recoat every 3 to 5 years. - Source: Internet Choosing from among the several hundred deck cleaners, stains, and sealers out there is less simple. You’ll also have to decide whether to do the job yourself or hire a pro. Here’s how to take the guesswork out of renewing a worn deck or protecting the one you just built. - Source: Internet Be sure to read the label on whichever deck stain you choose to see what the manufacturer suggests for dry time. Keep in mind that a deck that is dry to the touch is likely not ready to be walked on. A deck that is fully dry and ready for foot traffic may not have fully cured, which means the stain has fully seeped into the fibers of the wood to display its true color. - Source: Internet Solid-color finishes offer the most UV protection. Unfortunately, most aren’t formulated for foot traffic. If you want a solid color, look for products made expressly for deck surfaces, such as Cabot’s solid-color decking stain with Teflon. - Source: Internet Defy Wood Brightener: This is something I’ve done before and did it again this year. Lightens the wood up another shade but, more importantly, it resets the PH balance of the wood to its natural state so it accepts the stain better. - Source: Internet Due to its stability and rot-resistance, professionals use cedar wood for projects such as play structures, fences, siding, and furniture. It lasts for many years due to its durability. If exposed to direct sunlight, it can retain its natural color but only for a few months. You can prevent cedar from turning gray by using a product to create a finish on the surface that reflects UV sunlight. - Source: Internet Although weathering begins immediately with cedar, it quickly slows to a crawl. Weathering quickly progresses into the wood to about 2 mm before it slows down. But over time, the weathered portion of the wood begins to splinter or flake away, exposing fresh wood to the elements. - Source: Internet Generally, most new decks, including cedar wood deck, requires a drying time of at least thirty days before applying stain. Once the deck is dry enough, you can proceed with the staining process. It will help prevent premature aging, warping or rotting of wooden decks. - Source: Internet OK, I’ve always thought the reason you spend more money on cedar is because it’s rot resistant. Also, I prefer the look of cedar after it has weathered to a soft gray. But now that my husband and I built a new house and have 3 cedar decks, I want to make sure I protect our investment! So, please explain why it should be sealed. If I do need to seal, is there a product that is truly clear? I don’t like the look of the dark stains that I always see. Sorry if this is all stuff you’ve covered a million times… - Source: Internet Unless you particularly want untreated cedar wood, it’s best to treat it. Cedar fences should be treated once a year. Cedar’s natural oils do protect the wood, but only for a finite period. Eventually, decay will start to set in. When the cedar becomes too porous and splintery, it’s more difficult to treat effectively. - Source: Internet You can use a paint brush, foam brush, stain applicator pad, or paint roller to apply stain. Thin coats are best, and a little stain can go a long way. Be sure to work in small sections—a few feet at a time—so that you can go back and brush the stain to avoid drip marks and uneven coverage. - Source: Internet If you would like to prolong its life, the right cedar wood sealer is all you require. Even though there are several great wood sealers in the market, our pick for you would be Agra-Life TriCo Polymer Lumber Seal for its environment-friendly ingredients. However, when it comes to picking the right sealer, you should consider factors other than the environment. - Source: Internet It’s not just for decks, either; get an extra gallon or two to finish and protect fences and unpainted wood siding as well. This stain goes a long way—a gallon can cover 400 square feet of smooth boards or 200 square feet of rough fencing slats. As you apply the stain, you’ll want to wipe off an excess with a cloth to create a smooth finish. The blend of natural oils in this product results in a durable exterior that offers rich color and a superior defense against moisture. - Source: Internet But be aware that it is notoriously difficult to mimic authentic wood color with paint. If you absolutely want some type of wood appearance, paint is not a good alternative. Because of cedar’s large pores, it is necessary to prime the wood before painting it. - Source: Internet If you are someone concerned about the environmental factors when purchasing a sealer, then go for products that are least damaging to the environment and you. If a sealer or a stain is of good quality in terms of eco-friendly components, it will allow you to apply without causing skin irritation. Moreover, if your pocket allows, you can also purchase organic sealers as they come at a higher cost. - Source: Internet But one aspect is that cedar’s lovely red turns a monotonous gray surprisingly quickly. Once cedar has turned gray, there is no natural way of going back. The only alternative at this point is to tone the wood with a stain or other coloring agent. - Source: Internet From experience, I’d say that these days the top deck stain is Extreme Wood Stain from DEFY, is made in the USA and that means a lot to us. It comes in 7 shades counting clear. A very good price and easy to clean up (water-based). Definitely one of the best deck stains on the market. - Source: Internet Soft woods, like pine and cedar, easily accept any penetrating stain. But only certain kinds of seed oils, such as tung or linseed, will soak into ultradense hardwoods like ipe and mahogany. Always test these woods first to make sure the finish will penetrate and dry. - Source: Internet This semi-solid stain by Olympic deserves a medal for providing your deck with tough waterproof protection that lasts year-round. It’s made from a urethane-strengthened formula that protects the wood from cracking and peeling during the colder months. The stain can be used on a variety of wood types, including less common types like ipe. In addition to decks, this stain is also a great treatment for other exterior wood structures, including siding, fences, stair railings, and even wood patio furniture. - Source: Internet Deck finishes fall into two categories: sealers and stains. Both are formulated to seal out the elements. As their name implies, clear sealers are nonpigmented finishes. Stains are available with a little pigmentation (referred to on the label as “tone”), semitransparent, and in solid colors. Unlike paints, which form a surface film, clear and pigmented finishes penetrate the wood and can stand up to foot traffic. - Source: Internet The winter can be an especially brutal time for your deck—snow and rain sinks deep into the wood and freezes, causing the planks to split. Leave a deck untreated and it could crack and even collapse if the damage has progressed, Clarke says. “Regular staining also enhances the appearance of your wooden deck and ensures it maintains its beauty and character,” Clarke explains. - Source: Internet Waterborne resins dry faster than oils, so you can get out on your deck sooner. But greater care is required during application to prevent lap marks; brush the finish on no more than two boards at a time, and be sure to cover their lengths in one pass. Also, stains should be applied in the shade when surface temperatures are above 50 degrees. - Source: Internet Cabot Clear Wood Protector won’t change the look of your wood deck at all, keeping the wood natural. What it will do is penetrate deep into those planks to build a superior waterproof defense. Mold, mildew, and algae don’t stand a chance with Cabot. While other wax-based clear stains simply coat the outside of a wood plank, this clear exterior wood stain is water based, so the wood absorbs it easily for better protection. - Source: Internet UV radiation can also cause the natural color of the wood to fade. Consequently, it takes the coveted beauty away. For any indoor furniture, this may not be an essential factor to consider; however, your choice of the right cedar wood sealer for indoor use may still need some level of UV protection. - Source: Internet If it’s bare, chose whichever stain you want. But if it has a film finish, it’s easiest to stick with that; penetrating stains can’t go over a film. Also, water-based stains will cover oil-based ones, but not the other way around. - Source: Internet When it comes to wood, cedar is lightweight, structurally stable, and resistant to rot. Moreover, It does not split or crack easily. Additionally, its highly aromatic, rot-resistant oils make it an effective insect repellant. While we have established that cedar wood doesn’t wear and tear so easily, you can’t ignore its treatment. If you ignore upkeep and maintenance, cedar wood ages faster. - Source: Internet Even if your deck is made of pressure-treated lumber, redwood, cedar, or some other durable species, it’s at risk the moment the last nail is driven home. There are several culprits. Moisture swells the wood while the burning rays from the sun dry and shrink it, causing cracks and checks while also encouraging warping. Ultraviolet rays also discolor wood and accelerate wear by breaking down wood fibers. - Source: Internet Western Red Cedar grows to 200 to 250 feet tall and lives for very long, often centuries. One cedar tree in Idaho has even been dated back to the time of the ancient Egyptians: about 3,000 years old. With that kind of longevity, it’s no wonder that cedar works well as a long-lasting, durable building material, too. - Source: Internet Tip: Thinking of spraying it? Greenlight. I researched garden sprayers for spraying stain: this is the way to go for light stains, not solid or opaque. In another post, I selected hand pump sprayers that can handle clear, transparent and semi-transparent stains. The low-cost plastic sprayers cannot do it all. - Source: Internet If retaining the aromatic qualities of cedar in interior woodwork is not a priority, you can use a seal coat to clean the wood. You can also use a seal coat of lacquer sanding sealer or thinned varnish to smoothen the cedar if you wish to have a hard glossy surface on a window ledge or tabletop. Cedar is open to most finishes, such as penetrating oils like linseed and tung. Penetrating oils work well to seal the grain while making the wood look natural and raw. - Source: Internet The wood particles in wood-and-plastic composite decking are just as vulnerable to the sun as solid wood and will turn dingy over time. Specialized semitransparent stains for composites allow you to restore or change the color of weatherbeaten decking. These last a year or two. You can also use a standard solid-color acrylic deck finish and get 3 to 5 years of service. High-traffic areas may need more frequent attention. - Source: Internet The results? Amazing. I never thought I’d get my deck back to anything close to its original state, but this stain (and general approach) did the trick beyond my wildest dreams. Hopefully it holds up well over the winter. Next year I’ll just clean, brighten, apply more stain (without pressure washing or stripping). - Source: Internet It is an effective cedar wood sealer and is oil-based. It provides deep penetration into the wood and gives a smooth finish. Moreover, the finish it gives is odorless after drying out and not tacky at all. It allows the grains to be apparent, enhancing the wood’s natural beauty while also giving it a durable finish. - Source: Internet I’ve been using stains since my very first painting apprentice job in 1977. I’ve learned the difference and here I review the good and less good (read ‘bad’). My advice: be conservative and choose the best deck stain you can afford. - Source: Internet If you do need a touch-up, it’s easy to do with this stain without your deck’s finish looking uneven or streaky, so be sure to keep any excess on hand for when you need it. It’s also simple to re-treat your deck when you use Arborcoat as your base because it covers older, previously stained wood to create a smooth finish. You’ll likely come back to Arborcoat through the years to keep your deck looking great. - Source: Internet This all-in-one solid stain and sealer from Behr can transform the look of both new and older wood decks while also providing advanced weatherproof protection. UV rays, rain, and snow are no match against the 100%-acrylic formula. In fact, two coats of this solid stain can protect your deck for up to 10 years—and up to 25 years if you use it on fences and siding. - Source: Internet Moreover, it is better to go for a transparent stain as it is easy to apply and remove. Cedarwood staining requires a dry surface. Firstly we have to perform sanding on cedar wood; secondly, we have to stain it with our choice of color or varnish. - Source: Internet If your deck is already treated with an oil-based stain, you should use another one for the newest coat. If you use a water-based stain on top of an oil-based stain, it is likely to peel off as water-based stains don’t have the same density as their oil-based counterparts. Should you decide to switch the type of stain, you would have to sand down the entire deck, which adds a good deal of work to the project. - Source: Internet When it comes to choosing the right finish for your Western Red Cedar deck, you have a number of options. That’s because Western Red Cedar is pitch and resin-free, which means it accepts and holds a wide range of stains beautifully. It’s also a top-performing decking material that’s naturally resistant to rot, decay and insects, which means no matter what finish you decide on, your beautiful deck is going to last a long time. - Source: Internet If protecting a deck, then painting is your best option for treating cedar. Paint’s solids ward off light, and light is the main contributor to the deterioration of cedar. Lighter colors last longer since they reflect light more efficiently than darker colors. - Source: Internet It depends on the type. Those with more pigment last the longest: up to 7 years for a solid-color stain. Clear toners, which have the least amount of pigment, need to be reapplied annually. - Source: Internet Has less pigment than a solid-color stain, so it only partially obscures the wood’s grain. Leaves no surface film; can’t peel. Recoat every 2 to 4 years. - Source: Internet O’Neil favors a thick, 4- to 6-inch block stain brush, like the one here, which gives him better control than a sprayer. To prevent lap marks, work on only two or three boards or courses at a time and go from one end to the other. If spraying or rolling on the finish, always go back and brush the surface. - Source: Internet A single coat of Valspar Semi-Transparent Exterior Stain and Sealer is all it takes to build up your wood deck’s defense against the elements. This semi-transparent stain lets the beauty of the natural wood stand out while also protecting it from harmful UV rays.

The beauty of <strong>stain</strong> is that it’s easy to apply, resistant to peeling, and brings out wood’s texture or grain. But <strong>stain</strong> comes in a bewildering number of types.

It also has waterproof properties and advanced polymers that prevent it from fading. It can resist UV rays as well as mildew. It can also be used on damp or freshly cleaned wood with zero complications. Like other sealers, it also allows the grain on your structure to show. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wood sealers work best through penetration.

That issue is solved when you choose Olympic Maximum for your next exterior wood finishing project, be it your deck, siding, fence, or furniture. Its weather-ready formulation can be applied when the temperature drops to 35 degrees and when it goes as high as 120 (though we can&rsquo;t imagine doing anything but plopping in a deck chair under an umbrella in that heat). This semi-transparent <strong>stain</strong> can be used on all types of wood, whether old or new, treated or untreated. Just apply one layer and your deck or other wood surfaces are rain-ready in only eight hours. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Make sure that your structure is dry and clean before you apply the <strong>cedar</strong> wood sealer. If you apply it to wet wood, it may not turn out ideal. Similarly, grime or dirt on the wooden surface can make it extremely hard to get an excellent final finish. Therefore, first wash the wood using your hands instead of a power washer, which may cause damage. Before you start, let it dry completely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Basically it&rsquo;s a lightly pigmented, semitransparent oil-based <strong>stain</strong> that contains a special bleaching agent. Once it&rsquo;s brushed onto new, uncoated softwood siding, such as <strong>cedar</strong>, fir, or cypress, the surface changes to a light gray in about 6 months to a year. Recoat every 3 to 5 years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Choosing from among the several hundred deck cleaners, <strong>stain</strong>s, and sealers out there is less simple. You&rsquo;ll also have to decide whether to do the job yourself or hire a pro. Here&rsquo;s how to take the guesswork out of renewing a worn deck or protecting the one you just built. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Be sure to read the label on whichever deck <strong>stain</strong> you choose to see what the manufacturer suggests for dry time. Keep in mind that a deck that is dry to the touch is likely not ready to be walked on. A deck that is fully dry and ready for foot traffic may not have fully cured, which means the <strong>stain</strong> has fully seeped into the fibers of the wood to display its true color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Solid-color finishes offer the most UV protection. Unfortunately, most aren&rsquo;t formulated for foot traffic. If you want a solid color, look for products made expressly for deck surfaces, such as Cabot&rsquo;s solid-color decking <strong>stain</strong> with Teflon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=3><li>Defy Wood Brightener: This is something I&rsquo;ve done before and did it again this year.

It lasts for many years due to its durability. If exposed to direct sunlight, it can retain its natural color but only for a few months. You can prevent <strong>cedar</strong> from turning gray by using a product to create a finish on the surface that reflects UV sunlight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although weathering begins immediately with <strong>cedar</strong>, it quickly slows to a crawl. Weathering quickly progresses into the wood to about 2 mm before it slows down. But over time, the weathered portion of the wood begins to splinter or flake away, exposing fresh wood to the elements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Generally, most new decks, including <strong>cedar</strong> wood deck, requires a drying time of at least thirty days before applying <strong>stain</strong>. Once the deck is dry enough, you can proceed with the <strong>stain</strong>ing process. It will help prevent premature aging, warping or rotting of wooden decks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>OK, I&rsquo;ve always thought the reason you spend more money on <strong>cedar</strong> is because it&rsquo;s rot resistant. Also, I prefer the look of <strong>cedar</strong> after it has weathered to a soft gray. But now that my husband and I built a new house and have 3 <strong>cedar</strong> decks, I want to make sure I protect our investment! So, please explain why it should be sealed. If I do need to seal, is there a product that is truly clear? I don&rsquo;t like the look of the dark <strong>stain</strong>s that I always see. Sorry if this is all stuff you&rsquo;ve covered a million times&mldr; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Unless you particularly want untreated <strong>cedar</strong> wood, it&rsquo;s best to treat it. Cedar fences should be treated once a year. Cedar&rsquo;s natural oils do protect the wood, but only for a finite period. Eventually, decay will start to set in. When the <strong>cedar</strong> becomes too porous and splintery, it&rsquo;s more difficult to treat effectively. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can use a paint brush, foam brush, <strong>stain</strong> applicator pad, or paint roller to apply <strong>stain</strong>. Thin coats are best, and a little <strong>stain</strong> can go a long way. Be sure to work in small sections—a few feet at a time—so that you can go back and brush the <strong>stain</strong> to avoid drip marks and uneven coverage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you would like to prolong its life, the right <strong>cedar</strong> wood sealer is all you require. Even though there are several great wood sealers in the market, our pick for you would be Agra-Life TriCo Polymer Lumber Seal for its environment-friendly ingredients. However, when it comes to picking the right sealer, you should consider factors other than the environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It&rsquo;s not just for decks, either; get an extra gallon or two to finish and protect fences and unpainted wood siding as well. This <strong>stain</strong> goes a long way—a gallon can cover 400 square feet of smooth boards or 200 square feet of rough fencing slats. As you apply the <strong>stain</strong>, you&rsquo;ll want to wipe off an excess with a cloth to create a smooth finish. The blend of natural oils in this product results in a durable exterior that offers rich color and a superior defense against moisture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But be aware that it is notoriously difficult to mimic authentic wood color with paint. If you absolutely want some type of wood appearance, paint is not a good alternative. Because of <strong>cedar</strong>&rsquo;s large pores, it is necessary to prime the wood before painting it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are someone concerned about the environmental factors when purchasing a sealer, then go for products that are least damaging to the environment and you. If a sealer or a <strong>stain</strong> is of good quality in terms of eco-friendly components, it will allow you to apply without causing skin irritation. Moreover, if your pocket allows, you can also purchase organic sealers as they come at a higher cost. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But one aspect is that <strong>cedar</strong>&rsquo;s lovely red turns a monotonous gray surprisingly quickly. Once <strong>cedar</strong> has turned gray, there is no natural way of going back. The only alternative at this point is to tone the wood with a <strong>stain</strong> or other coloring agent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>From experience, I’d say that these days the top deck <strong>stain</strong> is Extreme Wood Stain from DEFY, is made in the USA and that means a lot to us. It comes in 7 shades counting clear. A very good price and easy to clean up (water-based). Definitely one of the best deck <strong>stain</strong>s on the market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Soft woods, like pine and <strong>cedar</strong>, easily accept any penetrating <strong>stain</strong>. But only certain kinds of seed oils, such as tung or linseed, will soak into ultradense hardwoods like ipe and mahogany. Always test these woods first to make sure the finish will penetrate and dry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This semi-solid <strong>stain</strong> by Olympic deserves a medal for providing your deck with tough waterproof protection that lasts year-round. It&rsquo;s made from a urethane-strengthened formula that protects the wood from cracking and peeling during the colder months. The <strong>stain</strong> can be used on a variety of wood types, including less common types like ipe. In addition to decks, this <strong>stain</strong> is also a great treatment for other exterior wood structures, including siding, fences, stair railings, and even wood patio furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Deck finishes fall into two categories: sealers and <strong>stain</strong>s. Both are formulated to seal out the elements. As their name implies, clear sealers are nonpigmented finishes. Stains are available with a little pigmentation (referred to on the label as &ldquo;tone&rdquo;), semitransparent, and in solid colors. Unlike paints, which form a surface film, clear and pigmented finishes penetrate the wood and can stand up to foot traffic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The winter can be an especially brutal time for your deck—snow and rain sinks deep into the wood and freezes, causing the planks to split. Leave a deck untreated and it could crack and even collapse if the damage has progressed, Clarke says. &ldquo;Regular <strong>stain</strong>ing also enhances the appearance of your wooden deck and ensures it maintains its beauty and character,&rdquo; Clarke explains. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Waterborne resins dry faster than oils, so you can get out on your deck sooner. But greater care is required during application to prevent lap marks; brush the finish on no more than two boards at a time, and be sure to cover their lengths in one pass. Also, <strong>stain</strong>s should be applied in the shade when surface temperatures are above 50 degrees. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cabot Clear Wood Protector won&rsquo;t change the look of your wood deck at all, keeping the wood natural. What it will do is penetrate deep into those planks to build a superior waterproof defense. Mold, mildew, and algae don&rsquo;t stand a chance with Cabot. While other wax-based clear <strong>stain</strong>s simply coat the outside of a wood plank, this clear exterior wood <strong>stain</strong> is water based, so the wood absorbs it easily for better protection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>UV radiation can also cause the natural color of the wood to fade. Consequently, it takes the coveted beauty away. For any indoor furniture, this may not be an essential factor to consider; however, your choice of the right <strong>cedar</strong> wood sealer for indoor use may still need some level of UV protection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If it&rsquo;s bare, chose whichever <strong>stain</strong> you want. But if it has a film finish, it&rsquo;s easiest to stick with that; penetrating <strong>stain</strong>s can&rsquo;t go over a film. Also, water-based <strong>stain</strong>s will cover oil-based ones, but not the other way around. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to wood, <strong>cedar</strong> is lightweight, structurally stable, and resistant to rot. Moreover, It does not split or crack easily. Additionally, its highly aromatic, rot-resistant oils make it an effective insect repellant. While we have established that <strong>cedar</strong> wood doesn’t wear and tear so easily, you can’t ignore its treatment. If you ignore upkeep and maintenance, <strong>cedar</strong> wood ages faster. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Even if your deck is made of pressure-treated lumber, redwood, <strong>cedar</strong>, or some other durable species, it&rsquo;s at risk the moment the last nail is driven home. There are several culprits. Moisture swells the wood while the burning rays from the sun dry and shrink it, causing cracks and checks while also encouraging warping. Ultraviolet rays also discolor wood and accelerate wear by breaking down wood fibers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Western Red Cedar grows to 200 to 250 feet tall and lives for very long, often centuries. One <strong>cedar</strong> tree in Idaho has even been dated back to the time of the ancient Egyptians: about 3,000 years old. With that kind of longevity, it&rsquo;s no wonder that <strong>cedar</strong> works well as a long-lasting, durable building material, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Tip: Thinking of spraying it? Greenlight. I researched garden sprayers for spraying <strong>stain</strong>: this is the way to go for light <strong>stain</strong>s, not solid or opaque. In another post, I selected hand pump sprayers that can handle clear, transparent and semi-transparent <strong>stain</strong>s. The low-cost plastic sprayers cannot do it all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If retaining the aromatic qualities of <strong>cedar</strong> in interior woodwork is not a priority, you can use a seal coat to clean the wood. You can also use a seal coat of lacquer sanding sealer or thinned varnish to smoothen the <strong>cedar</strong> if you wish to have a hard glossy surface on a window ledge or tabletop. Cedar is open to most finishes, such as penetrating oils like linseed and tung. Penetrating oils work well to seal the grain while making the wood look natural and raw. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The wood particles in wood-and-plastic composite decking are just as vulnerable to the sun as solid wood and will turn dingy over time. Specialized semitransparent <strong>stain</strong>s for composites allow you to restore or change the color of weatherbeaten decking. These last a year or two. You can also use a standard solid-color acrylic deck finish and get 3 to 5 years of service. High-traffic areas may need more frequent attention. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The results? Amazing. I never thought I&rsquo;d get my deck back to anything close to its original state, but this <strong>stain</strong> (and general approach) did the trick beyond my wildest dreams.

If you use a water-based <strong>stain</strong> on top of an oil-based <strong>stain</strong>, it is likely to peel off as water-based <strong>stain</strong>s don&rsquo;t have the same density as their oil-based counterparts. Should you decide to switch the type of <strong>stain</strong>, you would have to sand down the entire deck, which adds a good deal of work to the project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to choosing the right finish for your Western Red Cedar deck, you have a number of options. That’s because Western Red Cedar is pitch and resin-free, which means it accepts and holds a wide range of <strong>stain</strong>s beautifully.

No need to worry about what type of wood you have either—Ready Seal is appropriate to use on all soft and hard woods. Just make sure the wood has completely dried after washing or a rainstorm since the <strong>stain</strong> shouldn&rsquo;t be used on wood that has more than a 12% moisture content. When it&rsquo;s time to apply a fresh coat, there&rsquo;s no sanding or stripping needed, making deck maintenance a breeze. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://www.midsouthsealandstain.com/nashville/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nashville-stained-fence.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Best Clear Stain For Cedar Deck - All About Exterior Stain">
