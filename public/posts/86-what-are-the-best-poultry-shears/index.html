He is a product developer specializing in sun protective clothing and backpacking equipment but has also focused on human-centered design with composites and household items. He has spent the past three years using fabric shears while sewing up prototype apparel and bags, helping him understand the importance of a comfortable pair of sharp shears. It is no different in the kitchen or around the house when you need something cut or opened. Kitchen shears are convenient and make quick work without getting out a big knife or cutting board, and should cut right through anything, not hurting your hands in the process. - Source: Internet ✔ HEAVY-DUTY CONSTRUCTION: With 9.6 Inch long, 3.5mm blade thickness, engineered for perfection and built to last a lifetime, our high-quality stainless steel kitchen shears are strong, durable, rust-resistant. - Source: Internet The edges of the blades comprise of fine serrations that grip and cut the flesh right apart, without causing a nasty mess. These ultra-sharp blades measure 4.5” in length with a double-beveling and an ergonomic design. This is what accounts for precision-cutting and accurate measures of the shears when it comes to portions. - Source: Internet But again, if the OXO kitchen scissors are sold out or if you can’t find them anywhere, the Kai Kitchen Scissors are our runner-up choice. In our kitchen shears tests, the more-expensive pair performed as well as the OXO kitchen scissors, with a similar single serrated blade but a more squared off look. However, they’re not as readily available and don’t come with OXO’s guarantee. They’re a good choice if you can’t find the OXO scissors, but you likely won’t have that problem. - Source: Internet Poultry shears are essentially scissors. When breaking down a chicken, duck, or goose you’ll want to target joints where two bones intersect. Shears can also cut cleanly through the breast bone both for spatchcocking or for disassembling a chicken into bucket pieces. - Source: Internet We don’t like our hands cramping after cutting for long periods, and we are guessing you don’t either, so we made handle comfort equally weighted with ease of cleaning. On top of all the cutting for the sharpness test, we also cut three feet of cardboard to test heavy use on a resistant material. After all that cutting, the OXO Good Grips Multi-Purpose Scissors had the softest and most comfortable handles. The handle has silicone stretched over it, giving the shears a nice squish when closed. The KitchenAid All Purpose Shears come in next with a much firmer but more ergonomic handle. - Source: Internet If you’re looking for a solid pair of multipurpose kitchen shears (with comfortable handles) that do more than just snip, these Zwilling Henckels take-apart kitchen shears are among the most sturdy heavy-duty kitchen scissors we’ve used. The 3\" stainless-steel blades are high-quality, corrosion-resistant, and micro-serrated for easier, more efficient cutting. These shears can also replace several of your kitchen gadgets in a pinch; that jagged-toothed section of the handle can be used as a bottle opener or nutcracker. Can your knife do that? But mostly, we like that the blades come apart, which makes for easy cleaning after dispatching raw poultry. Hand-washing is recommended. - Source: Internet That’s where poultry shears come in. A cut above your standard kitchen scissors, these clippers are designed to slice through bird carcasses both big and small, from the smallest of spatchcocks to the fattest of turkeys. Unfortunately, some of the shears on the market are about as useful as those plastic scissors your toddler has. - Source: Internet Besides, the kitchen assistance from TANSUNG is produced by a high standard of CNC technology to represent premium quality and delicate design. Specifically, the stainless steel blades are ultra-sharp and strong for heavy-duty poultry cutting effortlessly. Further, there is no rust or corrosion during use. - Source: Internet These poultry shears are designed to handle different kinds of food. For example, the front part of the scissors where the blades ‘meet’ continuously is meant to cut meat. It is important to note that in order to cut meat perfectly, you use only the front part of the scissors and not the rear part with the groove, which is designed specially to cut bones. It is important to note that these poultry shears do not cut through skin. - Source: Internet Straightforward and practical, these poultry shears feature a tough-as-nails 3.5-inch serrated steel blade and a specially designed handle that will see you break down any bird with ease. The shears are spring-loaded so you get maximum slicing force with minimal effort. The locking mechanism is easy to engage and disengage (and doesn’t get in the way), so you can go to town on that chicken safely. - Source: Internet Just like a Swiss Army Knife, this pair of poultry shears packs several tools into one seamless design. You can cut through bones in a cinch, chop up veggies, peel fruits, scrape fish scales and even open a beer. Crafted from the same stainless steel as most high-quality chef knives, the blade is not only supremely sharp but also resistant to rusting and corrosion. The heavy-duty scissors have a large textured handgrip to keep your hand secure while cutting. Plus, you can detach the blade to clean thoroughly. - Source: Internet You should make sure that whatever you choose is comfortable and easy to use. The handles and handle loops of the shears should comfortably accommodate your fingers. Soft-grip coatings will prevent strains and undue pressure on your finger. Also, go for a pair that will allow ambidextrous use easily. - Source: Internet No other scissors cut through as many different materials as well as the Kai shears, with no tears, hanging threads, or divots. They’re the best scissors on the market for cutting through any random object you decide you want to trim—the perfect all-around scissor. Your biggest problem is going to be preventing family members, roommates, and dates you’re trying to impress from absconding with your perfect scissors. - Source: Internet These all-steel poultry shears are stylish, versatile and super sharp. The ergonomic handle is suitable for left- and right-handed people and is slip-proof thanks to a “grasp and hold” design. But what really sets this pair of scissors apart is the ingenious two-in-one blade design that allows you to complete two of the most essential tasks relating to poultry: snip and trim through skin and cleave through bone. They’re also extremely hygienic, as there is no chance of bacteria sticking to the stainless steel. - Source: Internet A set of poultry shears typically looks a lot like a pair of scissors, although the shears generally look and feel heavier. The ideal material for these shears is carbon steel, which holds an edge well and remains extremely durable, although it is also possible to find shears made from stainless metal. Depending on the design, the shears may be solid molded, or handles in materials like plastic may be attached. It is also not uncommon to find serrations or notches on one blade to grip the meat while it is cut. - Source: Internet We love how easy it is to clean the shears. In fact, the blades separate easily to aid thorough cleaning. You can adjust the interlocking screw of the shears for the desired preferences. - Source: Internet Serrated blades will provide you with a better grip any day over a straight-edged knife. And if the shears are sufficiently durable, these could cut through bones and tendons effortlessly. The serrations also provide a non-slip, safe grip during use. - Source: Internet How about you? Which is your ideal poultry shear? Hopefully, my review will help you choose the best one that meets your demand. If you like this post, please give it a thumbs up or share it with others. Thank you! - Source: Internet 10/18/12 Update…Still going strong after several years. Blades have remained sharp and all the parts (handle, spring, the latch that keeps shears closed when not in use)are in really good shape. - Source: Internet In our tests, they sliced easily through materials as varied as marshmallows, parchment paper, and clamshell packaging. One micro-serrated edge keeps a hold on slippery meats and seafood, and the blades come apart for easy cleaning. The handles are large enough to accommodate most hands, and they have a bit of cushioning for comfort, although that didn’t make much of a difference in our tests. Finally, OXO’s satisfaction guarantee gave these a leg up on shears that performed similarly. - Source: Internet This delivers a super-clean cut of accurate proportions. We absolutely loved the kind of precision cutting that these shears offered for separating flesh from joints or cutting them altogether. These could even cut through tendons, and the bone notch on the tool can be used for small poultry bones as well. - Source: Internet When it comes to buying the best poultry shears, you should know some fundamental factors that highlight kitchen utensils. Otherwise, you might find it hard to choose the best one or waste your money on an invaluable product. Hence, below are four essential things you should consider when opting for the best poultry shears. - Source: Internet To maintain the sharpness of the blades, it is recommended to store the poultry shears in a knife block, cover it with a sheath, or put it in a drawer separate from other utensils. These poultry shears measure 9.35 inches long by 3.94 inches wide. - Source: Internet But “regular” all-around scissors aren’t always best for everything. If you’re looking for a pair of snips to keep in the kitchen, OXO Good Grips Kitchen and Herb Scissors is the best pair because it combines sharp, take-apart blades, a micro-serrated blade for gripping slippery raw meats, roomy handles, and a great warranty. These snip raw poultry and fresh herbs swiftly and cleanly—unlike some other models that let things slide. - Source: Internet Just like a Swiss Army Knife, this pair of poultry shears packs several tools into one seamless design. You can cut through bones in a cinch, chop up veggies, peel fruits, scrape fish scales and even open a beer. Crafted from the same stainless steel as most high-quality chef knives, the blade is not only supremely sharp but also resistant to rusting and corrosion. The heavy-duty shears have a large textured handgrip to keep your hand secure while cutting. Plus, you can detach the blade to clean thoroughly. - Source: Internet Poultry shears are good for much more than breaking down a chicken into pieces. You can also use the shears to debone chicken thighs, section wings, and trim fat off for deep frying. Poultry shears are an all-around useful kitchen tool – one of the few essentials that Sous Vide Guy recommends every chef has on hand. They can also serve a bit of double duty for processing herbs and some vegetables as well. - Source: Internet For thorough and safe cleaning, the detaching mode allows you to safely separate the blades with ease. The large-sized, non-slip grips offer more room for your fingers to rest when holding, making them easy to use. These poultry shears are also ideal for cutting fish and have a bottle opener built into the handle. - Source: Internet Additionally, its professional and stylish design will surely meet your needs. Indeed, the entire structure is sturdy and durable because of the top-grade stainless steel material. As a result, you no longer deal with rust or corrosion problems like other regular poultry shears. Plus, the handles also provide you with pleasant and non-slippery control. - Source: Internet The upper blade of these shears, we noticed, is uniquely designed with micro-serration that tends to almost minutely curve inwards. What these finely-honed edges do is latch firmly onto whatever it is that you are trying to cut: meat, vegetables, etc., pulling the flesh apart along with cutting the substance. - Source: Internet The spring-loaded full-tang handle gives you better control and a firm grip, and the ergonomic design is ideal for left or right-handed users. The thick heavy-duty 4mm high-grade stainless steel runs all the way through the shears from top to bottom, meaning the blades and handle are designed to last longer even for heavy duty cutting. And they are made to never come apart when cutting, no matter how wide you open the blade. - Source: Internet A good pair of kitchen shears is essential. We’d argue that it’s just as important as a trusty chef’s knife. Yes, really. Kitchen shears are more than just a pair of scissors that lives in the kitchen; they’re super sharp, powerful, and most certainly not for slicing open cardboard boxes. - Source: Internet The OXO Good Grips Spring-Loaded Shears are a great kitchen tool for those who want an easier time in the kitchen, or those who struggle with grip strength. The key feature of these poultry shears is the addition of a spring-loaded mechanism in the handle. This is great for those who have arthritis or joint inflammation. - Source: Internet One warning, however. The blades themselves are quite short, meaning that if you’re looking for a dedicated set of poultry shears you may have better luck elsewhere. You’ll also want to make sure that the blades don’t become misaligned when doing any sort of heavy cutting such as through bone or the like. Keep in mind that missing the joint can lead to a blade offset that must be corrected before trying to cut through skin, work on raw meat, or remove silver skin. - Source: Internet How can I use poultry shears for other purposes aside from cutting poultry? You can make the most of it by cutting other cooking materials such as lobster, cracking nuts, and other seafood. However, the performance will depend on the quality of the blades. How do you cut a chicken with poultry shears? You can watch this youtube video for reference. Can I use regular kitchen scissors to cut chicken? Yes, you can, and yet you only cut the soft meat.

Even trimming or chopping herbs is not an issue with it at all. This also makes for safe, anti-slippage performance and use. - Source: Internet Use: You many only use your poultry shears to cut through chicken, animal bones, fish and other fibrous food, and that’s okay. If that will be the sole use, then look for a pair that is strong with a good spring action and a lock. Also, some poultry shears cut through raw food, while others are better for cooked chicken, turkey or meat. Plus, there are some models that do not cut through raw skin, so be on the lookout for this if you intend to use your shears to cut up a raw chicken with the skin still on. - Source: Internet A great benefit to these shears is that the blades can be taken apart for cleaning. Hand-washing the tool with warm water and soap is recommended. However, do dry them promptly after that. - Source: Internet These poultry shears from William Sonoma may look simple, but they can cut through meat and bone with no fuss.

He is a product developer specializing in sun protective clothing and backpacking equipment but has also focused on human-centered design with composites and household items. He has spent the past three years using fabric <strong>shears</strong> while sewing up prototype apparel and bags, helping him understand the importance of a comfortable pair of sharp <strong>shears</strong>. It is no different in the kitchen or around the house when you need something cut or opened. Kitchen <strong>shears</strong> are convenient and make quick work without getting out a big knife or cutting board, and should cut right through anything, not hurting your hands in the process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>✔ HEAVY-DUTY CONSTRUCTION: With 9.6 Inch long, 3.5mm blade thickness, engineered for perfection and built to last a lifetime, our high-quality stainless steel kitchen <strong>shears</strong> are strong, durable, rust-resistant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The edges of the blades comprise of fine serrations that grip and cut the flesh right apart, without causing a nasty mess. These ultra-sharp blades measure 4.5” in length with a double-beveling and an ergonomic design. This is what accounts for precision-cutting and accurate measures of the <strong>shears</strong> when it comes to portions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But again, if the OXO kitchen scissors are sold out or if you can’t find them anywhere, the Kai Kitchen Scissors are our runner-up choice. In our kitchen <strong>shears</strong> tests, the more-expensive pair performed as well as the OXO kitchen scissors, with a similar single serrated blade but a more squared off look. However, they’re not as readily available and don’t come with OXO’s guarantee. They’re a good choice if you can’t find the OXO scissors, but you likely won’t have that problem. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Poultry <strong>shears</strong> are essentially scissors. When breaking down a chicken, duck, or goose you’ll want to target joints where two bones intersect. Shears can also cut cleanly through the breast bone both for spatchcocking or for disassembling a chicken into bucket pieces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We don&rsquo;t like our hands cramping after cutting for long periods, and we are guessing you don&rsquo;t either, so we made handle comfort equally weighted with ease of cleaning. On top of all the cutting for the sharpness test, we also cut three feet of cardboard to test heavy use on a resistant material. After all that cutting, the OXO Good Grips Multi-Purpose Scissors had the softest and most comfortable handles. The handle has silicone stretched over it, giving the <strong>shears</strong> a nice squish when closed. The KitchenAid All Purpose Shears come in next with a much firmer but more ergonomic handle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re looking for a solid pair of multipurpose kitchen <strong>shears</strong> (with comfortable handles) that do more than just snip, these Zwilling Henckels take-apart kitchen <strong>shears</strong> are among the most sturdy heavy-duty kitchen scissors we’ve used. The 3" stainless-steel blades are high-quality, corrosion-resistant, and micro-serrated for easier, more efficient cutting. These <strong>shears</strong> can also replace several of your kitchen gadgets in a pinch; that jagged-toothed section of the handle can be used as a bottle opener or nutcracker. Can your knife do that? But mostly, we like that the blades come apart, which makes for easy cleaning after dispatching raw <strong>poultry</strong>. Hand-washing is recommended. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>That’s where <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong> come in. A cut above your standard kitchen scissors, these clippers are designed to slice through bird carcasses both big and small, from the smallest of spatchcocks to the fattest of turkeys. Unfortunately, some of the <strong>shears</strong> on the market are about as useful as those plastic scissors your toddler has. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Besides, the kitchen assistance from TANSUNG is produced by a high standard of CNC technology to represent premium quality and delicate design. Specifically, the stainless steel blades are ultra-sharp and strong for heavy-duty <strong>poultry</strong> cutting effortlessly. Further, there is no rust or corrosion during use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>These <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong> are designed to handle different kinds of food. For example, the front part of the scissors where the blades ‘meet’ continuously is meant to cut meat. It is important to note that in order to cut meat perfectly, you use only the front part of the scissors and not the rear part with the groove, which is designed specially to cut bones. It is important to note that these <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong> do not cut through skin. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Straightforward and practical, these <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong> feature a tough-as-nails 3.5-inch serrated steel blade and a specially designed handle that will see you break down any bird with ease. The <strong>shears</strong> are spring-loaded so you get maximum slicing force with minimal effort. The locking mechanism is easy to engage and disengage (and doesn’t get in the way), so you can go to town on that chicken safely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Just like a Swiss Army Knife, this pair of <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong> packs several tools into one seamless design. You can cut through bones in a cinch, chop up veggies, peel fruits, scrape fish scales and even open a beer. Crafted from the same stainless steel as most high-quality chef knives, the blade is not only supremely sharp but also resistant to rusting and corrosion. The heavy-duty scissors have a large textured handgrip to keep your hand secure while cutting. Plus, you can detach the blade to clean thoroughly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You should make sure that whatever you choose is comfortable and easy to use. The handles and handle loops of the <strong>shears</strong> should comfortably accommodate your fingers. Soft-grip coatings will prevent strains and undue pressure on your finger. Also, go for a pair that will allow ambidextrous use easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>No other scissors cut through as many different materials as well as the Kai <strong>shears</strong>, with no tears, hanging threads, or divots. They’re the best scissors on the market for cutting through any random object you decide you want to trim—the perfect all-around scissor. Your biggest problem is going to be preventing family members, roommates, and dates you’re trying to impress from absconding with your perfect scissors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>These all-steel <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong> are stylish, versatile and super sharp. The ergonomic handle is suitable for left- and right-handed people and is slip-proof thanks to a “grasp and hold” design. But what really sets this pair of scissors apart is the ingenious two-in-one blade design that allows you to complete two of the most essential tasks relating to <strong>poultry</strong>: snip and trim through skin and cleave through bone. They’re also extremely hygienic, as there is no chance of bacteria sticking to the stainless steel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A set of <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong> typically looks a lot like a pair of scissors, although the <strong>shears</strong> generally look and feel heavier. The ideal material for these <strong>shears</strong> is carbon steel, which holds an edge well and remains extremely durable, although it is also possible to find <strong>shears</strong> made from stainless metal. Depending on the design, the <strong>shears</strong> may be solid molded, or handles in materials like plastic may be attached. It is also not uncommon to find serrations or notches on one blade to grip the meat while it is cut. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We love how easy it is to clean the <strong>shears</strong>. In fact, the blades separate easily to aid thorough cleaning. You can adjust the interlocking screw of the <strong>shears</strong> for the desired preferences. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Serrated blades will provide you with a better grip any day over a straight-edged knife. And if the <strong>shears</strong> are sufficiently durable, these could cut through bones and tendons effortlessly. The serrations also provide a non-slip, safe grip during use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>How about you? Which is your ideal <strong>poultry</strong> shear? Hopefully, my review will help you choose the best one that meets your demand. If you like this post, please give it a thumbs up or share it with others. Thank you! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>10/18/12 Update&mldr;Still going strong after several years. Blades have remained sharp and all the parts (handle, spring, the latch that keeps <strong>shears</strong> closed when not in use)are in really good shape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In our tests, they sliced easily through materials as varied as marshmallows, parchment paper, and clamshell packaging. One micro-serrated edge keeps a hold on slippery meats and seafood, and the blades come apart for easy cleaning. The handles are large enough to accommodate most hands, and they have a bit of cushioning for comfort, although that didn’t make much of a difference in our tests. Finally, OXO’s satisfaction guarantee gave these a leg up on <strong>shears</strong> that performed similarly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This delivers a super-clean cut of accurate proportions. We absolutely loved the kind of precision cutting that these <strong>shears</strong> offered for separating flesh from joints or cutting them altogether. These could even cut through tendons, and the bone notch on the tool can be used for small <strong>poultry</strong> bones as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to buying the best <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong>, you should know some fundamental factors that highlight kitchen utensils. Otherwise, you might find it hard to choose the best one or waste your money on an invaluable product. Hence, below are four essential things you should consider when opting for the best <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To maintain the sharpness of the blades, it is recommended to store the <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong> in a knife block, cover it with a sheath, or put it in a drawer separate from other utensils. These <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong> measure 9.35 inches long by 3.94 inches wide. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But “regular” all-around scissors aren’t always best for everything. If you’re looking for a pair of snips to keep in the kitchen, OXO Good Grips Kitchen and Herb Scissors is the best pair because it combines sharp, take-apart blades, a micro-serrated blade for gripping slippery raw meats, roomy handles, and a great warranty. These snip raw <strong>poultry</strong> and fresh herbs swiftly and cleanly—unlike some other models that let things slide. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Just like a Swiss Army Knife, this pair of <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong> packs several tools into one seamless design. You can cut through bones in a cinch, chop up veggies, peel fruits, scrape fish scales and even open a beer. Crafted from the same stainless steel as most high-quality chef knives, the blade is not only supremely sharp but also resistant to rusting and corrosion. The heavy-duty <strong>shears</strong> have a large textured handgrip to keep your hand secure while cutting. Plus, you can detach the blade to clean thoroughly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Poultry <strong>shears</strong> are good for much more than breaking down a chicken into pieces. You can also use the <strong>shears</strong> to debone chicken thighs, section wings, and trim fat off for deep frying. Poultry <strong>shears</strong> are an all-around useful kitchen tool – one of the few essentials that Sous Vide Guy recommends every chef has on hand. They can also serve a bit of double duty for processing herbs and some vegetables as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For thorough and safe cleaning, the detaching mode allows you to safely separate the blades with ease. The large-sized, non-slip grips offer more room for your fingers to rest when holding, making them easy to use. These <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong> are also ideal for cutting fish and have a bottle opener built into the handle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Additionally, its professional and stylish design will surely meet your needs. Indeed, the entire structure is sturdy and durable because of the top-grade stainless steel material. As a result, you no longer deal with rust or corrosion problems like other regular <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong>. Plus, the handles also provide you with pleasant and non-slippery control. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The upper blade of these <strong>shears</strong>, we noticed, is uniquely designed with micro-serration that tends to almost minutely curve inwards. What these finely-honed edges do is latch firmly onto whatever it is that you are trying to cut: meat, vegetables, etc., pulling the flesh apart along with cutting the substance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The spring-loaded full-tang handle gives you better control and a firm grip, and the ergonomic design is ideal for left or right-handed users. The thick heavy-duty 4mm high-grade stainless steel runs all the way through the <strong>shears</strong> from top to bottom, meaning the blades and handle are designed to last longer even for heavy duty cutting. And they are made to never come apart when cutting, no matter how wide you open the blade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A good pair of kitchen <strong>shears</strong> is essential. We’d argue that it’s just as important as a trusty chef’s knife. Yes, really. Kitchen <strong>shears</strong> are more than just a pair of scissors that lives in the kitchen; they&rsquo;re super sharp, powerful, and most certainly not for slicing open cardboard boxes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The OXO Good Grips Spring-Loaded Shears are a great kitchen tool for those who want an easier time in the kitchen, or those who struggle with grip strength. The key feature of these <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong> is the addition of a spring-loaded mechanism in the handle. This is great for those who have arthritis or joint inflammation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One warning, however. The blades themselves are quite short, meaning that if you’re looking for a dedicated set of <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong> you may have better luck elsewhere. You’ll also want to make sure that the blades don’t become misaligned when doing any sort of heavy cutting such as through bone or the like. Keep in mind that missing the joint can lead to a blade offset that must be corrected before trying to cut through skin, work on raw meat, or remove silver skin. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>How can I use <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong> for other purposes aside from cutting <strong>poultry</strong>? You can make the most of it by cutting other cooking materials such as lobster, cracking nuts, and other seafood. However, the performance will depend on the quality of the blades. How do you cut a chicken with <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong>? You can watch this youtube video for reference. Can I use regular kitchen scissors to cut chicken? Yes, you can, and yet you only cut the soft meat. It’s better for your <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong> with the most rigid meat or hard bones for better results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The micro-serrated blade edge of the <strong>shears</strong> cuts clean through meat and tough tissues. Even trimming or chopping herbs is not an issue with it at all. This also makes for safe, anti-slippage performance and use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Use: You many only use your <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong> to cut through chicken, animal bones, fish and other fibrous food, and that’s okay. If that will be the sole use, then look for a pair that is strong with a good spring action and a lock. Also, some <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong> cut through raw food, while others are better for cooked chicken, turkey or meat. Plus, there are some models that do not cut through raw skin, so be on the lookout for this if you intend to use your <strong>shears</strong> to cut up a raw chicken with the skin still on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A great benefit to these <strong>shears</strong> is that the blades can be taken apart for cleaning. Hand-washing the tool with warm water and soap is recommended. However, do dry them promptly after that. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>These <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong> from William Sonoma may look simple, but they can cut through meat and bone with no fuss. This is because they’re designed with a spring that’ll allow you to press down on any surface with ease. And they’re also compact, taking up little space in your cabinet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>These all-steel <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong> are stylish, versatile and super sharp. The ergonomic handle is suitable for left- and right-handed people and is slip-proof thanks to a “grasp and hold” design. But what really sets this pair of <strong>shears</strong> apart is the ingenious two-in-one blade design that allows you to complete two of the most essential tasks relating to <strong>poultry</strong>: snip and trim through skin and cleave through bone. They&rsquo;re also extremely hygienic as there is no chance of bacteria sticking to the stainless steel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Want one tool in your kitchen that can do it all? Here we looked at the extra features the <strong>shears</strong> had on them besides cutting. Points we awarded for each unique feature per pair, and the Gerior Heavy Duty Come-Apart easily has the most. This pair comes with a bottle opener, peeler on the blade, fish descaler, flathead screwdriver, and nutcracker/jar opener, by far the most attachments out of our test fleet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The high-quality blade is the first vital element contributing to the peak performance of the <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong>. A robust and razor-sharp blade will cut the <strong>poultry</strong> smoother and effortlessly. Indeed, you should choose the gadget with premium stainless steel for peak quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cleaning and sharpening: Poultry <strong>shears</strong> come in contact with the juices of raw meat, fish and <strong>poultry</strong> and need to be thoroughly cleaned to avoid cross contamination. Look for <strong>shears</strong> where the blades are easy to separate so they can be properly cleaned, or open wide enough for you to be able to clean in between all the nooks and crannies. Being able to open the blades wide also makes them easier to sharpen. Some <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong> can only be washed by hand, while others are safe to put in the dishwasher. Consider what is more convenient for you before choosing a model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Poultry <strong>shears</strong> are scissors which are designed specifically to be able to cut through bone, chicken skin, and other tough materials. In addition to being used on <strong>poultry</strong>, of course, <strong>poultry</strong> <strong>shears</strong> can be utilized as general kitchen <strong>shears</strong>, and they are suited to a wide variety of heavy duty kitchen tasks.
