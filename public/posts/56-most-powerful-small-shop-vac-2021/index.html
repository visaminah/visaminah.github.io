However, for some, the suction may not be strong enough to pick up ground-in, stubborn dirt and debris. Specs Tank Size 2.5 gallons - Source: Internet Shop vacs aren’t just for use in workshops. These machines are powerful, and smaller versions can be useful for cleaning cars and home garages. A recent Popular Mechanics ranking shows some of the best small shop vacs on the market. Here are a few that should be on your radar. - Source: Internet You get two extension wands with this shop vacuum that can lengthen the 10-foot hose to a generous 17 feet, which gives you considerable reach while cleaning without needing to move the machine. The filters are easy to clean and replace, and you can also use this shop vacuum as a blower. That being said, you don’t get a blower extension to make the most of this feature, but there are a great selection of attachments to help you reach crevices and tackle a great range of tasks.. The Craftsman CMXEVBE17590 is an affordable shop vacuum that can clean up messes better than many of the higher-priced machines on the market. - Source: Internet Shop vacuums are great for car use because they can make quick work of clearing professional vehicles. The ArmorAll AA255 is a capable shop vac despite its small size, with attachments including a floor nozzle, crevice tool, concentration tool, and car nozzle for plenty of different uses. It has a ten foot cord and six foot hose, which gives it the length needed for cleaning cars outdoors. - Source: Internet While cord length and horsepower are some of the things you’ll look out for, the best shop vacuums also have a generous gallon size to stash away debris and liquids. Naturally, this comes with its limitations, as a larger gallon will weigh more, meaning you’ll need to put your muscles to work. Features like 360-degree wheels will make maneuvering easier, but if you’re looking for a vacuum that’s lighter to help with zipping up small spills, one of the best handheld vacuums (opens in new tab) might be a better fit, Otherwise, some budget shop vacuums such as the Stanley wet dry vac are on the lighter side, under 10 lbs. - Source: Internet The Vacmaster VHB 305M comes in at $59.99 on Amazon. It features a four-wheel caddy and a wall-mounting bracket that Popular Mechanics praises for its excellent design. This shop vac’s wheels make it easy to move around, and its six-foot hose makes it particularly well-suited to vacuuming those hard-to-reach spots within your car. It also has a 15-foot cord. - Source: Internet Sure, a traditional vacuum comes with attachments. But shop vacs can offer you even more, going above and beyond with specialized accessories designed to make cleaning up all types of messes (and even all types of surfaces) a breeze. From extension wands and lengthy hoses that can give you 10 feet of reach or more to dust nozzles to crevice tools that get into slim spaces, a shop vac has a whole lot to offer. - Source: Internet The Stanley SL18129 is a great shop vacuum for those on a budget, but in our tests it was one of the loudest shop vacs we reviewed. We loved how lightweight the Stanley SL18129 was in our tests at eight pounds, and it was great at vacuuming liquid fast thanks to its four-horsepower motor. In our tests, it sucked up a gallon of water in under five seconds. However, it doesn’t have a drain port, so it will need to be tipped after each use, which could become cumbersome. - Source: Internet At five feet, the hose of the Stanley SL18129 is one of the shorter ones out there. Its power cord is ten feet long though, so you can still access most spaces with ease. We also thought this could be a great car vacuum because of its lightweight design, although it’s not powerful enough for heavy, bulkier debris. - Source: Internet One of the main selling points of this product is the fact that it has a full circumference dolly, which makes the vacuum easier to maneuver. However, there are a few disadvantages you might experience. Setting up the shop vac can be a challenge; it requires some assembly, and all of the components may not fit together perfectly. Additionally, the top of the vacuum doesn’t seal, which can be messy for cleanup. Specs Tank Size 5 gallon - Source: Internet The PowerSmith PAVC101 is not a wet dry shop vacuum. It’s designed for ash, making it perfect for fireplaces and other fine particles such as sawdust. Its metal canister is also designed to handle warm ash better than a traditional polypropylene vacuum. - Source: Internet Shop vacs across the board are generally pretty powerful when it comes to suction. That’s what makes them so beneficial for your garage, outdoor spaces, or the interior of your vehicle. One of these vacuums can pick up everything from sawdust to screws and shavings to traditional dirt and dust with its suction. Plus, when you’re working with stubborn wet messes, it’s the easiest way to suck up unpleasant liquids. - Source: Internet This shop vacuum has a short hose but a 16 foot power cord, which makes it really portable. The cloth filter needs regular replacement but it does a great job of containing fine particles and dust. This shop vac isn’t suitable for wet use, because it’s designed with ash and other dry features in mind, but it did a great job of picking up screws, which makes it suitable for larger debris. - Source: Internet We were impressed by how this shop vac performed in our water tests. It picked up water at a great speed, but its ability to clear large messes and flooding is limited by its smaller six gallon tank. With this shop vacuum you get a lot of attachments. There’s a variety of extension wands and a floor nozzle, crevice tool and gulper nozzle. - Source: Internet The Armor All AA255 costs approximately $51 on Amazon as of this writing. It is quiet and comes with an accessory called the Deluxe Car Nozzle. Although Popular Mechanics notes the word “deluxe” might be “overstating things a bit,” this accessory functions well to clean ribbed floor mats and carpeting within cars. This shop vac features a Velcro band for the power cord, making it easier to stay organized. - Source: Internet As they’re so heavy-duty, you might be mistaken in thinking that one of the best shop vacuums will set you back too much to be a viable purchase. Surprisingly, however, shop vacuums are pretty cheap to pick up, with prices usually ranging from $40 to $100. In a home setting, they’ll be a secondary purchase to a normal hoover, saved for more unmanageable situations, which is why it’s great that they won’t cost too much to factor in alongside another model. - Source: Internet If you want your shop vacuum to be ultimately useful, then choose a model with a lengthy hose in order to get wherever you need it around the house. Be sure to also look out for vacuums equipped with different extension tools to get into all the crevices you might need to use the vacuum for. Having an extra-large tank allows for you to also hoover for longer without needing to empty the machine. - Source: Internet get the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.

The toolbox-shaped machines are easy to store and offer the advantage of internal hose and attachments storage. Credit: Laura Casner - Source: Internet If the best shop vacuums weren’t on your radar previously, that’s probably down to their top spot in commercial and industrial settings. However, that doesn’t mean that they don’t have their uses around the home too. While the longer cables are a dream at reaching troublesome corners around warehouses or other businesses, they’ll also make tidying up your driveway or garage less of a chore. That’s why the best wet-dry vacuums have longer cables than a traditional vacuum, with cord lengths reaching as far as 20 feet or so to really tackle your problem patches. Plus, you’ll find that some can handle two chores at once, as they can be contorted into a handheld blower to blast away dirt, dust, and leaves. - Source: Internet This is one of the most common questions among people looking to purchase a shop vac. It really comes down to what you are going to use it for. If you are using the vacuum for larger objects and not fine particles, you don’t necessarily need a filter. If you often vacuum fine materials like ash or sawdust, you should look for a dust filter that traps tiny particles. Without a filter in place when you vacuum up sawdust or other fine particulates, you’ll most likely just end up blowing the particles out of the shop vac again, which ultimately defeats the purpose of vacuuming! - Source: Internet The DeWalt DCV581H is cordless, compact and quiet – three things you almost never get with a shop vacuum. It is more portable than most shop vacs with its rechargeable battery, but it can also be plugged into the wall. This DeWalt machine was not great on our suction tests; some cleaned faster with fewer passes. It can help you tidy up without the clunky tanks and noise of the bigger models. Since it’s compact it is easy to take to different places. - Source: Internet One of the things that makes this particularly enticing is its construction. The polypropylene material with which it was made enables it to work efficiently for your workshop. Our experts believe that these qualities make the Vacmaster VBV1210 12-gallon wet/dry vacuum incredibly useful for woodworkers. - Source: Internet If you were on the lookout for a cost-effective wet and dry vacuum cleaner, then this versatile cleaner from U.S.-based Hoover’s Enigma range must be considered deeply. Check Price Despite the low-price, this wet and dry vacuum displays tremendous suction, primarily because of the 2,000-watt motor that rests inside. - Source: Internet The crevice test assesses both the crevice tool itself and the reach of the suction produced by the vacuum motor. Here too, the Milwaukee, Ryobi, and Kobalt proved themselves to be top-notch. Their attachments all penetrated eight or more inches and at least another half-inch of suction reach. Overall, Kobalt and Milwaukee lead the class in dry work. - Source: Internet The DeWalt DCB205CK is one of the more expensive options on this list, priced at $159 through Platt. However, it is also the only shop vac option that works both cordless and corded. So its power cord is slightly shorter, at just eight feet. This shop vac runs on the same battery as other DeWalt products, making it a good option for folks who have cordless power tools from this brand. - Source: Internet The Bosch GAS18V-3 has features akin to traditional plug-in shop vacuums. It has a rigid hose with extension tubes that allow the user to stand up while using the tool. The hose is also quite sturdy and can hold its shape while bearing the user’s full weight. Additionally, you never have to fight the spring-like action of a self-retracting hose. - Source: Internet This shop vacuum provides 360-degree wheels so it is easy to maneuver. It offers a dual-flex hose, which is one that can move in any direction and not collapse. You also can simply flip a switch and turn the hose into a blower, which adds another dimension to your cleaning capabilities with this shop vacuum. However, you don’t get any way to take the motor off to carry it around for blowing, which can hinder your blower cleaning somewhat. The power cord reaches 20 feet, which is the longest of any shop vac we tested, and it has a 7-foot hose that is average for the industry. - Source: Internet This shop vac doesn’t, however, come with any accessories or attachments. That can limit your ability to clean crevices and tight spots. Specs Tank Size 6 gallons - Source: Internet The Craftsman CMXEVBE17590 is a medium-sized shop vacuum which packs an impressive amount of horsepower for its affordable price. It can hold nine gallons of liquid and has an oversized drain for convenient emptying. At 15 pounds it’s not the lightest shop vacuum we reviewed, but it does have casters for easy transportation. - Source: Internet Accessories – what are you going to be using the shop vac for? If the main purpose of the vacuum cleaner is to use it for your car then look for a shop vac with extensive car accessories. If you want it for your garage at home and the garden then opt for the integrated blower port. Take a look at the accessories and apply them to your demands. Some shop vacs don’t have great accessories for carpets, so take this into consideration before you buy. - Source: Internet Our favorite shop vac was easily the Armor Utility Wet \u0026 Dry Vacuum AA255. We liked this particular vacuum because we felt it offered really good value for money and provided enough horsepower for small to medium jobs. The shop vac came with a good selection of accessories (particularly good for car cleaning) and could easily be converted to blow. Which as we all now know, is a super useful tool for debris removal. - Source: Internet The production of this review required weeks of research and testing. We ran these machines through every conceivable test and measurement for cordless dry/wet vacuuming, battery life, and convenience. If you still aren’t sure what to purchase, you might find a different vacuum style is better suited to your lifestyle. However, in the end, we’re hoping that our research helps you to easily and confidently select the right machine for your needs. - Source: Internet There are so many different shop vacs available for purchase, so in order to make our top product picks, we took a close look at the variety sold online.

We specifically sought out models that could work for garage messes and in-car messes for versatility. From there, we compared the shop vacs based on details like their emptying method, included accessories or attachments, suction power, and reliable performance over time. - Source: Internet Leaking washing machine?

While it’s a jack of all trades, it’s a master of none. This vacuum is reasonably affordable, reasonably powerful, reasonably lightweight, and works well for both wet and dry use. - Source: Internet The ArmorAll AA255 is an affordable option for those seeking a more portable shop vacuum. It weighs eight pounds, so it’s easy to carry around, but this does mean its smaller 2.5 gallon capacity will require far more regular emptying. - Source: Internet We used hardware and specific weights to assess the vacuum power of each model we review.

Above we see the water lifting test that challenges the machine to move 2 gallons of water as quickly as possible. - Source: Internet To test suction, we measured two gallons of water, poured it into a bathtub with the drain stopper in and then vacuumed up the water, taking note of how long it took for each vacuum to complete the task. We found the best vacuums were up to three times faster than those on the lower end of our product lineup. After the vacuuming tests were done, we conducted somewhat subjective testing by examining how clean each filter appeared to be. We also conducted several general movement tests, such as moving the vacuums around by the hose or over an obstacle, to get a sense of how easy it was to maneuver each vacuum. - Source: Internet We selected some of the most popular cordless wet dry vacuums and put them through a rigorous testing process. Our results reveal which products are best for specific situations, as well as which vacuums are all-around crowd-pleasers. We include info that will help you make the best decision for your needs. - Source: Internet Weighted at 10% of the overall score, convenience is not the most crucial aspect of a vacuum, but it plays a part in how easy it is to use a product. We measure the outer dimensions of the machine, the hose length (both retracted and at its maximum stretch), the weight, and the noise level at 3 ½ feet. Finally, we look at the filters. - Source: Internet HEPA filters are generally thought to be the gold standard in vacuum filters. The reason for that is that HEPA filters can capture 99.97% of all allergens, up to 0.3 microns in size. To put that in perspective, a human hair is about 50 microns thick! - Source: Internet We spent more than 40 hours running the shop vacuums we chose for testing through a series of trials to see how well each performed. For our tests, we vacuumed up typical materials you’d run into in your own home or garage. We measured two ounces of mulch and sawdust mixed with six small screws and spread it on a piece of carpeting. After using each machine to clean up the mess, we then measured how much of the debris the shop vacuums picked up after one pass. We deliberately included bigger pieces of mulch to see how well all the shop vacuums performed when handling heavier items. - Source: Internet Ease of Use – again, look at the weight and size of the vacuum in relation to who is using it and what it’s going to be used for.

Firstly, look at your own specifics. If you need a sturdy shop vac for your workshop or store then considering a bigger, more powerful vac might be sensible. - Source: Internet Unfortunately, despite the perks of this shop vac, it does also have some drawbacks. Some components, including the accessories, are made out of cheap plastic and are prone to breaking or weakness. Additionally, the exterior of the vacuum’s tank can easily be dented, which kind of ruins its appearance. Specs Tank Size 4 gallons - Source: Internet Some top-rated shop vacuums have tanks as big as 14 gallons, allowing you to deal with serious messes in one cleaning session. However, you might not need something so large for the jobs you do and the storage space you have.

However, for some, the suction may not be strong enough to pick up ground-in, stubborn dirt and debris. Specs Tank Size 2.5 gallons - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Shop <strong>vac</strong>s aren’t just for use in work<strong>shop</strong>s. These machines are powerful, and smaller versions can be useful for cleaning cars and home garages. A recent Popular Mechanics ranking shows some of the best small <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>s on the market. Here are a few that should be on your radar. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You get two extension wands with this <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uum that can lengthen the 10-foot hose to a generous 17 feet, which gives you considerable reach while cleaning without needing to move the machine. The filters are easy to clean and replace, and you can also use this <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uum as a blower. That being said, you don’t get a blower extension to make the most of this feature, but there are a great selection of attachments to help you reach crevices and tackle a great range of tasks.. The Craftsman CMXEVBE17590 is an affordable <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uum that can clean up messes better than many of the higher-priced machines on the market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Shop <strong>vac</strong>uums are great for car use because they can make quick work of clearing professional vehicles. The ArmorAll AA255 is a capable <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong> despite its small size, with attachments including a floor nozzle, crevice tool, concentration tool, and car nozzle for plenty of different uses. It has a ten foot cord and six foot hose, which gives it the length needed for cleaning cars outdoors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While cord length and horsepower are some of the things you’ll look out for, the best <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uums also have a generous gallon size to stash away debris and liquids. Naturally, this comes with its limitations, as a larger gallon will weigh more, meaning you’ll need to put your muscles to work. Features like 360-degree wheels will make maneuvering easier, but if you’re looking for a <strong>vac</strong>uum that’s lighter to help with zipping up small spills, one of the best handheld <strong>vac</strong>uums (opens in new tab) might be a better fit, Otherwise, some budget <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uums such as the Stanley wet dry <strong>vac</strong> are on the lighter side, under 10 lbs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Vacmaster VHB 305M comes in at $59.99 on Amazon. It features a four-wheel caddy and a wall-mounting bracket that Popular Mechanics praises for its excellent design. This <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>’s wheels make it easy to move around, and its six-foot hose makes it particularly well-suited to <strong>vac</strong>uuming those hard-to-reach spots within your car. It also has a 15-foot cord. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sure, a traditional <strong>vac</strong>uum comes with attachments. But <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>s can offer you even more, going above and beyond with specialized accessories designed to make cleaning up all types of messes (and even all types of surfaces) a breeze. From extension wands and lengthy hoses that can give you 10 feet of reach or more to dust nozzles to crevice tools that get into slim spaces, a <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong> has a whole lot to offer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Stanley SL18129 is a great <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uum for those on a budget, but in our tests it was one of the loudest <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>s we reviewed. We loved how lightweight the Stanley SL18129 was in our tests at eight pounds, and it was great at <strong>vac</strong>uuming liquid fast thanks to its four-horsepower motor. In our tests, it sucked up a gallon of water in under five seconds. However, it doesn’t have a drain port, so it will need to be tipped after each use, which could become cumbersome. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At five feet, the hose of the Stanley SL18129 is one of the shorter ones out there. Its power cord is ten feet long though, so you can still access most spaces with ease. We also thought this could be a great car <strong>vac</strong>uum because of its lightweight design, although it’s not powerful enough for heavy, bulkier debris. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the main selling points of this product is the fact that it has a full circumference dolly, which makes the <strong>vac</strong>uum easier to maneuver. However, there are a few disadvantages you might experience. Setting up the <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong> can be a challenge; it requires some assembly, and all of the components may not fit together perfectly. Additionally, the top of the <strong>vac</strong>uum doesn’t seal, which can be messy for cleanup. Specs Tank Size 5 gallon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The PowerSmith PAVC101 is not a wet dry <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uum. It’s designed for ash, making it perfect for fireplaces and other fine particles such as sawdust. Its metal canister is also designed to handle warm ash better than a traditional polypropylene <strong>vac</strong>uum. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Shop <strong>vac</strong>s across the board are generally pretty powerful when it comes to suction. That’s what makes them so beneficial for your garage, outdoor spaces, or the interior of your vehicle. One of these <strong>vac</strong>uums can pick up everything from sawdust to screws and shavings to traditional dirt and dust with its suction. Plus, when you’re working with stubborn wet messes, it’s the easiest way to suck up unpleasant liquids. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uum has a short hose but a 16 foot power cord, which makes it really portable. The cloth filter needs regular replacement but it does a great job of containing fine particles and dust. This <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong> isn’t suitable for wet use, because it’s designed with ash and other dry features in mind, but it did a great job of picking up screws, which makes it suitable for larger debris. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We were impressed by how this <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong> performed in our water tests. It picked up water at a great speed, but its ability to clear large messes and flooding is limited by its smaller six gallon tank. With this <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uum you get a lot of attachments. There’s a variety of extension wands and a floor nozzle, crevice tool and gulper nozzle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Armor All AA255 costs approximately $51 on Amazon as of this writing. It is quiet and comes with an accessory called the Deluxe Car Nozzle. Although Popular Mechanics notes the word “deluxe” might be “overstating things a bit,” this accessory functions well to clean ribbed floor mats and carpeting within cars. This <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong> features a Velcro band for the power cord, making it easier to stay organized. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As they’re so heavy-duty, you might be mistaken in thinking that one of the best <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uums will set you back too much to be a viable purchase. Surprisingly, however, <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uums are pretty cheap to pick up, with prices usually ranging from $40 to $100. In a home setting, they’ll be a secondary purchase to a normal hoover, saved for more unmanageable situations, which is why it’s great that they won’t cost too much to factor in alongside another model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want your <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uum to be ultimately useful, then choose a model with a lengthy hose in order to get wherever you need it around the house. Be sure to also look out for <strong>vac</strong>uums equipped with different extension tools to get into all the crevices you might need to use the <strong>vac</strong>uum for. Having an extra-large tank allows for you to also hoover for longer without needing to empty the machine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>get the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart <strong>shop</strong>ping advice, and exclusive discounts.

The toolbox-shaped machines are easy to store and offer the advantage of internal hose and attachments storage. Credit: Laura Casner - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If the best <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uums weren’t on your radar previously, that’s probably down to their top spot in commercial and industrial settings. However, that doesn’t mean that they don’t have their uses around the home too. While the longer cables are a dream at reaching troublesome corners around warehouses or other businesses, they’ll also make tidying up your driveway or garage less of a chore. That’s why the best wet-dry <strong>vac</strong>uums have longer cables than a traditional <strong>vac</strong>uum, with cord lengths reaching as far as 20 feet or so to really tackle your problem patches. Plus, you’ll find that some can handle two chores at once, as they can be contorted into a handheld blower to blast away dirt, dust, and leaves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is one of the most common questions among people looking to purchase a <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>. It really comes down to what you are going to use it for. If you are using the <strong>vac</strong>uum for larger objects and not fine particles, you don&rsquo;t necessarily need a filter. If you often <strong>vac</strong>uum fine materials like ash or sawdust, you should look for a dust filter that traps tiny particles. Without a filter in place when you <strong>vac</strong>uum up sawdust or other fine particulates, you&rsquo;ll most likely just end up blowing the particles out of the <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong> again, which ultimately defeats the purpose of <strong>vac</strong>uuming! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The DeWalt DCV581H is cordless, compact and quiet – three things you almost never get with a <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uum. It is more portable than most <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>s with its rechargeable battery, but it can also be plugged into the wall. This DeWalt machine was not great on our suction tests; some cleaned faster with fewer passes. It can help you tidy up without the clunky tanks and noise of the bigger models. Since it’s compact it is easy to take to different places. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the things that makes this particularly enticing is its construction. The polypropylene material with which it was made enables it to work efficiently for your work<strong>shop</strong>. Our experts believe that these qualities make the Vacmaster VBV1210 12-gallon wet/dry <strong>vac</strong>uum incredibly useful for woodworkers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you were on the lookout for a cost-effective wet and dry <strong>vac</strong>uum cleaner, then this versatile cleaner from U.S.-based Hoover’s Enigma range must be considered deeply. Check Price Despite the low-price, this wet and dry <strong>vac</strong>uum displays tremendous suction, primarily because of the 2,000-watt motor that rests inside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The crevice test assesses both the crevice tool itself and the reach of the suction produced by the <strong>vac</strong>uum motor. Here too, the Milwaukee, Ryobi, and Kobalt proved themselves to be top-notch. Their attachments all penetrated eight or more inches and at least another half-inch of suction reach. Overall, Kobalt and Milwaukee lead the class in dry work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The DeWalt DCB205CK is one of the more expensive options on this list, priced at $159 through Platt. However, it is also the only <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong> option that works both cordless and corded. So its power cord is slightly shorter, at just eight feet. This <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong> runs on the same battery as other DeWalt products, making it a good option for folks who have cordless power tools from this brand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Bosch GAS18V-3 has features akin to traditional plug-in <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uums. It has a rigid hose with extension tubes that allow the user to stand up while using the tool. The hose is also quite sturdy and can hold its shape while bearing the user&rsquo;s full weight. Additionally, you never have to fight the spring-like action of a self-retracting hose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uum provides 360-degree wheels so it is easy to maneuver. It offers a dual-flex hose, which is one that can move in any direction and not collapse. You also can simply flip a switch and turn the hose into a blower, which adds another dimension to your cleaning capabilities with this <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uum. However, you don’t get any way to take the motor off to carry it around for blowing, which can hinder your blower cleaning somewhat. The power cord reaches 20 feet, which is the longest of any <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong> we tested, and it has a 7-foot hose that is average for the industry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong> doesn’t, however, come with any accessories or attachments. That can limit your ability to clean crevices and tight spots. Specs Tank Size 6 gallons - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Craftsman CMXEVBE17590 is a medium-sized <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uum which packs an impressive amount of horsepower for its affordable price. It can hold nine gallons of liquid and has an oversized drain for convenient emptying. At 15 pounds it’s not the lightest <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uum we reviewed, but it does have casters for easy transportation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Accessories – what are you going to be using the <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong> for? If the main purpose of the <strong>vac</strong>uum cleaner is to use it for your car then look for a <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong> with extensive car accessories. If you want it for your garage at home and the garden then opt for the integrated blower port. Take a look at the accessories and apply them to your demands. Some <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>s don’t have great accessories for carpets, so take this into consideration before you buy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Our favorite <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong> was easily the Armor Utility Wet & Dry Vacuum AA255. We liked this particular <strong>vac</strong>uum because we felt it offered really good value for money and provided enough horsepower for small to medium jobs. The <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong> came with a good selection of accessories (particularly good for car cleaning) and could easily be converted to blow. Which as we all now know, is a super useful tool for debris removal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The production of this review required weeks of research and testing. We ran these machines through every conceivable test and measurement for cordless dry/wet <strong>vac</strong>uuming, battery life, and convenience. If you still aren&rsquo;t sure what to purchase, you might find a different <strong>vac</strong>uum style is better suited to your lifestyle. However, in the end, we&rsquo;re hoping that our research helps you to easily and confidently select the right machine for your needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are so many different <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>s available for purchase, so in order to make our top product picks, we took a close look at the variety sold online. We looked at <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>s big and small with tanks of varying sizes, comparing their capacities and their motors to determine how efficient, powerful, and helpful each <strong>vac</strong>uum could be. We specifically sought out models that could work for garage messes and in-car messes for versatility. From there, we compared the <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>s based on details like their emptying method, included accessories or attachments, suction power, and reliable performance over time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Leaking washing machine? Not a problem with a wet and dry <strong>vac</strong>uum. Spillages on the floor? Easy peasy. A wet <strong>vac</strong> will sort these problems out in no time at all. Some of the <strong>vac</strong>uums on this list are that powerful they can drink up to 1 gallon of water per second. Think how useful that can be in an industrial capacity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>7 DeWALT Poly Wet/Dry Vac Best for Small Jobs See More Reviews CHECK LATEST PRICE If you’re looking for a professional wet dry <strong>vac</strong> that will be able to handle small to medium jobs then the DeWalt Poly Wet/Dry Vac might just be the one for you. It’s portable, but still sturdy enough, with a 6-gallon tank to soak up any work<strong>shop</strong> or car spillages. Built specifically for garage and vehicle use, this <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong> is easy to manage and work with, and it’ll offer enough suction for plenty of different jobs; it can even be used at job sites for daily cleanup. It also boasts a built-in blower port that can blow debris and sawdust from any work<strong>shop</strong> as well as leaves from a yard. Plus, with ultra-durable rubberized caster wheels, you’ll enjoy smooth swiveling and therefore a smooth <strong>vac</strong>uuming experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Shop-Vac 9653610 is the most versatile <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uum we tested. While it’s a jack of all trades, it’s a master of none. This <strong>vac</strong>uum is reasonably affordable, reasonably powerful, reasonably lightweight, and works well for both wet and dry use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The ArmorAll AA255 is an affordable option for those seeking a more portable <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uum. It weighs eight pounds, so it’s easy to carry around, but this does mean its smaller 2.5 gallon capacity will require far more regular emptying. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We used hardware and specific weights to assess the <strong>vac</strong>uum power of each model we review. Running the Porter Cable model through one of our light sediment <strong>vac</strong>uum tests. A wet/dry <strong>vac</strong>uum that doubles as a bilge pump? Above we see the water lifting test that challenges the machine to move 2 gallons of water as quickly as possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To test suction, we measured two gallons of water, poured it into a bathtub with the drain stopper in and then <strong>vac</strong>uumed up the water, taking note of how long it took for each <strong>vac</strong>uum to complete the task. We found the best <strong>vac</strong>uums were up to three times faster than those on the lower end of our product lineup. After the <strong>vac</strong>uuming tests were done, we conducted somewhat subjective testing by examining how clean each filter appeared to be. We also conducted several general movement tests, such as moving the <strong>vac</strong>uums around by the hose or over an obstacle, to get a sense of how easy it was to maneuver each <strong>vac</strong>uum. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We selected some of the most popular cordless wet dry <strong>vac</strong>uums and put them through a rigorous testing process. Our results reveal which products are best for specific situations, as well as which <strong>vac</strong>uums are all-around crowd-pleasers. We include info that will help you make the best decision for your needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Weighted at 10% of the overall score, convenience is not the most crucial aspect of a <strong>vac</strong>uum, but it plays a part in how easy it is to use a product. We measure the outer dimensions of the machine, the hose length (both retracted and at its maximum stretch), the weight, and the noise level at 3 ½ feet. Finally, we look at the filters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>HEPA filters are generally thought to be the gold standard in <strong>vac</strong>uum filters. The reason for that is that HEPA filters can capture 99.97% of all allergens, up to 0.3 microns in size. To put that in perspective, a human hair is about 50 microns thick! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We spent more than 40 hours running the <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uums we chose for testing through a series of trials to see how well each performed. For our tests, we <strong>vac</strong>uumed up typical materials you&rsquo;d run into in your own home or garage. We measured two ounces of mulch and sawdust mixed with six small screws and spread it on a piece of carpeting. After using each machine to clean up the mess, we then measured how much of the debris the <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uums picked up after one pass. We deliberately included bigger pieces of mulch to see how well all the <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uums performed when handling heavier items. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ease of Use – again, look at the weight and size of the <strong>vac</strong>uum in relation to who is using it and what it’s going to be used for. Is it easy to empty? Some <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>s have features such as drain ports for easy emptying. Does it have handles? Can it be easily stored? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Size – If you are only looking for a small <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong> for your home and backyard then there’s not much point in buying an industrial-sized beast with a six horsepower motor. Firstly, look at your own specifics. If you need a sturdy <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong> for your work<strong>shop</strong> or store then considering a bigger, more powerful <strong>vac</strong> might be sensible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Unfortunately, despite the perks of this <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>, it does also have some drawbacks. Some components, including the accessories, are made out of cheap plastic and are prone to breaking or weakness. Additionally, the exterior of the <strong>vac</strong>uum’s tank can easily be dented, which kind of ruins its appearance. Specs Tank Size 4 gallons - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some top-rated <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uums have tanks as big as 14 gallons, allowing you to deal with serious messes in one cleaning session. However, you might not need something so large for the jobs you do and the storage space you have. In that case, you can get <strong>vac</strong>uums with tanks as small as two gallons. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Extension tubes are a rare accessory with cordless <strong>vac</strong>uums. If you need reach or want to stand-up while working, look for a model with this accessory. Credit: Laura Casner - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uums will set any spills straight, whether it’s sawdust, smashed glass or spilled milk. With a little extra gusto than the best <strong>vac</strong>uums for home (opens in new tab), <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>uums are built to spruce up offices, <strong>shop</strong>s and building work too, thanks to their lengthy hoses and supersized tanks. On top of that, the best wet-dry <strong>vac</strong>uums can be used to lick up liquid messes, whether that’s from plumbing woes or spills on the <strong>shop</strong> floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Among other things, we studied manufacturer websites and sought out expert opinions for advice on finding the best product. Paul Mayer is a Minnesota-based woodworker and tool reviewer that you can see in action on the Tool Metrix (opens in new tab) channel on YouTube. He has owned a lot of <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>s over the years and now uses a large dust collector more than any <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>. He still uses a <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong> for anything left after he sweeps up the floors, though. He recommends doing specific research. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The 12-gallon tank and list of 11 handy accessories offer both plenty of reach and a lot of value in one <strong>shop</strong> <strong>vac</strong>. However, it does have one drawback. It isn’t very great at picking up sawdust, so it isn’t the best choice for woodworking cleanup. Specs Tank Size 12 gallons - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The most expensive option on this list is the Snapper 1688061, which costs $299 through Home Depot.
