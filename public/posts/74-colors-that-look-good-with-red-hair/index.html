Skintones can also be cool or warm. Natural redheads usually have a warm undertone to their skin. - Source: Internet Your undertone usually falls into one of three categories: cool, neutral, and warm. According to Aaron Bradford, colorist at NYC-based hair studio Cedric Salon, “cool” undertones have hints of blue, green, and violet in their skin, while “warm” tones appear red, orange, golden, or yellow. As for “neutral” hues, their undertones are usually a mix of warm and cool tones, which means this lucky bunch is able to find a wider variety of hair colors that flatter them. - Source: Internet Merlot hair color is perfect for anyone who wants to go red but can’t imagine parting with their dark locks. The red wine-inspired shade is a beautiful blend of rich brown, burgundy, and juicy cherry red. It also has the added benefit of being one of the most low maintenance red hair colors available. - Source: Internet This hair color is all about customization. If you want to add a subtle red hue to your dark brown locks, ask your colorist for burgundy and cherry red highlights or ombre. If you want your merlot hue to resemble a fruity sangria more closely, ask your colorist for an all-over deep cherry red. - Source: Internet Can’t decide between dark and bright hair? Check out this melty auburn-red mix. With dark red hair, you get the benefit of depth at the root. Bright pops of auburn tones help you get the best out of the red balayage for this season. - Source: Internet Red hair—particularly the shades that incorporate blonde—is an incredibly summery look. Strawberry is certainly one of those beach-ready shades. The brighter, blonder version of copper looks lovely alongside a light tan. - Source: Internet Blondes may have more fun (or so they say), but it’s redheads that really have the most options when choosing makeup colors. In short, pretty much anything goes when you have red hair. Why? “Greens and blues will really make the hair color pop, since they fall opposite red on the color wheel,” explains celebrity makeup artist and beauty expert Bryan Cantor. - Source: Internet There’s an old saying that states redheads should never wear red. However, this saying is a myth because red is one of the most flattering clothing colors for redheads. The key is to find the shade that works best with your hair color. For example, red with a purplish tinge will complement your hair, but those with an orange hue will not. Bright red is also a good choice if you want to look bold and daring. - Source: Internet Blue is a soothing color, and it can accentuate red hair, thanks to the perfect contrast between the two shades. To be specific, redheads will look stunning on cobalt, navy, and powder blue. Brighter shades, like turquoise blue, are also flattering to your tresses. Denim blue is also a great choice because it can enhance the true color of your strands. - Source: Internet Finding clothing colors that compliments your red hair can be a bit challenging. Some redheads don’t wear bright-colored clothes because they fear that the shade may clash with their tresses. However, saturated hues are recommended for women with red hair. To give you a better view, here are some of the best clothing colors for redheads. - Source: Internet Strawberry blonde Also known as “red sand”, strawberry blonde is a type of light ginger hair. It’s a fantastic shade if you want to suffuse blonde sun streaks with red blonde highlights and maintain that sun-kissed hue year round. For the ultimate beach babe look, style your red sand hair with bouncy, tousled waves. - Source: Internet When you go red, there’s always the option to really go red. This neon shade is straight out of a comic strip or spy novel. Be warned that bright shades tend to fade quickly, so you’ll need to discuss a custom care routine with your stylist. - Source: Internet Eager to try a red hair color? We don’t blame you! When it comes to achieving the red shade of your dreams, however, it’s best to avoid DIYing it at-home. Red is a notoriously finicky color, so we always recommend leaving your red hair color transformation to a salon professional. They’ll be able to create a specific formula using professional color to help you leave the salon with the best possible results. - Source: Internet If you love copper penny hair and want to take it to the next level, copper fire hair is perfect for you. This quintessential red hue is guaranteed to multiply your compliments this year. Bond says the only way to do this color justice is to go completely red. - Source: Internet This curly queen has gone for the dark red burgundy shade with an ombre effect. Dark roots paired with brighter pops on the ends do bring lots of fun and work amazingly for perky curls and dark skin tones. Texture in the hair shows off the dimensional shade of red, and we love it. - Source: Internet Warm peachy red is having a real moment. By now, you’ve probably seen the shade in dozens of matte lipstick tubes, blush palettes, and the like. Instead of applying the color to our lips, we’d rather wear it in a way that’s semi-permanent. - Source: Internet Who said never play with fire? Turn up the heat with this flaming hot medium to dark red balayage. This dark color does not only melt intense depth and true red tones but also incorporates fiery red highlights to bring that extra spectacle. A true attention grabber. - Source: Internet Purple is the color of royalty, and redheads will look regal wearing a purple-colored dress. However, you should avoid muted shades, like lavender, because they can wash out your hair color. Instead, you can opt for bright and electric shades to accentuate your tresses. - Source: Internet We spoke to some of the top celebrity colorists about the best red hair color ideas for 2022, no matter your skin tone. Some general advice: Softer peach and cinnamon look great on pale skin, deep violets and cranberries complement deep skin, and Zendaya-esque rubies and coppers look incredible on everyone. Scroll on for some hair-color inspo, and get ready to book an appointment. - Source: Internet #24: Dark Copper Red Hair Dark copper red hair is one of the most flattering shades that matches almost every skin tone. Of course, you still can have the benefits of warm red tones to go with a darker shade. This vibrant and bold hairstyle is so smooth on straight hair. - Source: Internet Red hair is having a moment. From Jessica Chastain‘s bright copper to Amy Adams‘ strawberry blonde, the color made some show-stopping appearances on the red carpet this season. Thinking of going red yourself? Before you schedule your color job, consider whether you have what it takes to pull off the look. I spoke with Rick Wellman, co-owner of Patrick Melville Salon in New York City (who recently gave my locks a much needed copper touchup) about what you need to consider before committing to your own red hair makeover. - Source: Internet Unlike pink-infused hair, blood orange is all about the juicy notes. There’s barely a hint of red here. Instead, the shade is primarily an orangey blonde that looks a little space-age chic. - Source: Internet Don’t want your hair to have a strong red hue? This warm medium auburn hue is a great compromise for those who want to gently glow up their look with a darker shade of red. It can be a little gentler on a pale skin tone too. Perfect for those of you eager to play it on the safe side. - Source: Internet Another trick to finding your color match? Look at the colored flecks in your irises. “The gold/yellow flecks in the iris mean the warmer reds will be flattering,” Rick says. Cool blue or brown flecks mean cooler-toned red are the better option. Your jewelry choices can also be an indication: “Whether you are drawn to silver or gold jewelry can also point you towards your cool or warm red hair color compass.” - Source: Internet “Neutral skin tones are a little more flexible as you can wear almost anything,” says Reid. “Opt for richer red shades, violets or mahogany auburn, or even look to combining shades by adding in more natural red or flecks of warm toffee shades.” - Source: Internet Cherry red hair colour A vibrant mixture of deep red and purple tones, cherry red hair works well on skin that tans easily and is equally great at accentuating brown eyes. It works especially well with a short bob hairstyle for a Parisian chic look. If you’re keen to create this vibrant cherry shade, check out our Radiant Red Deep Cherry Brown vegan-friendly red hair dye. - Source: Internet Unlike platinum blonde hair, which only looks good on certain people, red can work for anyone. The trick is to finding the right red for your skin tone. “Freckles, pale skin and light eyes work best with strawberry blonde and copper reds. Darker eyes with cooler skin tones work best with deeper true reds and violet tones,” Rick explains. Emma Stone, a natural blonde, pulls off copper effortlessly while Rihanna’s complexion is compatible with a true red. - Source: Internet Bright orange hair Bright orange adds a vivacious ‘pop’ to your copper hair, while also complementing cooler skin tones. This fiery red hair colour is vibrant to say the least and can be combined nicely with other shades through balayage or ombre colouring techniques. - Source: Internet Here’s another infinitely wearable shade of red. This caramel-influenced color suits women of all skin tones, combining ashy notes with warm red and brown. Instead of spending another year on the same old caramel hair, add a surprising flash of red to the mix. - Source: Internet Dark burgundy hair Similar to ‘merlot’ in colour, the violet elements of this shade will enhance golden skin tones. It definitely leans more towards the darker side of the red hair spectrum, so keep the colour in check with our Radiant Red range , comprised of shampoo and conditioner that work wonders at boosting your colour. Dark burgundy hair adds an elegance that works great for long hair, and is a superb hairstyle option for Halloween. - Source: Internet If you’re headed to the salon to get your color, Tardo says that most salons usually have mix-in options to increase the longevity of your red hair. However, if you’re a DIY kind of person, you can easily craft your new red shade in the comfort of your own home with a trusty box dye. Tardo recommends using red shades from the Clairol Nice’N Easy collection, and touch-ups can be easily achieved with the Tressa Watercolors Shampoo, which will help redeposit red into your hair between coloring sessions. - Source: Internet This look is a true red hair color. While still falling under the darker red category due to shadow roots, it’s one of the brighter variations of dark red hair. This look adds a little drama and energy and would be great if you need a burst of vivid color in your life. - Source: Internet Dimensional jewel-like tones work like magic if you want to dye brunette hair dark red. Pops of dark red highlights through a deep ruby red will certainly update any hairdo. The contrast of the highlights and lowlights paired with the lob wavy style is simply gorgeous. - Source: Internet #32: Plum Red for Curly Hair This is a plum red for curly hair ombre. Don’t you love how vibrant the color came out? Long Beach, CA hair colorist Griffin Rangel says, “this is for women looking for something new and fun. It’s something that isn’t too crazy but will get people to notice your hair.” - Source: Internet Bond assures us that with the proper products and hair care routine, you can keep your color looking as vibrant and fabulous as the day you walked out of the salon. To keep your red hue looking fresh between appointments, Bond suggests swapping out your regular shampoo and conditioner with a system formulated to protect color-treated hair. The stylist recommends L’Oréal Professionnel Serie Expert Vitamino A-OX Color Preserve Shampoo and Conditioner to her clients. This system provides color and UV protection to help prolong color radiance and enhance shine. - Source: Internet Glints of a ruby hair shade powerfully bring this dark hair color to life. The dark red hair paired with the ripple wave shouts Jessica Rabbit. This super sexy warm red look is enough to give us all hair color envy. - Source: Internet #8: Dark Reddish Strawberry Blonde Hair Dark reddish strawberry blonde hair is a warm color that complements pale skin. “It’s trendy, and any woman of any age can rock it,” says stylist Tori Skrot of Pennsylvania. “We used Lanza to color the roots and pop lowlights in slices and weaves,” Skrot states. Skrot also points out that this red hair color is high maintenance. - Source: Internet Light red tones in this dark red hair add glimmers of it all. Mind that color ideas like this one depend not only on the shade that you go for but also on the mastery of the colorist that is dyeing your hair red. One thing is sure: if you like dimension, these highlights and lowlights are the fun dark red hair color you’re looking for. - Source: Internet Bradford says that one trick for determining your skin’s undertone is through the color of your veins. “Look at your wrist in bright indirect light: cool tones will show blue/purple, neutral tones will show blue/green, warm tones will show green/olive,” he says. “Warm tones of skin will visibly appear red, orange, or yellow (golden) while cool tones will have somewhat blue, green or violet tints. If you have a hard time discerning visibly, you are most likely neutral meaning you have a mixture.” - Source: Internet This TWA style looks bright and sassy with a smart mix of copper and red color shades. The shorter sides and back have a deeper red hue, while the bright red ombre adds texture and definition to the curls. Keeping the base color dark really adds dimension and marries the short and long together. - Source: Internet Red is considered by many to be a classic nail polish color. But like all colors, it can be divided into cool and warm shades. Warm reds are yellow-based and tend to lean to the orange side. - Source: Internet Copper hair colour At its best against fair, medium and olive skin tones, copper hair colour is a mixture of red and bronze thrown together to create a warm and elegant hue. Like real metal, copper hair works when it’s bright and shining. Keep your copper locks from becoming dull and looking lacklustre with our guide to achieving healthy-looking hair. - Source: Internet Welcome pumpkin spice and all things nice! This rich copper shade has all the depth you need to warm up the colder seasons. A splendid color to dye hair dark, while still keeping it on the bright, warm side. We love this natural red hair color combined with a pale skin tone and tousled curls. - Source: Internet From natural strawberry red to copper to rich auburn, wine, and bright red ruby tones, red hair is always a head-turning choice. And while it might be a big change for some, it will continue to be a top hair color trend into 2020 and beyond. Next time you’re feeling fiery (or just want to enhance your natural shade), show your colorist one of these gorgeous takes on scarlet strands (including inspiration for red hair color with highlights) and find the best red hair color for your skin tone. - Source: Internet Although creative hair colors have seen more cultural acceptance over the past ten years or so, dark red hair feels like it’s held widespread popularity much longer. While cotton candy-type blue and pink hues might (wrongfully) garner some judgmental looks, burgundy and auburn locks have long been so common that they might as well be naturally occurring. Most “natural only” offices will even let these shades slip by without a second thought—they’re that embedded in the collective consciousness. - Source: Internet Here’s the thing about red hair: Even though it’s one of the prettiest hair colors out there (l mean, have you looked at your Insta feed lately?), it’s also a maaaajor commitment. “Red is the hardest color to maintain and also the hardest color to get rid of,” says Olivia Casanova, colorist at IGK Salon in New York, which means you’ll probably want to think twice before you scrap those dark-blonde highlights you’ve been getting all year. But if your heart is set on red—and, TBH, I don’t blame you—you’ll want to (A) make sure you have a color-safe, sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to keep your shade nice and vibrant at home, and (B) take plenty of inspo pics to your appointment, since there’s no such that as a single red shade. That’s why I rounded up the 25 prettiest red hair ideas (seen on the heads of Zendaya, Emma Roberts, Lucy Hale, and more) that’ll flatter virtually every skin tone and hair texture, ahead. - Source: Internet For cool tones, Kate Reid, KEVIN.MURPHY COLOR.ME Design Director, suggests experimenting with pinks, peach, gingers, auburn, cool coppers, deeper reds, or cinnamon shades. - Source: Internet This deep red color has me ready for winter wine. The plummy merlot shade can add a nice twist to both blonde and dark brown strands, enriching it with a shimmery light and reflective cherry red hue. If you’re looking for a good balance of depth and tone in your hair, this might be the shade calling you! - Source: Internet “The red hair color molecule is larger than other color molecules which is why it fades and rinses out so quickly,” he says. “Since this molecule doesn’t enter the cortex (center) of the hair easily, we want to keep the cuticle (shell) as sealed and healthy as possible.” - Source: Internet #22: Bold Red Hair with Blonde Highlights Bold red hair with blonde highlights is impressive! There’s nothing wrong with having retro chunky streaks of gold on your auburn red and blonde mane. This funky style is great for women who want to add some brightness to their red hair. Related: See more red hairstyles with blonde highlights. - Source: Internet What’s the best red hair shade for my skin tone? Red hair on pale skin When it comes to red hair and pale skin, you’ll want to avoid dark red hair tones as they’ll leave you looking washed out. Instead, opt for lighter, more natural shades such as strawberry blonde, copper and red sand. If you have naturally brown eyes, these shades of red hair will also accentuate them, and add warmth to your facial features. - Source: Internet #10: Dark Purple-Red Hair Here’s a dark purple-red hair color that you must go for. The combo of red hair, dark roots are refreshing to the eyes. When adding purple-red waves to a long haircut, the payoff is so shiny! It reminds us of red velvet cake! - Source: Internet As the saying goes, “In a world where you can be anything, be a fabulous redhead .” I can’t take credit for that quote, but it sure does make me want to go red! Whether you’re a blonde , brunette , or somewhere in between, you’ve probably thought about switching up your hair color before. Not only is red hair color bright and fun, but there are also numerous shades you can choose from depending on the look you’re trying to achieve. - Source: Internet Apricot blonde is the exact opposite of merlot: It’s perfect for anyone looking to go red who can’t imagine parting with their blonde locks. If you’re a natural blonde who’s always thought about going red, this shade is just for you. To achieve this hue, your colorist will hand paint subtle shades of reddish apricot atop your blonde locks. - Source: Internet If you’re contemplating whether you can pull off red hair, just go ahead and stop right there. You heard it here first: It doesn’t matter if you’re the fairest of fair or melanin-rich — there’s a fiery hue out there that will work for you. And one that will earn you oodles of compliments to boot. Still skeptical? Give us a chance to change your mind. - Source: Internet Overall, these are the best clothing colors for redheads. Wearing these colors will definitely make you look fabulous. However, always keep in mind that being stylish and fashionable is all about confidence and attitude. As such, you can wear other clothing colors, and you will still look great as long as you walk feeling confident and with your head held high. - Source: Internet #18: Dark Brown Hair with Red Highlights Ginger up your short dark brown hair with red highlights for such a chic dimension. These dark red curls accentuate even more when matched with a shoulder-length bob that keeps the curls full. Spritz a dry texture spray as a finishing touch to show off the movement better in your red hair. - Source: Internet This dark red-brown hair works well on women looking for classy natural looks. Add in caramel and warm chocolate tones to give natural radiation to the dark hair base. Chunky caramel highlights will be a super trendy face framing. - Source: Internet New hair color, new makeup choices. Because red hair is so vibrant, you want to choose makeup colors that don’t compete with it. Since I went red, I’ve relied on subtle greens and purples for pops of color. However, don’t steer away from red lipstick. Jessica Chastain is a perfect example of a redhead who wears a red lip successfully. - Source: Internet Look to A-listers like Emma Stone, Blake Lively, our girl RiRi, and Lupita Nyong’o, all of whom have managed to slay the scarlet hair game at one time or another.

Now get those fingers to scrolling and read on about how to find the perfect shade of crimson just for you. Here are 27 red hair color ideas for every skin tone. - Source: Internet “Dark red hair is different from copper and other red tones as it is on the deeper side of the spectrum,” Pickthorn says, “Depending on what your natural color is, generally deeper reds show more in the light and have a reflection that reads red. Many times the undertones are red-orange or red-violet.” - Source: Internet This dark red hair screams fall 2021. The rich dark auburn shade paired with the shaggy bob is very on-trend. This type of hair color is beautiful in different lights, giving hair a warm glow in the natural light. - Source: Internet If honey blonde is the shade every woman tries to go in time for summer, light red is the same Holy Grail shade for redheads.

An excellent way to dye hair red and make your dark skin and green eyes stand out, without compromising the health of your strands. - Source: Internet Another way to determine your undertone is through the “fabric” test, says celebrity colorist Jeremy Tardo. “An easy way to determine your skin’s undertones at home is to examine your complexion next to a stark white or jet black fabric,” he says. “Look into a mirror and hold the fabric up behind you or to the side of your face. Are your natural tones golden next to the fabric? Do you see reddish hues, pink, or even green? If you see none of these, your natural tone may be quite neutral in which case, you can wear almost any hair color well.” - Source: Internet Coral red hair Coral red hair has a rosy-orange undertone and really brings out the colour of blue and green eyes. It works on a multitude of different skin tones - from fair and medium to olive and dark. Because of its brightness, your stylist will need to bleach your hair to achieve this particular shade. Bleach can be quite rough on your locks, so after your trip to the salon, we’d recommend following our tips on giving your hair some post-bleaching TLC. - Source: Internet #6: Dimensional Red and Brunette Balayage A dimensional red and brunette balayage is a fun way to play with colors while transitioning back to a dark one.

Skintones can also be cool or warm. Natural <strong>red</strong>heads usually have a warm undertone to their skin. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Your undertone usually falls into one of three categories: cool, neutral, and warm. According to Aaron Bradford, colorist at NYC-based hair studio Cedric Salon, “cool” undertones have hints of blue, green, and violet in their skin, while “warm” tones appear <strong>red</strong>, orange, golden, or yellow. As for “neutral” hues, their undertones are usually a mix of warm and cool tones, which means this lucky bunch is able to find a wider variety of hair <strong>colors</strong> that flatter them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Merlot hair color is perfect for anyone who wants to go <strong>red</strong> but can’t imagine parting with their dark locks. The <strong>red</strong> wine-inspi<strong>red</strong> shade is a beautiful blend of rich brown, burgundy, and juicy cherry <strong>red</strong>. It also has the added benefit of being one of the most low maintenance <strong>red</strong> hair <strong>colors</strong> available. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This hair color is all about customization. If you want to add a subtle <strong>red</strong> hue to your dark brown locks, ask your colorist for burgundy and cherry <strong>red</strong> highlights or ombre. If you want your merlot hue to resemble a fruity sangria more closely, ask your colorist for an all-over deep cherry <strong>red</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Can’t decide between dark and bright hair? Check out this melty auburn-<strong>red</strong> mix. With dark <strong>red</strong> hair, you get the benefit of depth at the root. Bright pops of auburn tones help you get the best out of the <strong>red</strong> balayage for this season. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Red hair—particularly the shades that incorporate blonde—is an inc<strong>red</strong>ibly summery look. Strawberry is certainly one of those beach-ready shades. The brighter, blonder version of copper looks lovely alongside a light tan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blondes may have more fun (or so they say), but it’s <strong>red</strong>heads that really have the most options when choosing makeup <strong>colors</strong>. In short, pretty much anything goes when you have <strong>red</strong> hair. Why? “Greens and blues will really make the hair color pop, since they fall opposite <strong>red</strong> on the color wheel,” explains celebrity makeup artist and beauty expert Bryan Cantor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There’s an old saying that states <strong>red</strong>heads should never wear <strong>red</strong>. However, this saying is a myth because <strong>red</strong> is one of the most flattering clothing <strong>colors</strong> for <strong>red</strong>heads. The key is to find the shade that works best with your hair color. For example, <strong>red</strong> with a purplish tinge will complement your hair, but those with an orange hue will not. Bright <strong>red</strong> is also a good choice if you want to look bold and daring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue is a soothing color, and it can accentuate <strong>red</strong> hair, thanks to the perfect contrast between the two shades. To be specific, <strong>red</strong>heads will look stunning on cobalt, navy, and powder blue. Brighter shades, like turquoise blue, are also flattering to your tresses. Denim blue is also a great choice because it can enhance the true color of your strands. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Finding clothing <strong>colors</strong> that compliments your <strong>red</strong> hair can be a bit challenging. Some <strong>red</strong>heads don’t wear bright-colo<strong>red</strong> clothes because they fear that the shade may clash with their tresses. However, saturated hues are recommended for women with <strong>red</strong> hair. To give you a better view, here are some of the best clothing <strong>colors</strong> for <strong>red</strong>heads. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol><li>Strawberry blonde Also known as “<strong>red</strong> sand”, strawberry blonde is a type of light ginger hair. It&rsquo;s a fantastic shade if you want to suffuse blonde sun streaks with <strong>red</strong> blonde highlights and maintain that sun-kissed hue year round. For the ultimate beach babe look, style your <strong>red</strong> sand hair with bouncy, tousled waves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>When you go <strong>red</strong>, there’s always the option to really go <strong>red</strong>. This neon shade is straight out of a comic strip or spy novel. Be warned that bright shades tend to fade quickly, so you’ll need to discuss a custom care routine with your stylist. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Eager to try a <strong>red</strong> hair color? We don’t blame you! When it comes to achieving the <strong>red</strong> shade of your dreams, however, it’s best to avoid DIYing it at-home. Red is a notoriously finicky color, so we always recommend leaving your <strong>red</strong> hair color transformation to a salon professional. They’ll be able to create a specific formula using professional color to help you leave the salon with the best possible results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you love copper penny hair and want to take it to the next level, copper fire hair is perfect for you. This quintessential <strong>red</strong> hue is guaranteed to multiply your compliments this year. Bond says the only way to do this color justice is to go completely <strong>red</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This curly queen has gone for the dark <strong>red</strong> burgundy shade with an ombre effect. Dark roots pai<strong>red</strong> with brighter pops on the ends do bring lots of fun and work amazingly for perky curls and dark skin tones. Texture in the hair shows off the dimensional shade of <strong>red</strong>, and we love it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Warm peachy <strong>red</strong> is having a real moment. By now, you’ve probably seen the shade in dozens of matte lipstick tubes, blush palettes, and the like. Instead of applying the color to our lips, we’d rather wear it in a way that’s semi-permanent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Who said never play with fire? Turn up the heat with this flaming hot medium to dark <strong>red</strong> balayage. This dark color does not only melt intense depth and true <strong>red</strong> tones but also incorporates fiery <strong>red</strong> highlights to bring that extra spectacle. A true attention grabber. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple is the color of royalty, and <strong>red</strong>heads will look regal wearing a purple-colo<strong>red</strong> dress. However, you should avoid muted shades, like lavender, because they can wash out your hair color. Instead, you can opt for bright and electric shades to accentuate your tresses. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We spoke to some of the top celebrity colorists about the best <strong>red</strong> hair color ideas for 2022, no matter your skin tone. Some general advice: Softer peach and cinnamon look great on pale skin, deep violets and cranberries complement deep skin, and Zendaya-esque rubies and coppers look inc<strong>red</strong>ible on everyone. Scroll on for some hair-color inspo, and get ready to book an appointment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>#24: Dark Copper Red Hair Dark copper <strong>red</strong> hair is one of the most flattering shades that matches almost every skin tone. Of course, you still can have the benefits of warm <strong>red</strong> tones to go with a darker shade. This vibrant and bold hairstyle is so smooth on straight hair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Red hair is having a moment. From Jessica Chastain‘s bright copper to Amy Adams‘ strawberry blonde, the color made some show-stopping appearances on the <strong>red</strong> carpet this season. Thinking of going <strong>red</strong> yourself? Before you schedule your color job, consider whether you have what it takes to pull off the look. I spoke with Rick Wellman, co-owner of Patrick Melville Salon in New York City (who recently gave my locks a much needed copper touchup) about what you need to consider before committing to your own <strong>red</strong> hair makeover. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Unlike pink-infused hair, blood orange is all about the juicy notes. There’s barely a hint of <strong>red</strong> here. Instead, the shade is primarily an orangey blonde that looks a little space-age chic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Don’t want your hair to have a strong <strong>red</strong> hue? This warm medium auburn hue is a great compromise for those who want to gently glow up their look with a darker shade of <strong>red</strong>. It can be a little gentler on a pale skin tone too. Perfect for those of you eager to play it on the safe side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another trick to finding your color match? Look at the colo<strong>red</strong> flecks in your irises. “The gold/yellow flecks in the iris mean the warmer <strong>red</strong>s will be flattering,” Rick says. Cool blue or brown flecks mean cooler-toned <strong>red</strong> are the better option. Your jewelry choices can also be an indication: “Whether you are drawn to silver or gold jewelry can also point you towards your cool or warm <strong>red</strong> hair color compass.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“Neutral skin tones are a little more flexible as you can wear almost anything,” says Reid. “Opt for richer <strong>red</strong> shades, violets or mahogany auburn, or even look to combining shades by adding in more natural <strong>red</strong> or flecks of warm toffee shades.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=3><li>Cherry <strong>red</strong> hair colour A vibrant mixture of deep <strong>red</strong> and purple tones, cherry <strong>red</strong> hair works well on skin that tans easily and is equally great at accentuating brown eyes. It works especially well with a short bob hairstyle for a Parisian chic look. If you&rsquo;re keen to create this vibrant cherry shade, check out our Radiant Red Deep Cherry Brown vegan-friendly <strong>red</strong> hair dye. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Unlike platinum blonde hair, which only looks good on certain people, <strong>red</strong> can work for anyone. The trick is to finding the right <strong>red</strong> for your skin tone. “Freckles, pale skin and light eyes work best with strawberry blonde and copper <strong>red</strong>s. Darker eyes with cooler skin tones work best with deeper true <strong>red</strong>s and violet tones,” Rick explains. Emma Stone, a natural blonde, pulls off copper effortlessly while Rihanna’s complexion is compatible with a true <strong>red</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=5><li>Bright orange hair Bright orange adds a vivacious &lsquo;pop&rsquo; to your copper hair, while also complementing cooler skin tones. This fiery <strong>red</strong> hair colour is vibrant to say the least and can be combined nicely with other shades through balayage or ombre colouring techniques. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Here’s another infinitely wearable shade of <strong>red</strong>. This caramel-influenced color suits women of all skin tones, combining ashy notes with warm <strong>red</strong> and brown. Instead of spending another year on the same old caramel hair, add a surprising flash of <strong>red</strong> to the mix. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=4><li>Dark burgundy hair Similar to &lsquo;merlot&rsquo; in colour, the violet elements of this shade will enhance golden skin tones. It definitely leans more towards the darker side of the <strong>red</strong> hair spectrum, so keep the colour in check with our Radiant Red range , comprised of shampoo and conditioner that work wonders at boosting your colour. Dark burgundy hair adds an elegance that works great for long hair, and is a superb hairstyle option for Halloween. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>If you’re headed to the salon to get your color, Tardo says that most salons usually have mix-in options to increase the longevity of your <strong>red</strong> hair. However, if you’re a DIY kind of person, you can easily craft your new <strong>red</strong> shade in the comfort of your own home with a trusty box dye. Tardo recommends using <strong>red</strong> shades from the Clairol Nice’N Easy collection, and touch-ups can be easily achieved with the Tressa Water<strong>colors</strong> Shampoo, which will help <strong>red</strong>eposit <strong>red</strong> into your hair between coloring sessions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This look is a true <strong>red</strong> hair color. While still falling under the darker <strong>red</strong> category due to shadow roots, it’s one of the brighter variations of dark <strong>red</strong> hair. This look adds a little drama and energy and would be great if you need a burst of vivid color in your life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dimensional jewel-like tones work like magic if you want to dye brunette hair dark <strong>red</strong>. Pops of dark <strong>red</strong> highlights through a deep ruby <strong>red</strong> will certainly update any hairdo. The contrast of the highlights and lowlights pai<strong>red</strong> with the lob wavy style is simply gorgeous. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>#32: Plum Red for Curly Hair This is a plum <strong>red</strong> for curly hair ombre. Don’t you love how vibrant the color came out? Long Beach, CA hair colorist Griffin Rangel says, “this is for women looking for something new and fun. It’s something that isn’t too crazy but will get people to notice your hair.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bond assures us that with the proper products and hair care routine, you can keep your color looking as vibrant and fabulous as the day you walked out of the salon. To keep your <strong>red</strong> hue looking fresh between appointments, Bond suggests swapping out your regular shampoo and conditioner with a system formulated to protect color-treated hair. The stylist recommends L&rsquo;Oréal Professionnel Serie Expert Vitamino A-OX Color Preserve Shampoo and Conditioner to her clients. This system provides color and UV protection to help prolong color radiance and enhance shine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Glints of a ruby hair shade powerfully bring this dark hair color to life. The dark <strong>red</strong> hair pai<strong>red</strong> with the ripple wave shouts Jessica Rabbit. This super sexy warm <strong>red</strong> look is enough to give us all hair color envy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>#8: Dark Reddish Strawberry Blonde Hair Dark <strong>red</strong>dish strawberry blonde hair is a warm color that complements pale skin. “It’s trendy, and any woman of any age can rock it,” says stylist Tori Skrot of Pennsylvania. “We used Lanza to color the roots and pop lowlights in slices and weaves,” Skrot states. Skrot also points out that this <strong>red</strong> hair color is high maintenance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Light <strong>red</strong> tones in this dark <strong>red</strong> hair add glimmers of it all. Mind that color ideas like this one depend not only on the shade that you go for but also on the mastery of the colorist that is dyeing your hair <strong>red</strong>. One thing is sure: if you like dimension, these highlights and lowlights are the fun dark <strong>red</strong> hair color you’re looking for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bradford says that one trick for determining your skin’s undertone is through the color of your veins. “Look at your wrist in bright indirect light: cool tones will show blue/purple, neutral tones will show blue/green, warm tones will show green/olive,” he says. “Warm tones of skin will visibly appear <strong>red</strong>, orange, or yellow (golden) while cool tones will have somewhat blue, green or violet tints. If you have a hard time discerning visibly, you are most likely neutral meaning you have a mixture.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This TWA style looks bright and sassy with a smart mix of copper and <strong>red</strong> color shades. The shorter sides and back have a deeper <strong>red</strong> hue, while the bright <strong>red</strong> ombre adds texture and definition to the curls. Keeping the base color dark really adds dimension and marries the short and long together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Red is conside<strong>red</strong> by many to be a classic nail polish color. But like all <strong>colors</strong>, it can be divided into cool and warm shades. Warm <strong>red</strong>s are yellow-based and tend to lean to the orange side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=2><li>Copper hair colour At its best against fair, medium and olive skin tones, copper hair colour is a mixture of <strong>red</strong> and bronze thrown together to create a warm and elegant hue. Like real metal, copper hair works when it’s bright and shining. Keep your copper locks from becoming dull and looking lacklustre with our guide to achieving healthy-looking hair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Welcome pumpkin spice and all things nice! This rich copper shade has all the depth you need to warm up the colder seasons. A splendid color to dye hair dark, while still keeping it on the bright, warm side. We love this natural <strong>red</strong> hair color combined with a pale skin tone and tousled curls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>From natural strawberry <strong>red</strong> to copper to rich auburn, wine, and bright <strong>red</strong> ruby tones, <strong>red</strong> hair is always a head-turning choice. And while it might be a big change for some, it will continue to be a top hair color trend into 2020 and beyond. Next time you&rsquo;re feeling fiery (or just want to enhance your natural shade), show your colorist one of these gorgeous takes on scarlet strands (including inspiration for <strong>red</strong> hair color with highlights) and find the best <strong>red</strong> hair color for your skin tone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although creative hair <strong>colors</strong> have seen more cultural acceptance over the past ten years or so, dark <strong>red</strong> hair feels like it&rsquo;s held widespread popularity much longer. While cotton candy-type blue and pink hues might (wrongfully) garner some judgmental looks, burgundy and auburn locks have long been so common that they might as well be naturally occurring. Most &ldquo;natural only&rdquo; offices will even let these shades slip by without a second thought—they&rsquo;re that embedded in the collective consciousness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Here’s the thing about <strong>red</strong> hair: Even though it’s one of the prettiest hair <strong>colors</strong> out there (l mean, have you looked at your Insta feed lately?), it’s also a maaaajor commitment. “Red is the hardest color to maintain and also the hardest color to get rid of,” says Olivia Casanova, colorist at IGK Salon in New York, which means you’ll probably want to think twice before you scrap those dark-blonde highlights you’ve been getting all year. But if your heart is set on <strong>red</strong>—and, TBH, I don’t blame you—you’ll want to (A) make sure you have a color-safe, sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to keep your shade nice and vibrant at home, and (B) take plenty of inspo pics to your appointment, since there&rsquo;s no such that as a single <strong>red</strong> shade. That&rsquo;s why I rounded up the 25 prettiest <strong>red</strong> hair ideas (seen on the heads of Zendaya, Emma Roberts, Lucy Hale, and more) that&rsquo;ll flatter virtually every skin tone and hair texture, ahead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For cool tones, Kate Reid, KEVIN.MURPHY COLOR.ME Design Director, suggests experimenting with pinks, peach, gingers, auburn, cool coppers, deeper <strong>red</strong>s, or cinnamon shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This deep <strong>red</strong> color has me ready for winter wine. The plummy merlot shade can add a nice twist to both blonde and dark brown strands, enriching it with a shimmery light and reflective cherry <strong>red</strong> hue. If you’re looking for a good balance of depth and tone in your hair, this might be the shade calling you! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“The <strong>red</strong> hair color molecule is larger than other color molecules which is why it fades and rinses out so quickly,” he says. “Since this molecule doesn’t enter the cortex (center) of the hair easily, we want to keep the cuticle (shell) as sealed and healthy as possible.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>#22: Bold Red Hair with Blonde Highlights Bold <strong>red</strong> hair with blonde highlights is impressive! There’s nothing wrong with having retro chunky streaks of gold on your auburn <strong>red</strong> and blonde mane. This funky style is great for women who want to add some brightness to their <strong>red</strong> hair.

Red hair on pale skin When it comes to <strong>red</strong> hair and pale skin, you&rsquo;ll want to avoid dark <strong>red</strong> hair tones as they’ll leave you looking washed out. Instead, opt for lighter, more natural shades such as strawberry blonde, copper and <strong>red</strong> sand. If you have naturally brown eyes, these shades of <strong>red</strong> hair will also accentuate them, and add warmth to your facial features. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>#10: Dark Purple-Red Hair Here’s a dark purple-<strong>red</strong> hair color that you must go for. The combo of <strong>red</strong> hair, dark roots are refreshing to the eyes. When adding purple-<strong>red</strong> waves to a long haircut, the payoff is so shiny! It reminds us of <strong>red</strong> velvet cake! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As the saying goes, “In a world where you can be anything, be a fabulous <strong>red</strong>head .” I can’t take c<strong>red</strong>it for that quote, but it sure does make me want to go <strong>red</strong>! Whether you’re a blonde , brunette , or somewhere in between, you’ve probably thought about switching up your hair color before. Not only is <strong>red</strong> hair color bright and fun, but there are also numerous shades you can choose from depending on the look you&rsquo;re trying to achieve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Apricot blonde is the exact opposite of merlot: It’s perfect for anyone looking to go <strong>red</strong> who can’t imagine parting with their blonde locks. If you’re a natural blonde who’s always thought about going <strong>red</strong>, this shade is just for you. To achieve this hue, your colorist will hand paint subtle shades of <strong>red</strong>dish apricot atop your blonde locks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;re contemplating whether you can pull off <strong>red</strong> hair, just go ahead and stop right there.

Many times the undertones are <strong>red</strong>-orange or <strong>red</strong>-violet.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This dark <strong>red</strong> hair screams fall 2021.

Ask your colorist for a dark <strong>red</strong> wine hair color to match your mid-length mane. Since your base color is already dark, applying a rich <strong>red</strong> takes your colorist less time and less money. Red wine hues can give you a sophisticated, yet sweet vibe!

Are your natural tones golden next to the fabric? Do you see <strong>red</strong>dish hues, pink, or even green? If you see none of these, your natural tone may be quite neutral in which case, you can wear almost any hair color well.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=8><li>Coral <strong>red</strong> hair Coral <strong>red</strong> hair has a rosy-orange undertone and really brings out the colour of blue and green eyes. It works on a multitude of different skin tones - from fair and medium to olive and dark. Because of its brightness, your stylist will need to bleach your hair to achieve this particular shade. Bleach can be quite rough on your locks, so after your trip to the salon, we&rsquo;d recommend following our tips on giving your hair some post-bleaching TLC. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>#6: Dimensional Red and Brunette Balayage A dimensional <strong>red</strong> and brunette balayage is a fun way to play with <strong>colors</strong> while transitioning back to a dark one. Going from light to dark takes time to properly fill and create a dimensional tone. With this in mind, try that bold <strong>red</strong> or copper you’ve always wanted to. There’s no commitment and will be more gentle on your hair as you transition back to a dark color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>#4: Dark Brick Red Wavy Hair Wavy hair in a dark brick <strong>red</strong> shade is a great option.

The <strong>red</strong> color looks different in the light and it’s a color that’s shiny and rich. This dark <strong>red</strong> hair dye is high-maintenance.
