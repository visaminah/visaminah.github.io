The regulations set-out detailed guidance on how to safely install electrics in bathroom spaces. Therefore, make sure you always refer to your bs7671 guide when preparing works. - Source: Internet IP ratings are used in the UK to show the level of protection around electrical equipment and lighting. Electrical appliances are assigned a certain IP rating which indicates how much protection they provide against ingress of water and other particles. Each zone has a minimum requirement that must be met if a fitting is to be installed in this area. - Source: Internet This zone requires a minimum of IP68. This is the area within a bath tub or shower. Only 12V SELV (Safety Extra Low Voltage) equipment can be used. - Source: Internet Zone 0 is inside the bath or shower itself. Any fitting used in this bathroom zone must be low voltage, (max 12V) and be rated at least IP67 which is total immersion proof. (We do not currently have any fittings that are suitable for Zone 0) - Source: Internet Zone 0: Any area that will be submerged in water. In bathrooms, this only really applies to lights that will be installed in bathtubs below the waterline. Electrical appliances in this zone must meet a rating of IPX7 (it is a given that any item that can be submerged in water will also be immune to dust and other particles). - Source: Internet This space refers to the standing area above the bathtub, from the floor, up to the upper limit of the box. In terms of width, this zone includes the full expanse of the bath, not just the seating area. Therefore, candidates should consider external bathtub handles when calculating this space. - Source: Internet Zone 2 is an area stretching 0.6m outside the perimeter of the bath and to a height of 2.25m from the floor. In these bathroom zones an IP rating of at least IP44 is required. In addition, it is good practice to consider the area around a wash basin, within a 60cm radius of any tap, to be considered as zone 2. - Source: Internet When it comes to bathroom design and electrical safety, all bathrooms can be divided into zones. Each zone is based on how close it is to the water sources in the room (taps, showers and the like). In each of these zones, any electrical appliances installed will need to have a certain IP Rating to ensure they are safe to use in that particular space. - Source: Internet An IP rating is always indicated by the initials ‘IP’ followed by two digits. The first digit indicates the level of protection from solids, so you can ignore the first digit when looking for bathroom lights. It is the second digit you want to pay attention to, as this indicates how water resistant the light is. The higher the digit, the more water resistant your light will be. - Source: Internet A bathroom typically is a wet area but it is divided into zones which are based on how near you get to the water e.g. basin taps or shower cubicle. See the diagram for different zones. - Source: Internet The bathroom is split up into three different zones. The zonal requirements of each area are mainly dependent upon the risk level of water getting close to or touching the electrical supply. This would cause damage to the installation but more importantly poses a risk of electric shock. The three bathroom zones are: - Source: Internet By knowing the right IP rating and the regulations around bathroom zoning when installing an extractor fan you can prevent issues going forwards. Always look for the product’s IP rating when making a purchase. By knowing the extractor fans IP rating and the relevant bathroom zones you can ensure that the ventilation product is protected against water when it is installed. All mains circuits within a bathroom must be installed and protected in line with the current wiring regulations. - Source: Internet The area above the bath or shower tray area to a height of 2.25m from the finished floor level. In this zone a minimum rating requirement is IPX4. - Source: Internet Bathrooms are defined as areas of increased electrical hazard. According to the IET 18th Edition Wiring Regulations (Section 701), it is necessary to install ventilation products that meet a minimum of IPX4 in Zones 1 and 2 of a bathroom. This means that when installed correctly the product should prevent ingress of water and remain safe for use without the potential to cause harm to the end user i.e electrical shocks or electrocution. - Source: Internet The IP rating removes any confusion by allowing a person to easily refer a table and determine the suitability of an electrical appliance for any location in a bathroom. Where a product has an IP rating provided, HeatandPlumb.com lists it in the product details so you can be confident that it’s safe before you make a purchase. - Source: Internet Did you know that the location and type of lighting in your bathroom is dictated by bathroom lighting zones? Lighting a bathroom is different to lighting any other room in your house due to the high levels of moisture and steam present. These unique conditions mean that any lighting installed in your bathroom has to be appropriately water resistant to ensure both your safety and the longevity and performance of the lighting itself. Bathroom light regulations exist to guide you on what each bathroom light zone is and what type of lighting you should use. - Source: Internet As an example, a Hib back-lit mirror has a rating of IP44. This means it is safe for installation in a bathroom but should not be subjected to direct water exposure. A HiB shower light has a rating of IP65, meaning it is completely safe in an environment where it will be sprayed with water. - Source: Internet The area reaching 0.6m outside the bath’s perimeter, up to a height of 2.25m from the floor. Many experts in the field also recommend considering the area around a wash basin, within a 60cm radius of taps, as Zone 2. Zone 3 (also referred to as ‘Outside Zones’): These are basically any areas that lie outside Zones 0, 1 and 2 and where no water jets will be used. - Source: Internet All bathroom extractor fans are given an IP rating, which relate to which zones they are suitable for. The first digit of an IP rating describes its protection against solid materials such as dust and debris, and the second digit relates to the extractor fans protection from water and moisture. The higher the number, the more protection it has. If the first digit is shows an X this means that the product has not been tested against solid materials, this is usually because the unit will not come into contact with many solid objects. - Source: Internet The area stretching 0.6m outside the perimeter of the bath to a height of 2.25m. As with Zone 1, the minimum rating for this zone is IPX4. - Source: Internet Zone 1 is the area above the bath or shower tray to a height of 2.25m from the floor. Any fitting used in this zone must have a minimum rating of IP65 , which means it is protected against water spray from all directions. - Source: Internet Our guide will walk you through each context (i.e., bath, shower, wet room) and the zonal considerations for these environments. Again, candidates and electricians must flag if any information is ambiguous as specialist locations can be volatile. Installations must be carried out with confidence and assurance. - Source: Internet The type of product that requires an IP rating in the bathroom does vary, but generally it’s anything that uses electricity. This could be any sort of lighting or extractor fan fitted on the wall or within the ceilings. You need to know the minimum rating required in your chosen zone to make sure you are fitting electrics safely and legally in your bathroom. - Source: Internet The upper box threshold should always be 2.25m (or the highest fixed head or outlet, whichever is higher). This applies to all ‘bathroom’ contexts, whether navigating bathtub, shower, or wet room functions. - Source: Internet Zone 0 – This zone covers the areas inside the bath or shower tray. If you do decide to fit lights here they need to be a minimum of IP67 which means that they are safe to be fully immersed. They also need to be low voltage. - Source: Internet The problem with decorative lighting in bath zones in bathrooms is…….most of the pretty lights we love to see in our bathrooms are not IP65 – for lots of really good technical reasons….which we won’t get lost in right now. - Source: Internet Zone 2 is the area immediately adjacent to the bathtub, i.e., the additional 0.6m added for safety purposes. Again, any equipment should be subjected to an IPX4 grading. - Source: Internet The Ingress Protection (IP) Standard is a rating system for categorising electrical appliances by their ability to keep out foreign bodies, such as dust particles and water. For bathroom electronics, this is most relevant in preventing water from entering the appliance and causing a potentially dangerous malfunction. This system is now the standard in the UK and should be conformed to when designing and purchasing appliances for your bathroom. - Source: Internet Once you have an understanding of bathroom zones, you can confidently start to explore your bathroom lighting ideas, as well as any other electrical fittings you might be interested in incorporating. When choosing, you will notice that these kinds of items all come with an IP rating. But what does this mean? - Source: Internet The interior of the bath or shower tray itself. Any appliance installed in this zone must have a minimum rating of IPX7, which is total immersion proof. It is not recommended to install any ventilation product directly into this zone. - Source: Internet Zone 1 is the area above the bath to a height of 2.25m from the floor. If the fitting is 240V a 3oma residual current device (RCD) must also be used to protect the circuit in this zone. An IP65 rating is recommended. - Source: Internet Zone 1 – Includes the area directly above the bath or shower tray to a height of 2.25m. Lights being fitted within this area must have an IP rating of IP44 or better which means they are protected against water spray and splashing from any direction. - Source: Internet Zone 2: Lighting placed either side of the bath, shower or wash basin up to 600mm (0.6m) outside the perimeter of the water sources and up to 2.25m from the floor. - Source: Internet This article will comprehensively take you through the required installation practices for bathrooms containing bathtubs, showers and wet rooms respectively. Given the elevated risk involved, electricians must undertake a range of safety precautions to protect domestic and commercial users. Candidates are advised to focus on the specifications attached to each ‘zone’, and understand corresponding measurements which are essential to safe installs. - Source: Internet Zone 1: A shower area, whether an enclosed shower or a bathtub with a shower nozzle, up to a height of 2.25 metres. The minimum IP rating for an appliance in this zone is IP44, meaning it must be protected against all solid objects and any splashing liquid. - Source: Internet Zone 2 – Covers the area 0.6m outside the perimeter of the bath. This area also requires a light fitting to be IP44 of better. It’s also considered best practice to incorporate the sink into zone 2 and apply the same perimeter and light fitting requirements as you would the bath. - Source: Internet Zone 0 - Inside the bath or shower. Any fittings used here must be SELV (Separated Extra Low Voltage - Max. 12V) and have a minimum rating of IPX7 (IP67) (protected against immersion in water - total immersion proof). - Source: Internet If the area underneath the tub is easily accessible, then this should be integrated into Zone 1. However, if it is blocked by a barrier or panel (requiring a key/tool to gain entry), this is classified as the ‘outside zone’. This should be prepared accordingly to the provisions set out under this space (information on this area later). - Source: Internet Requires a minimum of IP44. This is the area directly above a bath and within a shower cubicle, up to 2.25M in height. - Source: Internet When installing in this zone, electrical equipment should be IPX7 rated, which dually accommodates submersion. It is critical that voltage does not exceed 12VAC or 30VDC in this area. Furthermore, it must be a SELV (separated extra-low voltage) circuit only, and a 230V transformer supporting this end must be located outside of the bathroom (zones). ELV (extra low voltage) cables are permitted to travel in this zone and others. - Source: Internet Bathroom zones are areas where electrical equipment must offer a certain degree of protection against water. The bathroom zone number refers to the amount of water likely to be present. The lower the zone number, the higher the IP rating needs to be. - Source: Internet To fully understand bathroom zones you should first have knowledge of IP ratings. IP stands for International Protection but is more commonly known as Ingress Protection. When X is used it means that protection against solids is not important. - Source: Internet The most pertinent questions always serve to provide an understanding of three key areas. Firstly, what the ‘zones’ are, secondly how they are calibrated, and, thirdly, what wiring needs to be RCD protected. This guide should ultimately answer all those questions for you, but, as referenced above, it’s important to ascertain this information in the context of the installation, given the potential for variance. - Source: Internet Guidance for locations containing a bath, shower or wet room is located in Part 7 (Special Installations \u0026 Locations), Section 701, and includes a full set of instructions along with supplementary diagrams. As per its installation support process, candidates will be walked through each stage of the task. Judging workspace conditions, considering the provision of equipment, subsequently selecting the right equipment, and the commissioning through appropriate testing and inspection. Therefore, any information you require should be present in this all-encompassing workbook. - Source: Internet The area inside the bath or shower — this would also apply to shower enclosures and wet rooms too. Zone 1: The area above the bath or shower up to a height of 2.25 from floor level. - Source: Internet To illustrate IP zoning regulations, we have divided the illustration of a bathroom below into zones. These are classified using the numbers 0, 1 and 2. The lower the zone number, the higher the IP (Ingress Protection) rating must be. - Source: Internet Width: This should be the width of the bathtub, plus 0.6m (60cm). Therefore, if the bathtub measured 0.7m (70cm), your box width would be 1.3m (130 cm) - Source: Internet Unsurprisingly, Zone 2 is always adjacent to zone 1 and also around the other water outlets such as the basin. It is an area where the risk of water splashes are not so probable, stretching 0.6m out from the basin tap or zone 1 area. In this zone an IP rating of at least IP44 is required. - Source: Internet One of the areas of the house we get asked the most questions about is the bathroom or wet room. Around the vast majority of your home you’re free to add which ever light fittings take your fancy. However in the bathroom things become a little more complex as there are specific regulations that govern what type of lights can and can’t be used. - Source: Internet Zone 3 is anywhere outside zones 0, 1, and 2 (subject to specific limits) and where no water jet is likely to be used. No IP rating is required. However, if there is a likelihood of water jets being used for cleaning purposes in zones 1, 2 and 3, a fitting rated a minimum IP65 must be used. - Source: Internet I printed my cleaning list and declutter list and put them back to back in a plastic sheet. Ready to cross off the tasks as I go! During the week I keep the list in my cleaning caddy. That way I can use any spare minutes I have to do one of the tasks. No more marathon cleaning sessions…do you hear me?! LOL! The aim is not to cross everything off the list this week but to keep moving forward in this zone and get something (anything!) done. - Source: Internet Before starting, electricians should refer to Section 7 of the bs7671 18th edition. This part details appropriate regulations and advisory notes on specialist locations such as bathrooms. Remember, the guide breaks down how to approach a task from start to completion, so it is well worth reviewing prior to installation. - Source: Internet The higher the number, the better the protection. For example, IP44 is protected against penetration of solid objects up over 1mm and from splashes of water. An IP67 light fixture, meanwhile, is completely dust tight and can withstand temporary water immersion. Only a rating of IP68 bathroom lighting and electricals are water resistant against long periods of immersion. - Source: Internet Though potentially daunting, the IP rating is merely a reference system. Two numbers follow the letters IP, for example IP65. The first digit (0-6) refers to the object’s protection against foreign bodies, such as dust and tools, while the second (0-8) is its ability to keep out water, from general humidity to complete submersion. The latter of these is more likely to be a concern in bathroom appliances, such as shower lights. There are a number of letter suffixes that can be added to the end of the IP code, signifying a wide range of other traits (for example, protection against oil). - Source: Internet Here are a few tips to help you find information about Bathroom Zones:\r- Look for good places to get information about Zone 1 Bathroom Lights.

Each <strong>zone</strong> has a minimum requirement that must be met if a fitting is to be installed in this area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>zone</strong> requires a minimum of IP68. This is the area within a <strong>bath</strong> tub or shower. Only 12V SELV (Safety Extra Low Voltage) equipment can be used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Zone 0 is inside the <strong>bath</strong> or shower itself. Any fitting used in this <strong>bath</strong>room <strong>zone</strong> must be low voltage, (max 12V) and be rated at least IP67 which is total immersion proof. (We do not currently have any fittings that are suitable for Zone 0) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Zone 0: Any area that will be submerged in water. In <strong>bath</strong>rooms, this only really applies to lights that will be installed in <strong>bath</strong>tubs below the waterline. Electrical appliances in this <strong>zone</strong> must meet a rating of IPX7 (it is a given that any item that can be submerged in water will also be immune to dust and other particles). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This space refers to the standing area above the <strong>bath</strong>tub, from the floor, up to the upper limit of the box. In terms of width, this <strong>zone</strong> includes the full expanse of the <strong>bath</strong>, not just the seating area. Therefore, candidates should consider external <strong>bath</strong>tub handles when calculating this space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Zone 2 is an area stretching 0.6m outside the perimeter of the <strong>bath</strong> and to a height of 2.25m from the floor. In these <strong>bath</strong>room <strong>zone</strong>s an IP rating of at least IP44 is required. In addition, it is good practice to consider the area around a wash basin, within a 60cm radius of any tap, to be considered as <strong>zone</strong> 2. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to <strong>bath</strong>room design and electrical safety, all <strong>bath</strong>rooms can be divided into <strong>zone</strong>s. Each <strong>zone</strong> is based on how close it is to the water sources in the room (taps, showers and the like). In each of these <strong>zone</strong>s, any electrical appliances installed will need to have a certain IP Rating to ensure they are safe to use in that particular space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>An IP rating is always indicated by the initials ‘IP’ followed by two digits. The first digit indicates the level of protection from solids, so you can ignore the first digit when looking for <strong>bath</strong>room lights. It is the second digit you want to pay attention to, as this indicates how water resistant the light is. The higher the digit, the more water resistant your light will be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A <strong>bath</strong>room typically is a wet area but it is divided into <strong>zone</strong>s which are based on how near you get to the water e.g. basin taps or shower cubicle. See the diagram for different <strong>zone</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>bath</strong>room is split up into three different <strong>zone</strong>s. The zonal requirements of each area are mainly dependent upon the risk level of water getting close to or touching the electrical supply. This would cause damage to the installation but more importantly poses a risk of electric shock. The three <strong>bath</strong>room <strong>zone</strong>s are: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>By knowing the right IP rating and the regulations around <strong>bath</strong>room zoning when installing an extractor fan you can prevent issues going forwards. Always look for the product’s IP rating when making a purchase. By knowing the extractor fans IP rating and the relevant <strong>bath</strong>room <strong>zone</strong>s you can ensure that the ventilation product is protected against water when it is installed. All mains circuits within a <strong>bath</strong>room must be installed and protected in line with the current wiring regulations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The area above the <strong>bath</strong> or shower tray area to a height of 2.25m from the finished floor level. In this <strong>zone</strong> a minimum rating requirement is IPX4. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bathrooms are defined as areas of increased electrical hazard. According to the IET 18th Edition Wiring Regulations (Section 701), it is necessary to install ventilation products that meet a minimum of IPX4 in Zones 1 and 2 of a <strong>bath</strong>room. This means that when installed correctly the product should prevent ingress of water and remain safe for use without the potential to cause harm to the end user i.e electrical shocks or electrocution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The IP rating removes any confusion by allowing a person to easily refer a table and determine the suitability of an electrical appliance for any location in a <strong>bath</strong>room. Where a product has an IP rating provided, HeatandPlumb.com lists it in the product details so you can be confident that it&rsquo;s safe before you make a purchase. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Did you know that the location and type of lighting in your <strong>bath</strong>room is dictated by <strong>bath</strong>room lighting <strong>zone</strong>s? Lighting a <strong>bath</strong>room is different to lighting any other room in your house due to the high levels of moisture and steam present. These unique conditions mean that any lighting installed in your <strong>bath</strong>room has to be appropriately water resistant to ensure both your safety and the longevity and performance of the lighting itself. Bathroom light regulations exist to guide you on what each <strong>bath</strong>room light <strong>zone</strong> is and what type of lighting you should use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As an example, a Hib back-lit mirror has a rating of IP44. This means it is safe for installation in a <strong>bath</strong>room but should not be subjected to direct water exposure. A HiB shower light has a rating of IP65, meaning it is completely safe in an environment where it will be sprayed with water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The area reaching 0.6m outside the <strong>bath</strong>’s perimeter, up to a height of 2.25m from the floor. Many experts in the field also recommend considering the area around a wash basin, within a 60cm radius of taps, as Zone 2. Zone 3 (also referred to as ‘Outside Zones’): These are basically any areas that lie outside Zones 0, 1 and 2 and where no water jets will be used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>All <strong>bath</strong>room extractor fans are given an IP rating, which relate to which <strong>zone</strong>s they are suitable for. The first digit of an IP rating describes its protection against solid materials such as dust and debris, and the second digit relates to the extractor fans protection from water and moisture. The higher the number, the more protection it has. If the first digit is shows an X this means that the product has not been tested against solid materials, this is usually because the unit will not come into contact with many solid objects. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The area stretching 0.6m outside the perimeter of the <strong>bath</strong> to a height of 2.25m. As with Zone 1, the minimum rating for this <strong>zone</strong> is IPX4. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Zone 1 is the area above the <strong>bath</strong> or shower tray to a height of 2.25m from the floor. Any fitting used in this <strong>zone</strong> must have a minimum rating of IP65 , which means it is protected against water spray from all directions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Our guide will walk you through each context (i.e., <strong>bath</strong>, shower, wet room) and the zonal considerations for these environments. Again, candidates and electricians must flag if any information is ambiguous as specialist locations can be volatile. Installations must be carried out with confidence and assurance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The type of product that requires an IP rating in the <strong>bath</strong>room does vary, but generally it&rsquo;s anything that uses electricity. This could be any sort of lighting or extractor fan fitted on the wall or within the ceilings. You need to know the minimum rating required in your chosen <strong>zone</strong> to make sure you are fitting electrics safely and legally in your <strong>bath</strong>room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The upper box threshold should always be 2.25m (or the highest fixed head or outlet, whichever is higher). This applies to all ‘<strong>bath</strong>room’ contexts, whether navigating <strong>bath</strong>tub, shower, or wet room functions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Zone 0 – This <strong>zone</strong> covers the areas inside the <strong>bath</strong> or shower tray. If you do decide to fit lights here they need to be a minimum of IP67 which means that they are safe to be fully immersed. They also need to be low voltage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The problem with decorative lighting in <strong>bath</strong> <strong>zone</strong>s in <strong>bath</strong>rooms is&mldr;….most of the pretty lights we love to see in our <strong>bath</strong>rooms are not IP65 – for lots of really good technical reasons….which we won’t get lost in right now. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Zone 2 is the area immediately adjacent to the <strong>bath</strong>tub, i.e., the additional 0.6m added for safety purposes. Again, any equipment should be subjected to an IPX4 grading. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Ingress Protection (IP) Standard is a rating system for categorising electrical appliances by their ability to keep out foreign bodies, such as dust particles and water. For <strong>bath</strong>room electronics, this is most relevant in preventing water from entering the appliance and causing a potentially dangerous malfunction. This system is now the standard in the UK and should be conformed to when designing and purchasing appliances for your <strong>bath</strong>room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once you have an understanding of <strong>bath</strong>room <strong>zone</strong>s, you can confidently start to explore your <strong>bath</strong>room lighting ideas, as well as any other electrical fittings you might be interested in incorporating. When choosing, you will notice that these kinds of items all come with an IP rating. But what does this mean? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The interior of the <strong>bath</strong> or shower tray itself. Any appliance installed in this <strong>zone</strong> must have a minimum rating of IPX7, which is total immersion proof. It is not recommended to install any ventilation product directly into this <strong>zone</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Zone 1 is the area above the <strong>bath</strong> to a height of 2.25m from the floor. If the fitting is 240V a 3oma residual current device (RCD) must also be used to protect the circuit in this <strong>zone</strong>. An IP65 rating is recommended. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Zone 1 – Includes the area directly above the <strong>bath</strong> or shower tray to a height of 2.25m. Lights being fitted within this area must have an IP rating of IP44 or better which means they are protected against water spray and splashing from any direction. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Zone 2: Lighting placed either side of the <strong>bath</strong>, shower or wash basin up to 600mm (0.6m) outside the perimeter of the water sources and up to 2.25m from the floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This article will comprehensively take you through the required installation practices for <strong>bath</strong>rooms containing <strong>bath</strong>tubs, showers and wet rooms respectively. Given the elevated risk involved, electricians must undertake a range of safety precautions to protect domestic and commercial users. Candidates are advised to focus on the specifications attached to each ‘<strong>zone</strong>’, and understand corresponding measurements which are essential to safe installs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Zone 1: A shower area, whether an enclosed shower or a <strong>bath</strong>tub with a shower nozzle, up to a height of 2.25 metres. The minimum IP rating for an appliance in this <strong>zone</strong> is IP44, meaning it must be protected against all solid objects and any splashing liquid. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Zone 2 – Covers the area 0.6m outside the perimeter of the <strong>bath</strong>. This area also requires a light fitting to be IP44 of better. It’s also considered best practice to incorporate the sink into <strong>zone</strong> 2 and apply the same perimeter and light fitting requirements as you would the <strong>bath</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Zone 0 - Inside the <strong>bath</strong> or shower. Any fittings used here must be SELV (Separated Extra Low Voltage - Max. 12V) and have a minimum rating of IPX7 (IP67) (protected against immersion in water - total immersion proof). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If the area underneath the tub is easily accessible, then this should be integrated into Zone 1. However, if it is blocked by a barrier or panel (requiring a key/tool to gain entry), this is classified as the ‘outside <strong>zone</strong>’. This should be prepared accordingly to the provisions set out under this space (information on this area later). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Requires a minimum of IP44. This is the area directly above a <strong>bath</strong> and within a shower cubicle, up to 2.25M in height. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When installing in this <strong>zone</strong>, electrical equipment should be IPX7 rated, which dually accommodates submersion. It is critical that voltage does not exceed 12VAC or 30VDC in this area. Furthermore, it must be a SELV (separated extra-low voltage) circuit only, and a 230V transformer supporting this end must be located outside of the <strong>bath</strong>room (<strong>zone</strong>s). ELV (extra low voltage) cables are permitted to travel in this <strong>zone</strong> and others. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bathroom <strong>zone</strong>s are areas where electrical equipment must offer a certain degree of protection against water. The <strong>bath</strong>room <strong>zone</strong> number refers to the amount of water likely to be present. The lower the <strong>zone</strong> number, the higher the IP rating needs to be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To fully understand <strong>bath</strong>room <strong>zone</strong>s you should first have knowledge of IP ratings. IP stands for International Protection but is more commonly known as Ingress Protection. When X is used it means that protection against solids is not important. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The most pertinent questions always serve to provide an understanding of three key areas. Firstly, what the ‘<strong>zone</strong>s’ are, secondly how they are calibrated, and, thirdly, what wiring needs to be RCD protected. This guide should ultimately answer all those questions for you, but, as referenced above, it’s important to ascertain this information in the context of the installation, given the potential for variance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Guidance for locations containing a <strong>bath</strong>, shower or wet room is located in Part 7 (Special Installations & Locations), Section 701, and includes a full set of instructions along with supplementary diagrams. As per its installation support process, candidates will be walked through each stage of the task. Judging workspace conditions, considering the provision of equipment, subsequently selecting the right equipment, and the commissioning through appropriate testing and inspection. Therefore, any information you require should be present in this all-encompassing workbook. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The area inside the <strong>bath</strong> or shower — this would also apply to shower enclosures and wet rooms too. Zone 1: The area above the <strong>bath</strong> or shower up to a height of 2.25 from floor level. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To illustrate IP zoning regulations, we have divided the illustration of a <strong>bath</strong>room below into <strong>zone</strong>s. These are classified using the numbers 0, 1 and 2. The lower the <strong>zone</strong> number, the higher the IP (Ingress Protection) rating must be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Width: This should be the width of the <strong>bath</strong>tub, plus 0.6m (60cm). Therefore, if the <strong>bath</strong>tub measured 0.7m (70cm), your box width would be 1.3m (130 cm) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Unsurprisingly, Zone 2 is always adjacent to <strong>zone</strong> 1 and also around the other water outlets such as the basin. It is an area where the risk of water splashes are not so probable, stretching 0.6m out from the basin tap or <strong>zone</strong> 1 area. In this <strong>zone</strong> an IP rating of at least IP44 is required. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the areas of the house we get asked the most questions about is the <strong>bath</strong>room or wet room. Around the vast majority of your home you’re free to add which ever light fittings take your fancy. However in the <strong>bath</strong>room things become a little more complex as there are specific regulations that govern what type of lights can and can’t be used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Zone 3 is anywhere outside <strong>zone</strong>s 0, 1, and 2 (subject to specific limits) and where no water jet is likely to be used. No IP rating is required. However, if there is a likelihood of water jets being used for cleaning purposes in <strong>zone</strong>s 1, 2 and 3, a fitting rated a minimum IP65 must be used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I printed my cleaning list and declutter list and put them back to back in a plastic sheet. Ready to cross off the tasks as I go! During the week I keep the list in my cleaning caddy. That way I can use any spare minutes I have to do one of the tasks. No more marathon cleaning sessions…do you hear me?! LOL! The aim is not to cross everything off the list this week but to keep moving forward in this <strong>zone</strong> and get something (anything!) done. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before starting, electricians should refer to Section 7 of the bs7671 18th edition. This part details appropriate regulations and advisory notes on specialist locations such as <strong>bath</strong>rooms. Remember, the guide breaks down how to approach a task from start to completion, so it is well worth reviewing prior to installation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The higher the number, the better the protection. For example, IP44 is protected against penetration of solid objects up over 1mm and from splashes of water. An IP67 light fixture, meanwhile, is completely dust tight and can withstand temporary water immersion. Only a rating of IP68 <strong>bath</strong>room lighting and electricals are water resistant against long periods of immersion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Though potentially daunting, the IP rating is merely a reference system. Two numbers follow the letters IP, for example IP65. The first digit (0-6) refers to the object&rsquo;s protection against foreign bodies, such as dust and tools, while the second (0-8) is its ability to keep out water, from general humidity to complete submersion. The latter of these is more likely to be a concern in <strong>bath</strong>room appliances, such as shower lights. There are a number of letter suffixes that can be added to the end of the IP code, signifying a wide range of other traits (for example, protection against oil). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://www.architectureartdesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/16-Tremendous-Contemporary-Bathroom-Interior-Designs-To-Inspire-You-Today-11-630x869.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="What Zone Is Under A Bath - What Is Bathroom Zone 1 And 2">
