Just a note: Although baking soda is safe to use around dogs, they shouldn’t consume it, especially in large amounts, so be sure to close this room off to your furry friends while the baking soda is working its magic. - Source: Internet Ditch carpeting. Carpets offer comfort, but they also trap all kinds of bacteria and debris.

Swap your carpets for hardwoods, tile or other allergen-reducing surfaces, and enjoy the fresh, cleaner feel that comes with it. - Source: Internet Attack accidents immediately. If your pet has an accident in the house, always clean it up as soon as possible. The quicker you clean the mess, the less the smell can spread and/or stain. - Source: Internet It’s important to note that dirty ears can lead to ear infections that create odors that you can’t get rid of.

You may also need to go to the vet or find a groomer to drain clogged anal glands in order to get rid of persistent and abnormally strong odors. - Source: Internet Wash dog beds weekly. The place where your pup sleeps is a prime location for stubborn odors to thrive. Wash beds weekly, and, if they have removable covers, machine-wash them to get them super-clean.

This can also help stop odors before they start. - Source: Internet Dogs add a lot of joy to a household — but, unless you work carefully, they also add something much less pleasant: pet odor.

It gets in everything: your carpet, rugs, upholstery, curtains, you name it. - Source: Internet Adding nice smells can help get rid of minor lingering scents. Fresh flowers, scented candles, and time-released air scent diffusers can all help you achieve this goal.

You may think because you have hardwood floors and linoleum that you don’t have a dog smell problem. Think again. That saliva and sweat coming off of your dog’s paws sticks to your hardwood floors too. - Source: Internet HEPA filters do a good job of purifying air riddled with pet fur. Be sure to check your filters regularly. If you have especially furry dogs, you may find that you have to replace your filters more frequently. - Source: Internet Mandy Jones, director of rehoming services at the pet charity, Blue Cross, says: “Dogs like to be able to smell themselves in their home, so homes should always smell of them at least a bit. Over-cleaning and removing the smell completely could lead to a dog marking and urinating, which is obviously not desirable.” - Source: Internet If deodorizing doesn’t remove the pet odor, the carpets and padding will have to go. Once you tear them out, scrub the subfloor with vinegar or an odor-removing product, and install new padding and carpeting.

Make sure you are giving your dog regular baths to combat this scent. - Source: Internet Hiring a cleaning company offers the benefit of experience, as well as special tools and cleaning products designed to eliminate smells at their source.

Check all of your filters. Clean and replace them as necessary. - Source: Internet Get your dog groomed monthly. From stinky saliva to waxy ear build-up to body sweat, dogs have plenty of places where stink resides. To keep your home clean, go to the source of the smell.

While it is possible to overdo the washing and dry out your dog’s skin, a monthly cleaning can work wonders. - Source: Internet The first thing you should do is rule out any medical reasons.

Start with furniture, linens, and bedding. You’ll want to remove all slip covers and cushion covers. If you can remove your pillow covers, remove them. - Source: Internet Pick a day and mark it as “doggy wash day.” Gather up all those stinky toys, beds, blankets, clothes etc. and wash them. This is a great day to rotate toys out – putting away the toys clean (and DRY) cuts down on smells in the storage area and prevents mold, mildew, etc. from growing. - Source: Internet Apart from how to get dog smell out of the house, a professional Realtor can help you decide what other steps you can take to get the highest price possible for your home. UpNest, which is owned by parent company Realtor.com, can help you find a top-notch professional real estate agent in your local market to help you sell your home. - Source: Internet Wash all textiles that your dog sits or lies on. This includes any blankets or towels you keep in the crate, if applicable. If your dog is allowed on your bed, wash your sheets as well as any quilts, covers, or blankets.

Use hot water and an odor-eliminating laundry detergent. - Source: Internet If you have carpets, start by sprinkling them liberally with baking soda.

Just a few sprays will neutralize the dog smell as it evaporates. - Source: Internet Don’t forget the dog! You can clean your house until the cows come home but if your dog smells, than your house will too. Waterless shampoo and bath wipes can help keep your pup fresh between baths. Project Paws® Aloe \u0026 Oatmeal Grooming Wipes will feed shelter dogs while keeping your buddy smelling sweet. - Source: Internet Freshpet makes a great choice because each recipe is made with 100% farm-raised chicken, beef, or fish, and all-natural fruits and veggies that are grown right here in the USA.

This recipe is made with steam-cooked chicken, pumpkin, brown rice, sweet potatoes, carrots, and chicory root extract, which all work to ensure that dogs with sensitive stomachs receive the nutrients that they require to stay happy and healthy. Chicory root extract, in particular, is a natural prebiotic that contains inulin, which can assist beneficial bacteria in your dog’s gastrointestinal tract. - Source: Internet Short answer: yes, probably. You might not notice it anymore because you’ve gotten so used to it. Someone walking into your house for the first time, however, will pick up on that dog smell right away. - Source: Internet Be mindful to flip mattresses and vacuum them dry before using a steam cleaner. Too often, you think, I’ll just steam clean to get rid of the smell, but if you skip this step – the strip and vacuum step – you’re going to create a disgusting amalgam of dog smells. Vacuum everywhere, including under couches and behind cabinets to neutralize dog odors. - Source: Internet Not only can air purifiers help with allergies associated with pet dander, but they can also remove pet smells from the air. Air purifiers with Activated Carbon filters absorb and trap pet odors before the air is purified and circulated back into the room, leaving it smelling fresh.

Most will indicate the recommended room size, with some being able to handle 1,000 square feet or more. - Source: Internet One of the easiest ways to keep your house from smelling like a dog is to keep all surfaces clean. As your pet interacts with these surfaces daily, you’ll want to choose pet-friendly cleaning products that are free from ammonia, bleach, formaldehyde, phthalates, glycol ethers, and perchloroethylene. If you have carpets, try sprinkling baking soda on them before vacuuming – the baking soda will absorb any pet odors lingering in the carpet and is completely natural, unlike other carpet deodorizers. If you have wood or tile floors, simply give it a good vacuum and mop using a strong – but natural – cleaning solution. While floors are the obvious ones, wiping down cupboards, doors, and any other surface that is at pet level is also key. - Source: Internet Dog spit creates odors.

Wash all removable covers from couches, cushions, throw pillows, etc. according to the manufacturer’s instructions. If the covers aren’t removable, you can rent a steam cleaner or hire a steam cleaning service to deep clean the furniture. - Source: Internet Make sure the dog’s bed is odour-resistant, or at least washable. Usually, beds have a washable cover that you can slip off and put in the washing machine. The inside of the bed may not smell, but if it does you may be able to wash that too – if the washing instructions say you can, and if it’s not too big for the machine. “To minimise doggy smells, make sure they have their own bed and wash it regularly,” says Jones. - Source: Internet One of the places smells lurk is in your dog’s bed. Buying a bed that has anti-microbial properties and resists orders is a good way to start. PACK\u0026DEN beds have easy-to-clean, machine washable covers and can be used with odor trappers to keep the scent in the pouch and out of the air in your home. - Source: Internet Accidents happen – especially if you have a puppy or senior dog – so it’s good to have a heavy-duty pet odor eliminator on hand. Similar to the cleaning products you use, you’ll want to choose an odor eliminator that is pet-safe, such as Angry Orange Pet Odor Eliminator. Made right here in the USA, the secret behind this product is the oil derived from orange peels that are used in the recipe. It safely tackles even the toughest pet odors and leaves your house smelling orange-fresh. What’s more, it currently has over 35,000 five-star ratings on Amazon! - Source: Internet Having a mop and vacuum handy will also be helpful. Oh, and once you clean your wet dog, you’ll need to keep him or her away from furniture and carpet surfaces while you tackle the rest of your house. A good game plan here might be sending your pup on a playdate or having a family member take them for a fun outing. - Source: Internet You could hire a professional, rent a steam cleaner and do it yourself, or use one that you own. Make sure that if you use your own that it isn’t also infected with that same dog smell that you are trying to get rid of.

If you want to start fresh, make sure your cleaning tools are fresh. - Source: Internet Everybody knows that dogs have bad breath. What happens when they lick themselves or lick you with those tongues? That bad breath spreads adding to the overall dog smell in your house. You can feed them teeth cleaning dog treats or get in there and manually brush their teeth but good oral hygiene helps get rid of dog smell. - Source: Internet Air out the space. Believe it or not, the simple step of circulating fresh air around your home can do wonders for improving odors. Whenever possible, crack a window to encourage smells to flow out and away from the interior of your home. - Source: Internet This may seem like an odd one, but another good way of keeping your house from smelling like a dog is choosing a food that supports their digestive health. Why, you ask? Because when your pup’s gut is happy, they’re less likely to experience upset stomachs and gas. This means that by making the switch to a gut-friendly food, you can say goodbye to one particular type of stinky dog smell. - Source: Internet Once your house is free of pet odors, do what you can to keep the smells from returning. When you’re out, crate your dog or keep them outdoors. Limit the cat to one floor or room if possible. And don’t forget pet bedding. Remove or replace it. - Source: Internet Accidents and messes are an inevitable part of having a dog. And, even if you clean up right away, there could be lingering scents from past incidents. These odors are usually concentrated on floors and/or drywall. - Source: Internet If you let the dog on the furniture, Jones suggests using throws that can be easily removed and washed. In addition, regularly wash the dog’s toys, blankets, etc. Also regularly wash your dog’s collar and lead – put them in a pillowcase first to stop the metal bits banging against the side of the washer drum. When washing doggy items, it can help to add a little apple cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar to the washing detergent – vinegar helps neutralise dog smells. - Source: Internet Although they won’t get rid of a doggy smell, (pet-friendly) air fresheners and scented candles will at least disguise it, as will simply opening windows and letting some fresh air in. “Keep rooms aired by opening windows often, and consider using incense, scented candles or pet-friendly air fresheners to keep rooms smelling pleasant,” suggests Jones. “But don’t spray the dog!” - Source: Internet Worse, over time, you may not even be able to tell that there is an odor.

When you don’t have time for a bath or you’re in between bath times but you need to do something for the smell, here are 10 effective ways to tackle dog smell. - Source: Internet Once you’ve deodorized your home, it’s time to begin your regular routine to keep the dog smell away.

Lift the cushions on the couch and sprinkle baking soda underneath them. - Source: Internet All of these odors combine to create that dog smell everyone hates. It’s easy to see how it fills your house. Unless your dog is confined to just one area of the home, wherever it goes, the smell will follow. - Source: Internet For example, check your carpet padding by lifting your carpets and making sure that the pad beneath hasn’t been soaked with your dog’s waste. Even the floor underneath the pad may be giving off dog smell. Make sure to thoroughly clean and deodorize those areas too. - Source: Internet Perhaps the main reason why your whole house has a dog smell is your furniture and carpets.

Baking soda acts as a natural neutralizer and absorbs <strong>smell</strong>s. In the morning, vacuum your furniture thoroughly. Just a note: Although baking soda is safe to use around <strong>dog</strong>s, they shouldn’t consume it, especially in large amounts, so be sure to close this room off to your furry friends while the baking soda is working its magic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ditch carpeting. Carpets offer comfort, but they also trap all kinds of bacteria and debris. For this reason, if you’re eager to clean and sanitize your home from pet <strong>smell</strong>s, hard-surface floors are a better way to go. Swap your carpets for hardwoods, tile or other allergen-reducing surfaces, and enjoy the fresh, cleaner feel that comes with it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Attack accidents immediately. If your pet has an accident in the house, always clean it up as soon as possible. The quicker you clean the mess, the less the <strong>smell</strong> can spread and/or stain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s important to note that dirty ears can lead to ear infections that create odors that you can’t get rid of. In that case, your <strong>dog</strong> needs antibiotics to kill the infection – see a vet right away. You may also need to go to the vet or find a groomer to drain clogged anal glands in order to get rid of persistent and abnormally strong odors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wash <strong>dog</strong> beds weekly. The place where your pup sleeps is a prime location for stubborn odors to thrive. Wash beds weekly, and, if they have removable covers, machine-wash them to get them super-clean. Bonus tip: Get your <strong>dog</strong> an odor-resistant bed that has anti-microbial properties. This can also help stop odors before they start. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dogs add a lot of joy to a household — but, unless you work carefully, they also add something much less pleasant: pet odor. If you’ve ever wondered how to keep your house from <strong>smell</strong>ing like <strong>dog</strong>, you’re not alone. Many pet owners find that their pooches fill their homes with an unmistakable <strong>smell</strong> that feels impossible to remove or mask. It gets in everything: your carpet, rugs, upholstery, curtains, you name it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Adding nice <strong>smell</strong>s can help get rid of minor lingering scents. Fresh flowers, scented candles, and time-released air scent diffusers can all help you achieve this goal. Just be sure any scent you buy is <strong>dog</strong>-safe, as some essential oils can be dangerous for pets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is not the first impression you want to make on a potential buyer. You want that freshly cleaned scent. Think lemon or fresh breeze, anything but <strong>dog</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In this post, I’m breaking down the basics on how to keep your house from <strong>smell</strong>ing like <strong>dog</strong> AND how to eliminate pet odors as you go. Because they will happen. It’s part of the charm of our pets. 😉 Finally, I want to note that I’m focused on <strong>dog</strong> odors here. If anyone’s interested in cat odors or how we handle the litter boxes, let me know in the comments below! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fortunately, a waterless shampoo does exist to help you reap some of the benefits of a <strong>dog</strong> bath without actually going through all of the hard work. Using a waterless shampoo along with grooming wipes between baths can help refresh your <strong>dog</strong>’s coat and get rid of odors. Just don’t use too much of it or too often or problems can occur. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There is no way to stress enough the importance of vacuuming frequently for keeping <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong> out. At the very least, it should be a weekly chore to dry vacuum your floors and furniture. It’s a lot of work but absolutely necessary if you want to keep your house <strong>dog</strong> odor free. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your <strong>dog</strong> uses indoor pee pads, put down a new pad each time the <strong>dog</strong> goes. Throw them away outside in a trash can with a tight lid. Remove even clean pads from view before each showing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Baking soda absorbs odors, so put an open box in the cabinet where you keep all your <strong>dog</strong>’s treats and toys, or on the shelf where you hang his collar. It’s a simple way to help cut down on <strong>dog</strong>gy odor. Also, sprinkle baking soda on the carpets and let it sit overnight to absorb odors, than vacuum it up the next day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Carpet is easy to identify as a <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong> absorbing part of the house. You may think because you have hardwood floors and linoleum that you don’t have a <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong> problem. Think again. That saliva and sweat coming off of your <strong>dog</strong>’s paws sticks to your hardwood floors too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>HEPA filters do a good job of purifying air riddled with pet fur. Be sure to check your filters regularly. If you have especially furry <strong>dog</strong>s, you may find that you have to replace your filters more frequently. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Mandy Jones, director of rehoming services at the pet charity, Blue Cross, says: &ldquo;Dogs like to be able to <strong>smell</strong> themselves in their home, so homes should always <strong>smell</strong> of them at least a bit. Over-cleaning and removing the <strong>smell</strong> completely could lead to a <strong>dog</strong> marking and urinating, which is obviously not desirable.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If deodorizing doesn&rsquo;t remove the pet odor, the carpets and padding will have to go. Once you tear them out, scrub the subfloor with vinegar or an odor-removing product, and install new padding and carpeting. That is, unless the <strong>smell</strong> is in the subfloor, in which case that goes next. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Part of getting your home ready for sale is making it attractive to potential buyers. Your Realtor will likely give you advice on decluttering, staging, and curb appeal. And, if you own a <strong>dog</strong> or two, your real estate agent might give you some advice on how to get the <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong> out of your house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sprinkle the bottom of your bedroom mattresses, especially if your <strong>dog</strong> sleeps in your room or in the bed with you or your kids. Leave the baking soda there from twelve hours to a day before vacuuming up the baking soda. Do this on a weekly basis to keep the odors out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>All <strong>dog</strong>s have a natural scent on their fur and bodies. This is mostly due to their sweat and the oils they secrete. These scents are more likely to be found on the furniture. As your <strong>dog</strong> spends time on his <strong>dog</strong>gie bed or the couch, he transfers those to the fabric, where they become embedded in the fibers. Make sure you are giving your <strong>dog</strong> regular baths to combat this scent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hiring a cleaning company offers the benefit of experience, as well as special tools and cleaning products designed to eliminate <strong>smell</strong>s at their source. Because each situation is different, speaking with a local house cleaning pro will help you get the most accurate price estimate for you. Just make sure you specify that you’d like to get rid of pet <strong>smell</strong>s when you hire them, so they use the right tools and products for the job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Thankfully, you don’t have to accept the odor and live with it. Today, there are many steps you can take to keep your home <strong>smell</strong>ing good, even when you have pets. In fact, with the right strategies, it’s entirely possible to keep a fresh, clean-<strong>smell</strong>ing home while there are <strong>dog</strong>s inside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s a good idea to change your filters at least twice a year whether you own a <strong>dog</strong> or not. When you own a <strong>dog</strong> you should do it once a month. If your house <strong>smell</strong>s of <strong>dog</strong>, have you checked your filters lately? Filters can get piled high with dust, dander, and fur over time. Check all of your filters. Clean and replace them as necessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Get your <strong>dog</strong> groomed monthly. From stinky saliva to waxy ear build-up to body sweat, <strong>dog</strong>s have plenty of places where stink resides. To keep your home clean, go to the source of the <strong>smell</strong>. When it comes to how to make your <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong> good, grooming is crucial. While it is possible to overdo the washing and dry out your <strong>dog</strong>’s skin, a monthly cleaning can work wonders. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The first thing you should do is rule out any medical reasons. All <strong>dog</strong>s <strong>smell</strong>, but if yours is particularly odorous, it could be because of a skin or dental infection. If you’ve noticed a stronger <strong>smell</strong> than usual, a quick trip to the vet should help you get rid of any doubts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ridding your furniture and carpets of <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong> is a three part process: Strip and dry vac, shampoo and neutralize, and then deodorize. Start with furniture, linens, and bedding. You’ll want to remove all slip covers and cushion covers. If you can remove your pillow covers, remove them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pick a day and mark it as “<strong>dog</strong>gy wash day.” Gather up all those stinky toys, beds, blankets, clothes etc. and wash them. This is a great day to rotate toys out – putting away the toys clean (and DRY) cuts down on <strong>smell</strong>s in the storage area and prevents mold, mildew, etc. from growing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Apart from how to get <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong> out of the house, a professional Realtor can help you decide what other steps you can take to get the highest price possible for your home. UpNest, which is owned by parent company Realtor.com, can help you find a top-notch professional real estate agent in your local market to help you sell your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wash all textiles that your <strong>dog</strong> sits or lies on. This includes any blankets or towels you keep in the crate, if applicable. If your <strong>dog</strong> is allowed on your bed, wash your sheets as well as any quilts, covers, or blankets. If your furniture has removable covers, make sure you wash those, too. Use hot water and an odor-eliminating laundry detergent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you have carpets, start by sprinkling them liberally with baking soda. This is a natural odor eliminator, and completely safe for <strong>dog</strong>s. Let it sit overnight before vacuuming. You can also spray the carpets with vodka. Just a few sprays will neutralize the <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong> as it evaporates. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Don’t forget the <strong>dog</strong>! You can clean your house until the cows come home but if your <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong>s, than your house will too. Waterless shampoo and bath wipes can help keep your pup fresh between baths. Project Paws® Aloe & Oatmeal Grooming Wipes will feed shelter <strong>dog</strong>s while keeping your buddy <strong>smell</strong>ing sweet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Freshpet makes a great choice because each recipe is made with 100% farm-raised chicken, beef, or fish, and all-natural fruits and veggies that are grown right here in the USA. If your <strong>dog</strong> has a digestive system that is generally more sensitive, Freshpet® Select Sensitive Stomach and Skin is a perfect choice. This recipe is made with steam-cooked chicken, pumpkin, brown rice, sweet potatoes, carrots, and chicory root extract, which all work to ensure that <strong>dog</strong>s with sensitive stomachs receive the nutrients that they require to stay happy and healthy. Chicory root extract, in particular, is a natural prebiotic that contains inulin, which can assist beneficial bacteria in your <strong>dog</strong>’s gastrointestinal tract. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Short answer: yes, probably. You might not notice it anymore because you’ve gotten so used to it. Someone walking into your house for the first time, however, will pick up on that <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong> right away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Be mindful to flip mattresses and vacuum them dry before using a steam cleaner. Too often, you think, I’ll just steam clean to get rid of the <strong>smell</strong>, but if you skip this step – the strip and vacuum step – you’re going to create a disgusting amalgam of <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong>s. Vacuum everywhere, including under couches and behind cabinets to neutralize <strong>dog</strong> odors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Not only can air purifiers help with allergies associated with pet dander, but they can also remove pet <strong>smell</strong>s from the air. Air purifiers with Activated Carbon filters absorb and trap pet odors before the air is purified and circulated back into the room, leaving it <strong>smell</strong>ing fresh. For air purifiers to work their best, you’ll want to choose one that is the right size for the rooms it’s in. Most will indicate the recommended room size, with some being able to handle 1,000 square feet or more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the easiest ways to keep your house from <strong>smell</strong>ing like a <strong>dog</strong> is to keep all surfaces clean. As your pet interacts with these surfaces daily, you’ll want to choose pet-friendly cleaning products that are free from ammonia, bleach, formaldehyde, phthalates, glycol ethers, and perchloroethylene. If you have carpets, try sprinkling baking soda on them before vacuuming – the baking soda will absorb any pet odors lingering in the carpet and is completely natural, unlike other carpet deodorizers. If you have wood or tile floors, simply give it a good vacuum and mop using a strong – but natural – cleaning solution. While floors are the obvious ones, wiping down cupboards, doors, and any other surface that is at pet level is also key. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dog spit creates odors. If your <strong>dog</strong> suffers from beard and eye staining, chances are that is part of the reason for the odor. You’ll want to attack the source with a good stain remover that’s safe for <strong>dog</strong>s like our Eye Envy Beard Stain Remover Spray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The oils and sweat produced by your <strong>dog</strong> can rub off on porous surfaces. Wash all removable covers from couches, cushions, throw pillows, etc. according to the manufacturer’s instructions. If the covers aren’t removable, you can rent a steam cleaner or hire a steam cleaning service to deep clean the furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Make sure the <strong>dog</strong>’s bed is odour-resistant, or at least washable. Usually, beds have a washable cover that you can slip off and put in the washing machine. The inside of the bed may not <strong>smell</strong>, but if it does you may be able to wash that too – if the washing instructions say you can, and if it’s not too big for the machine. &ldquo;To minimise <strong>dog</strong>gy <strong>smell</strong>s, make sure they have their own bed and wash it regularly,&rdquo; says Jones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the places <strong>smell</strong>s lurk is in your <strong>dog</strong>’s bed. Buying a bed that has anti-microbial properties and resists orders is a good way to start. PACK&DEN beds have easy-to-clean, machine washable covers and can be used with odor trappers to keep the scent in the pouch and out of the air in your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Accidents happen – especially if you have a puppy or senior <strong>dog</strong> – so it’s good to have a heavy-duty pet odor eliminator on hand. Similar to the cleaning products you use, you’ll want to choose an odor eliminator that is pet-safe, such as Angry Orange Pet Odor Eliminator. Made right here in the USA, the secret behind this product is the oil derived from orange peels that are used in the recipe. It safely tackles even the toughest pet odors and leaves your house <strong>smell</strong>ing orange-fresh. What’s more, it currently has over 35,000 five-star ratings on Amazon! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Having a mop and vacuum handy will also be helpful. Oh, and once you clean your wet <strong>dog</strong>, you&rsquo;ll need to keep him or her away from furniture and carpet surfaces while you tackle the rest of your house. A good game plan here might be sending your pup on a playdate or having a family member take them for a fun outing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You could hire a professional, rent a steam cleaner and do it yourself, or use one that you own. Make sure that if you use your own that it isn’t also infected with that same <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong> that you are trying to get rid of. Same thing with your dry vac; if it’s the same one you’ve been using for years to vacuum <strong>dog</strong> fur, chances are it has a <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong> to it too. If you want to start fresh, make sure your cleaning tools are fresh. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Everybody knows that <strong>dog</strong>s have bad breath. What happens when they lick themselves or lick you with those tongues? That bad breath spreads adding to the overall <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong> in your house. You can feed them teeth cleaning <strong>dog</strong> treats or get in there and manually brush their teeth but good oral hygiene helps get rid of <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Air out the space. Believe it or not, the simple step of circulating fresh air around your home can do wonders for improving odors. Whenever possible, crack a window to encourage <strong>smell</strong>s to flow out and away from the interior of your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This may seem like an odd one, but another good way of keeping your house from <strong>smell</strong>ing like a <strong>dog</strong> is choosing a food that supports their digestive health. Why, you ask? Because when your pup’s gut is happy, they’re less likely to experience upset stomachs and gas. This means that by making the switch to a gut-friendly food, you can say goodbye to one particular type of stinky <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once your house is free of pet odors, do what you can to keep the <strong>smell</strong>s from returning. When you&rsquo;re out, crate your <strong>dog</strong> or keep them outdoors. Limit the cat to one floor or room if possible. And don&rsquo;t forget pet bedding. Remove or replace it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Accidents and messes are an inevitable part of having a <strong>dog</strong>. And, even if you clean up right away, there could be lingering scents from past incidents. These odors are usually concentrated on floors and/or drywall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you let the <strong>dog</strong> on the furniture, Jones suggests using throws that can be easily removed and washed. In addition, regularly wash the <strong>dog</strong>’s toys, blankets, etc. Also regularly wash your <strong>dog</strong>’s collar and lead – put them in a pillowcase first to stop the metal bits banging against the side of the washer drum. When washing <strong>dog</strong>gy items, it can help to add a little apple cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar to the washing detergent – vinegar helps neutralise <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although they won’t get rid of a <strong>dog</strong>gy <strong>smell</strong>, (pet-friendly) air fresheners and scented candles will at least disguise it, as will simply opening windows and letting some fresh air in. &ldquo;Keep rooms aired by opening windows often, and consider using incense, scented candles or pet-friendly air fresheners to keep rooms <strong>smell</strong>ing pleasant,&rdquo; suggests Jones. &ldquo;But don’t spray the <strong>dog</strong>!&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Worse, over time, you may not even be able to tell that there is an odor. Even the most conscientious <strong>dog</strong> owner has a hard time getting rid of <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong>, especially since bathing your <strong>dog</strong> too often is bad for its fur and skin. When you don’t have time for a bath or you’re in between bath times but you need to do something for the <strong>smell</strong>, here are 10 effective ways to tackle <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once you’ve deodorized your home, it’s time to begin your regular routine to keep the <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong> away. After you’ve remade the bed and replaced the linens in the closet, sprinkle them with baking soda. Lift the cushions on the couch and sprinkle baking soda underneath them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>All of these odors combine to create that <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong> everyone hates. It’s easy to see how it fills your house. Unless your <strong>dog</strong> is confined to just one area of the home, wherever it goes, the <strong>smell</strong> will follow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For example, check your carpet padding by lifting your carpets and making sure that the pad beneath hasn’t been soaked with your <strong>dog</strong>’s waste. Even the floor underneath the pad may be giving off <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong>. Make sure to thoroughly clean and deodorize those areas too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Perhaps the main reason why your whole house has a <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong> is your furniture and carpets. Even if your <strong>dog</strong> is not allowed on the furniture, its fur, its paws, its saliva are getting on everything else that your <strong>dog</strong> touches. Therefore your task has to be a comprehensive approach in order to get rid of <strong>dog</strong> <strong>smell</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://torahtreasuretrove.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/tapeworm_1.302140918_std.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Best Way To Keep Dog Smell Out Of House - best way to keep dog smell out of house">
