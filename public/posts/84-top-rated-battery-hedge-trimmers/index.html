You can get cordless hedge trimmers that come with different power capacities such as 7.2V, 10.8V, 18V, 20V, 40V, and 56V. - Source: Internet There is no doubt that the Black + Decker 40V MAX Cordless Hedge Trimmer, 24-Inch is the best cordless hedge trimmer this year. Not only is it powerful enough to tackle most jobs, but it has a great battery operating time, makes clean one-pass cuts, and is easy to handle. There is not too much else you could want in a hedge trimmer. - Source: Internet If you are looking to buy a new hedge trimmer, I would strongly recommend a cordless model. In general, they are lighter, easy to use and maintain and less expensive than gas-powered models. Although they may not be ideal for commercial applications. - Source: Internet Trimming your hedges is an essential part of maintaining a tidy-looking yard . Whether you’re growing boxwoods as a low foundation hedge or larger shrubs as a screen for backyard privacy , there are plenty of tools available that make hedge trimming much easier. Since there are so many hedge trimmers on the market, with gas-powered, corded electric, and cordless options, it can be tough knowing which ones to go for. - Source: Internet Weighing in at under a kilogram, this compact hedge trimmer is the best cordless hedge trimmer if you want a lightweight option, making it a good bet for gardeners with mobility problems or arthritis, or those who tire easily. Unlike our first two picks, it’s not big hedges that let this handheld trimmer shine – rather, it comes in extremely handy for shorter hedges and more detailed work, such as keeping shaped boxes looking sharp. With its ability to be use single-handed, and its petite quick-charging battery, it’s a handy option to keep around for smaller jobs. - Source: Internet Another factor to consider is handleability. Choosing a model that is too heavy or is not well balanced will make the trimmer very difficult to use. You also want to look into the handle and the type of trigger. For example, safety triggers are good, but can be tricky to use while maneuvering the trimmer. If you are not able to use the hedge trimmer correctly, it will affect more than just your strength, but the performance of the trimmer as well. - Source: Internet Bosch AHS 50-20 Lithium-Ion Hedgecutter Best cordless hedge trimmer you can buy: with a powerful and protected blade, this hedgecutter lets you get the closest of shaves Specifications Best for: Thick hedges Battery or petrol: Battery Battery life: 50 minutes continuous cutting Power: 18V Weight: 2.5kg Blade length: 100mm Today’s Best Deals View at B \u0026 Q (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at ManoMano UK (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Really powerful + Blade tip protector for a close cut Reasons to avoid - Charger is huge - Source: Internet The star of the show when it comes to the Husqvarna 115iHD45 is balance. It’s designed carefully to make sure that it’s easily held and indeed lofted and swung, making it a doddle to trim your hedges. It’s quite a bit heavier than the Bosch, though, which is why it’s not our top pick. - Source: Internet The tradeoff, however, when you step up to a heavy-duty, long-bar trimmer is anywhere from a pound to two pounds of increased weight. That may not sound like much, but you can definitely feel it on a hot day, particularly if you’re kneeling down or bending. Unless you’re trimming a wide hedge with access only from one side, use a trimmer with a bar that’s 22 to 24 inches long. For wide or very tall bushes, use a trimmer with a bar 26 inches and longer. Note, again, that increased bar length adds to trimmer weight and to the cantilever effect produced when you trim with your arms extended. - Source: Internet At just 2.5 pounds, this 1,200 RPM tool with an ergonomic handle includes both hedger and shear attachments, so it adapts to whatever kind of shrubbery you’re trimming.

Due to the extra weight, this may not be the best hedge trimmer for smaller people. - Source: Internet These tough tools, which generally require both oil and gas to run properly, tend to work harder than their electric counterparts. The downside to more power is weight: Gas hedge trimmers may weigh more than 10 pounds, making it a challenge to reach up and around tall shrubbery. Electric hedge trimmers: Though they don’t provide quite as much oomph as gas-juiced models, electric trimmers are usually lighter, making them easier to wield at chest height or higher. Lower-priced corded models offer uninterrupted use but less mobility because they’re plugged into an outlet—a potential problem for larger yards if the gardener doesn’t have a lengthy extension cord. Cordless hedge trimmers use a battery to allow total freedom of movement, as long as the batteries are recharged or replaced regularly. - Source: Internet Our next pick is the best cordless hedge trimmer for the money. The Earthwise 20-inch has a 2.0An Lithium-ion battery that charges in about 45 to 60 minutes but only gives you 30 to 45 minutes of continuous use. This little gem, however, does sport a dual-action steel blade that will help you cut through ⅝ of an inch. At 2,600 SPM, you will be able to cut cleanly through shrubs and bushes with one pass, and it is also good for edging. - Source: Internet On average, a hedge trimmer battery can last between 30 minutes and 1 hour, and it will take between 30 minutes and 2 hours to fully charge. Keep in mind that some hedge trimmers don’t come with a battery or a battery charger, so users may need to purchase the battery separately. If this is the case, it’s a good idea to get two batteries so that one is always charging while the other is in use. - Source: Internet The WORX PowerShare 20” hedge trimmer is number 7 on our list. This 20-inch dual-action steel blade is very lightweight and compact. It is perfect for the novice hedge trimmer. The 20-volt battery lasts for only about 30 minutes of stop and go use.

While blade lengths might be fairly self-explanatory (tall hedges? Go for a long reach trimmer. Just a bit of box out in the front garden? A blade up to 45cm should be ample) there are some differences that need teasing out between the two types of power before you buy. - Source: Internet A corded hedge trimmer is quiet, easy to use, and practically maintenance free. There are no exhaust fumes, pull cord, or oil or gas to mess with. They are very affordable. - Source: Internet The chosen hedge trimmers cut branches ranging from ⅜ to 1 inch in diameter and have blade sizes ranging from 18 to 24 inches.

Figure that out, and it’s time to chop, chop! - Source: Internet The longer the blade of the cordless hedge trimmer, the more power it needs. You can get blades that are single or dual action. The dual action blades cut a lot faster than a single action. - Source: Internet The best time to get your hedge trimmer out is actually winter, after you hedge has gone dormant at the end of autumn, and before it breaks into fresh bud.

You can get cordless <strong>hedge</strong> <strong>trimmers</strong> that come with different power capacities such as 7.2V, 10.8V, 18V, 20V, 40V, and 56V. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There is no doubt that the Black + Decker 40V MAX Cordless Hedge Trimmer, 24-Inch is the best cordless <strong>hedge</strong> trimmer this year. Not only is it powerful enough to tackle most jobs, but it has a great battery operating time, makes clean one-pass cuts, and is easy to handle. There is not too much else you could want in a <strong>hedge</strong> trimmer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are looking to buy a new <strong>hedge</strong> trimmer, I would strongly recommend a cordless model. In general, they are lighter, easy to use and maintain and less expensive than gas-powered models. Although they may not be ideal for commercial applications. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Trimming your <strong>hedge</strong>s is an essential part of maintaining a tidy-looking yard . Whether you&rsquo;re growing boxwoods as a low foundation <strong>hedge</strong> or larger shrubs as a screen for backyard privacy , there are plenty of tools available that make <strong>hedge</strong> trimming much easier. Since there are so many <strong>hedge</strong> <strong>trimmers</strong> on the market, with gas-powered, corded electric, and cordless options, it can be tough knowing which ones to go for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Weighing in at under a kilogram, this compact <strong>hedge</strong> trimmer is the best cordless <strong>hedge</strong> trimmer if you want a lightweight option, making it a good bet for gardeners with mobility problems or arthritis, or those who tire easily. Unlike our first two picks, it’s not big <strong>hedge</strong>s that let this handheld trimmer shine – rather, it comes in extremely handy for shorter <strong>hedge</strong>s and more detailed work, such as keeping shaped boxes looking sharp. With its ability to be use single-handed, and its petite quick-charging battery, it’s a handy option to keep around for smaller jobs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another factor to consider is handleability. Choosing a model that is too heavy or is not well balanced will make the trimmer very difficult to use. You also want to look into the handle and the type of trigger. For example, safety triggers are good, but can be tricky to use while maneuvering the trimmer. If you are not able to use the <strong>hedge</strong> trimmer correctly, it will affect more than just your strength, but the performance of the trimmer as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol><li>Bosch AHS 50-20 Lithium-Ion Hedgecutter Best cordless <strong>hedge</strong> trimmer you can buy: with a powerful and protected blade, this <strong>hedge</strong>cutter lets you get the closest of shaves Specifications Best for: Thick <strong>hedge</strong>s Battery or petrol: Battery Battery life: 50 minutes continuous cutting Power: 18V Weight: 2.5kg Blade length: 100mm Today&rsquo;s Best Deals View at B & Q (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at ManoMano UK (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Really powerful + Blade tip protector for a close cut Reasons to avoid - Charger is huge - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>The star of the show when it comes to the Husqvarna 115iHD45 is balance. It&rsquo;s designed carefully to make sure that it&rsquo;s easily held and indeed lofted and swung, making it a doddle to trim your <strong>hedge</strong>s. It&rsquo;s quite a bit heavier than the Bosch, though, which is why it&rsquo;s not our top pick. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The tradeoff, however, when you step up to a heavy-duty, long-bar trimmer is anywhere from a pound to two pounds of increased weight. That may not sound like much, but you can definitely feel it on a hot day, particularly if you’re kneeling down or bending. Unless you’re trimming a wide <strong>hedge</strong> with access only from one side, use a trimmer with a bar that’s 22 to 24 inches long. For wide or very tall bushes, use a trimmer with a bar 26 inches and longer. Note, again, that increased bar length adds to trimmer weight and to the cantilever effect produced when you trim with your arms extended. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At just 2.5 pounds, this 1,200 RPM tool with an ergonomic handle includes both <strong>hedge</strong>r and shear attachments, so it adapts to whatever kind of shrubbery you’re trimming. It has a rechargeable 7.2-volt lithium-ion battery (with charger) for easy cordless operation. Interchangeable 4- and 6-inch blades mean you can do all sorts of grooming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This unit is heavier than it looks….about 3 pounds more than most competitors. Due to the extra weight, this may not be the best <strong>hedge</strong> trimmer for smaller people. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>These tough tools, which generally require both oil and gas to run properly, tend to work harder than their electric counterparts. The downside to more power is weight: Gas <strong>hedge</strong> <strong>trimmers</strong> may weigh more than 10 pounds, making it a challenge to reach up and around tall shrubbery. Electric <strong>hedge</strong> <strong>trimmers</strong>: Though they don’t provide quite as much oomph as gas-juiced models, electric <strong>trimmers</strong> are usually lighter, making them easier to wield at chest height or higher. Lower-priced corded models offer uninterrupted use but less mobility because they’re plugged into an outlet—a potential problem for larger yards if the gardener doesn’t have a lengthy extension cord. Cordless <strong>hedge</strong> <strong>trimmers</strong> use a battery to allow total freedom of movement, as long as the batteries are recharged or replaced regularly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Our next pick is the best cordless <strong>hedge</strong> trimmer for the money. The Earthwise 20-inch has a 2.0An Lithium-ion battery that charges in about 45 to 60 minutes but only gives you 30 to 45 minutes of continuous use. This little gem, however, does sport a dual-action steel blade that will help you cut through ⅝ of an inch. At 2,600 SPM, you will be able to cut cleanly through shrubs and bushes with one pass, and it is also good for edging. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>On average, a <strong>hedge</strong> trimmer battery can last between 30 minutes and 1 hour, and it will take between 30 minutes and 2 hours to fully charge. Keep in mind that some <strong>hedge</strong> <strong>trimmers</strong> don’t come with a battery or a battery charger, so users may need to purchase the battery separately. If this is the case, it’s a good idea to get two batteries so that one is always charging while the other is in use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The WORX PowerShare 20” <strong>hedge</strong> trimmer is number 7 on our list. This 20-inch dual-action steel blade is very lightweight and compact. It is perfect for the novice <strong>hedge</strong> trimmer. The 20-volt battery lasts for only about 30 minutes of stop and go use. It also sports a D-shaped handle that makes it easier to work at different angles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Electric <strong>hedge</strong> <strong>trimmers</strong> have an amperage (amps) measurement that indicates the amount of energy flowing through the electric engine. The higher the amperage, the more powerful the engine. Most electric <strong>hedge</strong> <strong>trimmers</strong> range from 2.5 to 4.5 amps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Keep all body parts away from cutting blades. Carry your <strong>hedge</strong> clipper by its handle and make certain that the cutting blade is stopped. Keep this appliance away from children. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The main choices you have when it comes to buying a cordless <strong>hedge</strong> trimmer are between different blade lengths and between electric or petrol <strong>trimmers</strong>. While blade lengths might be fairly self-explanatory (tall <strong>hedge</strong>s? Go for a long reach trimmer. Just a bit of box out in the front garden? A blade up to 45cm should be ample) there are some differences that need teasing out between the two types of power before you buy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A corded <strong>hedge</strong> trimmer is quiet, easy to use, and practically maintenance free. There are no exhaust fumes, pull cord, or oil or gas to mess with.

We prioritized relatively lightweight tools with runtimes over 40 minutes for cordless electric and gas tools. Some models come with a battery and a charger included to get the user started with landscaping right away. Additionally, the list prioritized models with features such as dual-action blades, a comfortable grip, and anti-vibration systems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If the top item on your to-do list is getting your yard in fighting shape, then it’s time to purchase a <strong>hedge</strong> trimmer. Finding the best <strong>hedge</strong> <strong>trimmers</strong> for your needs is all about the space you’re working with, whether you want an electric cord or need room to wander, and how much money you prefer to spend. Figure that out, and it’s time to chop, chop! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The longer the blade of the cordless <strong>hedge</strong> trimmer, the more power it needs. You can get blades that are single or dual action. The dual action blades cut a lot faster than a single action. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best time to get your <strong>hedge</strong> trimmer out is actually winter, after you <strong>hedge</strong> has gone dormant at the end of autumn, and before it breaks into fresh bud. You don&rsquo;t want to ever trim off tender new growth as this can do a lot of damage to your <strong>hedge</strong>. Likewise, if during a mild spell in autumn your <strong>hedge</strong> is still green, wait before trimming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>They tend to be heavy when compared to electric <strong>hedge</strong> <strong>trimmers</strong>. It’s also more difficult to use them as compared to electric <strong>hedge</strong> <strong>trimmers</strong>. Gas <strong>hedge</strong> <strong>trimmers</strong> also need a lot more maintenance than electric <strong>hedge</strong> <strong>trimmers</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Obviously, you want your <strong>hedge</strong> trimmer to offer versatility—maybe your backyard is huge while your front yard is more modest—but whatever model you buy should be easy to use and work efficiently. Blade size is the No. 1 thing to consider when investing in a trimmer. As a rule, opt for less than 16 inches for small to average-size <strong>hedge</strong>s, 18 inches for average-size <strong>hedge</strong>s, and 20 inches or more for large, thick <strong>hedge</strong>s and branches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Whether you use them daily, or just once a season, battery-powered <strong>hedge</strong> <strong>trimmers</strong> fit the bill. They have no engine to maintain, or gasoline to keep fresh. That means you can use them as much, or as little, as you need without the worry of stale gas.

That said, many reviewers of cordless <strong>hedge</strong> <strong>trimmers</strong> have found that the batteries can be unreliable and some don’t hold charge well, and when the cost of replacing batteries over the trimmer’s lifetime comes into play, the initial outlay for a petrol trimmer might not seem so bad.

In order to find the best tool to manage this achievement, there are a lot of things to consider: Do you want an electric trimmer, or would you prefer a battery-operated or gas-powered model?

They could also need a replacement part, or have a wire come loose. The most common issue though is the lifespan of a battery.
