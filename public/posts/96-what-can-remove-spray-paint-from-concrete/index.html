If you don’t have a pressure washer, other known natural methods such as vinegar and baking soda might not work depending on the severity, and so may result in more money being spent trying different processes. It’s also not worth forking out on a pressure washer if you don’t already own one just to remove paint as there’s no guarantee it’ll work. - Source: Internet When you’re trying to remove spray paint overspray from a surface, there are a few basic steps that you should follow. First, use a clean, wet cloth to gently wipe the area clean. Next, mix soap into water and spritz it onto the cloth. Wring out the soapy cloth well before shaking the can of paint vigorously until all of the liquid is mixed in. Finally, aim the spray at the overspray area and hold it for several seconds before rinsing off with water. - Source: Internet You not always have to use toxic chemicals for cleaning paint off concrete. Your kids can come in contact with such toxic chemicals. Also, remember that if you are going to use these chemical strippers to clean up old paint stains on your garage floor, you need to make sure that you wear protective gear so that you will not be accidentally doused with the chemicals. - Source: Internet Step 5: Finally, rinse the wall or the area using the warm water you prepared before. You can also use a garden hose, if possible. Repeat the process until the spray paint is completely gone. - Source: Internet To get paint spray off a driveway using paint thinner, you must first prepare the surface for the paint thinner to work. You need to scrape or sand off the paint. Make sure to use some kind of respirator to minimize the risks of inhaling the fumes of paint thinner. If the paint is dried, it should be scraped off. - Source: Internet Alternatively, try spray paint remover chemicals such as trisodium phosphate. Simply mix half a cup with two gallons of warm water and apply on the area. Be sure to use protective clothing and eyewear as if this chemical comes into contact with the skin or eyes it can cause damage. Apply to the spray and scrub with a brush that has fibre bristles. - Source: Internet Well, manual scrubbing and scraping paint off concrete walls could be a time consuming and a labor-intensive method. Even if you use scraper or a grinder, the methods would be ineffective without pressure washer. So, no matter what other methods your use for removing paint of concrete garage or driveways, make sure you give finish with a pressure washer. I’d recommend never scrubbing or scraping paint in dry state because this would release paint dust and fine particles that could end up in your eyes or may get into your lungs, if you’d breathe them in. - Source: Internet It’s more than a graffiti remover, it is an anti-graffiti protection system. It is a water-based solution that has a unique effect when sprayed on surfaces. The graffiti will be removed very easily. Clean the surface with some strong detergent and then spray Graffiti Remover on the surface. Use a clean cloth to wipe off the paint. - Source: Internet Yes, you read that right. A mixture of soap and water is an effective solution to scrub off spray paint off the concrete. And if you compare it to others, it is the safest, non-toxic, and most economical way. - Source: Internet As a spray gel formula, it couldn’t be easier to use Peel Tec to remove spray paint from concrete. The formula is dispensed from an aerosol canister via a nozzle that is easy to gauge. This means that you are in complete control of how much product is dispensed onto the target area. When applied, Peel Tec immediately starts working its way into the paint, dissolving it so that you can easily peel away the paint residue from the concrete within ten minutes of application. What’s left behind is a clinically clean and preserved surface. - Source: Internet The deeper we go into this list, the stronger the chemicals become. On a scale, this is somewhere in the middle and is an effective solution. TSP, or trisodium phosphate, is a proven chemical used for paint removal. - Source: Internet Graffiti removing materials effectively penetrate the paint structure and loosen its grip from the concrete or other surfaces. They are available in the market in various forms, such as wipes, pastes, aerosol cans, and even liquid solutions. To use it in the best way, we suggest that you carefully read the instructions on the label. - Source: Internet Make sure that you read the label carefully and go through the instructions minutely. This will help you understand in what proportions you should apply the solvent. Following the guideline, apply the thinner to the affected portions of the concrete. Use a clean piece of cloth to wipe the paint off once you are done. - Source: Internet Removing dried paint from concrete, however, can be a rather frustrating process because concrete readily absorbs the paint. While removing dried paint can be time-consuming, it’s not impossible. Learn how to remove paint from concrete, step by step. - Source: Internet Latex is fairly easy to remove from a concrete surface compared to oil-based paints. Most of the dried up paint will easily come off with a little scrubbing. If there are stubborn paint stains, apply a paint remover (not stripper) and let it sit for a few minutes. Once it dries up, scrape-off the stains. - Source: Internet Note: When dealing with large paints on walls, keep in mind that the dissolved paint has a 100% chance to drip down the unaffected area, especially if the paint is on a vertical surface and you are using trigger sprayers. Try to avoid it by not oversaturating the area. Or, if you can get one, simply place a tape on the surface under the spray-painted area using a painter’s tape. - Source: Internet To clean up spray paint overspray on the floor, you will need to wet down the area with a mix of water and floor cleaner. Then, scrub the surface with a floors towel and steam machine. Burst of steam should loosen any residual paint. - Source: Internet Again, use your wide-wire brush to scrub off the loosened paint. Continue until no more paint comes off. If the stain was from latex paint, using warm soapy water as you scrub should be enough. Oil-based paints are harder to clean, therefore, proceed to the next step. - Source: Internet Rinse the treated area with warm, soapy water. Scrub off as much as you can. If the paint still remains, consider using stronger paint stripping chemicals as described below. - Source: Internet Power washing is one option but it’s not a very good one. When you blast a powerful jet of water at a concrete surface, it can cause a heap of problems. Plus, it probably won’t have the desired results that you’re after. Power washing is known to damage structures like walls, wiring and insulation. So, if you want to remove spray paint from concrete indoors, you’ll need a safer option. - Source: Internet The most intense treatment for plastic is denatured alcohol (this only works for latex-based paint, not oil paints). Be sure to protect your skin and eyes, use a respirator, and work in a well-ventilated space as the fumes can be harmful. Apply the alcohol to the area, scrub, and rinse off thoroughly. - Source: Internet The sand or soda is moved at excessive pressure along with help of a compressor and nozzle. And they are aimed at the concrete surface for abrasion of the paint. The fine dust of sand or jet of steam then washes the paint. - Source: Internet Rinsing off anything that remains can be done with plain tap water before drying off with a cloth or paper towel. A final step is usually applying a sealant if there was significant overspray present on the surface; follow instructions supplied by your chosen product for best results. For stubborn areas, it might be necessary to call in an expert – such as a professional painter – who can apply more aggressive methods of clean-up. - Source: Internet The first thing you should do is to identify the type of paint used. If the paint is latex, then you just have to scrub it off with some water and soap. Graffiti Remover Technique is an effective solution to get rid of all kinds of graffiti. - Source: Internet I can confidently say that one of the best ways to remove spray paint from a driveway is to use Acetone. Acetone is a solvent that dissolves other things easily. You can easily get it from the hardware store or online. You need to pour the solvent onto the driveway and rub it into the paint until the paint starts to dissolve. - Source: Internet This is why it’s ideal to use a paint stripper that comes in aerosol form just like its enemy so it can cover all the affected areas evenly. Using the Jenolite paint remover spray is perfect for the job as it clings to vertical surfaces, making it a highly effective treatment for removing paint from walls. Simply spray on 15-20cm away and wait 15 minutes for it to work, remove with a scorer or hard brush to get inside all of the holes and crevices. Repeat if necessary. - Source: Internet Oil-based paints are stubborn and difficult to remove. You can’t just use a paint scraper alone. Anyhow, we recommend using paint scraper to loosen the paint off. But at the end you must finish the job using a pressure washer. - Source: Internet It is possible to remove spray paint from a concrete driveway using TSP. TSP is the active ingredient in commercial concrete and masonry cleaner. Concrete and masonry cleaners contain different types of detergents, buffers and surfactants that make them effective at removing oil, grease and paint. - Source: Internet To begin with, you’ll need to get your hands on an effective paint stripper or a thinner. There are many options that are available in the market. Other than that, what you will need is a piece of clean disposable cloth and gear to protect you while working. - Source: Internet A pressure washer or a power washer is a piece of equipment that sprays a concentrated, fast squirt of water. This is a great way to remove stains and substances from various surfaces. And it works very effectively when it comes to getting rid of spray paint from concrete. - Source: Internet *I say supposedly here because that’s what I’ve heard. Our paint never started to bubble, even after applying hot vinegar to it 4 different times. When we inevitably spill paint again, I’ll try this method when the paint is fresh. I think it would work well then. - Source: Internet A lot of homeowners are finding ways to remove paint spills from concrete with or without chemicals, after a major home renovation project. They try to use vinegar or scratch dried paint off the concrete but can’t get results. That’s because they’re not following the correct way or technique to get paint off concrete. - Source: Internet This can result in any run-off water turning black and dirty, which must be collected and disposed of responsibly. For this reason, especially on newer / blacker roads, or seal-coated asphalt roads, we recommend using our Transgel. Brush thickly onto the spray can and allow some dwell time (at least10-20 minutes) before rinsing off with your pressure washer. - Source: Internet It comes, for instance, in the non-caustic gel. One good example is Prosoco’s SafStrip, a low-odor gel-based paint stripper that can dissolve even high-strength paints. Paint stripper also comes in caustic formulas or those that are solvent-based such as Prosoco’s Safety Peel 1. - Source: Internet Wet sand blasting is slower, but it’s fine for sandblasting from a driveway. By using a sandblasting method, it is possible to remove the paint from the driveway. The driveway will be no longer slippery when the paint is removed. - Source: Internet Removing spray paint from concrete can be done in various ways. Professionals, however, do not just use them mindlessly. Rather they employ each method according to what the situation requires—like if the spill is small only or large wall art such as graffiti. - Source: Internet However, do take note that such a method is often effective only when applied on fresh spray paint. It is because aside from it dish soaps are a mild and non-corrosive agent, concrete is naturally porous too. It means it absorbs any type of liquid—including paint—quickly and deeply. And once the paint dries up, it settles within the grooves of concrete, making it more complicated to lift it off by just using water and mild dish soap. - Source: Internet Home renovations projects are tricky and overwhelming. In your excitement you might forget about the mess you’re going to deal with at the finishing stages of the project. For example if you’re taking plunge of paint finishing your basement, you have to deal with spills at the end That’s because at times you can’t avoid kinds of paint spills on concrete surfaces like floors. Later on, these spills can spoil your grand party. - Source: Internet The last step is to use a wire brush to grind away the rest of the paint. You can buy them at any hardware store. It is a little time consuming, but it will be easier than scraping or sanding. - Source: Internet When soda blasting, you will need a soda blaster and special sodium bicarbonate. Prepare the blaster and spray the sodium carbonate evenly from a safe distance so that you do not end up blasting off the concrete. Remember to wear a respirator while doing this. - Source: Internet If you’re having a paint issue on a bit delicate concrete surface and a large area is already affected, soda blasting is the way to go. It is a relatively newer technique to strip paint off concrete walls and garage floors. The method is effective, environmentally friendly and will not damage your concrete surface. - Source: Internet And once that is done, apply the graffiti remover on the affected areas. But before applying, read the label carefully so that you add it in the proper proportions. When done, let the mixture sit for a while. After that, take the stiff bristle brush to scrub the area clean and take the paint off by moving the brush in a circular motion. - Source: Internet If you want to remove paint from surfaces, soap and water will do the trick. Graffiti remover can take paint off of concrete or metal. Paint thinner or stripper may be necessary for tougher coats of paint that resist scrubbing with soap and water alone. - Source: Internet Make sure that you do not leave any chemical solution on the concrete for too long. Use a soap and water mix to wipe it off. Otherwise, it will start eating away at the concrete. Toxic chemicals that have the power to dissolve the paint can easily cause permanent damage to the stone. - Source: Internet You can also use heat gun to remove paint off concrete walls. Just clean the painted area and try to prepare the heat gun properly. Once it is hot and ready, apply it from a distance of 5 inches away from the surface. At the end you can scrape away the paint. - Source: Internet Using a degreaser or soap and water, scrub well to remove the top layer of dirt, dust, or general debris. This means the paint stripper formula can work directly onto the desired surface. Then apply the paint remover liberally and give time for the formula to work, but don’t allow it to fully dry, 15 minutes should be enough. - Source: Internet As spray-paint has deep roots in the porous concrete surface, I’d recommend using a mixture of tri-sodium phosphate and water. It’s a chemical compound that’s famous for removing grease and stains from concrete and other common surfaces in your home. All you have to do is to dilute sodium-phosphate in water and apply the mixture to the affected area. Let the mixture sit over some time and then scrub it using simple brush or Bristol brush.

Sandblasting also known as grit blasting involves forcibly propelling an abrasive material against a surface. - Source: Internet After the cleaning, some paint may have already started to chip. Scrape off as much as possible and apply paint stripper to the rest of the area. You can use turpentine or mineral spirits. If this doesn’t work, use a paint stripper recommended specifically for concrete. - Source: Internet Step 1: The first step is to prep the surface and the area. Wipe or sweep off all dirt and dust. Make sure that the area is well-ventilated too, as both paint stripper and thinner are flammable. - Source: Internet While oil-based material is durable, it’s rather difficult to remove. You might need to use a paint absorbent along with the paint stripper. Mix the two and apply them to the affected area.

If you don’t have a pressure washer, other known natural methods such as vinegar and baking soda might not work depending on the severity, and so may result in more money being spent trying different processes. It’s also not worth forking out on a pressure washer if you don’t already own one just to remove <strong>paint</strong> as there’s no guarantee it’ll work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you’re trying to remove <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> over<strong>spray</strong> from a surface, there are a few basic steps that you should follow. First, use a clean, wet cloth to gently wipe the area clean. Next, mix soap into water and spritz it onto the cloth. Wring out the soapy cloth well before shaking the can of <strong>paint</strong> vigorously until all of the liquid is mixed in. Finally, aim the <strong>spray</strong> at the over<strong>spray</strong> area and hold it for several seconds before rinsing off with water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You not always have to use toxic chemicals for cleaning <strong>paint</strong> off concrete. Your kids can come in contact with such toxic chemicals. Also, remember that if you are going to use these chemical strippers to clean up old <strong>paint</strong> stains on your garage floor, you need to make sure that you wear protective gear so that you will not be accidentally doused with the chemicals. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Step 5: Finally, rinse the wall or the area using the warm water you prepared before. You can also use a garden hose, if possible. Repeat the process until the <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> is completely gone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To get <strong>paint</strong> <strong>spray</strong> off a driveway using <strong>paint</strong> thinner, you must first prepare the surface for the <strong>paint</strong> thinner to work. You need to scrape or sand off the <strong>paint</strong>. Make sure to use some kind of respirator to minimize the risks of inhaling the fumes of <strong>paint</strong> thinner. If the <strong>paint</strong> is dried, it should be scraped off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Alternatively, try <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> remover chemicals such as trisodium phosphate. Simply mix half a cup with two gallons of warm water and apply on the area. Be sure to use protective clothing and eyewear as if this chemical comes into contact with the skin or eyes it can cause damage. Apply to the <strong>spray</strong> and scrub with a brush that has fibre bristles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Well, manual scrubbing and scraping <strong>paint</strong> off concrete walls could be a time consuming and a labor-intensive method. Even if you use scraper or a grinder, the methods would be ineffective without pressure washer. So, no matter what other methods your use for removing <strong>paint</strong> of concrete garage or driveways, make sure you give finish with a pressure washer. I’d recommend never scrubbing or scraping <strong>paint</strong> in dry state because this would release <strong>paint</strong> dust and fine particles that could end up in your eyes or may get into your lungs, if you’d breathe them in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s more than a graffiti remover, it is an anti-graffiti protection system. It is a water-based solution that has a unique effect when <strong>spray</strong>ed on surfaces. The graffiti will be removed very easily. Clean the surface with some strong detergent and then <strong>spray</strong> Graffiti Remover on the surface. Use a clean cloth to wipe off the <strong>paint</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yes, you read that right. A mixture of soap and water is an effective solution to scrub off <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> off the concrete. And if you compare it to others, it is the safest, non-toxic, and most economical way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As a <strong>spray</strong> gel formula, it couldn’t be easier to use Peel Tec to remove <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> from concrete. The formula is dispensed from an aerosol canister via a nozzle that is easy to gauge. This means that you are in complete control of how much product is dispensed onto the target area. When applied, Peel Tec immediately starts working its way into the <strong>paint</strong>, dissolving it so that you can easily peel away the <strong>paint</strong> residue from the concrete within ten minutes of application. What’s left behind is a clinically clean and preserved surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The deeper we go into this list, the stronger the chemicals become. On a scale, this is somewhere in the middle and is an effective solution. TSP, or trisodium phosphate, is a proven chemical used for <strong>paint</strong> removal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Graffiti removing materials effectively penetrate the <strong>paint</strong> structure and loosen its grip from the concrete or other surfaces. They are available in the market in various forms, such as wipes, pastes, aerosol cans, and even liquid solutions. To use it in the best way, we suggest that you carefully read the instructions on the label. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Make sure that you read the label carefully and go through the instructions minutely. This will help you understand in what proportions you should apply the solvent. Following the guideline, apply the thinner to the affected portions of the concrete. Use a clean piece of cloth to wipe the <strong>paint</strong> off once you are done. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Removing dried <strong>paint</strong> from concrete, however, can be a rather frustrating process because concrete readily absorbs the <strong>paint</strong>. While removing dried <strong>paint</strong> can be time-consuming, it’s not impossible. Learn how to remove <strong>paint</strong> from concrete, step by step. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Latex is fairly easy to remove from a concrete surface compared to oil-based <strong>paint</strong>s. Most of the dried up <strong>paint</strong> will easily come off with a little scrubbing. If there are stubborn <strong>paint</strong> stains, apply a <strong>paint</strong> remover (not stripper) and let it sit for a few minutes. Once it dries up, scrape-off the stains. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Note: When dealing with large <strong>paint</strong>s on walls, keep in mind that the dissolved <strong>paint</strong> has a 100% chance to drip down the unaffected area, especially if the <strong>paint</strong> is on a vertical surface and you are using trigger <strong>spray</strong>ers. Try to avoid it by not oversaturating the area. Or, if you can get one, simply place a tape on the surface under the <strong>spray</strong>-<strong>paint</strong>ed area using a <strong>paint</strong>er’s tape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To clean up <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> over<strong>spray</strong> on the floor, you will need to wet down the area with a mix of water and floor cleaner. Then, scrub the surface with a floors towel and steam machine. Burst of steam should loosen any residual <strong>paint</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Again, use your wide-wire brush to scrub off the loosened <strong>paint</strong>. Continue until no more <strong>paint</strong> comes off. If the stain was from latex <strong>paint</strong>, using warm soapy water as you scrub should be enough. Oil-based <strong>paint</strong>s are harder to clean, therefore, proceed to the next step. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Rinse the treated area with warm, soapy water. Scrub off as much as you can. If the <strong>paint</strong> still remains, consider using stronger <strong>paint</strong> stripping chemicals as described below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Power washing is one option but it’s not a very good one. When you blast a powerful jet of water at a concrete surface, it can cause a heap of problems. Plus, it probably won’t have the desired results that you’re after. Power washing is known to damage structures like walls, wiring and insulation. So, if you want to remove <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> from concrete indoors, you’ll need a safer option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The most intense treatment for plastic is denatured alcohol (this only works for latex-based <strong>paint</strong>, not oil <strong>paint</strong>s). Be sure to protect your skin and eyes, use a respirator, and work in a well-ventilated space as the fumes can be harmful. Apply the alcohol to the area, scrub, and rinse off thoroughly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The sand or soda is moved at excessive pressure along with help of a compressor and nozzle. And they are aimed at the concrete surface for abrasion of the <strong>paint</strong>. The fine dust of sand or jet of steam then washes the <strong>paint</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Rinsing off anything that remains can be done with plain tap water before drying off with a cloth or paper towel. A final step is usually applying a sealant if there was significant over<strong>spray</strong> present on the surface; follow instructions supplied by your chosen product for best results. For stubborn areas, it might be necessary to call in an expert – such as a professional <strong>paint</strong>er – who can apply more aggressive methods of clean-up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The first thing you should do is to identify the type of <strong>paint</strong> used. If the <strong>paint</strong> is latex, then you just have to scrub it off with some water and soap. Graffiti Remover Technique is an effective solution to get rid of all kinds of graffiti. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I can confidently say that one of the best ways to remove <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> from a driveway is to use Acetone. Acetone is a solvent that dissolves other things easily. You can easily get it from the hardware store or online. You need to pour the solvent onto the driveway and rub it into the <strong>paint</strong> until the <strong>paint</strong> starts to dissolve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is why it’s ideal to use a <strong>paint</strong> stripper that comes in aerosol form just like its enemy so it can cover all the affected areas evenly. Using the Jenolite <strong>paint</strong> remover <strong>spray</strong> is perfect for the job as it clings to vertical surfaces, making it a highly effective treatment for removing <strong>paint</strong> from walls. Simply <strong>spray</strong> on 15-20cm away and wait 15 minutes for it to work, remove with a scorer or hard brush to get inside all of the holes and crevices. Repeat if necessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Oil-based <strong>paint</strong>s are stubborn and difficult to remove. You can’t just use a <strong>paint</strong> scraper alone. Anyhow, we recommend using <strong>paint</strong> scraper to loosen the <strong>paint</strong> off. But at the end you must finish the job using a pressure washer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It is possible to remove <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> from a concrete driveway using TSP. TSP is the active ingredient in commercial concrete and masonry cleaner. Concrete and masonry cleaners contain different types of detergents, buffers and surfactants that make them effective at removing oil, grease and <strong>paint</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To begin with, you’ll need to get your hands on an effective <strong>paint</strong> stripper or a thinner. There are many options that are available in the market. Other than that, what you will need is a piece of clean disposable cloth and gear to protect you while working. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A pressure washer or a power washer is a piece of equipment that <strong>spray</strong>s a concentrated, fast squirt of water. This is a great way to remove stains and substances from various surfaces. And it works very effectively when it comes to getting rid of <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> from concrete. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>*I say supposedly here because that’s what I’ve heard. Our <strong>paint</strong> never started to bubble, even after applying hot vinegar to it 4 different times. When we inevitably spill <strong>paint</strong> again, I’ll try this method when the <strong>paint</strong> is fresh. I think it would work well then. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A lot of homeowners are finding ways to remove <strong>paint</strong> spills from concrete with or without chemicals, after a major home renovation project. They try to use vinegar or scratch dried <strong>paint</strong> off the concrete but can’t get results. That’s because they’re not following the correct way or technique to get <strong>paint</strong> off concrete. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This can result in any run-off water turning black and dirty, which must be collected and disposed of responsibly. For this reason, especially on newer / blacker roads, or seal-coated asphalt roads, we recommend using our Transgel. Brush thickly onto the <strong>spray</strong> can and allow some dwell time (at least10-20 minutes) before rinsing off with your pressure washer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It comes, for instance, in the non-caustic gel. One good example is Prosoco’s SafStrip, a low-odor gel-based <strong>paint</strong> stripper that can dissolve even high-strength <strong>paint</strong>s. Paint stripper also comes in caustic formulas or those that are solvent-based such as Prosoco’s Safety Peel 1. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wet sand blasting is slower, but it’s fine for sandblasting from a driveway. By using a sandblasting method, it is possible to remove the <strong>paint</strong> from the driveway. The driveway will be no longer slippery when the <strong>paint</strong> is removed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Removing <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> from concrete can be done in various ways. Professionals, however, do not just use them mindlessly. Rather they employ each method according to what the situation requires—like if the spill is small only or large wall art such as graffiti. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, do take note that such a method is often effective only when applied on fresh <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong>. It is because aside from it dish soaps are a mild and non-corrosive agent, concrete is naturally porous too. It means it absorbs any type of liquid—including <strong>paint</strong>—quickly and deeply. And once the <strong>paint</strong> dries up, it settles within the grooves of concrete, making it more complicated to lift it off by just using water and mild dish soap. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Home renovations projects are tricky and overwhelming. In your excitement you might forget about the mess you’re going to deal with at the finishing stages of the project. For example if you’re taking plunge of <strong>paint</strong> finishing your basement, you have to deal with spills at the end That’s because at times you can’t avoid kinds of <strong>paint</strong> spills on concrete surfaces like floors. Later on, these spills can spoil your grand party. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The last step is to use a wire brush to grind away the rest of the <strong>paint</strong>. You can buy them at any hardware store. It is a little time consuming, but it will be easier than scraping or sanding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When soda blasting, you will need a soda blaster and special sodium bicarbonate. Prepare the blaster and <strong>spray</strong> the sodium carbonate evenly from a safe distance so that you do not end up blasting off the concrete. Remember to wear a respirator while doing this. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re having a <strong>paint</strong> issue on a bit delicate concrete surface and a large area is already affected, soda blasting is the way to go. It is a relatively newer technique to strip <strong>paint</strong> off concrete walls and garage floors. The method is effective, environmentally friendly and will not damage your concrete surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>And once that is done, apply the graffiti remover on the affected areas. But before applying, read the label carefully so that you add it in the proper proportions. When done, let the mixture sit for a while. After that, take the stiff bristle brush to scrub the area clean and take the <strong>paint</strong> off by moving the brush in a circular motion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to remove <strong>paint</strong> from surfaces, soap and water will do the trick. Graffiti remover can take <strong>paint</strong> off of concrete or metal. Paint thinner or stripper may be necessary for tougher coats of <strong>paint</strong> that resist scrubbing with soap and water alone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Make sure that you do not leave any chemical solution on the concrete for too long. Use a soap and water mix to wipe it off. Otherwise, it will start eating away at the concrete. Toxic chemicals that have the power to dissolve the <strong>paint</strong> can easily cause permanent damage to the stone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can also use heat gun to remove <strong>paint</strong> off concrete walls.

Then apply the <strong>paint</strong> remover liberally and give time for the formula to work, but don’t allow it to fully dry, 15 minutes should be enough. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As <strong>spray</strong>-<strong>paint</strong> has deep roots in the porous concrete surface, I’d recommend using a mixture of tri-sodium phosphate and water. It’s a chemical compound that’s famous for removing grease and stains from concrete and other common surfaces in your home. All you have to do is to dilute sodium-phosphate in water and apply the mixture to the affected area. Let the mixture sit over some time and then scrub it using simple brush or Bristol brush. That’s set; you have easily removed the <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> off concrete. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you have a concrete driveway that is – let’s say around 200 mm deep, you can restore the shine and remove <strong>paint</strong> spots off using sandblasting.

Sandblasting also known as grit blasting involves forcibly propelling an abrasive material against a surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After the cleaning, some <strong>paint</strong> may have already started to chip.

If this doesn’t work, use a <strong>paint</strong> stripper recommended specifically for concrete. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Step 1: The first step is to prep the surface and the area. Wipe or sweep off all dirt and dust. Make sure that the area is well-ventilated too, as both <strong>paint</strong> stripper and thinner are flammable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While oil-based material is durable, it’s rather difficult to remove. You might need to use a <strong>paint</strong> absorbent along with the <strong>paint</strong> stripper. Mix the two and apply them to the affected area. Let the solution sit for 30 minutes to one hour and scrub the surface with a nylon brush. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For those familiar with using an angle grinder, removing <strong>paint</strong> stains will be a cakewalk. It is one of the quickest and most straightforward solutions for getting rid of stubborn <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> stains from concrete.

Because you do not have to do it manually, it saves time and effort too. And if you end up combining it with TSP or a graffiti remover, you will see the results even faster. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This step may require you to use more than just a good supply of rinsing solutions.
