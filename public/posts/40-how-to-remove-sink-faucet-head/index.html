No rubber gloves nearby? Then, use a piece of dry cloth instead. Usually, the aerator is screwed on manually. So, it should come off similarly too. However, if the aerator refuses to budge, you should contemplate a different route. - Source: Internet A substitute method would be to apply heat on the region, wait for it to cool down, and then try to unscrew with appropriate tools. Heat expands the interatomic space between the cluster molecules and eventually disintegrates the mass. However, keep in mind that overheating could ruin the faucet. - Source: Internet When you get low water flow from your kitchen pull-down faucet, there could very well be a blockage in the spray head. This is usually caused by calcium deposits in the aerator, inlet screen or backflow preventer, and vinegar will dissolve buildup in all of these. However, you should check first that the spray head is actually the source of the problem, because sometimes the real culprit is a component of the faucet you wouldn’t normally suspect: the quick-connect fitting between the spray head hose and the faucet body. - Source: Internet For the individual faucet parts you will need to go to the manufacturer and purchase it from them (or another parts supplier… just search “kitchen faucet head” and you will find many different results). You can also try just going to Lowes or Home Depot or your local hardware store and see if they have a generic replacement head. The Home Depot site lists one: Spray-Head for Kitchen Pull-Out Faucets but it says it is only available in store. - Source: Internet In case your faucet contains a cartridge, (which will be the case if you own a high-end faucet) you will encounter a gold-colored piece after removing the Allen key. You can either use your hands or an old towel (tie it around the piece) and wrench to remove it. Utilizing a towel would be a wiser option as it can protect the gold-colored piece from any damage or scratch from the wrench. - Source: Internet When you unscrew the spray head for cleaning, open the faucet and watch the water flowing from the hose. If you don’t see a full, steady stream, it doesn’t hurt to clean the spray head anyway, but the obstruction is deeper in the pipes, and the most likely place, believe it or not, is the quick-connect fitting at the other end of the faucet hose. This plastic connector, which comes with many pull-down faucets, can get blocked with mineral deposits. You can also clean it with vinegar. - Source: Internet Step 1: Remove the Button On the front of the faucet, you’ll find a spout and two buttons for controlling the temperature. Use a flathead screwdriver to support the edges of the buttons as you click. Care should be taken when extracting or handling the buttons because they are delicate. The buttons are of medium scale, which allows them to drain comfortably. Furthermore, you have to make sure that you have covered the drain properly before transferring them to the drain. - Source: Internet Not all faucets have hidden aerators. In some faucets, a metal housing holds the aerator. If you are not sure what type of aerator your faucet has, look for a box-like structure on your faucet. If there is one, your aerator would be a housed aerator. Relying on your hands might not be a practical move considering these aerators are more difficult to remove. - Source: Internet An aerator could be overly resilient if there is too much sediment buildup. In extreme cases, you can’t even get desired results with tools. So, you have to address the core issue before trying to remove the faucet again. Remember, exerting too much pressure with tools might damage the faucet and the aerator. So, you have to rethink your strategy. - Source: Internet Some Moen faucets have handles that remove by loosening the screw in the back of the handle. To loosen this screw use a 3/32\" hex wrench. After the handle has been removed unscrew the spout collar nut by turning counterclockwise then lift and rotate the spout. - Source: Internet Rubber has a superb grip, so it’s unnecessary to use an intermediary layer of clothing when using a rubber wrench to unscrew an aerator. Since the rubber is soft, it won’t harm the faucet surface either. Place the wrench on the aerator and continue turning anti-clockwise till it falls off. - Source: Internet The acidic nature of vinegar will make it actively attack the grimy elements. Within an hour or so, the reaction will disperse dirt and make the aerator as clean as new. There would be no need to take out the aerator from the faucet to complete this procedure. It will be a thorough cleanse. - Source: Internet Once you have removed your Allen key, the next thing to do is remove the handle from the sink bathroom. However, a few faucets may contain cartridges. In case your faucet has one, you will have to unscrew the top of the cartridge to expose it. If your facet does not have a cartridge, you will find the actual faucet where the water comes through after removing the Allen key. - Source: Internet To locate the quick-connect fitting, go inside the cabinet with a headlamp and follow the faucet hose from the point it exits the spout tube until you find the connection to the faucet body. Disconnect it by squeezing the tabs and pulling it apart, then unscrew it from the spray hose using pliers. Soak it for several hours in vinegar, replace it, and the flow should be restored. - Source: Internet To remove water spots, use warm water and a soft, damp cloth. To lessen the need for this step (or to skip it altogether), get a faucet that has SpotShield Technology. This innovation helps your faucet stay cleaner longer by resisting water spots and fingerprints. There’s even antimicrobial protection of the finish that helps prevent the microbial growth associated with stains and odor. SpotShield finishes are available for kitchen and bath faucets and shower heads, too. - Source: Internet You don’t necessarily have to remove the faucet to give it a good wash. You can clear up the sediment mass and rust by applying a cleaning agent like vinegar. Soak a rag in vinegar and tie it around the aerator. - Source: Internet A faucet aerator is a nifty device responsible for keeping the water flow in check through the faucet. Over time, the aerator becomes clogged because of the mineral deposits that come with the water. In this article, we will discuss how to remove a faucet aerator without a wrench so that you can clean it or replace it without any hassle. - Source: Internet Image Faucet aerators are screens at the end of a faucet. The devices reduce the amount of water that comes out of a faucet and control the stream.

Remove water spots and buildup with the tips below, then apply regular TLC to keep them looking clean. “Remember to always dry the faucets and knobs after use to prevent water with trace minerals drying on them.” - Source: Internet Always lubricate faucet O-rings with silicone-based grease (Moen part number 99915). Do not use plumber’s grade faucet grease, silicon sprays or any lubricant that contain petroleum. Petroleum based lubricants may react with rubber seals and actually cause the faucet to become even more difficult to operate. - Source: Internet Rust and mineral deposits can make the aerator stuck. How to remove the aerator from a faucet in such a situation? A household kitchen essential like vinegar can bail out of this trouble. In chemistry textbooks, vinegar is known as acetic acid.

When its prongs fit the ridges, slowly turn counter-clockwise and take the aerator off when it’s loose enough. - Source: Internet Pull the handle out of the hose when the screw pops out. Try to use a pair of pliers or faucet pullers if you can’t do it with your hands. If used directly, the pliers might damage your handle by scratching it.

Replacing a kitchen faucet is not too hard; the hardest part is removing the old faucet (plus squeezing yourself under the sink). - Source: Internet The front side of the faucet’s handle consists of 2 different types of buttons: Cold and Hot. Carefully apply some pressure on the edge of the buttons with a flat head screwdriver. You have to be very gentle while handling or removing the buttons as they are extremely fragile. Being small in size, the buttons can easily go down the drain channel. Hence, make sure the drain is covered to avoid losing the buttons. - Source: Internet Wondering how to remove a faucet aerator without a wrench?
