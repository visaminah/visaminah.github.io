These are designed to cut against the grain of the wood, so when felling a tree, it should be swung sideways at the tree trunk.

For a felling axe, a longer handle will give a greater swing and more leverage, but a shorter handle will result in better precision. The standard length of a full-sized felling axe is 36 inches, but this should be the maximum length most users should consider. A person who is six foot tall would be best with a handle measuring around 32 inches, as this will offer a good balance between accuracy and force. - Source: Internet 430 Kelly True Temper 5 1/2 lb lb rafting axe in excellent, little used condition. 8 1/2 x 5 x 32\", 3.3kg - Source: Internet A hunter’s axe is the essential tool for a hunter, serving the dual purpose of chopping wood and meat. A good hunter’s axe will have a grooved handle, which improves grip even if the user’s hands are wet or sticky, be it from rain or animal blood. An ordinary axe would not work well to skin an animal, as the straight poll with sharp corners is likely to inadvertently damage the animal hide. By comparison, a hunter’s axe has a rounded ‘flay poll,’ which will be more useful for animal skinning. This type of axe is not widely available, and you would need to find a specialist forger to buy a hunter’s axe. - Source: Internet 418 Kelly Rockaway pattern 3 1/2 lb with good vintage hickory handle. 8 x 5 x 30\", 2.3kg - Source: Internet The most popular axe used today is the felling axe, which is also known as the American axe.

They are extremely heavy-duty tools and are too cumbersome to carry around on camping trips, but it would be great to store permanently at a cabin in the woods. These axes have extra long handles and are intended to cut down very large trees. A forest axe will have a sharp and flared blade with a slightly curved tip. - Source: Internet The other head is a hammer, which is for pounding in roofing nails when fixing shingles to the roof. Often, the hammer head will be magnetized, so you won’t need to hold the nails in place, and instead just attach them to the front of the hammer and jam them in. Roofing axes also have an additional feature, in the form of a node on the sharp blade side. This node is a shingle gauge, which can be used by hooking it over the front face of the shingle below the one you are setting, with the hammer head pointing upwards. The next shingle should sit up against the hammer head, giving you evenly placed rows of shingle. - Source: Internet Yes, eBay sells a variety of used hatchet or axe shafts and heads.

The head of a felling axe will weigh between two and four pounds, and sit at the end of a long handle. This long handle enables the user to produce a more powerful swing with greater leverage, making for a better cut. Traditionally the handles are made from hickory wood, which is strong. The grain of the hickory should follow the handle lengthways and curve along with it, for superior strength. - Source: Internet 478 True Temper Flint Edge 12\" broad axe in very good condition. 8 1/2 x 12 x 32\", 3.9kg - Source: Internet The double bit axe has two blades, one on either side of the head.

They used it to chop firewood while on extended trips to the cold north, and also as an all-purpose axe for other tasks. Size-wise, it is in between that of a hatchet and a full-sized felling axe.

This shape was useful for a variety of things in battle, such as hooking an opponent’s ankle to trip them over or hooking their shield out of the way to render them defenseless. The tips of the blade would be incredibly sharp so that they could slash throats like with a knife, and the blunt butt of an axe would also be utilized, usually to bang someone on the head to cause a humiliating but not lethal blow. The heads were almost always made from iron, while the handles were wooden. These types of axes are no longer used today; instead, they are studied to learn about past civilizations. - Source: Internet Canfield, James (1976). “County’s axe-making history began in 1835” and other titles.

The axes used in this sport can vary in type and design, but their main feature is that they need to be incredibly durable and sturdy so that they can cope with the pressure they are put under from numerous throws. - Source: Internet The weight of the axe head will affect its use.

They have a design very similar to a felling axe, with a long wooden handle to give a good swing. When using a splitting maul, you should use a downward swing, not a sideways swing like that used for a felling axe. Unlike felling axes, which cut against the grain of the wood, splitting mauls cut with the grain, which is what results in split wood rather than chopped wood. The head of a splitting maul will be much heavier than a felling axe, at around eight pounds. - Source: Internet 497 Keesteel washboard approximately 2 lb hafted as hatchet with a reshaped vintage hickory handle. 6 x 3 3/4 x 17\", 1.1kg - Source: Internet 431 Rare Robert Sorby bearded side axe London coopers pattern.

For a felling <strong>axe</strong>, a longer handle will give a greater swing and more leverage, but a shorter handle will result in better precision. The standard length of a full-sized felling <strong>axe</strong> is 36 inches, but this should be the maximum length most users should consider.

A good hunter’s <strong>axe</strong> will have a grooved handle, which improves grip even if the user’s hands are wet or sticky, be it from rain or animal blood. An ordinary <strong>axe</strong> would not work well to skin an animal, as the straight poll with sharp corners is likely to inadvertently damage the animal hide. By comparison, a hunter’s <strong>axe</strong> has a rounded ‘flay poll,’ which will be more useful for animal skinning.

They are extremely heavy-duty tools and are too cumbersome to carry around on camping trips, but it would be great to store permanently at a cabin in the woods.

Often, the hammer head will be magnetized, so you won’t need to hold the nails in place, and instead just attach them to the front of the hammer and jam them in. Roofing <strong>axe</strong>s also have an additional feature, in the form of a node on the sharp blade side. This node is a shingle gauge, which can be used by hooking it over the front face of the shingle below the one you are setting, with the hammer head pointing upwards. The next shingle should sit up against the hammer head, giving you evenly placed rows of shingle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yes, eBay sells a variety of used hatchet or <strong>axe</strong> shafts and heads.

The head of a felling <strong>axe</strong> will weigh between two and four pounds, and sit at the end of a long handle. This long handle enables the user to produce a more powerful swing with greater leverage, making for a better cut. Traditionally the handles are made from hickory wood, which is strong. The grain of the hickory should follow the handle lengthways and curve along with it, for superior strength. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>478 True Temper Flint Edge 12" broad <strong>axe</strong> in very good condition. 8 1/2 x 12 x 32", 3.9kg - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The double bit <strong>axe</strong> has two blades, one on either side of the head.

The tips of the blade would be incredibly sharp so that they could slash throats like with a knife, and the blunt butt of an <strong>axe</strong> would also be utilized, usually to bang someone on the head to cause a humiliating but not lethal blow. The heads were almost always made from iron, while the handles were wooden.
