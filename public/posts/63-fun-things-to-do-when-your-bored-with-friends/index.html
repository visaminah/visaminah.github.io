Play fun classics or spooky tales at your backyard outdoor movie theatre! - Source: Internet If you’re bored eating the same recipes all the time, discover new foods by hosting a potluck.

In summer, you can chill at pool parties, go on adventurous road trips, visit the beach and laze around, watch your favorite movies together or arrange a cute picnic.

Set up a day of each weekend where you can visit each others houses and help your friends to clean their closets, rooms, a garage, or garden. Serve drinks and food and trade stuff among yourselves. - Source: Internet This is a fun game to play to help with your child’s sensory development. Just like the name suggests, you take turns closing your eyes for this game. Brush a mystery object on your child’s hand and let them describe how the object feels and then guess what it might be. Try a feather, piece of fruit, or book. This game makes children use their sense of touch in place of vision relying on sensory integration skills to do so. - Source: Internet Check up on an Old Friend: Most times, our excuse for not checking up on old friends is that we do not have the time. Now you have the time, check up on that old friend or family member that you haven’t seen in a while. They would appreciate the visit or call, and catching up on old times would help you forget your boredom. - Source: Internet Sing karaoke. Traditional karaoke is fun enough, but if you’re looking for a good laugh, try Cowboy Karaoke. The person singing has headphones on with the song on a high volume, is blindfolded, and can’t hear themselves sing. For everyone else, you get an awkwardly hilarious a cappella performance. - Source: Internet Play Video Game: There are hundreds of new video games coming out weekly. You can grab the latest one from your favorite vendor and have a fun time learning how to play. - Source: Internet Host a Backyard Outdoor Movie: Bring out the projector and play movies on the side of your house or the front of your garage.

There is always an interesting topic, photo or video that would keep you engrossed and get rid of your boredom. - Source: Internet Start a garden club. One of the best parts about a garden club is that you can make it whatever you want it to be. Want to share gardening tips with friends? Go for it! Just craving some gossip-time with friends instead? A garden club is perfect for that, too. Get some friends on board, send out a fun paper (or virtual) invitation, and you’ve got time set aside for working on that green thumb. - Source: Internet Candle-making is fairly simple.

Caricatures and cartoons are fun too. - Source: Internet Who says scavenger hunts are just an outdoor activity? You can set up a scavenger hunt indoors by placing clues around the house and having your little one look for household products for the next clue (they can be simple objects, such as a toilet paper roll, a paper plate, a blue sock, etc.). Once they have found everything on the hunt, there can be a fun game or prize at the end; possibly some ice cream, or a fun craft to make. And hey, if the clouds part, then turn it into a nature scavenger hunt! There are many developmental benefits of outdoor activities for kids and playing in nature. - Source: Internet While the days of quarantine may feel long behind us, I still remember dying to spend time with friends. And sure, I’ve gotten back into the swing of things when it comes to socializing, but just “hanging out” doesn’t seem to cut it anymore.

To help inspire my own creative hangouts, I put together this list of things to do with friends when bored. - Source: Internet The doldrums hit us all eventually. When you’ve run through all the best movies on Netflix, you find yourself pacing between the fridge and the couch and the walls start to feel a little closer together than they’ve ever been before, you know the dreaded boredom monster has come knocking. But don’t worry — you’re not alone! Boredom comes for us all eventually, and it can feel impossible to find creative ways to entertain yourself once you’ve gotten into that rut. - Source: Internet Make a list of things to find in the local area. For example, if you live in a large town, your list could include “a napkin from a restaurant,” “a squirrel in a tree,” “a funny sign”, “a convertible car,” “a statue,” and “a piece of jewelry worth over $1,000.” - Source: Internet Let your child invent an imaginary pet. It can be a pet they wish they had or it doesn’t even have to be a real animal. Sometimes the mythical, made-up animals are more fun. Does it have the body of an eagle and the tusks of an elephant? Can it fly? Can it swim, but only in pools? Have your child come up with a name and story for their creature. Your child can draw pictures to tell the story of how their creature came to be. - Source: Internet Find karaoke tracks on Spotify or YouTube and sing along. It doesn’t matter if you can’t sing very well. Just have fun! - Source: Internet Buy some cheap colored chalks and create some original artwork on your driveway. Have fun working together on a huge drawing. At the end of the day, simply wash it away with a hose or pressure washer. - Source: Internet Start a costume bin in your house.

From board games and self-care to getting into gardening (or indoor houseplants!) and organizing or optimizing your space, these unique activities will keep your brain stimulated and your body busy. - Source: Internet End your weekend with a blast while bringing up your childhood memories. Plan a trip to an amusement park to take some adventurous, fun rides. Indulge in spicy, finger-licking street food like hotdogs and noodles, and end your day with a chocolaty dessert or an ice cream. - Source: Internet Try a new recipe. Because trial and error is more fun to laugh at with a friend. - Source: Internet Let the fun never end with a fun-filled pajama party. Call your friends and bounce at someone’s place for a slumber party. Keep the essentials ready – beanbags, midnight snacks, drinks, games, and music to make your party a big hit. Such parties are an excellent platform to strengthen your friendship and give it a new turn by sharing secrets and discussing peppy things. - Source: Internet Start an Online Course: Another helpful way to kill boredom is to take a course online. There are plenty of free courses online that you can subscribe to. - Source: Internet Pour over magazines. Resurrect one of the best parts of being a teen and gather up your favorite magazines.

Dog-ear recipes you want to make and talk about the interesting ideas and conversation starters the articles bring up. - Source: Internet But the thing about eating at the buzziest restaurant in town and jetting off to a tropical destination for a bachelorette trip is that it gets kinda costly—and fast. One night at the bar everyone’s talking about can easily set you back a nice chunk of change (and maybe you’re looking for fun things to do with friends at home anyway). When you need to be budget-conscious because you’re saving up for something big or you’re just trying to stack some cash, it often feels like you have very limited affordable options for bonding with your friends. Are all the fun activities really this expensive?! - Source: Internet One creative parent told us she made a “boredom” jar for her house. She cuts scraps of paper and writes a different activity for kids on each one. Each scrap contains suggestions like: “make paper boats”; “make friendship bracelets”, “play a ball toss game”, and other crafts and activities. Whenever her kids say they’re bored, instead of watching TV, she lets them choose three papers from the boredom jar and they can choose an activity to complete. It’s a great way to collect and store rainy day activities! - Source: Internet This is a time where we’re all looking for ways to get outside of normal, or what’s become the new normal.

These also make for great indoor winter activities, when it’s more challenging to get and stay outside! - Source: Internet Slumber parties are nostalgic fun and let you pretend to be teenagers again. Do all the things you used to do at a sleepover with teenage friends: watch movies, give each other makeovers, eat an excessive amount of junk food, and play easy, silly games like “truth or dare.” - Source: Internet Did you know that handwriting, coloring, and cutting are a great way for children to practice fine motor skills? Get out fun stationary or plain paper and envelopes and let your children decorate the paper. Help them write a letter to a distant relative or old friend.

Or, go big and buy an inflatable movie screen. Play <strong>fun</strong> classics or spooky tales at your backyard outdoor movie theatre! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re <strong>bored</strong> eating the same recipes all the time, discover new foods by hosting a potluck. Ask everyone to bring along one dish. You could decide on a theme for your potluck, such as “Italian food,” “favorite comfort food,” or “secret family recipes.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>People watching is what makes bar hopping the most <strong>fun</strong> anyway. And if you wanna grab a few drinks while you&rsquo;re at it, nothing&rsquo;s stopping you. Sometimes bars even have free trivia nights you can get in on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=86><li>Visit the Local Library: If you love books, you can never be <strong>bored</strong> visiting the library. Even if you don’t enjoy reading books, you would enjoy meeting new friends there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li><ol start=50><li>Have a picnic. Picnics are such a <strong>fun</strong> way to get outside and enjoy a simple meal with friends. Pack up some portable recipes or these vegan alternatives, lay down a blanket, and savor the vibes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>There are so many <strong>fun</strong> things to do with your friends all year round. In summer, you can chill at pool parties, go on adventurous road trips, visit the beach and laze around, watch your favorite movies together or arrange a cute picnic. You can even do more productive yet cool and <strong>fun</strong> stuff like cooking up meals together, doing DIY projects or home decors, and volunteering. Similarly, nighttime is more suitable for pajama parties, bonfires, game nights, and camping. All the <strong>fun</strong> ideas shared above can help you and your friends bond and have a great time together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Help out, have <strong>fun</strong> organizational party. Set up a day of each weekend where you can visit each others houses and help your friends to clean their closets, rooms, a garage, or garden. Serve drinks and food and trade stuff among yourselves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a <strong>fun</strong> game to play to help with your child’s sensory development. Just like the name suggests, you take turns closing your eyes for this game. Brush a mystery object on your child’s hand and let them describe how the object feels and then guess what it might be. Try a feather, piece of fruit, or book. This game makes children use their sense of touch in place of vision relying on sensory integration skills to do so. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol><li>Check up on an Old Friend: Most times, our excuse for not checking up on old friends is that we do not have the time. Now you have the time, check up on that old friend or family member that you haven’t seen in a while. They would appreciate the visit or call, and catching up on old times would help you forget your <strong>bored</strong>om. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li><ol start=30><li>Sing karaoke. Traditional karaoke is <strong>fun</strong> enough, but if you’re looking for a good laugh, try Cowboy Karaoke. The person singing has headphones on with the song on a high volume, is blindfolded, and can’t hear themselves sing. For everyone else, you get an awkwardly hilarious a cappella performance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li><ol start=85><li>Play Video Game: There are hundreds of new video games coming out weekly. You can grab the latest one from your favorite vendor and have a <strong>fun</strong> time learning how to play. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Host a Backyard Outdoor Movie: Bring out the projector and play movies on the side of your house or the front of your garage. Or, go big and buy an inflatable movie screen. Play <strong>fun</strong> classics or spooky tales. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=2><li>Go on Social Media: It is almost impossible to get <strong>bored</strong> on social media. There is always an interesting topic, photo or video that would keep you engrossed and get rid of your <strong>bored</strong>om. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li><ol start=48><li>Start a garden club. One of the best parts about a garden club is that you can make it whatever you want it to be. Want to share gardening tips with friends? Go for it! Just craving some gossip-time with friends instead? A garden club is perfect for that, too. Get some friends on board, send out a <strong>fun</strong> paper (or virtual) invitation, and you’ve got time set aside for working on that green thumb. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Candle-making is fairly simple. You can buy essential supplies in most craft stores, and there are lots of online tutorials to help you get started. Have <strong>fun</strong> customizing your candles with dried flowers, essential oils, and dyes. ProFlowers has a step-by-step guide for beginners. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Set a timer for 5 minutes and sketch each others’ portraits. They don’t have to be realistic drawings. Caricatures and cartoons are <strong>fun</strong> too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Who says scavenger hunts are just an outdoor activity? You can set up a scavenger hunt indoors by placing clues around the house and having your little one look for household products for the next clue (they can be simple objects, such as a toilet paper roll, a paper plate, a blue sock, etc.). Once they have found everything on the hunt, there can be a <strong>fun</strong> game or prize at the end; possibly some ice cream, or a <strong>fun</strong> craft to make. And hey, if the clouds part, then turn it into a nature scavenger hunt! There are many developmental benefits of outdoor activities for kids and playing in nature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While the days of quarantine may feel long behind us, I still remember dying to spend time with friends. And sure, I’ve gotten back into the swing of things when it comes to socializing, but just “hanging out” doesn’t seem to cut it anymore. So if you’re tempted to scroll your social media or resort to the same old coffee shop/water hole that you frequent, keep reading. To help inspire my own creative hangouts, I put together this list of things to do with friends when <strong>bored</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The doldrums hit us all eventually. When you&rsquo;ve run through all the best movies on Netflix, you find yourself pacing between the fridge and the couch and the walls start to feel a little closer together than they&rsquo;ve ever been before, you know the dreaded <strong>bored</strong>om monster has come knocking. But don&rsquo;t worry — you&rsquo;re not alone! Boredom comes for us all eventually, and it can feel impossible to find creative ways to entertain yourself once you&rsquo;ve gotten into that rut. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Make a list of things to find in the local area. For example, if you live in a large town, your list could include “a napkin from a restaurant,” “a squirrel in a tree,” “a <strong>fun</strong>ny sign”, “a convertible car,” “a statue,” and “a piece of jewelry worth over $1,000.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Let your child invent an imaginary pet. It can be a pet they wish they had or it doesn’t even have to be a real animal. Sometimes the mythical, made-up animals are more <strong>fun</strong>. Does it have the body of an eagle and the tusks of an elephant? Can it fly? Can it swim, but only in pools? Have your child come up with a name and story for their creature. Your child can draw pictures to tell the story of how their creature came to be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Find karaoke tracks on Spotify or YouTube and sing along. It doesn’t matter if you can’t sing very well. Just have <strong>fun</strong>! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Buy some cheap colored chalks and create some original artwork on your driveway. Have <strong>fun</strong> working together on a huge drawing. At the end of the day, simply wash it away with a hose or pressure washer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Start a costume bin in your house. Fill it with your clothes from past decades, old Halloween costumes, and goofy finds from thrift stores. Whenever your little one is looking for something <strong>fun</strong> to do, pull out the costume bin and let them step into character! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Instead of sitting around on your phone getting lost in the news and social media (ahem, doomscrolling), pivot to some <strong>fun</strong> things you can do at home or in your own backyard. We’ve rounded up the best things to when you’re <strong>bored</strong>, many of which require little to no money or extra materials. From board games and self-care to getting into gardening (or indoor houseplants!) and organizing or optimizing your space, these unique activities will keep your brain stimulated and your body busy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>End your weekend with a blast while bringing up your childhood memories. Plan a trip to an amusement park to take some adventurous, <strong>fun</strong> rides. Indulge in spicy, finger-licking street food like hotdogs and noodles, and end your day with a chocolaty dessert or an ice cream. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=16><li>Try a new recipe. Because trial and error is more <strong>fun</strong> to laugh at with a friend. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Let the <strong>fun</strong> never end with a <strong>fun</strong>-filled pajama party. Call your friends and bounce at someone’s place for a slumber party. Keep the essentials ready – beanbags, midnight snacks, drinks, games, and music to make your party a big hit. Such parties are an excellent platform to strengthen your friendship and give it a new turn by sharing secrets and discussing peppy things. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=39><li>Start an Online Course: Another helpful way to kill <strong>bored</strong>om is to take a course online. There are plenty of free courses online that you can subscribe to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li><ol start=42><li>Pour over magazines. Resurrect one of the best parts of being a teen and gather up your favorite magazines. While these might be a progression from the stuff we loved in middle and high school, the <strong>fun</strong> remains the same. Dog-ear recipes you want to make and talk about the interesting ideas and conversation starters the articles bring up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>But the thing about eating at the buzziest restaurant in town and jetting off to a tropical destination for a bachelorette trip is that it gets kinda costly—and fast. One night at the bar everyone’s talking about can easily set you back a nice chunk of change (and maybe you&rsquo;re looking for <strong>fun</strong> things to do with friends at home anyway). When you need to be budget-conscious because you’re saving up for something big or you’re just trying to stack some cash, it often feels like you have very limited affordable options for bonding with your friends. Are all the <strong>fun</strong> activities really this expensive?! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One creative parent told us she made a “<strong>bored</strong>om” jar for her house. She cuts scraps of paper and writes a different activity for kids on each one. Each scrap contains suggestions like: “make paper boats”; “make friendship bracelets”, “play a ball toss game”, and other crafts and activities. Whenever her kids say they’re <strong>bored</strong>, instead of watching TV, she lets them choose three papers from the <strong>bored</strong>om jar and they can choose an activity to complete. It’s a great way to collect and store rainy day activities! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a time where we’re all looking for ways to get outside of normal, or what’s become the new normal. We’ve created a list of 100 activities for kids that they can do outside. That’s right, <strong>fun</strong> things to do outside. Turn off those screens, step away from the Zoom and enjoy your yard, play in your neighborhood and find <strong>fun</strong> at a park near you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=4><li>Window Shop Online: Window shopping is not limited to physical stores. Online window shopping is very convenient and <strong>fun</strong>- you don’t have to spend a dime or drive through traffic to feed your eyes on beautiful items that you can buy later. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li><ol start=37><li>Have <strong>fun</strong> with flowers. Take a trip to the store and buy a variety of your favorite flowers. Set yourselves up with vases and all the tools you need to craft your own DIY bouquets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>End your day with your friends by preparing a pleasurable meal. Grab a bottle of wine and invite your friends to cook savory dishes. You can play music, chit-chat with each other, and crack jokes to take someone’s case in a <strong>fun</strong> way while cooking and baking all that you and your friends like. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=10><li>Make something creative. Go to the art supply store and pick out a <strong>fun</strong> project or go to town on old jeans or t-shirts with some scissors and an embroidery kit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>I bet you have most of the supplies you need already. If not, add them to the grocery list. There are even <strong>fun</strong> FREE printables added in along the way! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=18><li>Make your own pizza. Start from scratch with homemade dough or use store-bought crusts. Get personal sizes so everyone can go crazy with their topping choices. Way more <strong>fun</strong> than Domino’s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>To make your friendships last and have <strong>fun</strong> things with friends, you need to find hobbies to do at home with your dearest friends. After all, there is more to life than just your day-to-day job and boring routine. Cheap hobbies will enhance your creativity and improve your physical and mental health. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Host a dinner party and ask everyone to bring a dish to share. If you don’t enjoy cooking, maybe try and learn how to cook a new dish together with your friends. The <strong>fun</strong> with friends is guaranteed! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Staying in proper shape and keeping your weight in check are <strong>fun</strong>damentals of a healthy life. So, ask your friends to join fitness sessions or sports clubs. You can go for badminton, swimming, yoga, or gymming. And never let go of the company of your friends even while you are involved in physical activities. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But rainy day activities don’t need to be a bummer! When kids say they are <strong>bored</strong>, there are many different rainy day activities and games children can try instead of using screens. From easy crafting to <strong>fun</strong> learning activities, there are so many rainy day games that can keep kids on the move and entertained. Next time your child is stuck inside on a rainy day, offer some of these <strong>fun</strong> activities when they tell you they’re <strong>bored</strong>. These also make for great indoor winter activities, when it’s more challenging to get and stay outside! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Slumber parties are nostalgic <strong>fun</strong> and let you pretend to be teenagers again. Do all the things you used to do at a sleepover with teenage friends: watch movies, give each other makeovers, eat an excessive amount of junk food, and play easy, silly games like “truth or dare.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Did you know that handwriting, coloring, and cutting are a great way for children to practice fine motor skills? Get out <strong>fun</strong> stationary or plain paper and envelopes and let your children decorate the paper. Help them write a letter to a distant relative or old friend. Writing a letter can also help with their communication skills. If they’re too young to write, have them make a card with illustrations. Teach them how to address the letter and explain the how postage and stamps work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=69><li>Host a House Party: House parties are very good <strong>bored</strong>om killers. You can invite your friends over for a small party or a sleepover. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Dragging out Scrabble or Yahtzee is one of the most interesting and <strong>fun</strong> things to do with friends. You can hang out and play all sorts of games with large groups or small ones. Hold a tournament and compete against each other. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The weather is definitely improving, and if you are anything like us, you need to get outside. I feel like we’ve been stuck inside so much lately! So now’s the time to pull out the easy to do outdoor activities, and of course, we’ve got you covered with everything from crafts to STEM depending on your preferences and interest.

Look through your library for a book you can read, or loan one from a friend. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li><ol start=3><li>Play a game. Whether it’s cards, a board game, or old-fashioned hide and seek, games are a great <strong>bored</strong>om buster for friends. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Picnics are always <strong>fun</strong>, and nothing can beat the adventure of a summer picnic. So, choose a pretty little spot nearby your house with lush greenery and blossoming flowers to add appeal. Don’t forget to carry a picnic basket filled with yummy treats and drinks. You can also take your favorite novel, a camera for capturing beautiful memories, a guitar, or some outdoor game props. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Puzzles can be <strong>fun</strong> bonding activities. Try working on sudokus, crosswords, word searches, or jigsaws with your friends. If you’re feeling more competitive, have a puzzle race with a prize for the person who completes the puzzle first. Richardson Puzzles and Games has lots of free puzzles to download. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=22><li>Purge your closet with a style show. You know that scene from Sex & The City when Carrie Bradshaw moves out of her apartment and tries on all of her outfits for her friends to vote on? Yeah, do that. Productive and <strong>fun</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>If you&rsquo;re looking for something to pass the time yourself or are the parent or guardian of <strong>bored</strong> and uninspired kids and teens, we have some great solutions to keep you and them entertained. And who knows? The kids may even love some of the options we&rsquo;ve rounded up here, like trying a TikTok dance challenge, facing off during a family game night, or enjoying an indoor picnic.

Use markers to draw faces and scissor to cut a mouth. You can then put on a puppet show with your sock puppets! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Research local “pick your own” farms. You might be able to visit local apple orchards or pumpkin patches in the fall or sunflower patches in the summer. Choosing your own produce is more <strong>fun</strong> than buying it at the grocery store. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=46><li>Learn to make jewelry. While it’s plenty of <strong>fun</strong> to shop for jewelry that you’ll love forever, there’s little that’s more gratifying than being able to say you made your (insert statement piece here) yourself. Find a kit and get to designing and crafting! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>You may be able to find cheap second-hand gear online. If you aren’t into sports, why not go rollerskating or have a water balloon fight? You might like a few more ideas from this list of <strong>fun</strong> things to do with friends in the summer.
