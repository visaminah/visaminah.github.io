If you’re looking for a compressor that pushes the upper limits of the six-gallon range, this one is it. The additional PSI can give you that little bit of extra capacity for those jobs where the other six gallons can’t keep up. - Source: Internet Pounds per square inch (PSI): This is the max pressure the air compressor can produce. You’ll want to ensure your compressor is capable of producing more than the minimum PSI required for your most demanding tool. Additionally, a compressor capable of higher PSI can perform as though it has a slightly bigger tank than an equal-sized compressor capable of less PSI. - Source: Internet Depending on what kind of work you plan on doing with your compressor, the extra little bit of power the Dewalt has over the others may make a difference. You can extrapolate these results to other tasks: the Dewalt will also provide more consistent delivery for tasks like spraying. All that said, most tasks like running a nail gun, using air for clean up and inflating equipment, will barely benefit from a few extra PSI in the tank. - Source: Internet Top Pick Top Pick: CA Air Tools Smart design and a low noise output make the CA Air Tools best for portability and usability for both the shop and job sites. Although offered at a similar price point to other air compressors, the CA Air Tools stands high above the competition. See Price at Amazon - Source: Internet For those who are just starting out and need to purchase tools along with the air compressor to power them, consider the Craftsman Pancake Air Compressor with accessories. This kit comes with a 16-gauge finish nailer, an 18-gauge brad nailer, and a 23-gauge pin nailer. Together, they help install baseboards, deal with decorative molding, and handle finish jobs. An air hose is included so users have everything to start immediately. - Source: Internet Not everyone needs a high-capacity machine, and some buyers may have a tight budget. The California Air Tools Light and Quiet air compressor is a low-cost yet reliable tool. The motor is both oil-free and ultra-quiet at only 56 decibels. It includes protection against both thermal overload and external current overload. The air tank itself is light and portable, weighing less than 30 pounds. - Source: Internet We overwhelmingly preferred the lever operation over the screw-style after numerous cycles of filling the tank and draining it. This is obviously down to preference, but there’s no denying that flipping a lever is quicker and takes some of the guesswork out of the procedure. Small differences like this can be critical to the user experience with items like compressors. - Source: Internet “I have had this air compressor since 8/2013 and I use it at least once a week,” wrote one satisfied customer. “I have done all kinds of projects with this compressor from nailing, drywall texture, automotive, bike, and various other projects. This Makita compressor seems to be pretty tough and I don’t have any complaints. Highly recommend it for a small portable compressor or bench top compressor.” - Source: Internet Pancake compressors: This type of tank is both flat and round, much like its namesake. It’s a portable option because of how compact it is. The tank typically sits at the bottom of the tool, and its width offers stability to the air compressor. Pancake air compressors don’t have wheels for transportation. - Source: Internet The Bostitch was the only model that positioned the connections for an air hose on either side of the unit. It’s a small touch, but none of the other compressors use this design. An outlet on each side can keep you from getting two hoses tangled or dragging the compressor when a hose gets caught because you and your partners are working on opposite sides of the room. - Source: Internet Regardless of the size, a compressor is a useful tool to have on hand for just about everyone. Even the average homeowner will find uses for it to replace more annoying tools like bike pumps and hammers. Beyond that, the compressor expands your capabilities for DIY in a tremendous way. - Source: Internet Tank size: As we mentioned above, two and three-gallon tanks are sufficient if you plan on only driving a few nails on a rare occasion or filling up a bicycle tire. A six-gallon tank is more convenient for nearly everything else. Larger than six-gallon tanks start to make the compressor unwieldy if you expect to move it around at all. - Source: Internet The Central-Pneumatic has a small handle on the top that makes it uncomfortable to carry and feel cheap in the hand. It has a better valve system to drain the tank, but the fact that the valve protrudes from the tank in such a way that it can get caught on the person carrying it adds to how unpleasant it is to carry around. It also only has a connection for one air hose, though it is a one-handed connection which is a nice characteristic of an otherwise unimpressive design. - Source: Internet It’s important to understand the terminology involved with air compressors, specifically pounds per square inch (psi) and cubic feet per minute (CFM). The maximum psi rating for an air compressor tells the air pressure force it can offer. The CFM tells you the compressed air output relating to cubic feet per minute of use. - Source: Internet You may be wondering if on-site work is possible with a smaller six-gallon compressor and the answer is yes. Despite being smaller, these compressors fulfill so many needs that even a more casual user would have no desire for a larger tank or more PSI. The portability and relatively low prices also prove to be tremendous assets for any user. - Source: Internet Out of all the air compressors on this list, our favorite is the DeWALT Quiet Trim air compressor (US$269, Amazon). Its 2.5-gallon tank has several benefits, including portability and low noise output. Though it may be a smaller size air compressor, it can handle a multitude of jobs. - Source: Internet At 5.5 gallons, the CA Air Tools holds a half-gallon less than the others, but this is a small price to pay since you won’t mind the noise when it switches on to refill. Its 120 max PSI may be an issue for users expecting the performance of a large stationary compressor, but it’s more than enough to power the majority of tools you’d use with a six-gallon compressor. - Source: Internet Depending on how you intend to use it, the portability of the air compressor can make or break your experience with it. We picked the compressors up, carried (or wheeled) them around in a 20 ft by 20 ft square, set them down, inserted an air hose, unwrapped the cord, plugged it in, started the compressor to fill the tank, unplugged the cord and stowed it and then drained the compressor. This gave us an idea of the everyday experience of operating a compressor. - Source: Internet CFM: Cubic Feet per Minute: indicates the mass of airflow at a given PSI. Again, look at the manufacturer’s stated requirement for your tools to determine which is the most demanding. Make sure your compressor can provide at least that CFM at a minimum. Additional CFM capabilities will keep you working long before the tank needs to start refilling, but meeting the minimum requirements is most important. - Source: Internet The Dewalt impressed us on the sander test by running considerably longer than the other compressors. That being said, if you need that additional power, we’d recommend looking into larger stationary compressors as even the additional PSI won’t completely make up for the tank size. Our sanding test showed the Dewalt is a powerhouse, but still too small to run air hogging tools. - Source: Internet Craftsman is a line of tools, lawn and garden equipment. Product is sold since 1927. In the past 92 years, Craftsman continues to provide the high quality product and service to global customers. The Craftsman CMXECXA0331042 oil-free vertical air compressor is the perfect companion for the garage, the job site or the workshop. - Source: Internet Portable air compressors are handy in many ways. It goes without saying that being able to move an item from one location to another is generally convenient. That said, a portable air compressor might not have the capacity needed for a particular project. Stationary air compressors tend to have a larger tank size since the storage tank doesn’t need to move. - Source: Internet Small in stature but largely capable, the DeWALT Quiet Trim air compressor weighs in at only 36 pounds. This oil-free compressor is fairly narrow and can be used or stored horizontally and vertically. Dual quick couplers allow for the use of two nailers, and users can easily empty the tank using the ball drain valve. The motor low draws at 12 amps to provide a simple start and prevent tripping breakers. - Source: Internet For major projects that involve running power tools, spraying paint, or inflating tires, an air compressor is a key piece of equipment to have. Air compressors are available for a variety of applications, such as operating pneumatic air tools. Most air compressors are powerful but also convenient, with lightweight, portable, and low-maintenance models available. - Source: Internet Welcome to the Thomas guide to the best air compressors 2022. Thomas has been connecting North American industrial buyers and suppliers for more than 120 years. When you purchase products through our independent recommendations, we may earn an affiliate commission. - Source: Internet The Porter-Cable model has a noticeably cheaper feel to it than most of its competitors: from the plastic of the motor housing, the connections for the air hoses, and the welding on the tank. All that said, it still gets the job done if you’re looking to run a couple of nail guns or fill up some tires. It shares the Bostitch’s screw-style valve that we dislike, however, the Porter-Cable’s is slightly larger and not quite as irritating to operate as the Bostitch’s. - Source: Internet The California Air Tools once again distinguished itself with the hot dog design and a pair of wheels. The wheels are well-designed and made it easy to pull around the test course. This compressor does weigh a notable 20 lb more than most of the others, though, and you’ll probably run into a situation like loading it into a truck where you have to pick it up. - Source: Internet Two and three-gallon compressors are available at home centers and even department stores. They’re inexpensive and don’t take up much space. They’re convenient for the average homeowner just looking to inflate a few tires. Any other task may prove to be too much for the compressor. - Source: Internet With a no-maintenance pump and a quiet compressor, the Campbell Hausfeld electric hot dog air compressor is a popular choice. Despite the fact that no maintenance is required, the company promises a longer-than-average life for key components. This hot dog compressor is recommended for tasks such as light automotive work, stapling and fastening, as well as inflation. For easy transportation, it has wheels and a cushioned handle. - Source: Internet You need all the help you can get with DIY projects. The best 20 gallon air compressor is no different. From inflating tires to running pneumatic nail guns to painting or cleaning farm equipment, investing in an air compressor will add plenty of options to your at-home work repertoire. - Source: Internet One of the major downfalls of the Bostitch is the screw-style drain. Operating this style is just enough of a hassle compared to turning a handle that you’ll continue to get more and more frustrated with it the more you use the unit. The difference seems minor at first glance, but the screw-style requires you to grasp the small plug for the drain and unscrew it while air shoots out at the piece you’re unscrewing. - Source: Internet “The motor is maintenance-free, so you do not have to mess around with adding oil or later having to change the oil,” wrote one customer. “Fills the 8-gallon tank to 125 psi in little time. Once I started using air, I was happy with the CFM rate as I could run a variety of tools and not have to wait around for air to build back up.” - Source: Internet We also read up on users’ experiences via Subreddits like /r/woodworking and /r/DIY. These communities offered insight into what a first-time compressor buyer would be looking for. We even came across questions someone new to crafts like woodworking would have about finding a compressor that would meet their needs. - Source: Internet We found these differences made for a better compressor than a few more PSI or an extra outlet for a second air hose. For one, if a second air hose was important, we could easily buy a splitter for a few dollars and attach it. Again, buyers should research the PSI requirements of the tools they’re going to use before choosing a compressor. 120 PSI is enough for most uses, but double-check any equipment you might be running just in case. - Source: Internet The CA Air Tools is designed with user experience in mind. While most compressors in this range use the same tested design and aim for more PSI and a slightly bigger tank, the CA Air Tools breaks away from these priorities. Instead, it focuses on lowering the noise of the unit while incorporating the wheeled horizontal tank design to keep the unit portable. - Source: Internet For a larger storage tank, we recommend the California Air Tools Ultra Quiet air compressor. (US$619, The Home Depot). One of the larger cylindrical tanks on the list, this oil-free, 20-gallon air compressor has a decently large tank compared to others listed here. It can power air sanders, air ratchets, and other pneumatic tools like a nail gun or tire gauge. - Source: Internet Have some crown molding that’s starting to droop in the corners? A few seconds with a nail gun can have it looking like a professional repaired it. Replacing your white picket fence? You can spend all afternoon bent over driving nails with a hammer. Or, just break out the compressor and a nail gun to have it done with such little effort that you fool yourself into thinking you’re having fun. - Source: Internet The Bostitch does the things you expect of a compressor in this category. Being able to connect two tools at once is convenient if you have two people working or two different tools you don’t want to have to keep connecting and disconnecting. Additionally, if you keep the compressor in a permanent spot and run lines around your shop, two outlets give you more options. - Source: Internet For those searching for longer-lasting operation, the Kobalt Quiet Tech twin stack air compressor has the necessary power. The single-horsepower motor uses two oil-free pumps for more power and optimized airflow. The easy-to-use control panel includes a regulator and a one-hand push quick coupler. There are two gauges to track both tank pressure and outlet pressure. It has rubber wheels and a sliding handle for ease of transportation. - Source: Internet Larger compressors aren’t as readily available as their smaller counterparts. They’re also much more expensive and can take up a considerable amount of space. Large compressors are more likely to require oil changes as well, making them less convenient than the small compressors that rarely require maintenance. Lastly, most compressors above about eight gallons are far from portable. - Source: Internet The CA Air Tools is much quieter than every other product we tested. The other compressors required us to wear hearing protection to prevent hearing loss. Conversely, we were able to maintain a conversation while the CA Air Tools filled up. - Source: Internet Our testing staff worked closely with an experienced woodworking professional to thoroughly research and test these compressors. Our consultant focuses on furniture building with two years of owning a custom furniture business also with some work in larger carpentry projects like built-in cabinets. He has also dabbled in more craft-oriented activities like woodturning and pyrography. - Source: Internet Most importantly, the Porter-Cable vibrated noticeably more than its competitors. This may not seem like a big deal, but the vibration was enough that the unit itself moved freely across a concrete floor while the motor was running. If you set the compressor in the wrong place on a table or shelf, the vibration and movement could potentially cause it to fall off. - Source: Internet Five of our six compressors are based on a “pancake” design while only one has the design commonly referred to as “hot dog.” The pancake is popular because it allows the user to grasp a handle at the top of the compressor and carry it down at the side almost like a suitcase. For these compressors, the design of the handle is critical. The Ridgid, Dewalt, and Bostitch all had ergonomic handles that made them comfortable to carry. - Source: Internet Weight/Portability: In this class, all of the compressors are intended to be portable. However, the compressor’s overall weight, as well as the ergonomics of the tank and motor housing, make some compressors more of a chore to move than others. If you’re planning on moving the compressor around a house while installing molding or dragging it out every time the kids’ bikes need air, this can be a critical factor. - Source: Internet I’m looking to buy an air compressor. I need it in working condition and between 10-20 gallons. Old and slightly used as long as its in working condition is fine. Feel free to let me know what you … - Source: Internet Top Pick: California Air Tools - 8010 Quiet, convenient and innovative, the CA Air Tools raises the bar for 6-gallon compressors. It’s the best choice for both the shop and for job sites. It only takes one hand to operate the hose connection or drain valve. See Price at Amazon - Source: Internet Also Great: Dewalt - DWFP55126 The Dewalt is a solid choice with a time-tested design. It has the highest capacity of the bunch meaning more time between tank refills. This unit features two air outlets, and the drain valve is conveniently located. See Price at Amazon - Source: Internet Air compressors are available in two main types: gas or electric air compressors. The average air compressor uses electric motors. Most air compressors you’ll find are electric models. The main limitation with an electric model is that you need to be in the vicinity of an electrical outlet, or at least have a long extension cord. Electric compressors can be used in any environment where they can draw power. - Source: Internet Overall, the Dewalt is a solid choice in this range. Despite its extra power, it feels light in the hands due to the smart design of the large, curved handle and provides most of the benefits of the other compressors. As with many Dewalt tools, the quality and attention to detail separate it from less expensive alternatives. - Source: Internet Ease of care: We chose all oil-free compressors as most of the industry has moved this way for portable models. This avoids the occasional hassle of replacing oil. However, you will need to regularly drain the air tank on your compressor to keep water vapor from collecting and causing rust. Compressor design can make this painless or a real nuisance. - Source: Internet California Air Tools makes it a focal point of their advertising just how quiet their air compressors are. Our test also finds this to be true. The California Air Tools was so quiet that you can maintain a conversation even standing only five feet away from it. This also eliminates the need for hearing protection. - Source: Internet Compressors are pretty low maintenance items these days. The clunky, unreliable and oil-guzzling compressors of yesteryear have largely been replaced by sleek, reliable models that require little-to-no maintenance. That being said, you do need to drain your compressor each time you use it for best results. - Source: Internet Noise: If you’ve never heard an air compressor before, you may not understand how loud they can be. The majority of our compressors averaged in the mid-80 decibel range measured from five feet away. This indicates they’re only a few decibels quieter than your average lawnmower. - Source: Internet Most buyers will recognize the other names on our list: Dewalt and Ridgid are particularly well-known in most circles. California Air Tools (as the name implies) focuses heavily on pneumatic equipment which shows with their innovative approach to compressor design. This pays off for the consumer looking for a solution that genuinely is a step-up from the competition in the ways that are likely to matter most. - Source: Internet Most Portable: CA Air Tools - 8010 The 8010’s wheeled design makes it simple to move the compressor right where you want it, be it on the job site or in the garage at home. For a unit that’s 20 pounds heavier than many others, we found it remarkably easy to maneuver. See Price at Amazon - Source: Internet That being said, one of the most common uses for air compressors of this size is to run a pneumatic nail gun or two. Nail guns are commonly used for furniture making, repairs or installing molding or baseboards in your home. This usually doesn’t require a compressor with a gigantic tank, but six gallons is about the minimum you’ll want if you’re on a time limit and need consistent performance. Six gallons also works if you plan on running two nail guns at once. - Source: Internet As the name suggests, this type of air compressor has two tanks, with one stacked on top of the other. It provides more air storage than pancake or hot dog-style air compressors. Vertical compressors: This tank is similar to the hot dog style, except the tanks tend to be larger in size. It works well for projects with limited space. Some models have a handle and wheels for easy transportation, though some don’t, which is fine for stationary projects. - Source: Internet The Ridgid compressor is a solid unit that gives the Dewalt a run for its money in the runner-up category. It has a smaller handle than most of the others but it is still comfortable to carry. The thick molded plastic of the motor housing seems durable and is finished nicely. A pair of one-handed connections for your air hoses is a convenient feature that separates it from the competition. - Source: Internet DIYers have several uses for air compressors including powering pneumatic equipment/air tools and spraying paint or finish. These are the two most demanding tasks for this type of air compressor, but there are several more that the average homeowner may have. This includes inflating tires or recreational equipment as well as using compressed air to clean tough-to-reach places (like a grungy keyboard). - Source: Internet This air compressor packs a lot of power into a small unit. The Makita portable electrical two-stack air compressor is compact enough to carry around but boasts a 2.5 horsepower motor. The oil-lubricated pump and cylinder are made of cast iron for durability, and the roll-cage design prevents on-site damage. The amp draw is low enough to prevent breaker tripping, and the motor is protected by a built-in thermal overload. - Source: Internet “I’ve had a few air compressors over the years and used them for car repairs, furniture building, upholstery, household projects, etc.,” wrote one reviewer. “The DeWALT 6-gallon 165 psi air compressor is a well-built, high-quality, machine that will fulfill almost any need for the homeowner or contractor doing smaller projects. Actually, I could see a contractor using this compressor in the field when they need the compressor to be closer and smaller.” - Source: Internet The best 20 gallon air compressor should give you excellent performance, plenty of power, portability – all for a great price. That’s why the Industrial Air belt-driven twin-cylinder compressor is our winner today. Check it out on Amazon! - Source: Internet All of these fields use air compressors for everything from cleaning to running air-demanding tools like pneumatic sanders and spray systems. Although they’re dominated by heavy, bulky compressors that are permanently installed in a professional shop, he has quite a bit of experience using six-gallon air compressors in his home shop. Like most users, he has to carefully plan out the space usage in his shop, making a giant compressor tankless of a priority. - Source: Internet Six-gallon compressors are capable of running two nail guns at a rapid pace without breaking a sweat, as evidenced by the fairly common two-outlet design of compressors in this class. These compressors also focus on convenience and ease of use because they’re targeted at more casual users. This leads to easy to access drains and no oil changes. - Source: Internet Servicing a large workspace requires a heavy-duty air compressor. The Craftsman Two-Stage Electric Vertical air compressor is an industrial strength tool that can handle large tasks. The two-stage pump provides a higher air power, which makes continuous use and large-scale tasks easier. It’s important to note that the 208–230v electric motor requires a specific power supply of 230 volts, 60 Hz, and AC. This Craftsman air compressor should be wired for power by a certified electrician. - Source: Internet Each time you fill the tank of your compressor with air, there’s a chance some of the moisture will also enter the tank. This can cause rust, depending on the tank material. This is problematic for a few reasons. Moisture in your airlines can cause many finishes to cloud or have other issues if you’re using a spray gun hooked to your compressor to apply them. - Source: Internet As a compressor from a well-known and well-trusted name in the world of tools, the DeWALT pancake air compressor is a solid option. This air compressor uses an electric motor and has a lower-than-average noise output. It’s a highly efficient machine with an oil-free pump, meaning it doesn’t require the same level of maintenance. It has features, such as high flow regulators, to optimize the tool’s efficiency. At just 30 pounds, it’s also easy to maneuver. - Source: Internet “This combo really lives up to the Craftsman name,” according to one customer. “The tools are very sturdy and easy to set up and use and everything has a very sturdy feel to them. I used the set to do some reconstruction as part of a restoration job and was not let down.

If you’re looking for a <strong>compressor</strong> that pushes the upper limits of the six-gallon range, this one is it. The additional PSI can give you that little bit of extra capacity for those jobs where the other six gallons can’t keep up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pounds per square inch (PSI): This is the max pressure the <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong> can produce. You’ll want to ensure your <strong>compressor</strong> is capable of producing more than the minimum PSI required for your most demanding tool. Additionally, a <strong>compressor</strong> capable of higher PSI can perform as though it has a slightly bigger tank than an equal-sized <strong>compressor</strong> capable of less PSI. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Depending on what kind of work you plan on doing with your <strong>compressor</strong>, the extra little bit of power the Dewalt has over the others may make a difference. You can extrapolate these results to other tasks: the Dewalt will also provide more consistent delivery for tasks like spraying. All that said, most tasks like running a nail gun, using <strong>air</strong> for clean up and inflating equipment, will barely benefit from a few extra PSI in the tank. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Top Pick Top Pick: CA Air Tools Smart design and a low noise output make the CA Air Tools best for portability and usability for both the shop and job sites. Although offered at a similar price point to other <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong>s, the CA Air Tools stands high above the competition. See Price at Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For those who are just starting out and need to purchase tools along with the <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong> to power them, consider the Craftsman Pancake Air Compressor with accessories. This kit comes with a 16-gauge finish nailer, an 18-gauge brad nailer, and a 23-gauge pin nailer. Together, they help install baseboards, deal with decorative molding, and handle finish jobs. An <strong>air</strong> hose is included so users have everything to start immediately. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Not everyone needs a high-capacity machine, and some buyers may have a tight budget. The California Air Tools Light and Quiet <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong> is a low-cost yet reliable tool. The motor is both oil-free and ultra-quiet at only 56 decibels. It includes protection against both thermal overload and external current overload. The <strong>air</strong> tank itself is light and portable, weighing less than 30 pounds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We overwhelmingly preferred the lever operation over the screw-style after numerous cycles of filling the tank and draining it. This is obviously down to preference, but there’s no denying that flipping a lever is quicker and takes some of the guesswork out of the procedure. Small differences like this can be critical to the user experience with items like <strong>compressor</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“I have had this <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong> since 8/2013 and I use it at least once a week,” wrote one satisfied customer. “I have done all kinds of projects with this <strong>compressor</strong> from nailing, drywall texture, automotive, bike, and various other projects. This Makita <strong>compressor</strong> seems to be pretty tough and I don&rsquo;t have any complaints. Highly recommend it for a small portable <strong>compressor</strong> or bench top <strong>compressor</strong>.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pancake <strong>compressor</strong>s: This type of tank is both flat and round, much like its namesake. It’s a portable option because of how compact it is. The tank typically sits at the bottom of the tool, and its width offers stability to the <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong>. Pancake <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong>s don’t have wheels for transportation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Bostitch was the only model that positioned the connections for an <strong>air</strong> hose on either side of the unit. It’s a small touch, but none of the other <strong>compressor</strong>s use this design. An outlet on each side can keep you from getting two hoses tangled or dragging the <strong>compressor</strong> when a hose gets caught because you and your partners are working on opposite sides of the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Regardless of the size, a <strong>compressor</strong> is a useful tool to have on hand for just about everyone. Even the average homeowner will find uses for it to replace more annoying tools like bike pumps and hammers. Beyond that, the <strong>compressor</strong> expands your capabilities for DIY in a tremendous way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Tank size: As we mentioned above, two and three-gallon tanks are sufficient if you plan on only driving a few nails on a rare occasion or filling up a bicycle tire. A six-gallon tank is more convenient for nearly everything else. Larger than six-gallon tanks start to make the <strong>compressor</strong> unwieldy if you expect to move it around at all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Central-Pneumatic has a small handle on the top that makes it uncomfortable to carry and feel cheap in the hand. It has a better valve system to drain the tank, but the fact that the valve protrudes from the tank in such a way that it can get caught on the person carrying it adds to how unpleasant it is to carry around. It also only has a connection for one <strong>air</strong> hose, though it is a one-handed connection which is a nice characteristic of an otherwise unimpressive design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s important to understand the terminology involved with <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong>s, specifically pounds per square inch (psi) and cubic feet per minute (CFM). The maximum psi rating for an <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong> tells the <strong>air</strong> pressure force it can offer. The CFM tells you the compressed <strong>air</strong> output relating to cubic feet per minute of use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You may be wondering if on-site work is possible with a smaller six-gallon <strong>compressor</strong> and the answer is yes. Despite being smaller, these <strong>compressor</strong>s fulfill so many needs that even a more casual user would have no desire for a larger tank or more PSI. The portability and relatively low prices also prove to be tremendous assets for any user. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Out of all the <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong>s on this list, our favorite is the DeWALT Quiet Trim <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong> (US$269, Amazon). Its 2.5-gallon tank has several benefits, including portability and low noise output. Though it may be a smaller size <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong>, it can handle a multitude of jobs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At 5.5 gallons, the CA Air Tools holds a half-gallon less than the others, but this is a small price to pay since you won’t mind the noise when it switches on to refill. Its 120 max PSI may be an issue for users expecting the performance of a large stationary <strong>compressor</strong>, but it’s more than enough to power the majority of tools you’d use with a six-gallon <strong>compressor</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Depending on how you intend to use it, the portability of the <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong> can make or break your experience with it. We picked the <strong>compressor</strong>s up, carried (or wheeled) them around in a 20 ft by 20 ft square, set them down, inserted an <strong>air</strong> hose, unwrapped the cord, plugged it in, started the <strong>compressor</strong> to fill the tank, unplugged the cord and stowed it and then drained the <strong>compressor</strong>. This gave us an idea of the everyday experience of operating a <strong>compressor</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>CFM: Cubic Feet per Minute: indicates the mass of <strong>air</strong>flow at a given PSI. Again, look at the manufacturer’s stated requirement for your tools to determine which is the most demanding. Make sure your <strong>compressor</strong> can provide at least that CFM at a minimum. Additional CFM capabilities will keep you working long before the tank needs to start refilling, but meeting the minimum requirements is most important. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Dewalt impressed us on the sander test by running considerably longer than the other <strong>compressor</strong>s. That being said, if you need that additional power, we’d recommend looking into larger stationary <strong>compressor</strong>s as even the additional PSI won’t completely make up for the tank size. Our sanding test showed the Dewalt is a powerhouse, but still too small to run <strong>air</strong> hogging tools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Craftsman is a line of tools, lawn and garden equipment. Product is sold since 1927. In the past 92 years, Craftsman continues to provide the high quality product and service to global customers. The Craftsman CMXECXA0331042 oil-free vertical <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong> is the perfect companion for the garage, the job site or the workshop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Portable <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong>s are handy in many ways. It goes without saying that being able to move an item from one location to another is generally convenient. That said, a portable <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong> might not have the capacity needed for a particular project. Stationary <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong>s tend to have a larger tank size since the storage tank doesn’t need to move. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Small in stature but largely capable, the DeWALT Quiet Trim <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong> weighs in at only 36 pounds. This oil-free <strong>compressor</strong> is f<strong>air</strong>ly narrow and can be used or stored horizontally and vertically. Dual quick couplers allow for the use of two nailers, and users can easily empty the tank using the ball drain valve. The motor low draws at 12 amps to provide a simple start and prevent tripping breakers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For major projects that involve running power tools, spraying paint, or inflating tires, an <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong> is a key piece of equipment to have. Air <strong>compressor</strong>s are available for a variety of applications, such as operating pneumatic <strong>air</strong> tools. Most <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong>s are powerful but also convenient, with lightweight, portable, and low-maintenance models available. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Welcome to the Thomas guide to the best <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong>s 2022. Thomas has been connecting North American industrial buyers and suppliers for more than 120 years. When you purchase products through our independent recommendations, we may earn an affiliate commission. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Porter-Cable model has a noticeably cheaper feel to it than most of its competitors: from the plastic of the motor housing, the connections for the <strong>air</strong> hoses, and the welding on the tank. All that said, it still gets the job done if you’re looking to run a couple of nail guns or fill up some tires. It shares the Bostitch’s screw-style valve that we dislike, however, the Porter-Cable’s is slightly larger and not quite as irritating to operate as the Bostitch’s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The California Air Tools once again distinguished itself with the hot dog design and a p<strong>air</strong> of wheels. The wheels are well-designed and made it easy to pull around the test course. This <strong>compressor</strong> does weigh a notable 20 lb more than most of the others, though, and you’ll probably run into a situation like loading it into a truck where you have to pick it up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Two and three-gallon <strong>compressor</strong>s are available at home centers and even department stores. They’re inexpensive and don’t take up much space. They’re convenient for the average homeowner just looking to inflate a few tires. Any other task may prove to be too much for the <strong>compressor</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With a no-maintenance pump and a quiet <strong>compressor</strong>, the Campbell Hausfeld electric hot dog <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong> is a popular choice. Despite the fact that no maintenance is required, the company promises a longer-than-average life for key components. This hot dog <strong>compressor</strong> is recommended for tasks such as light automotive work, stapling and fastening, as well as inflation. For easy transportation, it has wheels and a cushioned handle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You need all the help you can get with DIY projects. The best 20 gallon <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong> is no different. From inflating tires to running pneumatic nail guns to painting or cleaning farm equipment, investing in an <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong> will add plenty of options to your at-home work repertoire. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the major downfalls of the Bostitch is the screw-style drain. Operating this style is just enough of a hassle compared to turning a handle that you’ll continue to get more and more frustrated with it the more you use the unit. The difference seems minor at first glance, but the screw-style requires you to grasp the small plug for the drain and unscrew it while <strong>air</strong> shoots out at the piece you’re unscrewing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“The motor is maintenance-free, so you do not have to mess around with adding oil or later having to change the oil,” wrote one customer. “Fills the 8-gallon tank to 125 psi in little time. Once I started using <strong>air</strong>, I was happy with the CFM rate as I could run a variety of tools and not have to wait around for <strong>air</strong> to build back up.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We also read up on users’ experiences via Subreddits like /r/woodworking and /r/DIY. These communities offered insight into what a first-time <strong>compressor</strong> buyer would be looking for. We even came across questions someone new to crafts like woodworking would have about finding a <strong>compressor</strong> that would meet their needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We found these differences made for a better <strong>compressor</strong> than a few more PSI or an extra outlet for a second <strong>air</strong> hose. For one, if a second <strong>air</strong> hose was important, we could easily buy a splitter for a few dollars and attach it. Again, buyers should research the PSI requirements of the tools they’re going to use before choosing a <strong>compressor</strong>. 120 PSI is enough for most uses, but double-check any equipment you might be running just in case. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The CA Air Tools is designed with user experience in mind. While most <strong>compressor</strong>s in this range use the same tested design and aim for more PSI and a slightly bigger tank, the CA Air Tools breaks away from these priorities. Instead, it focuses on lowering the noise of the unit while incorporating the wheeled horizontal tank design to keep the unit portable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For a larger storage tank, we recommend the California Air Tools Ultra Quiet <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong>. (US$619, The Home Depot). One of the larger cylindrical tanks on the list, this oil-free, 20-gallon <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong> has a decently large tank compared to others listed here. It can power <strong>air</strong> sanders, <strong>air</strong> ratchets, and other pneumatic tools like a nail gun or tire gauge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Have some crown molding that’s starting to droop in the corners? A few seconds with a nail gun can have it looking like a professional rep<strong>air</strong>ed it. Replacing your white picket fence? You can spend all afternoon bent over driving nails with a hammer. Or, just break out the <strong>compressor</strong> and a nail gun to have it done with such little effort that you fool yourself into thinking you’re having fun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Bostitch does the things you expect of a <strong>compressor</strong> in this category. Being able to connect two tools at once is convenient if you have two people working or two different tools you don’t want to have to keep connecting and disconnecting. Additionally, if you keep the <strong>compressor</strong> in a permanent spot and run lines around your shop, two outlets give you more options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For those searching for longer-lasting operation, the Kobalt Quiet Tech twin stack <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong> has the necessary power. The single-horsepower motor uses two oil-free pumps for more power and optimized <strong>air</strong>flow. The easy-to-use control panel includes a regulator and a one-hand push quick coupler. There are two gauges to track both tank pressure and outlet pressure. It has rubber wheels and a sliding handle for ease of transportation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Larger <strong>compressor</strong>s aren’t as readily available as their smaller counterparts. They’re also much more expensive and can take up a considerable amount of space. Large <strong>compressor</strong>s are more likely to require oil changes as well, making them less convenient than the small <strong>compressor</strong>s that rarely require maintenance. Lastly, most <strong>compressor</strong>s above about eight gallons are far from portable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The CA Air Tools is much quieter than every other product we tested. The other <strong>compressor</strong>s required us to wear hearing protection to prevent hearing loss. Conversely, we were able to maintain a conversation while the CA Air Tools filled up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Our testing staff worked closely with an experienced woodworking professional to thoroughly research and test these <strong>compressor</strong>s. Our consultant focuses on furniture building with two years of owning a custom furniture business also with some work in larger carpentry projects like built-in cabinets. He has also dabbled in more craft-oriented activities like woodturning and pyrography. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most importantly, the Porter-Cable vibrated noticeably more than its competitors. This may not seem like a big deal, but the vibration was enough that the unit itself moved freely across a concrete floor while the motor was running. If you set the <strong>compressor</strong> in the wrong place on a table or shelf, the vibration and movement could potentially cause it to fall off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Five of our six <strong>compressor</strong>s are based on a “pancake” design while only one has the design commonly referred to as “hot dog.” The pancake is popular because it allows the user to grasp a handle at the top of the <strong>compressor</strong> and carry it down at the side almost like a suitcase. For these <strong>compressor</strong>s, the design of the handle is critical. The Ridgid, Dewalt, and Bostitch all had ergonomic handles that made them comfortable to carry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Weight/Portability: In this class, all of the <strong>compressor</strong>s are intended to be portable. However, the <strong>compressor</strong>’s overall weight, as well as the ergonomics of the tank and motor housing, make some <strong>compressor</strong>s more of a chore to move than others. If you’re planning on moving the <strong>compressor</strong> around a house while installing molding or dragging it out every time the kids’ bikes need <strong>air</strong>, this can be a critical factor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I’m looking to buy an <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong>. I need it in working condition and between 10-20 gallons. Old and slightly used as long as its in working condition is fine. Feel free to let me know what you &mldr; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Top Pick: California Air Tools - 8010 Quiet, convenient and innovative, the CA Air Tools raises the bar for 6-gallon <strong>compressor</strong>s. It&rsquo;s the best choice for both the shop and for job sites. It only takes one hand to operate the hose connection or drain valve. See Price at Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Also Great: Dewalt - DWFP55126 The Dewalt is a solid choice with a time-tested design. It has the highest capacity of the bunch meaning more time between tank refills. This unit features two <strong>air</strong> outlets, and the drain valve is conveniently located. See Price at Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Air <strong>compressor</strong>s are available in two main types: gas or electric <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong>s. The average <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong> uses electric motors. Most <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong>s you’ll find are electric models. The main limitation with an electric model is that you need to be in the vicinity of an electrical outlet, or at least have a long extension cord. Electric <strong>compressor</strong>s can be used in any environment where they can draw power. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Overall, the Dewalt is a solid choice in this range. Despite its extra power, it feels light in the hands due to the smart design of the large, curved handle and provides most of the benefits of the other <strong>compressor</strong>s. As with many Dewalt tools, the quality and attention to detail separate it from less expensive alternatives. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ease of care: We chose all oil-free <strong>compressor</strong>s as most of the industry has moved this way for portable models. This avoids the occasional hassle of replacing oil. However, you will need to regularly drain the <strong>air</strong> tank on your <strong>compressor</strong> to keep water vapor from collecting and causing rust. Compressor design can make this painless or a real nuisance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>California Air Tools makes it a focal point of their advertising just how quiet their <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong>s are. Our test also finds this to be true. The California Air Tools was so quiet that you can maintain a conversation even standing only five feet away from it. This also eliminates the need for hearing protection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Compressors are pretty low maintenance items these days. The clunky, unreliable and oil-guzzling <strong>compressor</strong>s of yesteryear have largely been replaced by sleek, reliable models that require little-to-no maintenance. That being said, you do need to drain your <strong>compressor</strong> each time you use it for best results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Noise: If you’ve never heard an <strong>air</strong> <strong>compressor</strong> before, you may not understand how loud they can be. The majority of our <strong>compressor</strong>s averaged in the mid-80 decibel range measured from five feet away. This indicates they’re only a few decibels quieter than your average lawnmower. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most buyers will recognize the other names on our list: Dewalt and Ridgid are particularly well-known in most circles. California Air Tools (as the name implies) focuses heavily on pneumatic equipment which shows with their innovative approach to <strong>compressor</strong> design. This pays off for the consumer looking for a solution that genuinely is a step-up from the competition in the ways that are likely to matter most. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most Portable: CA Air Tools - 8010 The 8010&rsquo;s wheeled design makes it simple to move the <strong>compressor</strong> right where you want it, be it on the job site or in the garage at home. For a unit that&rsquo;s 20 pounds heavier than many others, we found it remarkably easy to maneuver.
