Don’t jump in blindly and start drawing. Figure out the angle we’re looking at the hand from. Can we see the back of the hand or the palm? How much of the front are we seeing? Or are we looking at it from the back? What is each finger and thumb doing? What about the wrist? - Source: Internet Now that we have all 4 fingers drawn, it’s time to locate each joint. Add 2 more ticks on the middle finger, each roughly 1 quarter of the way down. Using these ticks, draw 2 more curves. We now have reference points for joint placement! Wasn’t so bad, was it?

In a mirror, you can observe your own lips and try to replicate them on a paper by imitating the curves and edges of your own lips. - Source: Internet Keep in mind, even though the process itself is quite simple, drawing hands is never going to be easy.

To do that, draw a curved line that is similar to the first one drawn in step 1. - Source: Internet Hands are extremely expressive. When you’re drawing hands you have to be an actor.

If you’ve struggled with hands that end up looking like claws, like I did, this tutorial should assist you with creating more real-looking ones. In this guide, I use the Arteza Professional Drawing Set. With this set, I achieve a wide range of lead hardness, which means I can go from the lightest pencil marks to the darkest with ease.

Therefore, learning how to <strong>draw</strong> will enable you to develop new ways of communicating. For instance, you will grow to deeply understand different facial expressions, gestures, and the overall emotional effect of different colors and shapes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Know your nose with this tutorial — Of all the facial features, the nose is one you might not give a lot of thought to. But don&rsquo;t ignore it—this feature helps define the face. We&rsquo;ll go over the anatomy of the nose and how you can <strong>draw</strong> it in a realistic way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Use an HB pencil to <strong>draw</strong> a rectangle slightly longer than a square. Make a slope at the top. The right side of the curve will dip down much lower than the left side since we are <strong>draw</strong>ing the back of the right hand. Taper the right side of the rectangle as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Learn to <strong>draw</strong> lines out from the circles as fingers, ensuring the proportion is right, with more circles on each finger to give them shape.

Once you’ve mastered this, try <strong>draw</strong>ing other gestures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You don&rsquo;t have to <strong>draw</strong> dragons to exercise your imagination. If you like design, try creating your own patterns or filling a sheet of paper with stylized flowers. These ideas will get you started. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>[ My tutorial focused on explaining in depth for each hands, I will not talking about you have to do it my way, tell you how to color, using this particular brushes, etc. But more to theoretically present the principle of hands <strong>draw</strong>ing from my passed away master of traditional sketches, my only mentor in hyper realistic <strong>draw</strong>ing: my uncle, Mr. Hariyanto. &ldquo;I miss you, sensei.&rdquo; ] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While there are seemingly endless cool <strong>draw</strong>ing ideas floating around, some of the most popular subjects tend to be nature-themed or revolve around the human figure.

Just as writers have spoken of its beauty, artists <strong>draw</strong> its delicate petals. But just because the rose is popular doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s easy to sketch. Loaded with layers of petals, it can be a challenge. But have no fear—we break a rose <strong>draw</strong>ing down so that it&rsquo;s both approachable and fun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Of all parts of the body, the hand is by many considered to be the hardest to <strong>draw</strong>. We all have stories of how, early on, we would keep our characters&rsquo; hands behind their backs or in their pockets, avoiding as much as possible the task of tackling hands. Yet paradoxically, they are our most readily available reference, being in our field of vision every moment of our lives. With just one extra accessory, a small mirror, we can reference hands from all angles. The only real challenge, then, is the complexity of this remarkably articulated organ: it&rsquo;s almost like <strong>draw</strong>ing a small figure onto a larger one, one doesn&rsquo;t know where to start. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The limitations are very great indeed, either with or without mirror, but perhaps greatest without one since it is almost always obvious that the hand <strong>draw</strong>n is the artist&rsquo;s own, and we are always necessarily confronted with the thumb side, as in the <strong>draw</strong>ing directly above. Image below is my mom&rsquo;s fingers reference and I did not the exact way, adding more imagination and slightly make it&mldr; A bit less wrinkles and give a long sleeve in order to make it into an old style <strong>draw</strong>ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Drawing has become an interesting hobby for many people.

When you study from life you learn more about how the hand works and how the shapes look in various poses. You can use that knowledge to improve your work from imagination. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Step 8 I <strong>draw</strong> the pointing finger along its dotted line. Half of the middle and the tip are visible. I join the “mitten’s” lower portion, representing the back of the hand, from the little finger to the thumb. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The muscles on the pinky side are also a teardrop, but they’re mostly covered with a thick layer of fat on the palm. I include the fat and <strong>draw</strong> the form as a convex box. When the pinky is flexing or abducting, the crease between the fat and muscle appears. I’ll show the corner of the fat pad, and the round form of the muscle belly. If the the pinky was relaxed, I would round out this edge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=8><li>A hammer: A hammer is one of the tools that make great subjects for ****draw<strong>ings</strong>. It is quite easy to <strong>draw</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Now that you’ve learned how to easily <strong>draw</strong> a hand, you can start giving your characters and people even more personality.

But not really the best way to develop your skill. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>If the fingers are grouped together, you can try to imagine a mitten shape for all of them.

And, even though there are so many components of hands, I’m here to demonstrate an easy process of making natural-looking hands. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hands are one of the most expressive parts of a pose.

Don’t jump in blindly and start <strong>draw</strong>ing. Figure out the angle we’re looking at the hand from. Can we see the back of the hand or the palm? How much of the front are we seeing? Or are we looking at it from the back? What is each finger and thumb doing? What about the wrist? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now that we have all 4 fingers <strong>draw</strong>n, it’s time to locate each joint. Add 2 more ticks on the middle finger, each roughly 1 quarter of the way down. Using these ticks, <strong>draw</strong> 2 more curves. We now have reference points for joint placement! Wasn’t so bad, was it? Please note that these are only loose measurements for simplicity sake. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Step 6 Here, the ring finger peeks out from behind my pinky. I study the arc’s distance, as this will determine the finger’s length, and I <strong>draw</strong> it to where I want it to meet that line. Notice that the lower joint is concealed behind the little finger. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It is safe to say that everyone loves kittens and a kitten which is seen in most cartoons is beyond cute.

If you find it difficult to <strong>draw</strong> you can divide it into parts; the head first then the body and after that <strong>draw</strong> the limbs and end with the tail. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, limited the basic view of it may be, each pose, even though similar to a preceding one, is always subtly different. So, there is more of an exercise in <strong>draw</strong>ing and less of an anatomical study. Exploration of forms is common to most master ****draw<strong>ings</strong> in any era. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=32><li>An old person’s face: You can either <strong>draw</strong> the face of your grandparent or find a picture of an older person that you know.

In a mirror, you can observe your own lips and try to replicate them on a paper by imitating the curves and edges of your own lips. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Keep in mind, even though the process itself is quite simple, <strong>draw</strong>ing hands is never going to be easy. There’s prerequisites that make it challenging, like anatomy, perspective and shading.

But all this stuff ties together, so let’s get started… - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Next, <strong>draw</strong> a transverse line to mark the place where the metacarpals end and the proximal phalanges begin. The former area is where the so-called “mountains of Mercury, Sun, Saturn, and Jupiter” are, while the latter refers to the area of “the mountains of primary and secondary Mars and plain of Mars.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To determine the length of each finger, measure the length from the wrist to the knuckles and duplicate that. The dotted line marks the maximum finger height. Our fingers vary in length and since the middle finger is the longest, we will use it as a reference to find the height of the other 3 fingers. To do that, <strong>draw</strong> a curved line that is similar to the first one <strong>draw</strong>n in step 1. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hands are extremely expressive.

I use my mom&rsquo;s hands and mine as references for ****draw<strong>ings</strong> as well as my fiance&rsquo;s hands for female part but I don&rsquo;t want to distract viewer&rsquo;s attention with so many photos: in the end, we keep everything simple by using only sketches and our avatars. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Practice, practice, practice.

So, check out our recommendations for the best <strong>draw</strong>ing pencils, best sketchbooks, and best type of paper.

If you&rsquo;re interested, please head to the link I provided. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Always make sure your <strong>draw</strong>ing fits well into the <strong>draw</strong>ing area. For instance, if you are <strong>draw</strong>ing on a piece of paper, size the subject to ensure that it fits in the sheet. But it should also leave enough space on the sides so that it doesn’t look cramped. At the same time, make sure the subject doesn’t appear too tiny on the sheet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Feel free to download and use the hand images below for your reference! You may find that it is difficult to use the measurement system for certain gestures.

Choose the pieces that will make an interesting subject for <strong>draw</strong>ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Subtractive <strong>draw</strong>ing: Try this one with charcoal. Using it horizontally, shade your paper an even value of grey. Now “<strong>draw</strong>” with your eraser – erase the highlights of your subject. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As you start your <strong>draw</strong>ing project, start with the larger shapes and work your way down to the smallest details. For instance, if you are <strong>draw</strong>ing someone’s face, start with the shape of the head and the neck. Then, work your way down to the smallest details such as eyes, mouth, nose, eyelashes, nostrils, pupils, etc. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This means that you shouldn’t fully <strong>draw</strong> one part of a subject first before moving to the next one. For example, if you are <strong>draw</strong>ing a person’s face, don’t fully stretch one eye and then proceed to <strong>draw</strong> the next. Instead, <strong>draw</strong> the outer shapes of both eyes and then move on to the pupils. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=6><li>A stapler: Staplers are everywhere and they’re made up of simple shapes that are easy to <strong>draw</strong>. Start by <strong>draw</strong>ing the shapes and then add the details. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>When <strong>draw</strong>ing, minimize the number of strokes and use long steady lines. Don’t scribble or make many small strokes to <strong>draw</strong> a line. If you make a mistake when <strong>draw</strong>ing a light line sketch, you can <strong>draw</strong> several lines to correct it. But if the mistakes are too many, you should just erase them and start afresh. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Nature has long provided artists with inspiration for <strong>draw</strong>ing. Trees and the sandy beach are both beautiful to look at and are also fun to <strong>draw</strong>. As you improve on your <strong>draw</strong>ing, try revisiting these same subjects to see how differently they now look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/Fc2Hf07lw2s/maxresdefault.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Easy Drawings To Draw On Your Hand - Simple Things To Draw">
