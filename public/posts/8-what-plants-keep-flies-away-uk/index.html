By placing fragrant plants throughout your home and investing in a cruelty-free spider catcher, your home will be pleasantly spider free this autumn.” - Source: Internet “There’s many old-wives’ tales about how conkers can repel spiders – but many don’t know that a lot of fragrant houseplants can do just that,” Evie Lane, Gardening Expert at , says. “Most spider-deterring plants have a strong odour since aromatic plants are generally more effective at repelling insects – but they still smell great in your home too.” - Source: Internet The marigold is one of the most well-known insect-repelling plants and with good reason — they have a scent that will keep pests like mosquitoes, nematodes like cabbage worms, and other pests away.
