Case in point: Anne Curtis in this Jacquemus cropped cardigan and jeans &lsquo;fit. The same idea applies to pastels and other softer hues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Utilizing dark <strong>grey</strong> with black can create a gorgeous and bold monochrome space. We added different patterns and textures in the shade range to help keep a room visually interesting,&rsquo; says Lindye. &lsquo;We also accented the room with some additional pops of beige in the painting, pillows, and curtains to create more dimension against the dark background without detracting from the bold impact.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A gray-blue color would also look lovely with olive <strong>green</strong> because it is subtle and soft. Other neutral colors would include beige or ivory, like this top. Or, mustard yellow is nice and neutral. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the most uplifting colors that go with yellow is <strong>grey</strong>. That&rsquo;s because both colors are versatile, and can make as bold or as subtle a statement as you like. Think deep <strong>grey</strong> with warm yellow, or a light <strong>grey</strong> with a muted or mango yellow. Both combinations will look eye-catching yet so different. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Grey is an ideal colour as it compliments many interior styles and trends,&rsquo; says Richard Ticehurst, brand expert at Crosswater (opens in new tab). &lsquo;It is also enormously versatile when it comes to partnering with other colours. Depending on its underlying tones and depth of colour, <strong>grey</strong> can be partnered with almost any other hue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can incorporate gray into a room by painting walls, furniture, or adding accessories. Lighter gray shades give off a more feminine feel, while darker shades offer a more masculine impression. You can easily create a calming and relaxed atmosphere in a bedroom by using lighter gray shades and whites. Bring in a few earth tones like <strong>green</strong> or browns to add more character. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A <strong>grey</strong> and yellow combination works particularly well with a modern and contemporary style. You can decide on the quantity of both hues while creating your color scheme. If your base color is <strong>grey</strong> and you don&rsquo;t want to make a big commitment to accent color, bring yellow in through small accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hebe Hatton Journalist Hebe is an experienced homes writer and editor. She has written hundreds of articles helping readers make the best home design choices, and spends her days interviewing interiors industry experts to bring the latest ideas to her readers. For this piece she spoke to top designers to understand what colors would go best with <strong>grey</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Whether you are striking a dramatic note or going for a lighter scheme, combining different tones of <strong>grey</strong> can work very well,&rsquo; says Sarah. &lsquo;Pale shades will create a more relaxed look, while darker, richer hues will have an impact and can enhance the cocooning feel of a compact room.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;If I’m using a cool-toned <strong>grey</strong> I like to use pops of a hot color,&rsquo; says Annie. &lsquo;It’s a very effective way to make a room vastly more lively and rewarding to look at, and you only need small amounts of your accent color. I also love a blue-<strong>grey</strong> with terracotta as these colors contrast beautifully to give a delicious, juicy, contrast. In the past I’ve painted a wall in <strong>grey</strong>, then used terracotta tones to accentuate panels on the wall.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grey is one of the most popular basic colors that is easy to mix and match and is great for every space. But a <strong>grey</strong> living room can look too boring and impersonal and adding different hues of <strong>green</strong>s to it, makes a whole lot of difference. Various shades of <strong>green</strong> make the space cooler, bolder, fresher and much more eye-catching. Green reminds of natural world around us, and it’s perfect if you want to create a fall or a spring mood. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;For a sophisticated and fresh color combination consider introducing a palette of soft pastels to a <strong>grey</strong> interior scheme.&rsquo; suggests Jane Nicholson, co-founder of House of Dome. &lsquo;This doesn’t have to be limited to just a few colors; the delicate nature of muted shades allows you to be a little more experimental. Choose soft furnishing in mixed tones of <strong>grey</strong> with warm pinks and sage <strong>green</strong>s.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Rock a <strong>green</strong> shirt with tan pants for a casually stylish and stylish outfit. Unimpressed with this ensemble? Enter <strong>grey</strong> suede loafers to change things up a bit. For an ensemble that’s very easy but can be modified in a variety of different ways, pair a <strong>green</strong> shirt with tan pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pairing an olive shirt with navy jeans is a good idea for a neat and relaxed outfit. Bring a more elegant twist to this outfit by rocking a pair of <strong>grey</strong> athletic shoes. Opt for an olive shirt and navy jeans and you’ll be prepared for wherever this day takes you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A great color that goes with red is <strong>grey</strong>, and while it may sound a bit intense, it can work if you pick the right tones. For a bold look pair deep charcoal walls with a pop of vivid red in the form of a statement sofa or armchair. And if you want a more subtle look tone down that red and choose an earthy, terracotta tone and pair it with a lighter cloud-like <strong>grey</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Woodlawn Blue and Wedgewood Gray are two of the best blue paint colours. So many of today’s most popular blues have a lot of <strong>green</strong> in them – not these two. These are almost true blues and only have a small amount of <strong>green</strong> in them, which stops them from looking icy cold and helps them hold up a bit better in a north-facing room (which could look TOO cold with a real true blue on the walls). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another great option for some color-blocking action with <strong>green</strong> is pink. Mellow cotton candy shades delightfully offset dark forest <strong>green</strong>s, resulting in delectable outfits you&rsquo;d want to wear over and over again. You can easily try out the pairing by layering a <strong>green</strong> jacket over a pastel pink top (or vice versa, depending on what you have). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can wear any neutral shirt with olive pants. A <strong>grey</strong> henley shirt with <strong>green</strong> chinos is just as subtle and casual as wearing the same top with blue jeans. However, it’s more exciting and just as easy. Similarly, dark <strong>green</strong> trousers with a white dress shirt is perfectly professional and only slightly eye-catching. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you like colorful dress shoes, just follow the color wheel rule and avoid red shades. Crimson suede monks pair well with gray trousers and a red tie, but would be too loud when worn with <strong>green</strong> pants. Whereas tan Norwegian shoes work perfectly well as pictured below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Though, let&rsquo;s admit, it is quite challenging to don the hue, especially if you&rsquo;re new to wearing colorful outfits. The biggest tip we can give is to go big or go home—either you focus your entire look on one statement piece in <strong>green</strong>, or you play around with other hues that can complement it. Need some ideas to get you started? Scroll away for nine different colors that we assure you will perfectly pair with <strong>green</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Red, orange, and purple are complementary colors for <strong>green</strong>, so incorporate those shades when styling a <strong>green</strong> outfit. 3. Neutral colors: Green also works well with neutral colors, including white, beige, tan, gray, and black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are simply too many fetching shades of <strong>green</strong> to only stick to one. When going monochrome with the hue, experiment and pair together two or three variations of it for a fun and fresh ensemble. Elisse Joson is definitely convincing us to wear lime and mint <strong>green</strong> together the next time we go on a stroll. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can mix complementary and primary colors to create gray. For example, red and <strong>green</strong>, purple and yellow, or orange and blue. However, to lighten these colors, you will need to add white. If you use red, <strong>green</strong>, and yellow, you can also lighten the gray color using a lighter hue of yellow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When choosing color combinations for your home, if a monochromic color scheme is more your vibe, pair <strong>grey</strong> with <strong>grey</strong>. Perhaps that sounds a bit&mldr;dull but laying <strong>grey</strong> on <strong>grey</strong> can create just as interesting a space as pairing <strong>grey</strong> with any other color. The key is contrast, contrast, and texture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Say it with us now: Wearing black will never fail you. When you have an uber colorful &lsquo;fit on, say this head-to-ankle olive <strong>green</strong> moment from Camille, black accessories will seamlessly round everything out. They&rsquo;ll allow the main pieces to take center stage, while finishing things off with a sleek touch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I LOOOVE Silver Marlin. This flexible, simple and soft shade is perfect for many home styles. This is a subtle colour with its blue-<strong>green</strong> blend and soft gray backdrop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A <strong>green</strong> t-shirt looks especially cool when matched with khaki chinos. Go the extra mile and spice up your look with a pair of brown leather desert boots. For an effortlessly neat getup, consider wearing a <strong>green</strong> t-shirt and khaki dress pants — these items go wonderfully together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gray Cashmere is a LIGHT mix of <strong>green</strong>, blue and gray with a bit more gray than not. It certainly won’t look like a plain shade of gray, but the gray works to calm the blue-<strong>green</strong> blend down quite a bit. And while it’s a blend of those three colours, it more often leans blue-gray than <strong>green</strong>-gray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bright purples are too bold to pair with <strong>green</strong> pants. The combination is too reminiscent of The Joker. Instead, wear olive <strong>green</strong> pants with the darkest shades of purple, like raisin or royal ruby. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Like <strong>grey</strong>, brown is a neutral color and looks great on a many different men. Naturally, you don&rsquo;t want to appear like a schoolboy who&rsquo;s matched his shoes to his shirt, but wearing a brown dress shirt with <strong>grey</strong> pants makes a strong visual statement. A solid brown shirt with <strong>grey</strong> pants suggests that you mean business. Pair this with dark-brown wingtip dress shoes and a blue-<strong>grey</strong> tie for a look that is sure to impress your coworkers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The visual opposite of a neutral <strong>green</strong> is purple, which actually makes them a harmonious and pleasing color combination. Purple pieces &ldquo;warm up&rdquo; when viewed side-by-side with a kelly or emerald <strong>green</strong> garment, which makes for a fun outfit that will definitely turn heads. Take notes from Laureen and try out the color combo the next time you rock a casual, school girl-inspired &lsquo;fit! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Warm <strong>grey</strong>s have a yellowish undertone, while cool <strong>grey</strong>s may have a pink or blue shade. It&rsquo;s easy to spot the difference. You need just to hold a yellow piece of paper against the <strong>grey</strong> surface. If the yellow and <strong>grey</strong> mesh well, the <strong>grey</strong> is warm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A dark <strong>green</strong> t-shirt and white jeans teamed together are the perfect combination for guys who love casual outfits. Dark brown leather casual boots are a simple way to add a little kick to the ensemble. A dark <strong>green</strong> t-shirt and light blue denim overalls are a great combo to add to your current off-duty repertoire. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As mentioned, you can team olive pants up with clothes that have yellow hues in them. Browns and tans, for example, accentuate olive <strong>green</strong>’s earth tone. This is great for professorial outfits and outdoorsy styles. Think <strong>green</strong> trousers with a tan button-down and tweed jacket, or olive jeans with a brown flannel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Soft, naturalistic <strong>grey</strong>s look beautiful with a neutral pink.&rsquo; says color expert Annie Sloan. &lsquo;I often use French Linen with Antoinette (my earthy-neutral pink), because French Linen is a complex <strong>grey</strong> that allows the pink to grow and breathe and warm up. It’ll bring out the earthiness and the warmth of the pink.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>All the fashion-savvy folks on the internet are currently obsessed with <strong>green</strong>, and we&rsquo;re certainly some of them. Something about the grassy hue just injects a carefree touch of quirkiness into one&rsquo;s daily ensembles, and no matter what shade it&rsquo;s worn in, it instantly makes any &lsquo;fit an eye-catching one. We can probably thank luxury house Bottega Veneta for the rise in interest in this verdant color; we mean, they do have a shade of <strong>green</strong> named after them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Green is a cool earth tone that can go extremely well with <strong>grey</strong> pants and brown shoes &ndash; on some men. Although not every guy can wear a <strong>green</strong> shirt without looking seasick, those who can wear <strong>green</strong> do it magnificently. If you have a darker skin tone, you might wear a light, chalky <strong>green</strong> shirt for spring and switch to moss or forest <strong>green</strong> in the fall. You can play up the earth tones by adding a brown tie and brown belt or even take it cooler by incorporating various shades of blue into your outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Depending on your styling, the look can either be relaxed and dreamy or quite tailored, but it does always tend to strike a modern Scandi note,&rsquo; says Sarah Spiteri, Editorial Director of Livingetc. &lsquo;The key is to vary the proportions of <strong>grey</strong> and white; a 50/50 split will feel quite cold. The texture is a vital additional ingredient - chunky weaves, rough timber, and marble all work well.&rsquo; recommends. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;These spice-inspired colors are a big story at the moment and I love the way that they work with <strong>grey</strong>,&rsquo; says Sarah. &lsquo;Use the hotter, brighter colors in moderation as more of an accent. This combination is also worth remembering if you have an exposed red brick wall inside.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Again, never wear <strong>green</strong> pants with red or anything in the red family. This includes pink, magenta, and salmon. You’ll also want to steer clear of colors that are too close to red on the color wheel. True orange with <strong>green</strong> is only appropriate on St. Patrick’s Day, just as primary red with <strong>green</strong> is only appropriate on a holiday sweater. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>First of all, decide on the shade of <strong>green</strong> you want: emerald, sage, lime, mint, dark <strong>green</strong> or any other. The lighter shade you choose, the fresher the room will look, and if you choose bold <strong>green</strong> accents, they will give your room en elegant look, such shades are amazing for mid-century modern and art deco interiors and will also light up a modern living room. Need a lively super modern ambience and planning to have guests? Opt for lime <strong>green</strong> details and your living room will look amazing! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Blush pink is the ideal shade for just slightly warming up <strong>grey</strong> tones without actually adding too much warmth to a space or being too saccharine,&rsquo; says Sarah. &lsquo;A muted, dusky pink will make a room more inviting. For this effect, blush is the right choice as it is more subtle than other pink tones and less daring than red.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For you sneakerheads, avoid pairing <strong>green</strong> pants with any shoe that features bright primary red or orange as its dominant color. This means anything in the realm of red Converses or orange Nike Dunks. A splash of wheat works very well, for example, the Clae Malone Whites would pair beautifully: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The second reason why <strong>green</strong> is a great color for pants, is that it’s a common neutral in nature. That’s why it’s used for camo. People are accustomed to seeing it paired with a wide range of shades and tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue is another great shirt color to pair with <strong>green</strong>. A blue top will bring out the cooler tone of your olive pants. You can even pull off a vivid ultramarine top because the trousers will temper its brightness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sage <strong>green</strong> has been growing in popularity for months; you see more sage <strong>green</strong> kitchens and feature walls than you do navy blue nowadays. And it works so well with <strong>grey</strong> because they have those same calming, grounding, soft tones and in fact when paired with <strong>grey</strong> this muted <strong>green</strong> almost becomes neutral too. Perfect if you want to introduce the second color to a <strong>grey</strong> room but not lose the overall serene, neutral scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What are the ways to add <strong>green</strong>s to your living room décor? If you are ready for radical solutions, then opt for a <strong>green</strong> accent wall or even walls or an amazing <strong>green</strong> wall mural. Green furniture and pillows are another great idea to make a refreshing statement; <strong>green</strong> draperies and lamps in the preferred shades are a great idea if you don’t want to spend much money or aren’t sure about the colors – you can change them in case you get tired of them. There’s a more original way to infuse your home with <strong>green</strong> color: just put potted plants and <strong>green</strong>ery here and there and voila! Such a lively and natural way to spruce up your interior! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best way to choose gray colors is to understand the underlying tones. Warmer shades of gray will go better with warmer colors, while cool grays go better with navy blue, cool <strong>green</strong>s, and whites. If you can recognize the color temperature or tone, it will make it easier to choose the rest of your color palette for a room. Charcoal gray is a good choice if you are looking for a darker color, it is not as intense as black or a dark blue. Gray can also be the perfect backdrop for adding a variety of patterns, textures, and accents, do not be afraid to experiment to find the look you are going for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;As versatile as <strong>grey</strong> is, it is important to consider undertones when pairing it with another shade&rsquo; says Richard. &lsquo;Cool <strong>grey</strong>s are best paired with cooler colour schemes, such as blue, <strong>green</strong>, and light purple, while warm <strong>grey</strong>s better complement reds, oranges, and yellows. For fans of the monochrome look, incorporate different shades of <strong>grey</strong>, alongside white and black, to create depth and visual interest.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The risk with pairing <strong>grey</strong> with <strong>grey</strong> is that it can look a bit flat. Avoid this by adding plenty of textures and mixing in some natural materials too like rattan and wood. Accessorize with different materials and finishes too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wearing blue jeans with a <strong>green</strong> military-inspired utility shirt is a timeless casual combination. Switch the colors up by pairing dark olive jeans or chinos with a navy utility shirt. It’s different enough to be fashionable, but familiar enough that any guy can pull it off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Being a tonal shade, rather than a colour in itself, you really can match <strong>grey</strong> in any colour. A darker <strong>grey</strong> trouser will match well with a lighter colour shade top – whether it be <strong>green</strong>, blue, purple or whatever – and vice versa. A light <strong>grey</strong> trouser will work well with a dark red, blue, <strong>green</strong> or black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Like blue, <strong>green</strong> is also seen as a calming color. Green can also help to create a refreshing and lively atmosphere. Because of these effects, <strong>green</strong> is a great choice for adding a pop of color to a room or outfit while still keeping things feeling grounded. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For <strong>green</strong> clothes, you’ll team it up with hues from the left and right of where it sits on the color wheel, meaning yellow and blue. These are exceedingly common in men’s basics: Brown shoes, navy suits, camel jackets, blue and yellow club ties, to name a few. So, incorporating a pair of dark <strong>green</strong> trousers won’t disrupt your wardrobe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I did think of getting a similar sage <strong>green</strong> carpet?. I dont think cream would work. 2 cats, 8yr old and a 37yr old (!) to clean up i fear for a cream carpet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=http://sugartownpublishing.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/C-Coleman-final-cover_sm.114120810_std.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Does Green Go With Grey - 9 Colors to Pair with Green Clothing, As Seen on Celebrities">
