Add Water – You can either use a water-soaked sponge or a spray bottle. The key is to get enough but not too much water on the texture. - Source: Internet No matter how the wall texture was originally created, for most repair methods, you’ll be fixing damaged areas using a premixed wallboard compound. Recreating the texture is not difficult, but plan on spending a little time practicing on scrap pieces of wallboard. The exact texture you have on your walls depends on the tradesman who applied it, so a bit of practice will be necessary to match the texture. - Source: Internet Yep, it’s a lot of work no matter which procedure you have to use. Is it worth it? That depends. It’s a lot cheaper and less disruptive than having new drywall installed, but your chances of ending up with wonky walls that don’t look great are…well, pretty high, actually. You have to put a lot of time and effort into this project to get it to look right — be patient and don’t rush. - Source: Internet Prep and clean the walls Apply a first rough coat of joint compound. Apply a second coat of joint compound. Apply a third and final smoother coat of topping compound. Sand the wall texture to a nice even smooth finish. - Source: Internet Get the link to all the materials and read more on the blog here: https://www.remodelaholic.com/how-to-skim-coat-smooth-wall-texture-over-textured-walls/” player-type=”collapse” override-embed=”true”] - Source: Internet The process of smoothing textured walls with skim coating is fairly common. It refers to spreading a layer of joint compound over the walls to fill in the bumps and valleys in the texture, effectively creating a smooth surface. The texture itself is made of a spray-on joint compound, and since my walls were painted with a flat paint, I had no prep work before I got started. I looked at a few tutorials before attempting on my own, and as I began I actually developed a little different method that really worked quickly and easily. - Source: Internet You can hire a painter to smooth textured walls, but the cost for labor would have put the project out of my budget. The cost of supplies and doing it myself put the total investment around $50 and 5 hours. Not bad for the huge impact. - Source: Internet Orange-peel texture is a wall finish technique that looks like a uniform covering of small bumps. It is sometimes called a “splatter” or “eggshell” texture. You can find it on either plaster or wallboard walls, though it is more common on wallboard. There are several ways you can repair damage to this type of wall finish. - Source: Internet To skim coat around the tile and fixtures, I taped it all off as I would have had I been painting. The joint compound is super easy to clean-up once it’s dry, because it’s basically dried powder. I used the ladder to reach the tops of the walls. I decided against skim coating the ceiling (I’m planning to add some wood planks eventually). - Source: Internet One of the basic tenets of interior design — if you ever plan to sell your home — is to avoid overly personal choices of the more permanent variety. Yet, as anyone who has ever house- or apartment-hunted before can attest, many people think that textured walls are a universally appealing design choice. Fact: They are not. To be fair, textured walls are often employed as a cost-saving measure, because they save on drywall installation costs and hide damage and imperfections that would otherwise need to be repaired — but that doesn’t make them any less divisive. - Source: Internet Here is the bathroom before. I was told that the walls get this orange peel texture treatment to hide imperfections in the sheetrock seams, but I’ve lived in a lot of places with sheetrock and flat walls, so I’m not sure what is really going on. What I do know is that I don’t love it. - Source: Internet Orange-peel textures can usually be repaired simply by using an ordinary 3/8-inch nap paint roller to slightly stipple a coating of wet wallboard compound spread across the surface. To practice your technique, you’ll need pieces of ordinary cardboard, scrap wallboard, or plywood. Before attempting repairs on the actual wall, practice on your scrap materials. - Source: Internet This can be very desirable for a homeowner wanting low maintenance walls. This is also desirable for an investor wanting to flip a home fast. However, when it comes to a high-end, luxury home, where your wall finish can make or break a room, texture is the last thing you want. - Source: Internet If you choose to actually scrap the surface flat, being careful to not gouge into the drywall too much, you could easily put a skim coat of drywall joint compound over the entire wall to make up for the little holes caused by pieces of the grit that popped out or small valleys that are left. This is easier to do than trying to float a coat over a rough surface because you are not raising the entire surface but rather filling in dents and picks. You will probably need to work hard on a first coat, pick up little misses or gouges with touch up work on a second and perhaps third coat. Then prime and paint the wall. - Source: Internet You can paint any room with textured walls. The texture will make the room feel smaller, so people often use it in a room with high ceilings and natural sunlight. If a room is small and has only one or two small windows, it may feel too small. - Source: Internet Wipe down the ceiling with a damp cloth to remove any dust, and clean up your mess, it’s time to paint! We have painted all of our ceilings after removing the texture with this paint in a flat finish. It takes us two coats without priming to get good coverage. You can find our plans for the rest of this room HERE! - Source: Internet Before moving to Texas and building a house, I didn’t realize the wide variety of texture finishes that are possible on drywall. Where I grew up in Utah, walls were always smooth, and the heavy texture that seems to be the norm in Texas and many other southern states feels unfinished to me. So, I’ve decided to tackle the texture myself by smoothing it out with a skim coat before I paint or wallpaper each room. - Source: Internet – Remove items on the wall, remove or cover the trim and move the furniture away to the center of the room. Sand the Walls – This will remove the paint sheen and reduce the size of the texture. That way you can put less mud on the wall. - Source: Internet In the seventies, almost every homeowner wanted textured walls. It was considered cost-effective because it concealed imperfections in the wall. In addition to this, textured walls seemed more fascinating at the time and the ‘textured wall enthusiasts” claimed that it added character to the wall. - Source: Internet – This will remove the paint sheen and reduce the size of the texture. That way you can put less mud on the wall. Wipe the Wall – This is to get rid of the dust you created by sanding. - Source: Internet If you are building a new home from the ground up, the formula is very simple: tell your contractor you want Level 5 finish on your walls (or Level 4, if you can tolerate some imperfections). If you are renovating an existing home, however, this process will be more involved (and thus more expensive). Your contractor will have to: - Source: Internet In addition, textured paint will cover any imperfections in the wall. If your drywall is damaged, you may not be able to paint it without the damage showing. However, when you use textured paint, the design in the walls will hide these blemishes. - Source: Internet At this point, my gut is telling me to go the industrial sander route because the machine will make it easier. However, I’ve had handymen tell me to use skim coating. Torn. I need advice as a first time homeowner and want smooth walls. - Source: Internet Using the drywall sander and the course grit sandpaper, sand away the remaining compound/paint working in small sections. Swap out a fresh sheet of sandpaper when you notice the current one becoming less effective. As soon as the drywall begins to appear under the joint compound, stop and move to the next section. The coarser grit sandpaper can easily tear up the paper layer of the drywall if you aren’t careful. Notice in the picture below how there are a lot of spots with just a very very thin layer of compound left. - Source: Internet Apply a small amount of the original wall color to the edge of the painter’s tape with a brush. This seals the seam, and any bleed through will match the old color and blend in. The new paint color goes on top and any excess will get pulled away when the tape is removed. - Source: Internet One of the basic tenets of interior design—if you ever plan to sell your home—is to avoid overly personal choices of the more permanent variety. Yet, as anyone who has ever house- or apartment-hunted before can attest, many people think that textured walls are a universally appealing design choice. Fact: They are not. To be fair, textured walls are often employed as a cost-saving measure, because they save on drywall installation costs and hide damage and imperfections that would otherwise need to be repaired—but that doesn’t make them any less divisive. - Source: Internet Once the paint is dry, remove the painter’s tape. Pull at a steep angle, towards the area you want to keep white. Check out that perfectly clean line at the corner! (The wall isn’t that dark, but the camera does funny things sometimes!) - Source: Internet Most textured paint does not come with color in it; normally, you will use the textured paint first. Then, once it is completely dry, you can paint the color over it. It is important to test it before you apply it because textured paint is more difficult to remove. - Source: Internet Yep, it’s a lot of work no matter which procedure you have to use. Is it worth it? That depends. It’s a lot cheaper and less disruptive than having new drywall installed, but your chances of ending up with wonky walls that don’t look great are…well, pretty high, actually. You have to put a lot of time and effort into this project to get it to look right—be patient and don’t rush. - Source: Internet If your textured wall has been painted, you’re going to have to employ a more complicated fix (see below). That’s because paint acts as a sealant, protecting the texture from its enemy (that would be water, and you). These approaches apply to textured ceilings, as well. If the wall in question isn’t painted, you can use the “Soak and Scrape” procedure to get that texture off the wall. Like so: - Source: Internet I agree with the others a sander will chew up your walls. And maybe your woodwork and floors too if it gets away from you when you’re trying to sand in close. And you will still not have smooth walls. And then there’s that pesky asbestos and maybe lead paint. - Source: Internet If you’re not loving the texture on your walls and wish to make a change, rest assured that there is a method for removing the plaster. This method of scraping the texture from the wall will take a nominal amount of time, but you’ll be happy with the smooth surface that will allow for worry-free repainting. First, you’ll need to gather the necessary supplies, which according to How to Build It, include a drop cloth, work goggles, a scraper, and a spray bottle, although a large sprayer would get the job done more quickly. You’ll also need sandpaper, a wallboard knife, oil-based primer, and joint compound. - Source: Internet Anyone who has installed and finished drywall knows that smooth-finish walls are very labor intensive. For the homeowner, this means it is more expensive. In order to understand this, you should understand that drywall finishing has been categorized into different levels: - Source: Internet I did a bunch of research on how we would go about this and came across a few methods that we tried out. Our ceilings are even more difficult than the typical popcorn ceilings because they have been painted probably 4-5 times on top of the texture. That makes it way more difficult to remove. If your ceilings aren’t painted with multiple coats, you could most likely get away with following this method! - Source: Internet Here you can see a spot that didn’t get great coverage. The location of the white spots shows that I didn’t roll from high right to low left on this section. While the direction doesn’t really matter on a flat wall, it creates problem spots like this on textured walls! I find it easier to touch up these areas with a brush so I can really work the paint into all the nooks and crannies. - Source: Internet I started the process in this small bathroom, where I was planning to add some fun jackalope wallpaper, but couldn’t wallpaper over the thick texture. After lots of research I determined that a simple skim coat would do the trick to smooth the walls enough to add the paper. Adding the skim coat to smooth the textured walls was super inexpensive and a very simple process. - Source: Internet Modern textured paint allows you to be creative with your walls. The texture adds interest to the walls, and you can create many different effects. People often use wallpaper to create visually interesting designs on the walls, and textured paint is a more affordable way of achieving the same effect. You can create many different styles and patterns, from stucco to linen, to modern 3D designs. - Source: Internet One thing that would be worth testing, but it only works on certain paints and textures: use a heat gun and a wide spatula to scrape off the texture. Try this in a discrete corner and see if it is not easier than cutting with a sharp pull scraper. When the paint is acrylic it will often peel off fairly easy once heated up. Expect a few gauges and some drywall compound patching but the surface can come out quite smooth. - Source: Internet Have you just moved to the Sunshine State from somewhere like California or New England? Then perhaps you are surprised by the number of homes that feature textured walls. Whether it’s the small, rough specks on a popcorn ceiling or orange-peel walls, or the more sweeping texture known as knock-down, texture can seem rough and strange when you’re used to smooth finish walls. So why do so many Florida homes have textured walls? And how do you make your walls smooth if you don’t like the texture? Read on to find out. - Source: Internet Load up the roller with paint from the HANDy Pro Pail, then roll it on the wall in a W pattern. Go over the same area from different directions so you don’t miss any spots. A lamp or flashlight held against the wall can help you see any areas that are missing paint. - Source: Internet Once the skim coat has dried, examine it for major rough areas, or fallen globs of mud. These can all be carefully smoothed with some sandpaper. Once the walls are smoothed and sanded, you’re ready to paint or add wallpaper! - Source: Internet Textured paint can do many different things for your walls. You can create an interesting focal point with faux finishes, or you can create a rustic look. It does a great job of hiding imperfections, so if you aren’t up for replacing drywall that has seen better days, you might want to consider this type of paint job. - Source: Internet Following are some suggestions on where to begin your search for data on Best Paint To Hide Textured Walls:\rYou should try to find How To Remove Textured Paint From Plaster Walls-related information from reputable places.

It refers to spreading a layer of joint compound over the <strong>walls</strong> to fill in the bumps and valleys in the texture, effectively creating a smooth surface. The texture itself is made of a spray-on joint compound, and since my <strong>walls</strong> were <strong>paint</strong>ed with a flat <strong>paint</strong>, I had no prep work before I got started. I looked at a few tutorials before attempting on my own, and as I began I actually developed a little different method that really worked quickly and easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can hire a <strong>paint</strong>er to smooth textured <strong>walls</strong>, but the cost for labor would have put the project out of my budget. The cost of supplies and doing it myself put the total investment around $50 and 5 hours. Not bad for the huge impact. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Orange-peel texture is a wall finish technique that looks like a uniform covering of small bumps. It is sometimes called a &ldquo;splatter&rdquo; or &ldquo;eggshell&rdquo; texture. You can find it on either plaster or wallboard <strong>walls</strong>, though it is more common on wallboard. There are several ways you can repair damage to this type of wall finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To skim coat around the tile and fixtures, I taped it all off as I would have had I been <strong>paint</strong>ing. The joint compound is super easy to clean-up once it’s dry, because it’s basically dried powder. I used the ladder to reach the tops of the <strong>walls</strong>. I decided against skim coating the ceiling (I’m planning to add some wood planks eventually). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the basic tenets of interior design — if you ever plan to sell your home — is to avoid overly personal choices of the more permanent variety. Yet, as anyone who has ever house- or apartment-hunted before can attest, many people think that textured <strong>walls</strong> are a universally appealing design choice. Fact: They are not. To be fair, textured <strong>walls</strong> are often employed as a cost-saving measure, because they save on drywall installation costs and hide damage and imperfections that would otherwise need to be repaired — but that doesn’t make them any less divisive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Here is the bathroom before. I was told that the <strong>walls</strong> get this orange peel texture treatment to hide imperfections in the sheetrock seams, but I’ve lived in a lot of places with sheetrock and flat <strong>walls</strong>, so I’m not sure what is really going on. What I do know is that I don’t love it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Orange-peel textures can usually be repaired simply by using an ordinary 3/8-inch nap <strong>paint</strong> roller to slightly stipple a coating of wet wallboard compound spread across the surface. To practice your technique, you&rsquo;ll need pieces of ordinary cardboard, scrap wallboard, or plywood. Before attempting repairs on the actual wall, practice on your scrap materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This can be very desirable for a homeowner wanting low maintenance <strong>walls</strong>. This is also desirable for an investor wanting to flip a home fast. However, when it comes to a high-end, luxury home, where your wall finish can make or break a room, texture is the last thing you want. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you choose to actually scrap the surface flat, being careful to not gouge into the drywall too much, you could easily put a skim coat of drywall joint compound over the entire wall to make up for the little holes caused by pieces of the grit that popped out or small valleys that are left. This is easier to do than trying to float a coat over a rough surface because you are not raising the entire surface but rather filling in dents and picks. You will probably need to work hard on a first coat, pick up little misses or gouges with touch up work on a second and perhaps third coat. Then prime and <strong>paint</strong> the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can <strong>paint</strong> any room with textured <strong>walls</strong>. The texture will make the room feel smaller, so people often use it in a room with high ceilings and natural sunlight. If a room is small and has only one or two small windows, it may feel too small. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wipe down the ceiling with a damp cloth to remove any dust, and clean up your mess, it’s time to <strong>paint</strong>! We have <strong>paint</strong>ed all of our ceilings after removing the texture with this <strong>paint</strong> in a flat finish. It takes us two coats without priming to get good coverage. You can find our plans for the rest of this room HERE! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before moving to Texas and building a house, I didn’t realize the wide variety of texture finishes that are possible on drywall. Where I grew up in Utah, <strong>walls</strong> were always smooth, and the heavy texture that seems to be the norm in Texas and many other southern states feels unfinished to me. So, I’ve decided to tackle the texture myself by smoothing it out with a skim coat before I <strong>paint</strong> or wallpaper each room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>– Remove items on the wall, remove or cover the trim and move the furniture away to the center of the room. Sand the Walls – This will remove the <strong>paint</strong> sheen and reduce the size of the texture. That way you can put less mud on the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In the seventies, almost every homeowner wanted textured <strong>walls</strong>. It was considered cost-effective because it concealed imperfections in the wall. In addition to this, textured <strong>walls</strong> seemed more fascinating at the time and the ‘textured wall enthusiasts” claimed that it added character to the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>– This will remove the <strong>paint</strong> sheen and reduce the size of the texture. That way you can put less mud on the wall. Wipe the Wall – This is to get rid of the dust you created by sanding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are building a new home from the ground up, the formula is very simple: tell your contractor you want Level 5 finish on your <strong>walls</strong> (or Level 4, if you can tolerate some imperfections). If you are renovating an existing home, however, this process will be more involved (and thus more expensive). Your contractor will have to: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In addition, textured <strong>paint</strong> will cover any imperfections in the wall. If your drywall is damaged, you may not be able to <strong>paint</strong> it without the damage showing. However, when you use textured <strong>paint</strong>, the design in the <strong>walls</strong> will hide these blemishes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At this point, my gut is telling me to go the industrial sander route because the machine will make it easier. However, I&rsquo;ve had handymen tell me to use skim coating. Torn. I need advice as a first time homeowner and want smooth <strong>walls</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Using the drywall sander and the course grit sandpaper, sand away the remaining compound/<strong>paint</strong> working in small sections. Swap out a fresh sheet of sandpaper when you notice the current one becoming less effective. As soon as the drywall begins to appear under the joint compound, stop and move to the next section. The coarser grit sandpaper can easily tear up the paper layer of the drywall if you aren’t careful. Notice in the picture below how there are a lot of spots with just a very very thin layer of compound left. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Apply a small amount of the original wall color to the edge of the <strong>paint</strong>er&rsquo;s tape with a brush. This seals the seam, and any bleed through will match the old color and blend in. The new <strong>paint</strong> color goes on top and any excess will get pulled away when the tape is removed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the basic tenets of interior design—if you ever plan to sell your home—is to avoid overly personal choices of the more permanent variety. Yet, as anyone who has ever house- or apartment-hunted before can attest, many people think that textured <strong>walls</strong> are a universally appealing design choice. Fact: They are not. To be fair, textured <strong>walls</strong> are often employed as a cost-saving measure, because they save on drywall installation costs and hide damage and imperfections that would otherwise need to be repaired—but that doesn’t make them any less divisive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once the <strong>paint</strong> is dry, remove the <strong>paint</strong>er&rsquo;s tape. Pull at a steep angle, towards the area you want to keep white. Check out that perfectly clean line at the corner! (The wall isn&rsquo;t that dark, but the camera does funny things sometimes!) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most textured <strong>paint</strong> does not come with color in it; normally, you will use the textured <strong>paint</strong> first. Then, once it is completely dry, you can <strong>paint</strong> the color over it. It is important to test it before you apply it because textured <strong>paint</strong> is more difficult to remove. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yep, it’s a lot of work no matter which procedure you have to use. Is it worth it? That depends. It’s a lot cheaper and less disruptive than having new drywall installed, but your chances of ending up with wonky <strong>walls</strong> that don’t look great are&mldr;well, pretty high, actually. You have to put a lot of time and effort into this project to get it to look right—be patient and don’t rush. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your textured wall has been <strong>paint</strong>ed, you’re going to have to employ a more complicated fix (see below). That’s because <strong>paint</strong> acts as a sealant, protecting the texture from its enemy (that would be water, and you). These approaches apply to textured ceilings, as well. If the wall in question isn’t <strong>paint</strong>ed, you can use the “Soak and Scrape” procedure to get that texture off the wall. Like so: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I agree with the others a sander will chew up your <strong>walls</strong>. And maybe your woodwork and floors too if it gets away from you when you&rsquo;re trying to sand in close. And you will still not have smooth <strong>walls</strong>. And then there&rsquo;s that pesky asbestos and maybe lead <strong>paint</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;re not loving the texture on your <strong>walls</strong> and wish to make a change, rest assured that there is a method for removing the plaster. This method of scraping the texture from the wall will take a nominal amount of time, but you&rsquo;ll be happy with the smooth surface that will allow for worry-free re<strong>paint</strong>ing. First, you&rsquo;ll need to gather the necessary supplies, which according to How to Build It, include a drop cloth, work goggles, a scraper, and a spray bottle, although a large sprayer would get the job done more quickly. You&rsquo;ll also need sandpaper, a wallboard knife, oil-based primer, and joint compound. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Anyone who has installed and finished drywall knows that smooth-finish <strong>walls</strong> are very labor intensive. For the homeowner, this means it is more expensive. In order to understand this, you should understand that drywall finishing has been categorized into different levels: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I did a bunch of research on how we would go about this and came across a few methods that we tried out. Our ceilings are even more difficult than the typical popcorn ceilings because they have been <strong>paint</strong>ed probably 4-5 times on top of the texture. That makes it way more difficult to remove. If your ceilings aren’t <strong>paint</strong>ed with multiple coats, you could most likely get away with following this method! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Here you can see a spot that didn&rsquo;t get great coverage. The location of the white spots shows that I didn&rsquo;t roll from high right to low left on this section. While the direction doesn&rsquo;t really matter on a flat wall, it creates problem spots like this on textured <strong>walls</strong>! I find it easier to touch up these areas with a brush so I can really work the <strong>paint</strong> into all the nooks and crannies. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I started the process in this small bathroom, where I was planning to add some fun jackalope wallpaper, but couldn’t wallpaper over the thick texture. After lots of research I determined that a simple skim coat would do the trick to smooth the <strong>walls</strong> enough to add the paper. Adding the skim coat to smooth the textured <strong>walls</strong> was super inexpensive and a very simple process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Modern textured <strong>paint</strong> allows you to be creative with your <strong>walls</strong>. The texture adds interest to the <strong>walls</strong>, and you can create many different effects. People often use wallpaper to create visually interesting designs on the <strong>walls</strong>, and textured <strong>paint</strong> is a more affordable way of achieving the same effect. You can create many different styles and patterns, from stucco to linen, to modern 3D designs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One thing that would be worth testing, but it only works on certain <strong>paint</strong>s and textures: use a heat gun and a wide spatula to scrape off the texture. Try this in a discrete corner and see if it is not easier than cutting with a sharp pull scraper. When the <strong>paint</strong> is acrylic it will often peel off fairly easy once heated up. Expect a few gauges and some drywall compound patching but the surface can come out quite smooth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Have you just moved to the Sunshine State from somewhere like California or New England? Then perhaps you are surprised by the number of homes that feature textured <strong>walls</strong>. Whether it’s the small, rough specks on a popcorn ceiling or orange-peel <strong>walls</strong>, or the more sweeping texture known as knock-down, texture can seem rough and strange when you’re used to smooth finish <strong>walls</strong>. So why do so many Florida homes have textured <strong>walls</strong>? And how do you make your <strong>walls</strong> smooth if you don’t like the texture? Read on to find out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Load up the roller with <strong>paint</strong> from the HANDy Pro Pail, then roll it on the wall in a W pattern. Go over the same area from different directions so you don&rsquo;t miss any spots. A lamp or flashlight held against the wall can help you see any areas that are missing <strong>paint</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once the skim coat has dried, examine it for major rough areas, or fallen globs of mud. These can all be carefully smoothed with some sandpaper. Once the <strong>walls</strong> are smoothed and sanded, you’re ready to <strong>paint</strong> or add wallpaper! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Textured <strong>paint</strong> can do many different things for your <strong>walls</strong>. You can create an interesting focal point with faux finishes, or you can create a rustic look. It does a great job of hiding imperfections, so if you aren’t up for replacing drywall that has seen better days, you might want to consider this type of <strong>paint</strong> job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f8/75/7e/f8757e42a8601ef930534c043086a8eb.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="How To Remove Textured Walls With Paint - How to Skim Coat Smooth Wall Texture over Textured Walls">
