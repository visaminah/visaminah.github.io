The Mystery Behind Fractional Bathrooms, Solved In homes with a large master bathroom, you may find the cream of the crop in terms of tubs. The corner tub can give your bathroom a spa-like feel because a corner tub typically measures 60″ x 60″ x 22″. Also, the corner placement will provide you with a ledge surrounding the tub where you can place candles, plants, or a glass of wine. - Source: Internet Americans have doubled the number of bathrooms per person over the past fifty years. Not only has the number of bathrooms doubled, but the square footage of bathrooms has also increased significantly. In the average mid-century home, the bathroom would be 40 square feet, whereas a modern 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home is likely to boast a 70-to-110-square-foot bathroom — sometimes more! - Source: Internet We spoke to Chris Walker, a top-selling real estate agent in Alabama, about what makes a full bathroom, well, full. “The bathroom is labeled based on what’s in it. A full bathroom consists of one sink, one toilet, one shower, and a tub,” Walker explains. - Source: Internet A three-quarter bath is a bathroom that contains three of the four components. In modern homes, this kind of bathroom features a toilet, sink, and shower. In older homes, you’re likely to find a toilet, sink, and bathtub. - Source: Internet Naturally, the size of the fixtures will depend on the amount of space in the room. The average bathtub, called an alcove tub, requires 13 square feet of floor space. Smaller bathrooms will have tubs that usually measure 54″ x 30″ x 15″, but most homes will have a standard-sized tub, measuring 60″ x 32″ x 18″. - Source: Internet The total distance the toilet will stick out from the wall is going to depend on the shape of the bowl. Elongated toilet bowls extend 31 inches from the front to the wall, which is excellent for moderate to large bathrooms. However, if the space is limited, there’ll be a round toilet bowl. These toilets extend up to 28 inches from the front of the bowl to the wall. - Source: Internet These bathrooms can be upgraded to a half bath by merely adding one other element. For example, if there’s a sink, you can easily add a toilet. If there’s a shower stall, you can install a sink. - Source: Internet Small bathrooms can have a pedestal sink, which only features a slender base with a bowl on top. These sinks don’t offer additional storage, but they get the job done and take up very little space. Of course, if you want to have some counter space and storage, there are small cabinet options that take up very little space, ranging between 21 and 25 inches. - Source: Internet Whether you’d like to call it the bathroom, washroom, or restroom, the bathroom used to be the smallest room in the house, and now it’s a coveted place that offers privacy and relaxation. (There’s a reason why the toilet is sometimes referred to as a throne, after all.) - Source: Internet A quarter bath doesn’t offer much space at all and only features one component. This could be a small room with just a sink and mirror for people to freshen up with. It could have just a shower stall next to an outdoor area for washing off after swimming in the pool or coming in from the beach. - Source: Internet The good thing about having a three-quarter bathroom is that you can easily upgrade it to a full bath, providing you have enough space. Let’s say you have a three-quarter bathroom that lacks a shower. You can switch out the fixtures, install a showerhead and curtain, and call it a day. “It’s all about size. If there’s enough square footage, it’s pretty easy because the plumbing is all there,” Walker explains. - Source: Internet Of course, different bathrooms will have different types of tubs. Oval bathtubs are slightly larger than alcove tubs, measuring 60″ x 41″ x 24″. Whirlpool tubs may also look more substantial than the standard alcove tub. Whirlpool tubs tend to be 60 inches long, but the width and height can vary between 32 and 36 inches and 18 and 23 inches, respectively. - Source: Internet Although there are many different bathroom configurations, not all of them are easy to convert into a full bathroom due to space and plumbing. If you’re in love with a house and you need an extra full bath, you can expect to spend up to $19,000. Keep in mind that this estimated cost is going to depend on the grade of materials you want to use. - Source: Internet To get you started, here are some pointers to consider when searching for information regarding what is the definition of three-quarter bathroom:\r- Do some research to find What Is A Half Bathroom-related information from reputable sources.
