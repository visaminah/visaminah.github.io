To do this, start with one of the handles, either left or right. For example, to test the right handle, Turn off the water supply to the left handle by turning its shut-off valve. The valves are usually beneath your sink. They control the supply of water from the primary source through each handle. - Source: Internet If the hammering does not produce any results, the wrench becomes the last resort. However, do not attempt this if you’re not sure about your grip. Simply tighten the wrench around the faucet handle. - Source: Internet Rightly so, Lori, you need to get the handle out of the way so you can access the guts of the faucet in order to fix the leak. After shutting off the water to the tub at the shut-off valve, removing the handle is always the first step in a faucet leak repair, and almost always, there’s a small screw securing the handle that’s hiding under a vanity cap or is a tiny inconspicuous setscrew. However, your faucet is so super vintage it’s screw-less! (I conferred with cousin Sal back in Brooklyn who deals with 50+year old plumbing on a regular basis). Because of its age, I know it’s a stem or compression type faucet. FYI there are basically 2 different types of faucets, compression and washer-less, and knowing which one you have will determine how it’s repaired. - Source: Internet Apply generous amounts of penetrating oil inside the valve and around the handle.

Threaded faucet stems need to be wrapped with thread sealant tape before you screw on the new handles.

However, you may need a specific tool like the faucet handle puller or a pair of pliers. - Source: Internet Sometimes the handle of a bathroom faucet is put on incorrectly so it doesn’t rest in the correct position when the faucet is off. Other times the faucet handle may crack, discolor or otherwise look old, while still functioning. In either of these cases, the faucet handle can be replaced with a new one, without replacing the rest of the faucet. - Source: Internet It is easier to find a leak in a single-handle bathroom faucet because there is only one handle. However, for double-handle Moen faucets, you need to confirm which handle is the source of the leak. Usually, the handle with a faulty seal is the source. So, it would help if you found the handle with a bad seal. - Source: Internet Step 3 – Examine the faucet stem end for any kind of damage. Ideally, the stem tip has rims or ridges which attach to the ridges that are inside the handle of the faucet. When these get worn or spoiled, the faucet handle is unable to tighten around the stem. Due to this reason the faucet unable to turn off. You need to replace the part whose rims have smoothened out over a period of time. - Source: Internet If there are no leaks, you must repeat the process for the other handle. There are also times when the leak may be from both handles. Whatever the case, this process would reveal it. - Source: Internet Step 6 – Wrap a couple of layers (one or two) of thread-seal tape all around the valve stem tip. Now, push or firmly press in the handle over the stem through the layers of thread-seal tape. Another way is to rotate the handle over the stem until it locks in position. - Source: Internet In fact, this buildup can occur even on handles made of stainless steel or other corrosion-resistant metal alloys.

Look beneath the sink for a valve close to the wall on the same side as the handle you are replacing. If this is a single handle faucet, turn off both supplies. When you locate them, twist the water supply valve or valves tightly to the right. - Source: Internet To tighten the handle, turn right. The same goes for screwing handles with bolts/screws. Finally, you can turn on the shut-off valves for both handles when everything has been properly fitted. - Source: Internet Turn on the Water and Test Turn on the water to the home and allow it to flow throughout the plumbing system.

If all went as planned, you should have a new bathtub faucet and no leaks. - Source: Internet Allow the vinegar coating to sit for about an hour. Meanwhile, the acid in the vinegar will gradually disintegrate and loosen the mineral deposits. After some time, you should be able to turn the handle. - Source: Internet Step 4 – Carefully have a peek inside the faucet handle to detect any obvious damage. A handle which is cracked would need complete replacement. Again, this because it will not grip the faucet stem correctly.

As a result, it cannot regulate the faucet. - Source: Internet For stiff handles without bolts or screws, place the wrench on either side of the handle’s base and turn it, slowly, to the left. Don’t turn with too much force. Allow the wrench to do its work. - Source: Internet With steady yet gentle pressure, slowly turn the wrench in the right direction. This force, combined with the penetrating oil treatment, should coax the handle to turn. As soon as it twists a bit, take off the wrench, and loosen it with your hands. - Source: Internet put the screw back into the faucet handle all the way, then back it out 2-3 turns. use the handle puller to pull the handle out a little bit, then take it off. back out the screw 2-3 more turns.

Start by feeding the threaded end of the stem into the hole where the old stems were previously installed. Turn the stem clockwise, tightening it by hand at first, then use a socket wrench to ensure that the connection is snug and secure. Just make sure that you don’t over-tighten the stem, because this can cause damage to the pipes. If your bathtub has multiple handles, repeat the process with each handle to install the new stems. - Source: Internet After your cartridge is dealt with, check the black rubber rings in the faucet handle. The black rings are O-rings. Remove and change the o-ring if it looks worn out. - Source: Internet The right shut-off valve is for the right handle and the left for the right handle. After turning off the right valve, turn on the right handle so that leftover water can leave the handle. Then turn on the left handle and check for any leaks. Leaks indicate that the seal of the left handle is faulty. - Source: Internet Before you can repair a faucet valve, you have to take the handle off. That usually isn’t an overwhelming task, but if the faucet is old or situated in a high humidity environment, corrosion can cause it to stick. More often than not, you can coax it off without damaging the finish using tools and supplies you have around the house. On the rare occasion when it just won’t budge, you may need to go to the hardware store and purchase a faucet puller. - Source: Internet “Hi Norma! I am hoping you can help me with a leaky faucet (major leak). It is in the tub and the faucet handle does not have a vanity cap with a screw under it nor is there a screw anywhere else.

To do this, start with one of the <strong>handle</strong>s, either left or right. For example, to test the right <strong>handle</strong>, Turn off the water supply to the left <strong>handle</strong> by turning its shut-off valve. The valves are usually beneath your sink. They control the supply of water from the primary source through each <strong>handle</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If the hammering does not produce any results, the wrench becomes the last resort. However, do not attempt this if you’re not sure about your grip. Simply tighten the wrench around the faucet <strong>handle</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Rightly so, Lori, you need to get the <strong>handle</strong> out of the way so you can access the guts of the faucet in order to fix the leak. After shutting off the water to the tub at the shut-off valve, removing the <strong>handle</strong> is always the first step in a faucet leak repair, and almost always, there’s a small screw securing the <strong>handle</strong> that’s hiding under a vanity cap or is a tiny inconspicuous setscrew. However, your faucet is so super vintage it’s screw-less! (I conferred with cousin Sal back in Brooklyn who deals with 50+year old plumbing on a regular basis). Because of its age, I know it’s a stem or compression type faucet. FYI there are basically 2 different types of faucets, compression and washer-less, and knowing which one you have will determine how it’s repaired. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Apply generous amounts of penetrating oil inside the valve and around the <strong>handle</strong>. You may also use a sprayer with a narrow nozzle for precise application. Let the oil sit for a couple of minutes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, a shower with two or three <strong>handle</strong>s might have <strong>handle</strong>s screwed onto faucet stems. Threaded faucet stems need to be wrapped with thread sealant <strong>tap</strong>e before you screw on the new <strong>handle</strong>s. A single <strong>handle</strong> that slides directly onto the internal stem valve will not need <strong>tap</strong>e. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=6><li>Once the screw has been removed, you should be able to pull the <strong>handle</strong> off yourself. However, you may need a specific tool like the faucet <strong>handle</strong> puller or a pair of pliers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Sometimes the <strong>handle</strong> of a bathroom faucet is put on incorrectly so it doesn’t rest in the correct position when the faucet is off. Other times the faucet <strong>handle</strong> may crack, discolor or otherwise look old, while still functioning. In either of these cases, the faucet <strong>handle</strong> can be replaced with a new one, without replacing the rest of the faucet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It is easier to find a leak in a single-<strong>handle</strong> bathroom faucet because there is only one <strong>handle</strong>. However, for double-<strong>handle</strong> Moen faucets, you need to confirm which <strong>handle</strong> is the source of the leak. Usually, the <strong>handle</strong> with a faulty seal is the source. So, it would help if you found the <strong>handle</strong> with a bad seal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Step 3 – Examine the faucet stem end for any kind of damage. Ideally, the stem tip has rims or ridges which attach to the ridges that are inside the <strong>handle</strong> of the faucet. When these get worn or spoiled, the faucet <strong>handle</strong> is unable to tighten around the stem. Due to this reason the faucet unable to turn off. You need to replace the part whose rims have smoothened out over a period of time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If there are no leaks, you must repeat the process for the other <strong>handle</strong>. There are also times when the leak may be from both <strong>handle</strong>s. Whatever the case, this process would reveal it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Step 6 – Wrap a couple of layers (one or two) of thread-seal <strong>tap</strong>e all around the valve stem tip. Now, push or firmly press in the <strong>handle</strong> over the stem through the layers of thread-seal <strong>tap</strong>e. Another way is to rotate the <strong>handle</strong> over the stem until it locks in position. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In fact, this buildup can occur even on <strong>handle</strong>s made of stainless steel or other corrosion-resistant metal alloys. Typically, scales are light brown, while lime deposits are bright green in color. In comparison, mineral salts tend to leave a coarse and crusty residue. Nevertheless, it’s all too common, and a cinch resolve. Just follow these steps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When replacing the <strong>handle</strong>, coat the splines and the screw hole liberaly with grease. Silicon grease is better but any kind will do. (bacon grease will work although it does tend to smell a bit after a while). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you have completed these five steps and your faucet <strong>handle</strong>s are still spinning out of control, it might be time to replace the old faucet. Before you panic, bring in the professional team at Waldman Plumbing and Heating, Inc. to take a look at the situation and recommend solutions. To schedule an appointment, call us at 781-780-3184. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Turn off the water supply to the faucet. Look beneath the sink for a valve close to the wall on the same side as the <strong>handle</strong> you are replacing. If this is a single <strong>handle</strong> faucet, turn off both supplies. When you locate them, twist the water supply valve or valves tightly to the right. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To tighten the <strong>handle</strong>, turn right. The same goes for screwing <strong>handle</strong>s with bolts/screws. Finally, you can turn on the shut-off valves for both <strong>handle</strong>s when everything has been properly fitted. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Turn on the Water and Test Turn on the water to the home and allow it to flow throughout the plumbing system. The water will initially push any air out of the pipes, so give it a few minutes before turning off the laundry sink or basement bathroom sink, then proceed to the bathtub. Check the bathtub faucet and <strong>handle</strong>s for any leaks, then turn off the bathtub faucet and check again with the fixture under pressure. If all went as planned, you should have a new bathtub faucet and no leaks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Allow the vinegar coating to sit for about an hour. Meanwhile, the acid in the vinegar will gradually disintegrate and loosen the mineral deposits. After some time, you should be able to turn the <strong>handle</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Step 4 – Carefully have a peek inside the faucet <strong>handle</strong> to detect any obvious damage. A <strong>handle</strong> which is cracked would need complete replacement. Again, this because it will not grip the faucet stem correctly. When the grooves or ridges inside the <strong>handle</strong> get worn out, the <strong>handle</strong> can’t attach with the stem properly. As a result, it cannot regulate the faucet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For stiff <strong>handle</strong>s without bolts or screws, place the wrench on either side of the <strong>handle</strong>’s base and turn it, slowly, to the left. Don’t turn with too much force. Allow the wrench to do its work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With steady yet gentle pressure, slowly turn the wrench in the right direction. This force, combined with the penetrating oil treatment, should coax the <strong>handle</strong> to turn. As soon as it twists a bit, take off the wrench, and loosen it with your hands. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>put the screw back into the faucet <strong>handle</strong> all the way, then back it out 2-3 turns. use the <strong>handle</strong> puller to pull the <strong>handle</strong> out a little bit, then take it off. back out the screw 2-3 more turns. Then repeat with the <strong>handle</strong> puller. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The most straightforward approach to handling a faulty <strong>handle</strong> is removing and replacing it. Although removing Moen bathroom faucet <strong>handle</strong>s is an easy process, it requires care and precision. Pull too hard and you may ruin other functioning parts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Take some white vinegar and pour it generously all over the <strong>handle</strong>. Make sure that the vinegar is not diluted with water. Don’t bother if it drips on to the sink or gets on other areas since it’s unlikely to harm any surface. However, if it helps, you can use a dry towel to cover the sink before pouring the vinegar. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Screw in a New Stem With all of the new parts ready to go, you can begin to reinstall the new bathtub faucet. Start by feeding the threaded end of the stem into the hole where the old stems were previously installed. Turn the stem clockwise, tightening it by hand at first, then use a socket wrench to ensure that the connection is snug and secure. Just make sure that you don’t over-tighten the stem, because this can cause damage to the pipes. If your bathtub has multiple <strong>handle</strong>s, repeat the process with each <strong>handle</strong> to install the new stems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After your cartridge is dealt with, check the black rubber rings in the faucet <strong>handle</strong>. The black rings are O-rings. Remove and change the o-ring if it looks worn out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The right shut-off valve is for the right <strong>handle</strong> and the left for the right <strong>handle</strong>. After turning off the right valve, turn on the right <strong>handle</strong> so that leftover water can leave the <strong>handle</strong>. Then turn on the left <strong>handle</strong> and check for any leaks. Leaks indicate that the seal of the left <strong>handle</strong> is faulty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before you can repair a faucet valve, you have to take the <strong>handle</strong> off. That usually isn&rsquo;t an overwhelming task, but if the faucet is old or situated in a high humidity environment, corrosion can cause it to stick. More often than not, you can coax it off without damaging the finish using tools and supplies you have around the house. On the rare occasion when it just won&rsquo;t budge, you may need to go to the hardware store and purchase a faucet puller. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“Hi Norma! I am hoping you can help me with a leaky faucet (major leak). It is in the tub and the faucet <strong>handle</strong> does not have a vanity cap with a screw under it nor is there a screw anywhere else. I cannot figure out how to get the <strong>handle</strong> off. It is an old faucet, probably original to the building (1937 prewar Brooklyn building). Thanks for your help!” – WYSK Reader Lori Z - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Moen bathroom faucets have different styles and designs. Some <strong>handle</strong>s have screws while others don’t. Some are double-<strong>handle</strong>d, while others are single-<strong>handle</strong>d. Here is how to remove a regular double-<strong>handle</strong> faucet: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your faucet <strong>handle</strong> comes with a screw, you would need to loosen it with a screwdriver. However, the screw may be close to a wall or challenging to reach with a screwdriver. In this case, you would need a socket alongside the screwdriver. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Step 3 – Using a flat-blade screwdriver, pry beneath the cover plate to reveal the <strong>handle</strong> screw. Sometimes tightening this screw will solve the problem. Use a Phillips screwdriver to tighten it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The situation calls for an expert, which in this case is the plumber. However, he is not waiting at your doorstep, so you need to get a <strong>handle</strong> on things yourself. The apparent solution is repairing the faucet yourself. It’s an excellent time to learn the basics of faucet repairs now so that in future you can take care of things on your own. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your faucet <strong>handle</strong> is spinning, you’re probably racking your brain trying to figure out why. Here’s the most common explanation. Spinning faucet <strong>handle</strong>s can be caused by general wear and tear on the faucet stem, otherwise known as the faucet cartridge. This part can be replaced by removing the faucet from the sink and inserting the new cartridge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To replace the <strong>handle</strong>, ensure all the parts you removed are appropriately replaced. Examples include the o-ring and cartridge. You can take a picture of the arrangement of these parts before removing them. This way, you can easily replicate their placement when you’re done cleaning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Your faucet’s <strong>handle</strong> has several components, such as the o-ring and cartridge. When you remove the <strong>handle</strong>, you have easy access to any faulty components. You can change out the damaged part instead of replacing the entire faucet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Also, clean that faucet area with a mixture of white vinegar and water. Replace what needs replacement. Many of these tiny parts of the Moen bathroom faucet <strong>handle</strong> are affordable and easy to get. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To clean the build-up, you would need white vinegar. Mix equal parts of water and vinegar. Pour the mixture on the part of the <strong>handle</strong> (open) linked to the deck plate. Then wipe down with a rag or towel. Ensure you wipe clean all dirty parts of the attached <strong>handle</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Measure the Pipe and Purchase Replacement Parts To ensure that you get compatible parts for your current plumbing set, use a <strong>tap</strong>e measure to measure the length of the pipe. You will need to get a replacement spout that is longer than the pipe. Use the old <strong>handle</strong>s, stems, and spout as a reference when you head to your local hardware store to pick up replacement parts. Remember, if the shower has a multi-<strong>handle</strong> setup, you can’t switch to a single-<strong>handle</strong> setup without a significant amount of re-plumbing, so it’s best to invest in a similar set of <strong>handle</strong>s, rather than picking up a replacement <strong>handle</strong> that won’t work with the existing plumbing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Insert a screw into the top of the <strong>handle</strong> and tighten it down. Place the cover or cap into the top of the <strong>handle</strong>. If the cap reads “hot”, “color” or another word, line this up to face you. Snap the cap down into the cap of the faucet. Turn on the water supply and test the <strong>handle</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>First step in taking apart pretty much anything metal that’s stuck due to corrosion, rust, or built up mineral deposits, is to spray it down with a product that will loosen it up… and have patience as it soaks in to work its magic. Liquid Wrench® is very effective. Spray all around the back of the <strong>handle</strong>. Go have a drink… - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Moen bathroom faucets are of superior quality, but this doesn’t mean that faults wouldn’t arise as you use them. Many of these faults can be dealt with quickly. First, you need to know how to do simple things like removing your bathroom faucet <strong>handle</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>By removing the <strong>handle</strong>, you expose the cartridge held by the brass nut.

You would also need to change the cartridge to stop the leak. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Plastic and metal shower <strong>handle</strong>s can crack and stop working. Even if your shower <strong>handle</strong> is still functioning, it might look dingy or be harboring mold underneath.

This process is relatively easy for <strong>handle</strong>s without screws. All you need are your hands to turn the <strong>handle</strong> leftwards. Handles with screws require screwdrivers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Water is constantly touching the cartridge. This contact with water causes minerals and other substances to build up. In turn, this mineral build-up leads to a sticky faucet <strong>handle</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There is usually a build-up of different unpleasant substances inside the faucet <strong>handle</strong>s. This build-up often prevents the <strong>handle</strong> from functioning correctly. So, it is essential to clean them out before replacing the removed faucet <strong>handle</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After that, wrap a dry rag around the <strong>handle</strong> and try turning it. If it makes little to no movement, carefully use a hammer to <strong>tap</strong> the <strong>handle</strong> in the direction you want to turn it. Usually, it’s counterclockwise or towards the left. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Lay a Towel or Drop Cloth in the Bottom of the Tub When replacing the bathtub faucet, you will need to remove and <strong>handle</strong> one or more screws.

The buildup develops over the years, and other minerals in water are likely a contributing factor. Usually, if you live in an area with hard water and do not have a water treatment system, these deposits accumulate rapidly and cause the <strong>handle</strong> to get stuck. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Step 7 – Finally, turn on the water supply once again to check whether the fix works or not. If it works, remember, the thread-seal <strong>tap</strong>e is a temporary fix. It will increase the life of the faucet stem and <strong>handle</strong> from anywhere between a few months to a year or two. Ultimately, you just have to replace them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Test the faucet to ensure no water comes out when the <strong>handle</strong> to be replaced is turned.

This may be a porcelain cap that reads “hot” or “cold,” or it may be a metal cap in the same finish as the rest of the <strong>handle</strong>. Use a flat head screwdriver to loosen the cap and pry it up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>First, check the back of the <strong>handle</strong> for a screw or bolt.

The rust may have spread to those areas that are beyond your access. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Remove the faucet <strong>handle</strong>s and cover plate. There should be a button or cap covering the screw to the <strong>handle</strong>s. Use a flathead screwdriver to pop this off to gain access to the screw underneath, then remove the screw using the appropriate screwdriver. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before starting the project, you need to buy a replacement <strong>handle</strong>.
