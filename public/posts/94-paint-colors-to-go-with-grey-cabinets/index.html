Sure, the backsplash and paint colour were well-coordinated, but the granite and cream cabinets were doing their own thing and didn’t suit EITHER of the other surfaces. Accessible Beige (and the backsplash) look too taupe/flat compared to the yellow/cream of the cabinets. – it’s a bad combination that just makes the cabinets look more yellow and dated. - Source: Internet When you have gray cabinets, the color complements both dark and light colors allowing it to be an easy transitional shade if you have a light, airy kitchen not overwhelmed by white color. You may want to paint your cabinet in dove gray then pair it with something like a colorful appliance or a complex backsplash tile to give that unexpected contrast. Also, dove gray looks elegant with wooden countertops or marble, and if paired with silver and gold cabinet hardware, it makes a perfect look. - Source: Internet Remember, the above samples weren’t INTENDED to be coordinating wall colours, they were for a different project. However, seeing these colours in this light ON the cabinets helps us see how they just don’t work. This is one reason why I like to keep the sample photos that come in as they often come in handy for OTHER reasons! But regardless, whether your cabinets are this warm or not, gray, greige, taupe or beige paint colours in the LIGHT end of things can be a big stretch. This is one reason why it’s SO DARN HARD to partner with today’s popular gray and greige paint colours with cream cabinets. - Source: Internet Looking for a super quick way to create a grey kitchen? Paint! Just paint a feature wall in a lovely versatile soft grey to transform your space. We love this dusty lilac grey combined with the richly textured wooden cabinetry. But if you don’t have wooden cabinets just bring in some of those natural textures with a collection of chopping boards. - Source: Internet Many homeowners worry that grey is going to be boring in their homes and they do not want to make the room boring or uninteresting, especially if they are looking to sell. Grey, when it is used well, can be unique and exciting. There are many grey colors that you can choose to fill up the space that you are in and make it look nice. - Source: Internet The best strategy is to research and work with the undertones of any color you like. Creamy’s primary undertone is yellow, which comes as no surprise. It is, however, not as yellow as other colors like Sherwin Williams Dover White. (Jenna Kate At Home, 2020) - Source: Internet Lightening and brightening is often the goal in rooms with cream cabinets, HOWEVER, these options won’t make your room look light and bright compared to traditional off-white and light paint colours. But it’s not these paint colour options that are stopping you, it’s your cream cabinets and trim, they have limitations (and don’t kill the wee Ginger messenger!). Your room might look brighter than it USED to if it happened to be painted a darker colour, but that’s as far as you’ll get short of painting your walls the same colour as your cabinets or painting your trim/cabinets white. - Source: Internet ‘The trick is to look at the tones within the grey, and go from there,’ says Livingetc editor Pip Rich. ‘Some greys have purple or blue in them, and work well with those colors, other greys have black or brown in them and work best with black and brown.’ - Source: Internet If you’re worried about making small spaces feel even more small, think again. Imagine a blue color for the island paint, a white subway tile backsplash, stainless steel appliances, white oak cabinets, a farmhouse sink, and white dove walls. When I imagine this, I envision an airy kitchen that feels modern, clean, and yet still cozy and inviting. This type of kitchen sounds like a place I’d love to cook and entertain! - Source: Internet The trick is to get the right grey. ‘Grey is never just grey,’ says Marie Soliman, who designed this space. ‘There are two greys, one that comes between white and black, which I call “cold grey”, then there is the richer one which is a mix of two opposing colors on the color wheel. This warmer grey has real charm and can be used with any color.’ - Source: Internet As anyone who has wondered what colors go with grey will tell you, white is the perfect pairing. Its starkness gleams out against the dreaminess of grey, making both shades seem more sophisticated than they would on their own. Here, the grey marbling of the island carries to designer Suzie McAdam’s modern kitchen backsplash ideas, both of which sing out against the white walls. - Source: Internet Another thing is that gray cabinets tend to stand the test of time. You have seen gray in most of the Scandinavian kitchens. These kitchens have a cutting edge when it comes to design. Although grays are not too trendy for the conventional or traditional kitchen designs, they still offer unique features, and they hold their own space when it comes to the contemporary kitchen world. So, if you plan to remodel your kitchen, you may want to think gray – it’s stylish, offers warmth, and stands against dirt. - Source: Internet White cabinetry can pair well with most wall colors. To brighten and expand your room, select a light color like white, yellow or beige. One of these shades will likely make your kitchen feel cheerful and pristine. On the other hand, if you’d prefer to darken the room, try darker colors like red or mocha. - Source: Internet Grays with purple or blue undertones will create a fresh, cool ambiance, while a warmer shade will feel earthy and warm. Pale gray can be as luminous as white, while a dark shade of charcoal gray can read as black. Gray works with neutrals for an industrial or modern farmhouse look; adds contrast to wood tones; and is a great foil for metallic accents like gold or copper, and colors ranging from pink to green, to practically every color in between. - Source: Internet Grey is uniquely poised to add this vintage sense to a kitchen, as paint washes and worn textures can feel truly charming. This does take time, however. ‘Waxing the cabinets was a long process, and a bit of a headache, but we got there in the end,’ Mark says. - Source: Internet Their original goal was to find a warm white, but it just wasn’t going to work with these cabinets. Through the process of eliminating other potential options (ie. beige), we landed on Antique White 25% lighter which is as CLOSE to white as we’ll get! Even though the match isn’t 100% and varies from one side of the wall to the other, they got the brighter look they were going for! - Source: Internet Does anyone have recommendations for a wall color that goes with gray cabinets? Preferably Sherwin Williams (it’s local). Cabinets are Painted Stone by Waypoint. Gray cabinets are so popular but all the pics I’ve seen have little wall space or are just painted white. - Source: Internet Repose Gray can be paired with Urbane Bronze and Tidewater to create a unique color scheme. Urbane Bronze is actually Sherwin Williams’ Color of the Year for 2021. It’s earthy and dark, and it would look great on a feature wall, cabinets, or as a bold trim. Tidewater is a beautiful blue-green that would look great in a room next to it. - Source: Internet When designing a space, the first step is to choose a color palette or scheme. You’ll always have a blueprint or vision of what colors to use if you choose a group of colors that go well together. Using the same colors throughout your home creates a sense of calm, cohesion, and purpose. - Source: Internet Gray walls are a popular option in a lot of homes. It is a neutral color that is going to work well in many homes and looks nice and clean if you are trying to sell it. When the walls in your kitchen are gray, you will need to consider what color is going to be the best for the cabinets to make them look nice. - Source: Internet You asked for the best blue gray kitchen cabinet paint colors, and I delivered the most popular for 2022.

In addition to using it in furniture and décor, the favorite neutral color has become popular for kitchen cabinets. With different tones, kitchen cabinets painted gray can skew either cold or warm, thus allowing you to easily pair with different backsplash designers, appliance finishes, and countertop materials. - Source: Internet This finish appears shiny and almost glass-like. It’s generally used for high-traffic surfaces, such as a railing. Semi-gloss enamel: If you’re looking for shine but want to avoid a glass-like appearance, semi-gloss may be the option for you. This finish is great for high-moisture areas, cabinets or trim. - Source: Internet When it comes to gray kitchen cabinets, you can choose between stained and painted cabinets. You can have painted cabinets that are covered within an opaque gray hue, or you can choose stained cabinets to carry a translucent finish, which allows some kind of wood grain to be seen. There are many variations when it comes to cabinetry painting and staining. - Source: Internet Gray is a color with endless options in the kitchen cabinetry world. You can use it and pair it with so many colors. To get the right transition and appearance of the kitchen, you want to see what works and what doesn’t work.

Small kitchens, modern kitchen, farmhouse kitchens, and large kitchens alike can utilize blue gray paint colors on their kitchen cabinets to add a pop of color and make your kitchen even more of a focal point of your home. One theme that continues to grow in popularity is blue gray kitchen cabinets, so let’s dive into the most popular colors for 2022. - Source: Internet When choosing the right wall color to match your new kitchen cabinets, first consider the material and appearance of your cabinets. While wood cabinets pair well with earthy, neutral colors, metal cabinets pair well with cool ones. Painted cabinets can present an even greater range of options, so when choosing your wall color, base your decision on what looks work best with the type of cabinets that are in your kitchen. - Source: Internet And while it’s okay with some of the MORE MUTED and lighter cream paint colours, it’s too taupe for others. The reason it’s in this section is that sometimes it’s just that happy medium between cream cabinets/trim and surrounding finishes. My BEST advice is to try it 25% darker as you’ll have a better shot by lowering its LRV. Or even better, check out the darker version, Tony Taupe. - Source: Internet The good thing with blue-gray is that it satisfies even the most boring or neutral of palettes. It is elegant when you paint on kitchen cabinets, and even more when you pair it with metallic accents like gold or nickel. Blue-gray also appears nicely-looking when you combine it with complex floor tiles in dark or light colors. It also appears great when you complement it with the classic hardwood floor. Using a moody shade of gray color creates that cooling haven; it feels like the stormy morning you encounter on the coast. - Source: Internet in comparison. If this is okay with you, fill yer boots, but this look isn’t usually what my clients are going for. If you partner your cream cabinets with an off-white paint colour that isn’t actually THE SAME PAINT COLOUR as your cabinets, you risk some seriously clashing undertones – the two colours will be fighting for the same slot. - Source: Internet SW 7015 Repose Gray Color has purple and blue undertones, whereas Agreeable Gray has green undertones. This is despite the fact that they are both gray paint colors with strong beige undertones. Agreeable Gray appears to be lighter than Repose Gray in general. - Source: Internet I LOVE Horizon Gray. Not only does it have a beautiful green hue to it, but it also humours a reasonable range of cream paint colours. Just remember, the green undertone in Horizon Gray CAN make your cream cabinets or trim look that bit more yellow in comparison. - Source: Internet Testers are a great way for you to choose the right wall color to match your kitchen cabinets. You can buy them in a few different colors or shades to get a better idea of what the walls will look like and how the color will look at various times of the day when the light hits it. You may want to leave these test samples up for at least a week to get a good idea of what the color looks like in different lighting and times of the day. - Source: Internet It’s not easy when it comes to picking a color for the décor of a room. Before you can settle on a particular palette, you need to pick a style while also thinking about functionality. One thing with gray is that it’s very versatile. It can adapt to every space and style. A kitchen with grey cabinets will look stylish in a majority of situations and allow balance to dominate. - Source: Internet If you want to showcase your cabinets’ color for all to see, pick a wall color that will emphasize them. Choose paint with the same undertone as your cabinets but a couple of shades darker. Your cabinets will draw the eye, and the room will appear more spacious. If you’d rather make your cabinets blend into the background, you can choose an attention-grabbing wall color. A bright, bold shade can make your cabinets less noticeable. - Source: Internet Repose Gray serves as an anchor paint color for these cooler shades in the final color scheme. Naval is Sherwin Williams’ 2020 Color of the Year. It is a deep navy blue that works well as an accent wall, built-in cabinets, or furniture. - Source: Internet High-quality hardwood flooring also looks fantastic when paired with quartz countertops, especially Caesarstone’s 6600 Nougat.

To complete the look, add gold-colored accent pieces for some intrigue. - Source: Internet Regardless of what you call it, blue kitchen cabinets, light gray, dark gray, gray cabinets, and so on continue to grow in popularity, and it’s no wonder why.

If the paint is easy to wipe off, you will find that it is easier to keep them clean. - Source: Internet This is always a tough one, and at some point, you can only get so close to finding your exact colour match when cabinets have a glaze on them. Do your best to figure out what the ORIGINAL colour might’ve been and add a few LRV points for the extra depth added by the glaze. This is an important step as this number will help guide you towards a STARTING point when looking for compatible paint colours. Yes, glazed cream cabinets or trim add another layer to the beast. - Source: Internet Besides, having a kitchen with grey cabinets is great bacause they look good with different countertops. You have seen gray cabinets paired with solid surface and marble countertops – these two are popular choices for countertops. However, gray also pairs beautifully with laminate and butcher block, especially if you want a budget-friendly solution. - Source: Internet Do you think blue paint colors are not a good choice for kitchen cabinets?

(Kylie M Interiors, 2020) - Source: Internet ‘Grey is a beautiful color on its own but it also works so well with every other color because it’s the ultimate neutral. This is brilliant if you like grey - but don’t want to have it on every wall. Explore colors that work with grey like Concrete Grey (opens in new tab), Spiced Honey (opens in new tab) and Vintage Smoke (opens in new tab).’ says Shillingford. - Source: Internet Notice how Worldly Gray (left) sits a BIT better than Popular Gray (right), HOWEVER, neither are any screamin’ glory.

I’m always happy to humour clients when they want to TRY something like this, as sometimes they need to see for themselves why it doesn’t work. - Source: Internet Creamy will look fantastic in the living room, dining rooms, and kitchen cabinets when paired with repose gray walls. These creamy kitchen cabinets complement the Sherwin Williams Repose Gray walls. They end up creating a light, warm and inviting space.

Perhaps you want to establish a cohesive theme throughout your house. Maybe your kitchen is part of an open layout, and you want the wall color to work well with adjoining rooms to avoid clashing colors. In that case, you may want to use different shades of the same color to add depth and differentiate between rooms. - Source: Internet If you’re looking for a more youthful and light blue gray paint color, a great option is Sherwin Williams Stardew. This blue gray color has more blue undertones than gray making it the best choice for lighter blue cabinets.

Stardew gives me more coastal vibes, but I think this would still look amazing on kitchen cabinetry in the woods. - Source: Internet The trim is WHITER than the cabinets, making the cabinets look more yellow in comparison.

Cool neutrals have blue or green undertones, while warm neutrals have red, yellow, orange or brown ones.

This just makes a nice contrast, especially if you can get some greys that will go with one another. - Source: Internet If your cabinets are made of metal, find a color that will complement their sleek, reflective look. Typical kitchen wall colors may not be a great match with metal cabinets. Instead, consider pairing them with a dark gray, red or white if your cabinets are metallic grey. For white cabinets, most cool colors will work well as a backdrop. Metal cabinets stand out and attract attention, so you can choose a color that accents them well or tones down their metallic appearance. - Source: Internet By choosing complementary colours that sit closely to one another on the colour wheel, you can create a seamless and calming effect.

Sure, the backsplash and paint colour were well-coordinated, but the granite and cream <strong>cabinets</strong> were doing their own thing and didn’t suit EITHER of the other surfaces.

This is one reason why I like to keep the sample photos that come in as they often come in handy for OTHER reasons! But regardless, whether your <strong>cabinets</strong> are this warm or not, gray, greige, taupe or beige paint colours in the LIGHT end of things can be a big stretch. This is one reason why it’s SO DARN HARD to partner with today’s popular gray and greige paint colours with cream <strong>cabinets</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Looking for a super quick way to create a grey kitchen? Paint! Just paint a feature wall in a lovely versatile soft grey to transform your space. We love this dusty lilac grey combined with the richly textured wooden cabinetry. But if you don&rsquo;t have wooden <strong>cabinets</strong> just bring in some of those natural textures with a collection of chopping boards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Many homeowners worry that grey is going to be boring in their homes and they do not want to make the room boring or uninteresting, especially if they are looking to sell. Grey, when it is used well, can be unique and exciting. There are many grey <strong>colors</strong> that you can choose to fill up the space that you are in and make it look nice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best strategy is to research and work with the undertones of any color you like.

But it’s not these paint colour options that are stopping you, it’s your cream <strong>cabinets</strong> and trim, they have limitations (and don’t kill the wee Ginger messenger!). Your room might look brighter than it USED to if it happened to be painted a darker colour, but that’s as far as you’ll get short of painting your walls the same colour as your <strong>cabinets</strong> or painting your trim/<strong>cabinets</strong> white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>&lsquo;The trick is to look at the tones within the grey, and go from there,&rsquo; says Livingetc editor Pip Rich. &lsquo;Some greys have purple or blue in them, and work well with those <strong>colors</strong>, other greys have black or brown in them and work best with black and brown.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re worried about making small spaces feel even more small, think again. Imagine a blue color for the island paint, a white subway tile backsplash, stainless steel appliances, white oak <strong>cabinets</strong>, a farmhouse sink, and white dove walls. When I imagine this, I envision an airy kitchen that feels modern, clean, and yet still cozy and inviting. This type of kitchen sounds like a place I’d love to cook and entertain! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The trick is to get the right grey. &lsquo;Grey is never just grey,&rsquo; says Marie Soliman, who designed this space. &lsquo;There are two greys, one that comes between white and black, which I call &ldquo;cold grey&rdquo;, then there is the richer one which is a mix of two opposing <strong>colors</strong> on the color wheel. This warmer grey has real charm and can be used with any color.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As anyone who has wondered what <strong>colors</strong> go with grey will tell you, white is the perfect pairing.

Urbane Bronze is actually Sherwin Williams&rsquo; Color of the Year for 2021. It&rsquo;s earthy and dark, and it would look great on a feature wall, <strong>cabinets</strong>, or as a bold trim. Tidewater is a beautiful blue-green that would look great in a room next to it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When designing a space, the first step is to choose a color palette or scheme.

It is a deep navy blue that works well as an accent wall, built-in <strong>cabinets</strong>, or furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>High-quality hardwood flooring also looks fantastic when paired with quartz countertops, especially Caesarstone’s 6600 Nougat. The coarse-grained, almost sand-like tones found in 6600 Nougat pair well with wood floors and gray <strong>cabinets</strong>, creating a fresh, nature-inspired kitchen design. To complete the look, add gold-colored accent pieces for some intrigue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Regardless of what you call it, blue kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>, light gray, dark gray, gray <strong>cabinets</strong>, and so on continue to grow in popularity, and it’s no wonder why. The classic feel of the primary color blue makes blue gray <strong>cabinets</strong> a great choice. The best thing is how easily blue gray <strong>colors</strong> pair with many other <strong>colors</strong> allowing your kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> to coordinate with the existing color scheme in your home easily. Not to mention how absolutely amazing it looks paired with white countertops, brass hardware, and wood tones (we’ll get into this more later!). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pick a color that is bright and easy to clean off. You know that the kitchen can get messy and you will need to clean off the <strong>cabinets</strong> at some point. Changing up the color to bright white is going to show some of these messes as well. If the paint is easy to wipe off, you will find that it is easier to keep them clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is always a tough one, and at some point, you can only get so close to finding your exact colour match when <strong>cabinets</strong> have a glaze on them. Do your best to figure out what the ORIGINAL colour might’ve been and add a few LRV points for the extra depth added by the glaze. This is an important step as this number will help guide you towards a STARTING point when looking for compatible paint colours. Yes, glazed cream <strong>cabinets</strong> or trim add another layer to the beast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Besides, having a kitchen with grey <strong>cabinets</strong> is great bacause they look good with different countertops. You have seen gray <strong>cabinets</strong> paired with solid surface and marble countertops – these two are popular choices for countertops. However, gray also pairs beautifully with laminate and butcher block, especially if you want a budget-friendly solution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Do you think blue paint <strong>colors</strong> are not a good choice for kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>? Well, think again! White <strong>cabinets</strong> are, of course, still a stylish choice; however, in 2022, people are expanding their neutral paint <strong>colors</strong> to include blue gray kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. Having a bold color in the kitchen is a trend that continues to rise. Although painting kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> a blue gray color may be a new trend, these color choices have deep roots in history and are very traditional. Because of this, blue gray painted kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> aren’t like other home design trends. These <strong>colors</strong> aren’t going anywhere anytime soon! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You&rsquo;ll be surprised at how much grayer Repose Gray is. Both Repose Gray and Revere Pewter are excellent <strong>colors</strong> for use throughout the house. Revere Pewter can look muddy at times, whereas Repose Gray never does. (Kylie M Interiors, 2020) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Grey is a beautiful color on its own but it also works so well with every other color because it&rsquo;s the ultimate neutral. This is brilliant if you like grey - but don&rsquo;t want to have it on every wall. Explore <strong>colors</strong> that work with grey like Concrete Grey (opens in new tab), Spiced Honey (opens in new tab) and Vintage Smoke (opens in new tab).&rsquo; says Shillingford. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Notice how Worldly Gray (left) sits a BIT better than Popular Gray (right), HOWEVER, neither are any screamin’ glory. While Worldly Gray is ‘better’, it’s still very questionable and makes the <strong>cabinets</strong> look darn warm in comparison. I’m always happy to humour clients when they want to TRY something like this, as sometimes they need to see for themselves why it doesn’t work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Creamy will look fantastic in the living room, dining rooms, and kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> when paired with repose gray walls. These creamy kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> complement the Sherwin Williams Repose Gray walls. They end up creating a light, warm and inviting space. It&rsquo;s also a great color for rustic decor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Also, gray kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> don’t make space appear dark or heavy. When you want to make a statement on your kitchen design, you can go with black, however, that makes the space look dark or dull. Although dark <strong>cabinets</strong> are becoming popular, they aren’t the best option you can use. If you are possessed with black color, and you are worried the kitchen space won’t get sufficient light, you can go with gray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Take a look at this next photo. You’ll see a range of warm off-white neutrals partnered with very creamy <strong>cabinets</strong>. Notice how much richer and more yellow the <strong>cabinets</strong> look in comparison to these warm off-whites… - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Countertops are an essential part of any residential kitchen. High-quality countertops provide homeowners with a space to eat, cook, socialize, work, and much more. Although there are a variety of available materials that homeowners can make use of for their countertops, modern gray <strong>cabinets</strong> kitchen ideas often feature quartz. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To make those white <strong>cabinets</strong> really pop, use Repose Gray as your kitchen wall paint. It can also be wrapped around the ceiling, which makes the entire space feel warm and inviting. (Hampton Redesign., 2021) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Agreeable Gray is also one of the most popular Sherwin Williams paint <strong>colors</strong>. It&rsquo;s another greige paint color that looks a lot like Repose Gray but has a few key differences. The LRVs of Repose Gray and Agreeable Gray is very similar. This means they will return nearly the same amount of light into the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Almost any color you can think of will look great with SW 7015 Repose Gray. Repose Gray is a warm, inviting color that isn&rsquo;t sterile or harsh. It&rsquo;s a slightly warm gray with very subtle taupe undertones. These highlighted <strong>colors</strong> will work well as coordinating <strong>colors</strong> for kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grey kitchens can benefit from the addition of natural timber elements in order to warm up the colour palette and create a homely environment. Timber worktops are long-lasting and practical, and are an easy way to introduce wood into your kitchen. We offer subtle options of visible wood trim in our Pure range of <strong>cabinets</strong>, which are available in Walnut or Oak. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you combine texture and color into your kitchen design, you can create a beautiful, inviting room in your home. To learn what color might work best with your new kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>, break out your color wheel. Consider all of your color scheme options, from contrasting <strong>colors</strong> to harmonizing hues. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>By pairing this shade with white walls, it creates a bold aesthetic which is almost monochromatic, but not quite - thanks to those greying tones. &lsquo;The contrast of whites and creams against harsher dark <strong>colors</strong> always engages the eye,&rsquo; Athena says. &lsquo;When you juxtapose something soft against something bold you create a certain voltage.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Don’t forget to consider the existing <strong>colors</strong> in your home when making your decision. Perhaps you want to establish a cohesive theme throughout your house. Maybe your kitchen is part of an open layout, and you want the wall color to work well with adjoining rooms to avoid clashing <strong>colors</strong>. In that case, you may want to use different shades of the same color to add depth and differentiate between rooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re looking for a more youthful and light blue gray paint color, a great option is Sherwin Williams Stardew. This blue gray color has more blue undertones than gray making it the best choice for lighter blue <strong>cabinets</strong>. This paint color is described as youthful since it is a much lighter blue than the first two popular blue gray paint <strong>colors</strong> I mentioned above. Stardew gives me more coastal vibes, but I think this would still look amazing on kitchen cabinetry in the woods. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol><li>The trim is WHITER than the <strong>cabinets</strong>, making the <strong>cabinets</strong> look more yellow in comparison. Overall, the trim looks to be a considerably BRIGHT warm colour with a reasonable yellow in it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Renovating a kitchen can sometimes feel like a daunting task. There are countless factors homeowners need to consider before making a final decision. Some of these decisions include picking the right style and color for their kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You may think neutral means white, gray or brown — but in home decor, neutral actually refers to light or medium <strong>colors</strong> that match well with other <strong>colors</strong>. Neutrals can be cool or warm. They come in different undertones, such as blue, green, gray, yellow or brown. Cool neutrals have blue or green undertones, while warm neutrals have red, yellow, orange or brown ones. When selecting a neutral shade, picking between a cool or warm neutral is the first decision you’ll want to make. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Neutral <strong>colors</strong> often work best on kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> if the walls are gray. This means that you should go with options like a neutral gray, cream, pearl, and white. This can help to provide some of the modern look that the <strong>cabinets</strong> are going to need. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One option that can look nice in your kitchen is to use different <strong>colors</strong> like grey and white <strong>cabinets</strong>. This helps to create a type of gentle contrast. You can go for gray <strong>cabinets</strong> and white countertops or you can have all white in the upper <strong>cabinets</strong> and then grey for the lower ones. This just makes a nice contrast, especially if you can get some greys that will go with one another. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your <strong>cabinets</strong> are made of metal, find a color that will complement their sleek, reflective look. Typical kitchen wall <strong>colors</strong> may not be a great match with metal <strong>cabinets</strong>. Instead, consider pairing them with a dark gray, red or white if your <strong>cabinets</strong> are metallic grey. For white <strong>cabinets</strong>, most cool <strong>colors</strong> will work well as a backdrop. Metal <strong>cabinets</strong> stand out and attract attention, so you can choose a color that accents them well or tones down their metallic appearance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>By choosing complementary colours that sit closely to one another on the colour wheel, you can create a seamless and calming effect. Creating a close colour match between your kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> and wall paint is a fantastic way for a smaller kitchen to give the illusion space. Alternatively, contrasting colours like pinks and reds can be used to energise a space, allowing you the freedom to express your sense of style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is one of the best <strong>colors</strong> to use on your <strong>cabinets</strong> to help accent <strong>colors</strong> stand out. SW Creamy looks great as a kitchen cabinet color in a variety of rooms. Because of the amount of yellow it can display, it is not recommended as a trim color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Don’t be overwhelmed by all the blue gray paint color choices. Sticking to one of the popular color options for 2022 will make your decision less stressful since these are tried and loved color choices by so many others. Which one of these <strong>colors</strong> is your favorite? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Keep your home&rsquo;s lighting in mind as well. Darker <strong>colors</strong> may appear lighter and brighter in a room with a lot of natural light. Lighting has a big impact on wall <strong>colors</strong>. Look at them both during the day and at night to make sure you still like them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hale Navy is the most gorgeous blue paint color, and it also happens to be one of Benjamin Moore’s best-selling <strong>colors</strong>. This deep rich navy blue has gorgeous charcoal gray undertones. If you think navy <strong>cabinets</strong> are a bold choice, think again! Hale Navy is one of the most popular blue paints for kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> in 2022. Hale Navy has cool undertones, but what makes it so versatile is that it pairs amazingly well with warm undertones and cool undertone paint <strong>colors</strong>. This classic color will not let you down! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Lastly, stainless steel pairs well with a variety of <strong>colors</strong>, including gray. Pairing grey <strong>cabinets</strong> with a stainless steel backsplash is a great way to create a sleek and modern kitchen space. This versatility, along with the characteristics mentioned above, make stainless steel backsplashes a perfect addition to any kitchen with gray <strong>cabinets</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your <strong>cabinets</strong> suddenly look yellow next to the white paper, they are a warm white. If they look bluer, or about the same as the white paper, they are a cool tone. If your <strong>cabinets</strong> just look fractionally warmer, but not yellow at all, then they are probably a pretty neutral white - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re looking for shine but want to avoid a glass-like appearance, semi-gloss may be the option for you. This finish is great for high-moisture areas, <strong>cabinets</strong> or trim. Satin enamel: This finish has less shine, is easy to clean and is great for rooms with moisture, such as bathrooms or kitchens. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to style your gray <strong>cabinets</strong>, you may want to think of other <strong>colors</strong> you use. You can pair gray <strong>cabinets</strong> in the kitchen with warm materials and <strong>colors</strong>. The thing with gray is that it can appear cold and austere when you compare it with other <strong>colors</strong>. A room like a kitchen needs to be warm as well as inviting, meaning that using gray alone can be tricky. What you need to do is pair it with some warm material like wood along with bold accent <strong>colors</strong> like red, orange, and yellow so that you squeeze out some cheerfulness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to add interest to the gray cabinetry, you can consider using a two-tone look. This look combines two cabinetry <strong>colors</strong> within the same space. Since gray is neutral, it will pair well with every other color. Also, gray <strong>cabinets</strong> tend to work well with different wood tones. You can choose cement gray for your wall <strong>cabinets</strong> or stained mahogany cabinetry for the island. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the reasons why you would want to use gray <strong>cabinets</strong> is because the color does not show dirt as white does. White <strong>cabinets</strong> tend to be nice to look at; however, they show dirt easily. White <strong>cabinets</strong> have dominated the home design landscape for quite some time; however, they are a big drawback. Any smudge or stain or even droplet of liquid will stand out against white <strong>cabinets</strong>. However, gray <strong>cabinets</strong> tend to be a bit more forgiving. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We all love elephants, who doesn’t? The elephant gray has a cool tone and appears natural. It offers a great look in any kitchen. You can paint elephant gray on walls to offer a cooling effect, and also on kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>, pairing it with dark wooden or marble countertops. Better still, you can pair elephant gray with subway tile backsplash to get a classic combination. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The closer two paint colours are in depth, the more they’ll compete with each other. You need APPROX. 20+ LRV points between your cream <strong>cabinets</strong>/trim and your wall colour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With painted <strong>cabinets</strong>, they bring in a crisp, even coloration. They are also easier to wipe down, but stained <strong>cabinets</strong> bring a textured appearance that tends to highlight the wood beneath. However, when you have a protective coating, you can make the stained <strong>cabinets</strong> to be easier to clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’ve chosen wood <strong>cabinets</strong>, consider which <strong>colors</strong> will match well with the wood’s warm tones. Natural wood <strong>colors</strong> like oak, maple and walnut look best when paired with earthy shades. Avoid bold <strong>colors</strong> that can clash with wood <strong>cabinets</strong>. While you may want a dark pink for your kitchen walls, the result could be disastrous when paired with cherry <strong>cabinets</strong>. Limit your favorite bold hues to accent pieces, and stick mostly to neutral <strong>colors</strong> for bigger portions of the room, like the walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol><li>If you’re among the lucky few who have cream <strong>cabinets</strong> that are on the HIGH of the off-white range (ie. LRV of 80/81) you’ll have more room to move AS LONG as your cream doesn’t have a dominant yellow hue (ie. Sherwin Williams Creamy is good). By the time cream gets this light, it’s slightly more likely to act like a soft warm white than an off-white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Grey kitchen ideas are always in demand. Luxe, soothing, stylish and sometimes even daring, grey is one of the most versatile and liveable <strong>colors</strong> around. When used well it can add depth to neutral palettes, or make bolder shades seem more grounded. It&rsquo;s the perfect neutral, able to be dressed up or down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>White is a simple color that is able to go with anything that you throw at it. It can look nice and clean, especially if you pick a bright color that will contrast a bit with some of the grey that is stuck on the walls. You may find that a simple splash of white on the <strong>cabinets</strong> will make them look amazing and brightens up the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Within the kitchen design space, silver takes the first position in hardware <strong>colors</strong> used with gray cabinetry. However, other metallic finishes can also mesh well. When you have cabinetry with warm-tone gray, brass or gold drawer pulls tend to be very flattering, particularly if you pair them with matching sink faucets. Cooler gray tones and gray <strong>cabinets</strong> having a blue-ish hue look great when you pair them with traditional stainless-steel hardware. And this is how you create a modern kitchen! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Stonington Gray is a HEAVY, light depth stormy gray paint colour with a passive blue (often blue-green) undertone. Because Stonington Gray leans that bit cooler, it can be more reactive with the yellow in cream <strong>cabinets</strong> or trim. The more MUTED your cream is, the better chance you have of this combo looking great as Stonington Gray NATURALLY prefers white paint colours. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Argos is a WICKED pretty light-medium gray paint colour with a green-blue undertone. HOWEVER, being a cool paint colour, it WILL make your cream <strong>cabinets</strong> or trim look that much warmer in comparison. This is a pretty combo but needs to be the look you’re going for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are only a few paint <strong>colors</strong> that can be used on walls, trim, and <strong>cabinets</strong>. Of course, Repose Gray is one of those uncommon paint <strong>colors</strong>. Sw 7015 Repose Gray with Sw Pure White Pure paint color are <strong>colors</strong> that go well together. It goes well on trim, built-in <strong>cabinets</strong>, and walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Repose Gray is a warm gray neutral paint color that is extremely popular right now and has been for a long time. This is because it is so neutral and adaptable, it can be used in almost any home and almost any room. This paint color by Sherwin Williams is extremely versatile and goes well with a wide range of other <strong>colors</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Instead of contrasting <strong>colors</strong>, you could also opt for harmonizing shades for your kitchen. Consider your kitchen as a whole, and select a wall color that brings the entire room together. Maybe your ideal shade of wall paint matches the grain in your <strong>cabinets</strong>, or perhaps you prefer muted <strong>colors</strong> that will accent your <strong>cabinets</strong> and draw attention, such as ivory, salmon, pale aqua, light gray or a soft yellow. Avoid dark <strong>colors</strong>, as they might seem to shrink your kitchen’s size and could clash with your <strong>cabinets</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This depends on the vibe you are trying to create – if you want to play it safe and like a neutral scheme, than layering greys and adding in hints and black and whites is always a classic look. You could however be a bit bolder and throw in some contrasting <strong>colors</strong> like oranges and yellows to warm up your kitchen. It also depends on the tone of grey you are using in your kitchen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>IN GENERAL, Comfort Gray with these cream <strong>cabinets</strong> is a beautiful COMBINATION. Would I like them in rooms that are next to each other? Sure. Do I want them right up against each other? It’s not that it’s not pretty, but the cool hue of Comfort Gray is making the <strong>cabinets</strong> and trim look MUCH MORE YELLOW in comparison, a look that not EVERYONE is going for…but maybe YOU ARE! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A kitchen that is adorned with gray-colored <strong>cabinets</strong> along with other matching <strong>colors</strong> can be far from dull. Gray <strong>cabinets</strong> tend to build anticipation for other things in the kitchen. When you enter the kitchen, and you encounter gray color, you cannot wait to see other aspects like the floor, countertops, and backsplash. Gray makes other elements of your kitchen décor to come out more perfectly. Rather than having a boring kitchen, gray will make it more exciting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Based on existing finishes, especially in homes from the early 2000s, some kitchens don’t suit white <strong>cabinets</strong> and better suit a wood stain or a non-white paint colour. In these situations, a warm off-white or cream can come in darn handy, often saving the DAY. I’ve fallen in love with MANY cream kitchens when they’re done well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Almost any countertop color will look good with gray cabinetry. So your options for countertops may seem endless because gray works with almost any color. You may want to choose a splashy countertop color like aqua. You may also want to go for sophisticated monochromatic looks like the ones in stainless steel or slate. Also, natural stones like marble and granite can be a popular complement to the <strong>cabinets</strong> since the tone features gray flecks or veining. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/43/c3/02/43c302eadf0d7a7f68bff352e9cf0329--black-kitchen-countertops-grey-kitchen-cabinets.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Paint Colors To Go With Grey Cabinets - Pictures Of Kitchens With Gray Cabinets">
