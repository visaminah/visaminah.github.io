Foliage is glossy and deep green in colour with new growth being tinged in tones of red-brown. Small, white flowers appear in the warmer months, followed by fleshy pink-red fruits. This variety could easily be used as an Australian native alterative to the Italian pencil pines. - Source: Internet Cypress trees come in many varieties, over 130 species to be exact, which means there is sure to be something for your garden. The leaves range in colour from silver-green to dark green. They grow in whorled patterns or spirals and handle just about any soil type.

Don’t cut it any earlier, as the screening effect will last over winter, and it looks very pretty when the fronds are dusted with white frost. Grows to a height of around 2m if it’s kept well-watered. Plant in a large pot in full sun or partial shade. - Source: Internet Fast growing ‘Fine Line’ buckthorn is ideal in containers, to block views from windows, or to create privacy as foundation planting.

Many hedges can be used for screening, but there are also screening plants that are particularly fast-growing and dense. Here are 15 of the best hedges recommended by us – Harwood’s Garden Supplies - Source: Internet Where space is not a problem a mixed screen of some depth can be planted. For example, silver birches (Betula Pendula) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) interplanted in two rows 4.5m (15ft) apart can be very effective especially when underplanted with cotoneasters, viburnums and poplars which can be removed as the screen develops. A more formal approach might include Catalpa bignonioides ‘Aurea’, Davidia involucrata, Fagus sylvatica ‘Fastigiata’, Quercus rubra, Prunus padus or Sorbus aria ‘Lutescens’. - Source: Internet If you’re looking for a screen with needle leaves rather than broad leaves, the Cypress is a good choice. Cypress is better in hot, humid areas, but it can grow in some areas if well-cared for.

Cypress grows very quickly and does need to be trimmed regularly to keep it as a screen, but that also means it will become a screen quite fast.

This variety could easily be used as an Australian native alterative to the Italian pencil pines. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cypress trees come in many varieties, over 130 species to be exact, which means there is sure to be something for your garden. The leaves range in colour from silver-green to dark green. They grow in whorled patterns or spirals and handle just about any soil type. Most people think of cypress trees and tall narrow trees but many varieties such as Thuja Plicata (as pictured above) are wider and make excellent <strong>screen</strong>s if spaced and trimmed a couple of times a year. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It is very easy to grow, it just needs cutting down to the ground in February. Don’t cut it any earlier, as the <strong>screen</strong>ing effect will last over winter, and it looks very pretty when the fronds are dusted with white frost. Grows to a height of around 2m if it’s kept well-watered. Plant in a large pot in full sun or partial shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fast growing ‘Fine Line’ buckthorn is ideal in containers, to block views from windows, or to create privacy as foundation planting. Its feathery foliage is very elegant, with thin and long mid green leaves that grow on upright branches giving you very elegant and refined texture, and a dense <strong>screen</strong> from spring to late fall. It is also ideal for cold regions, including most of Canada, thanks to its great hardiness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Screening <strong>plants</strong> are an excellent choice for those who want natural, attractive, and low maintenance barriers. Screening <strong>plants</strong> grow swiftly, provide privacy, and elevate the look of a home. Not only do they block out line-of-sight, but they also serve as a windbreak. Many hedges can be used for <strong>screen</strong>ing, but there are also <strong>screen</strong>ing <strong>plants</strong> that are particularly fast-growing and dense. Here are 15 of the best hedges recommended by us – Harwood’s Garden Supplies - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Where space is not a problem a mixed <strong>screen</strong> of some depth can be planted. For example, silver birches (Betula Pendula) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) interplanted in two rows 4.5m (15ft) apart can be very effective especially when underplanted with cotoneasters, viburnums and poplars which can be removed as the <strong>screen</strong> develops. A more formal approach might include Catalpa bignonioides &lsquo;Aurea&rsquo;, Davidia involucrata, Fagus sylvatica &lsquo;Fastigiata&rsquo;, Quercus rubra, Prunus padus or Sorbus aria &lsquo;Lutescens&rsquo;. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re looking for a <strong>screen</strong> with needle leaves rather than broad leaves, the Cypress is a good choice. Cypress is better in hot, humid areas, but it can grow in some areas if well-cared for. It will have bright green leaves for much of the year, though the foliage will drop during the winter months reducing its utility as a privacy block. Cypress grows very quickly and does need to be trimmed regularly to keep it as a <strong>screen</strong>, but that also means it will become a <strong>screen</strong> quite fast. Check out our guide How to Select, Grow and Care for Your Conifers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A useful way of using large shrubs as tree substitutes is to clear the lower branches as they grow so that the space underneath is maximised and <strong>plants</strong> below receive adequate light. This is especially effective as a means of continuing <strong>screen</strong>ing above a 1.8m (6ft) standard boundary fences. The canopy then branches out above the fence. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>People’s taste in the architectural aesthetic of houses has changed over the last 10 years, and so have the <strong>plants</strong> that accompany these homes. Plants need not only suit the style of the home, they need to complement it too, and that’s especially important for privacy and <strong>screen</strong>ing <strong>plants</strong> that often form the backdrop of the garden.As my clients have become more design-savvy, so have their requests for more imaginative solutions when using <strong>plants</strong> to create privacy and <strong>screen</strong>ing. Screening <strong>plants</strong> are not only just about privacy from neighbours though – they also serve as a windbreak, protection from the sun, or are simply a way to block an unsightly aspect . Below are my top tips for creating <strong>screen</strong>ing and privacy for your contemporary home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A hardy plant that is often seen in the wild, what the Bottle Brush somewhat lacks for in appearance, it makes up through sheer hardiness. Bottle Brush can look a little unkempt if not trimmed and pruned regularly, but it’s desirable because it can live in almost any conditions, and because it produces an excellent, dense <strong>screen</strong>. Bottle Brush can grow up to ten meters high; an impressive height that is suitable to virtually any home. Check out our guide How to Select, Grow and Care for Your Bottlebrush. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>These are easy-care <strong>plants</strong>, which thrive in light shade. Cut back the flowered stems by a third in late summer, and then tidy up again in late winter. Try ‘American Beauty’ a hardy, semi-evergreen, for its gold and rose scented flowers and fast-growing habit (ultimate height is 5m). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Opt for taller varieties with feathery plumes and bleachy colours. Although they are perennials and die off during the winter, the fronds can be retained until February when they need to be cut back. This means that you get the <strong>screen</strong>ing effect almost year-round. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This tree has stunning, dark green leaves and large white flowers that appear in the spring with some continued blooms in summer. Eventually, the flowers will produce fruiting clusters come early autumn. Unlike most other Magnolias, this variety is also evergreen making it even better for <strong>screen</strong>ing as it provides cover all year round. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dogwood, both a tree and a shrub, is known for its stunning bracts of white or pink flowers and the minimal care requirements, it is also equally popular for the bright stems in winter, as pictured above. When you use Dogwood in your garden as part of your <strong>screen</strong>ing, you can choose from many types, including single-trunked trees to small shrubs. The most common include the flowering dogwood, Pagoda dogwood and the Cornelian cherry dogwood. These all prefer partial shade but if you water them well they will thrive in full sun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This bamboo provides thick foliage, needs partial shade, and will survive under the most severe of conditions to which bamboo can be exposed. You can trim 20% of the leaning canes every June and watch as the plant comes back upright and new the following year. It also works well when planted in larger pots as <strong>screen</strong>ing too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Flame Amur Maple is a <strong>screen</strong>ing tree that can grow in virtually any zone. Its colours range from beautiful deep greens to red, orange, and yellow, making them great for those who want to be able to watch the leaves change colours. This is one of the fastest-growing <strong>plants</strong> for privacy <strong>screen</strong>s, and additionally, it can grow in most circumstances—it’s even drought tolerant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Known as the umbrella bamboo for its shape and design, this variety reaches an average height of 4 metres and provides tightly grown groups of bamboo stems thanks to its clumping method of spreading. It should be spaced about 1.5 metres apart when grown for <strong>screen</strong>ing, but rest assured it will quickly spread in and fill the spaces you have in between. In fact, with its growth habit, you will find hundreds of canes growing out of even the smallest region. It typically circumvents the issue of the V shape other bamboo <strong>plants</strong> commonly produce which is why it offers more of an upright habit that is perfect for creating <strong>screen</strong>ing compared to other varieties. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Clever use of <strong>screen</strong>ing <strong>plants</strong> can also create privacy in an overlooked space. Another benefit is that they add interest to a small plot when they can be used to create interconnected spaces. A bland square or plain rectangular space could be divided by a row of grasses. A trellis fence makes an inexpensive feature when it is situated halfway across the garden and smothered with roses or clematis. This partial <strong>screen</strong>ing creates an inviting glimpse into the area beyond, tricking the eye into thinking that the garden is larger than it really is. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are dozens of popular <strong>screen</strong>ing <strong>plants</strong> out there, depending on what you want. Some of them flower, and some don’t. Some are so dense they can be shaped into topiary, and others are quite a bit more delicate. The <strong>screen</strong>ing <strong>plants</strong> on this list are fast-growing, which means you’ll have the landscape feature that you want very quickly. However, the caveat is that they will also require more maintenance once fully grown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The plant you choose depends on the reason for the <strong>screen</strong>. A semi-transparent row of planting might work in some spaces to break up a harsh boundary, but complete concealment might be preferable if you&rsquo;re looking to cover up unattractive garden fence ideas, for example. Our advice will help you find the best solution for your space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the best ways to provide your garden with division and privacy is to use tall <strong>plants</strong> to create <strong>screen</strong>ing. Fast-growing <strong>screen</strong>ing <strong>plants</strong> help you to add height to your garden, grow alongside an existing fence and further prevent intruders, and of course, give you much needed privacy which is probably the most common reason for planting <strong>plants</strong> for <strong>screen</strong>ing. There are so many tall <strong>plants</strong> that you can use for <strong>screen</strong>ing that will grow very quickly, fill up whatever space you have, and can be interspersed amongst one another to add variety and colour to your garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Shady sites can be challenging, but consider the evergreens Prunus laurocerasus, Ilex aquifolium or Taxus baccata. These can be planted as a dense hedge or as an extensive <strong>screen</strong> that will tolerate hard pruning. Where there is more sun, consider Elaeagnus Ã ebbingei or E. pungens for <strong>screen</strong>s up to 4m (13ft). These also tolerate hard pruning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Lavender is excellent for growing in drought or dry conditions, as it just needs watering regularly until it gets established. Trim the spent flowers back every summer so the bush can put on a bit of growth before winter. As you might know if you&rsquo;ve read our guide on how to grow lavender, the <strong>plants</strong> may need replacing every 5-10 years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fantastic service and communication, excellent quality and fast delivery!!!! I ended up buying 14 hedges (Lilly Pilly - Superior Select) in total on a Wednesday afternoon and they were delivered to my door Friday morning the same week. The quality/condition of the hedges is amazing - One very happy customer !! I googled &lsquo;hedges and <strong>screen</strong>ing&rsquo; on the sunshine coast and this was the first place that came up. Having no idea about anything to do with <strong>plants</strong> or hedges i decided to call up instead and see if i could see the hedges in person prior to buying online. I spoke to Jeff on the phone who was amazing and so helpful and that afternoon i was able to see the hedges and also chat to Jeff who showed me in detail the different types and gave instructions on how to keep them alive. Thanks Jeff! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This broadleaf evergreen shrub can reach a height of up to 4 metres and a spread between 3 and 4 metres. It produces white flowers that are showy and fragrant during the early spring, so if you prefer <strong>screen</strong>ing that is aromatic too, this is a great option to include. It grows well in medium moist, well-drained soil and prefers anywhere between partial shade and full sun. It can be grown in areas of full shade, however, you won’t get the same floriferous qualities. After you see the red growth start to fade in spring, you can prune it to thin it out and offer better air circulation, especially in the winter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A popular hedge in Europe, the European Beech has looser, larger leaves than the boxwood, but they’re nevertheless quite dense. These hedges won’t drop their leaves until late winter, if ever, and often have copper-coloured leaves through most of the season. These <strong>plants</strong> can grow to a large size, are easy to maintain, and even have some varieties that have brightly coloured foliage all year. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With a number of fantastic varieties, the Pittosporum is a common addition to many gardens. There are Silver Sheen, Green Pillar, James Stirling, and Tasman Ruffles Pittosporum varieties, ranging in their leaf size, colour, and many other attributes. Thus, you can probably find a Pittosporum to suit any look that you want. This hedge can grow up to five meters tall, making it the perfect option for a <strong>screen</strong>ing hedge. Check out our Guide to Choosing, Planting and Caring for Pittosporums. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Apart from hedges and bushes, like those above, many also consider climbing <strong>plants</strong> for their <strong>screen</strong>s. When used for <strong>screen</strong>s, climbing <strong>plants</strong> need to have some form of lattice or fencing already in place. Roses are one of the most popular options: climbing roses can be used throughout a garden for both the attractiveness of their flowers and to produce a privacy <strong>screen</strong>. Check out our guide on Pruning, Selecting and Caring for Roses. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This variety of magnolia is considered one of the hardiest, especially for severe winter weather. It is a tree and it will reach heights upwards of 25 metres and a spread between 10 metres and 15 metres but it does well in large pots too. You can use these to create <strong>screen</strong>ing across larger properties, particularly along the perimeter of your property and they look amazing in flower. It does well in full sun or partial shade and medium watering. The tree is best known for its flowers which are fragrant and showy, blooming white between May and June. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Miscanthus sinensis cultivars such as the 2m (6Â½ft) tall M. sinensis âSilberspinneâ and the 1.5m (5ft ) M. sinensis âMorning Lightâ make an informal <strong>screen</strong> for summer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>‘Pinpoint’ blue false cypress will <strong>screen</strong> your garden’s privacy with its dense foliage, and tall but narrow needle shape. In fact, with its slender conical habit and impenetrable bluish green leaves, this shrub can reach 20 feet tall (6.0 meters) but it will only take up a maximum of 5 feet (1.5 meters) of your soil. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The experts at Squires recommend Phyllostachys Aurea, or golden bamboo, as one of their top <strong>screen</strong>ing <strong>plants</strong>, explaining that: &lsquo;it has a wonderfully vibrant golden stem with evergreen foliage. At first the stems start green, then they mature to a bright golden yellow.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can plant this anywhere you need a <strong>screen</strong>, and it works well as part of an erosion control plan. It will grow in a rounded shape to approximately 3-4 metres in height and spread. Very easy to cultivate, the only real issues you need to be aware of include spider mites and fungal leaf spot but this isn’t a problem for most people. Finally, you can also get variegated varieties too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another trend is toward reduced lawns, and a WA native that can replace a lawn is Grevillea nudiflora which forms a lovely green carpet and has bird attracting flowers. For a <strong>screen</strong>ing in the garden one to look out for is Melaleuca nesophila &lsquo;Narrow Nessy&rsquo;. It grows to 4 metres high by a metre wide, has dense foliage, is shade tolerant and also produces pink flowers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A shrub with a lovely citrus scent, the Orange Blossom is a sophisticated choice for a fragrant garden. Orange Blossom has lovely, glossy, deep green foliage, and will set with bright white flowers. At three meters high, it’s one of the smaller types of <strong>screen</strong>ing <strong>plants</strong> and is good for small to mid-sized gardens, or breaks within the same garden (to delineate spaces). Check out our guide How to Grow and Care for Your Mexican Orange Blossom. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Holly is a favorite for people who really want their neighbors to stay out of their yard.

Most people aren’t going to want to get close to the Holly, which can certainly help in terms of privacy. Check out our guide to Selecting, Planting and Caring for Holly Hedges. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Hornbeam can change from green to yellow to brown during a season and will remain leaved through most of the winter months, providing continual privacy throughout the year. This is another exceptionally popular, fast-growing <strong>screen</strong>ing plant. It’s consistent, reliable, and attractive, and will hold a shape very well with minimal maintenance. Check out our guide How to Select, Grow and Care for Your Hornbeam. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Privacy in overlooked gardens can be achieved by introducing wood or metal arbors, a gazebo or even some simple garden arch ideas where <strong>screen</strong>ing <strong>plants</strong> can scramble thickly overhead. These features are readily available online or at garden centers. Then it’s just a matter of choosing a fast growing <strong>screen</strong>ing plant to grow over them and you could be looking at some much-needed seclusion in just one to two years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>, but really excels as a hedge or dense <strong>screen</strong> around the pool or courtyard areas. It grows best in full sun but also performs well in part shade conditions. It prefers well-drained soil, and has proven to be frost tolerant once it is established. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/b8/00/07/b800077414f2e5f1811d559f553ae187.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Screen Plants For Narrow Spaces - Tall Narrow Shrubs For Screening Australia">
