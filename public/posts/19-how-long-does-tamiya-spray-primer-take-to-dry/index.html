You guys do have great paint jobs ! And I see the Zero paints + 2K clear give unmatched results !!! - Source: Internet Niw the problem is I live in Finland, and I spray on my balcony, and days where it’s around 20C and low humidity are over. Nowadays it’s rarely above 15C and humidity seems to be at 75-80%, and it’s gonna get colder of course. I have painted in the past even when it was down to -10C. Thing to know of course is that I’m just out to paint then I rush back indoors where my box is and where I put my parts that I paint and where they’ll dry. Unfortunately I don’t see any other possibility for me. - Source: Internet A : MMP paint does not like alcohol or ammonia. Alcohol and Ammonia will strip the paint. If you need to clean dried over spray or spills off your work surface Windex will remove it. - Source: Internet Tamiya spray paints are not acrylic, but most can be used with acrylic paints. Tamiya spray paints are split into three main categories all with the modeller in mind. These are TS Spray Paints, AS Spray Paints, and PS Spray Paints. All Tamiya spray paints are perfect for painting larger areas with a single colour. - Source: Internet For a more controlled application the paint can be decanted into a container and then used through an airbrush. This is done by taping a plastic drinking straw over the nozzle of the can and spraying the contents into the container. The paint should then be left for 30 minutes to allow all the propellant gas to evaporate. - Source: Internet There are a lot of variables when using paint or airbrushing. We wish we could answer each and every question or trouble shoot every variable. We cant. This applies to any brand of paint. We have no control over the condition of a users airbrush, spraying environment, storage, temperate, elevation, application technique, skill level, experience etc.. - Source: Internet Be Methodical. Take your time. Think twice, spray once. Chrome needs to be built up in light layers. As you shoot you will see the transformation. - Source: Internet I also use TS lacquers for certain projects but I don’t understand all the mist coats, waiting, more mist coats, further waiting, first wet coat etc. I just spray (over prepared Tamiya primer) one tack coat, 5-10 mins to tack off, then 2-3 wet coats with 5 mins flash off in between. Bake in the Mr Dry Booth for 60 mins followed by overnight drying, polish the next day. - Source: Internet POLY BOTTOM LINE : Poly will add increased durability and adhesion properties, due to the nature of poly it will finish with a slight eggshell finish. We add it to every thing we spray. There is nothing complex about it. Again poly will seal the paint and dries from the inside out thus creating a hard shell automotive grade finish. Yes the paint can be sanded and yes the paint can be weathered and all chipping tech can be performed with or without poly added to the paint. - Source: Internet Thick primer coats will take longer to dry. So, coat the primer with a sprayer. A primer is best applied with a sprayer, which results in a thinner layer than brushing or rolling it. The primer should dry the same amount of time as paint if applied more than once. - Source: Internet The MMP Chrome system works best on smaller detail parts (wheels, trim, exhaust, etc.). We also know that many modelers would like a chrome or bright finish on larger sections and “flat” panels such as on car bodies, aircraft, and Sci-Fi models. Using the appropriate technique, MMP Chrome can be used on such pieces but as with many airbrushing and painting techniques, practice will be rewarded with superior results. Please also note that our chrome can be sprayed over any base color . - Source: Internet Apply a very fine mist of hairspray as your barrier coat. If you add to much hairspray you will create a slippery surface underneath your top coat and remove too much paint too fast with minimal control once the hairspray re-activates. The best practice is to weather over a flat or semi gloss coat. - Source: Internet Helpful tip: I usually strain all the primers and paints that pass through my spray gun. Even though it is an extra step, I truly want to ensure there is nothing in my paint or primer before it is sprayed.’ - Source: Internet And YES I got my hand on the holy grail a.k.a Tamiya white spray primer. I wonder if I should use it through the airbrush to waste a minimum of it, or I guess I could simply get later some Gunze Mr white base, but does it have micro filling properties like a “nomal” grey primer ? - Source: Internet Transparent dust. Lightly spray on slightly heavier towards the bottom of the model and feather as you go up. You can also thin the Transparent dust for different effects or washes. - Source: Internet Spraypainting means working with airborne particulates and solvents, both of which pose health hazards. Remember to use a NIOSH approved respirator and work in a well ventilated workspace. While painting, wear nitrile gloves to avoid spraying paint on your hands and and also protect your model from fingerprints. - Source: Internet B: When applying from the airbrush spray in thin even coats. Overlapping each spray pass. Build up the coats until you have a gloss finish allow to air dry or under UV light , wall heater or naturally air dry. - Source: Internet We have shot paint in 105 degree weather and 90% humidity with no issues. If you are spraying in these extreme temps add a little poly to your paint for good measure. - Source: Internet DO NOT spray primer in dry coats. Light wet coats are the way to go. Dry coats will lead to adhesion issues. Remember light wet coats. A light wet coat means that the primer looks shiny or “wet” on the surface but not so heavy that it runs. - Source: Internet Here are some recommendations for locating information about how long does tamiya spray primer take to dry to get you started:\r- Research Recommended drying time for Tamiya TS spray paints-related information from credible sources.
