Opt for a grey base for the walls and accent with brown window treatments, accessories with black finishes for an organic, elegant space. You can also introduce vibrant reds or crisp whites to balance out the energy in the room. - Source: Internet ‘There was a riot of color in the room from the art to the rug so the sofa, due to its size, needed to be a neutral grey. We opted for a sofa with a soft, rounded shape to it so that the children felt that they could play all around it and that it didn’t feel too imposing in the room.’ - Source: Internet One thing I’ve realized lately is that I’m totally in love with a grey color scheme. I’m sure this is probably because my house is basically tan everywhere you turn and I’m just over it and like to make things difficult for myself. I actually think that’s part of the reason why I wanted to try to sell our new couches a couple of months ago (which we never sold, by the way). - Source: Internet Using neutral tone colors such as beige for the wall paint behind the gray couch can help create a soft and welcoming living room. The beige color will go beyond white, yet feel sweeter than the typical tan. This color also can help the living room feel brighter as it creates sunny and warming effects. - Source: Internet – If you want to create a soothing vibe, try combining gray with a neutral color palette of white and off-white shades, beiges, tans, blacks, and browns. These are colors that go well with gray of all shades, both lighter shades and darker shades. Also, if you want to create a more monochromatic look, don’t forget that you can also pair gray with other gray shades. If you use multiple tones of gray together, you can still create depth and nuance. Pink – Blush pink and gray have been a winning combination in the current era, but there are also shades of darker pink that add warmth and depth to gray tones. - Source: Internet ‘The pinks warm timbers I have paired with this sofa tend to work well. Grey can often work as a particularly good canvas for other pops of stronger color without making a scheme feel overwhelming. I also like to combine mustard colors and blue tones with grey.’ - Source: Internet Olive green and sage green are very similar. Using these colors, you can enhance your grey couch or living room set with an earthy feel similar to brown. At the same time, using trim that is colored with light or dark browns can help give a very nice feel. - Source: Internet With a charcoal accent wall to create moody contrast in this living room, the grey accents seem a natural choice. We love the shimmering faux hide rug, which adds an attractive shape and texture to the space without demanding attention. The grey aesthetic continues with the accent chair and throw pillow arrangement on the couch. In addition, earthy shades of tan and beige go well with grey, adding visual warmth to make the area more inviting. - Source: Internet Where do you begin when you design your living room? A good place to start is with the sofa. Choose one you love and create your room around it. In this new series, we share ideas on how to design your living space around some popular sofa styles.

Select any of paint color themes such as monochromatic, analogous, complementary, triad, split-complementary, warm, cool or neutral colors. You can apply paint colors that will highlight your living room color design.

These sorts of textures add instant impact and drama to a room and the range of designs and fabrics are endless, it’s a real way to bring some fun into a scheme.’ - Source: Internet And if you want to keep everything neutral, that’s where texture comes in. Layering up different fabrics in the form of cushions and throws can create just as much interest as bringing in a rainbow of color. Mix together beiges, creams, and whites in linen, boucle, velvet, any materials that have a tactile quality. - Source: Internet ‘We worked with neutral shades, whites and finely textured natural fibers which give depth and tone in the absence of stronger colors or patterns. The sharp tailored feel of this grey Donghia living room sectional sofa allowed us to introduce the comfort of an l-shape sofa into a smaller living room, we chose a warm but light grey Rubelli fabric in this instance to avoid overwhelming the space and to create a feeling of calm spaciousness.’ - Source: Internet ‘Whilst grey isn’t a groundbreaking tone for furnishings, it will never go out of style if it works with the architecture of a space. As the living area was sunken and floors were a creamy polished concrete, we opted for a neutral fabric to feel tonal and complimentary, and wrapped it in an earthy walnut veneer.’ - Source: Internet Boucle is still going strong in the world of interior design trends and this lovely tactile fabric can give a grey sofa more interest, adding subtle texture and extra comfort. It’s also a super durable fabric so a practical choice too.
