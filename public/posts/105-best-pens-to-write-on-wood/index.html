If you choose a water-based pen to paint on wood, you will find that it has a thin texture and is quickly absorbed by the wood. Oil-based paint markers for wood, on the other hand, are denser and resist rubbing and staining, but these characteristics make the paint marker for wood more challenging to use. - Source: Internet One thing we dislike about these pens for wood signs is that you need to close the cap after some time and give it a shake to allow the ink to become a thicker texture. It may dry up if you keep it open for a while. This is just a nuisance when working on big projects. With all that said, we find the overall design of the markers pleasant to use. They are not as thick and bulky as other markers, making it convenient to work on bigger projects. - Source: Internet The points are subtle, but they cover nicely. You can shade using these pens with no issues. The nylon tips also last a long time. But they are prone to getting a little sticky on rough surfaces like canvas or uneven wood.

Some wooden pens have a protective resin or lacquer finish, which prevents staining and creates a smooth surface. Some wooden pens are highly polished but unfinished, and some pens are unfinished with a somewhat rougher surface texture. - Source: Internet The answer all depends on the pen you are using – Are you using a traditional marker or a paint pen? Traditional markers are likely to bleed into the wood. Certain types of wood may also cause the paint to bleed, even if you have the best quality paint pen available.

Before use: Face tip upright, push against the finger. Recap and shake. Press tip for surface several times - Source: Internet You will begin by activating the pen, which means that you need to allow the paint to flow to the tip before you can paint, as otherwise, the tip will be dry. The majority of pens can be activated by pressing the tip down, initially pressing it with your finger, which allows any air to escape, and then against a piece of paper or another flat surface to allow the paint to flow. The tip needs to be pressed down until you see the paint spread onto the paper.

The whorls of wood grain create distinctive designs, and different types of wood offer different styles. For example, the grain of maple resembles pale ribbons that glimmer when they catch the light, while blackwood is a sleek, dark wood with more uniform color. Different woods range in color from pale to dark, and the patterns of their grain may be subtle or dramatic, but all create beautiful, lively pens. - Source: Internet The consistency of the paint is thick but smooth. As it is oil-based, it will not wash out easily. In addition, it sets fast, so each stroke is accurate and will not make streaky marks. That can occur if you use a normal pen.
