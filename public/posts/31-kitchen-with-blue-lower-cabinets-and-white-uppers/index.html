Can you tell us when or if this is ever a good idea? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Custom-made <strong>cabinets</strong> with a bright blue finish and a bar with smoked mirror panels are displayed at the restaurant. The floors are made of honed Thassos marble and an Atlantic Blue marble color.

The stove in this cooking space is also one of the abode&rsquo;s original features. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>He does this by using color on the ceiling. “If you’re going with two-tones, the ceiling could be the same exact or another shade of the upper <strong>cabinets</strong> if it’s neutral. This changes the way the room feels. And if there’s crown molding, I recommend doing the crown molding in half the color’s value, or 50-percent lighter. The effect appears to drape color down from the ceiling to the molding to the <strong>cabinets</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grey, white, and natural-wood <strong>cabinets</strong> are still in style and probably won’t go anywhere anytime soon.
