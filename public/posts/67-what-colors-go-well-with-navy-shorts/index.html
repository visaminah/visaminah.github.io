However, maybe he was wrong! Green can be one of the most beautiful <strong>colors</strong> in your closet. In this article you’ll find how to wear green as well as what <strong>colors</strong> work well with your green outfits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For a casual look, consider pairing a purple t-shirt with navy <strong>shorts</strong> — these items play nicely together.

Remember, <strong>shorts</strong> are a vital summer piece and if they’re worn appropriately, they will give you that extra wow factor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><strong>shorts</strong> are the most common. No patterns mean that you can afford to get a more aggressive pattern on your chosen shirt, or even opt for busier shoes like tassel loafers. Stripes are sold in a wide range of sizes and color combinations. Seersucker weaves traditionally come with thin, alternating stripes known by different names depending on the time period and occupation of the wearer. In the old west, for example, a navy blue striped seersucker was called Hickory Stripe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to how to wear red <strong>shorts</strong> however, we should happily dismiss patterned <strong>shorts</strong> otherwise it will be difficult to find anything that matches. Even though <strong>shorts</strong> are casual wear, you need to make sure they’re suitable for the event or activity you’re planning to attend. For example, formal <strong>shorts</strong> won’t do for the beach, and denim wouldn’t be appropriate at a more formal occasion such as a garden party. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>are loosely cut with large pockets on either side. They don&rsquo;t look well on most men due to the bulging appearance of the pockets.

The style takes its name from its home city in India – now named Chennai. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your wardrobe is built on a foundation of neutrals like mine is, chances are you have plenty of navy pieces stocked in your closet. After all, beyond black and white, navy blue is one of the most versatile shades you can wear. While it’s a foolproof classic worn on its own, it also complements an array of <strong>colors</strong>. So what are the <strong>colors</strong> to go best with navy blue? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fashion insiders have shown us a range of <strong>colors</strong> that work. From head-to-toe navy for a monochrome look to a subtle pop of burgundy to unexpected <strong>colors</strong> like electric green, their stylish looks prove exactly how to pull off an outfit with navy blue. Some of these I’ve tried out before, but others are inspiring me to try some new color pairings. Ahead, see 11 chic ways the fashion set wears navy blue and shop pieces inspired by their looks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We all love denim and the most common blue <strong>shorts</strong> we all possess is one that is made of denim. We have all pretty much at some point in our lives made our own <strong>shorts</strong> by cutting off our old denim jeans. However, not everyone styled them right. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With all of that ahead, I guess it was high time we got into what all can be created using different patterns. This cool breezy look can be created with the help of a pastel blue and white striped t-shirt. You can pair it with light blue denim <strong>shorts</strong> that end above the knee and have fringes on the rims. Complete the look with a pair of casual white shoes and round-framed black sunglasses. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Start by pairing your mid-blue washed denim <strong>shorts</strong> with a pair of regular-sized navy blue polo. Now, this is a look that can be used as casual wear for a formal setting. For instance, when you go out with your colleagues which it’s not an after-work party but rather an office day outing. Your <strong>shorts</strong> length may vary depending on your office policy, however; if it doesn’t apply you could go with one that ends above the knee. Add on a pair of ankle-length white casual shoes and a square framed, black polarized sunglass - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Men who are 5'7 or below are considered short in the United States. In the image above we see a 5'2 man wearing a 7-inch inseam. Notice how the <strong>shorts</strong> travel precariously past the knees. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The more specific answer depends on the occasion. Go 2-3 above the knee if you are wearing casual <strong>shorts</strong> with a t-shirt, button-down, or polo. This works well with chino <strong>shorts</strong> or khakis. Athletic <strong>shorts</strong> on the other hand can easily end 5-6 inches above the knee. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Any situation requiring business-casual wear will require trousers. Law firms, corporate offices and banks are a few examples where <strong>shorts</strong> should not be worn. Instead, wear chino trousers or dress slacks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A spectrum of <strong>colors</strong>, from white to purple, can go well with blue pants. Furthermore, a sky blue shirt combination with black pants can be a great choice for formal meetings or daily office wears. Whereas, a blue shirt can be paired up with grey, black, khaki, or cream pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Navy blue <strong>shorts</strong> can go with several options depending on how bold your sense of fashion is. You can wear a white shirt or go yellow if you want a bright color. Style is subjective, and it’s up to you to get what you want and find a way to make it work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The advantage of synthetic fabric <strong>shorts</strong> is durability and low cost. They are less breathable though. However, you can find lighter weaves to compensate for this. Polyester is also excellent for repelling moisture and staying dry so maintaining these <strong>shorts</strong> is a breeze. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With temperatures on the rise and an increasing number of outdoor sports screenings, beer festivals, and gigs filling up your social calendar, it’s time to bring out that classic summer staple – the <strong>shorts</strong>. But since when did <strong>shorts</strong> become the ultimate summer piece? It wasn’t until after World War II that <strong>shorts</strong> started to emerge. Even then, they were still considered to be a boyish garment. Shorts became popular with (as you might expect) particular sports or recreational activities. They were often associated with tennis players, but only during the game. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wear <strong>shorts</strong> that are slightly wider. Opt for straight-legged <strong>shorts</strong>. They&rsquo;ll improve your silhouette and minimize the focus on the waist. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before we dive into the types of clothes to wear and how to wear them, we should look at the sort of <strong>colors</strong> that match red. Now, red is not the most versatile color in the spectrum, and we tend to keep items such as trousers and <strong>shorts</strong> firmly in the neutral category. Neutrals are generally the safe option because they match every color. But it is summer and you want to be more daring, so what goes with red? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>are the most common style of <strong>shorts</strong>. The material lies flat near the zipper for a slim, low-waisted look. Pleated <strong>shorts</strong> feature creases where material is folded and sewn before getting attached to the front of the waistband. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Prints are great but checked shirts are tried and tested, so it should definitely be one of the options in hand. Go for a navy blue and dark olive green checked shirt with a pair of mid-blue denim <strong>shorts</strong>. Keep the checks big for a casual vibe and add on a solid white t-shirt underneath the unbuttoned checked shirt. No all that is left to do is complete the look with a pair of off-white ankle-high canvas shoes and regular-length white socks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A. Blue is considered a basic color in jeans. Therefore you can pair anything with it, from casual tees to a crisp white shirt. A mandarin collar shirt will also look stunning with blue jeans if you have a broad neck and wide shoulders. You can even try several <strong>colors</strong> and styles ranging from white, black, and brown to sneakers and leather boots in shoes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now, you’ve known what color shirt goes with blue <strong>shorts</strong>. Blue is a color that you can pair with many different color combinations. For example, you can wear blue <strong>shorts</strong> with a white, black, green, yellow, beige, or even multi-colored top, and each will blend perfectly. You can also use your imagination and try various <strong>colors</strong> before finally choosing one but do not overthink it; have fun with it. You may also want to read about navy blue <strong>shorts</strong> ideas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This time let us go for a darker hue in blue denim <strong>shorts</strong> and pair it with a solid grey t-shirt. Grey being a neutral color helps soften the look with its presence on top of a dark color. Put on a pair of white sneakers and ankle-high socks to go along with the look while you accessorize with a pair of aviators in black tint and a golden metallic frame. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another summer look can be created by pairing a faded olive green t-shirt and faded mid-blue denim <strong>shorts</strong>. And yes with a color like faded olive green you would want to go for a solid pattern or something with minimal print. Maybe even color block in white so that the two neutrals can balance each other. Anyway, let us get back to finish styling this look with a pair of ankle-high white sneakers and a black baseball cap. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So we’ve looked at red <strong>shorts</strong> and the kinds of tops that match them. But what about shoes? We briefly touched upon shoes just now, but let’s have a look at them in more detail. Again, it all depends on the type of <strong>shorts</strong>. Usually, red jean <strong>shorts</strong> can look amazing for date night, but you will also enjoy a pop of color to your OOTD. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Short <strong>shorts</strong> are cute and sexy! A classic staple in warm summer weather, little <strong>shorts</strong> help keep you cool and show off your pretty gams. Feel comfortable in tiny <strong>shorts</strong> by styling them with fuller coverage tops and/or shoes - this is why short <strong>shorts</strong> look so right with cowboy boots or a long-sleeved peasant top! You’ll wear them all summer long but some short <strong>shorts</strong> are wearable at other times of the year too. In winter, try denim cutoffs with tights (it’s not a no-no) or wear a chic pair in black leather. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wool is a luxury fabric in menswear and is rare in men&rsquo;s <strong>shorts</strong>. It requires upkeep. You have to treat them as you would wool trousers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This changed in World War II. Troops in tropical climates started wearing <strong>shorts</strong> to cope with the heat. They are famously shown in depictions of the British Eighth Army in North Africa from 1940 to 1943, also known as the ‘Desert Rats&rsquo;. The German Afrikakorps, Italian army and Free French forces also wore <strong>shorts</strong> on the battlefield. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is an option that I personally love; a printed shirt with blue denim <strong>shorts</strong>. Now this one might take a little more effort as you would need to understand how to balance the <strong>colors</strong> in the print. So just remember don’t go with socking <strong>colors</strong> such as black with red. However, if you picked a shirt that has its base in navy blue, you could balance it with prints that had <strong>colors</strong> such as light blue and cream yellow. It is all about balancing the <strong>colors</strong> and prints for the occasion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As we’ve already established, you need to be careful about what <strong>colors</strong> you wear with your red <strong>shorts</strong>. However, if you are feeling brave there are a few <strong>colors</strong> and bold statements you could make. Play around with other tones of reds or blues as this could liven up the outfit perfect for the summer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>are designed to facilitate the most freedom of movement during exercise. Most running <strong>shorts</strong> include an inner lining that doubles as underwear. Most are made with polyester. Swimming <strong>shorts</strong> (swimming trunks) – The best men&rsquo;s swim <strong>shorts</strong> are made with nylon along with a mesh inner lining to dry quicker. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For those smart-casual events like a garden party or perhaps a wedding reception, your chino red <strong>shorts</strong> should be teamed up with a pair of formal (ish) shoes. Classic leather sandals in navy, brown, or tan are just the ticket here. If you prefer something a slight bit less summary, a pair of chic loafers or boat shoes will be perfect. These will give your outfit a sharp, refined, smart casual look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>About 90% of all <strong>shorts</strong> are made of cotton, with cotton twill fabric being the most common weave. Twill weaves are dense but durable. The lack of breathability is offset by the <strong>shorts</strong> themselves which let air travel up the legs. What are your other cotton options? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Shorts started as ‘knee pants&rsquo; for boys in the 1890s and served as the basis for school and scout uniforms. Roughhousing and tripping over would mean torn knees if a boy wore full-length trousers. When a boy reached maturity, he was expected to stop wearing <strong>shorts</strong> and transition into wearing trousers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Red dress <strong>shorts</strong> will also go really well with a shirt and blazer. So for those cooler evenings, you can always wear a white buttoned-up Oxford shirt and pair it with a grey blazer. Leather drivers will give you a more sophisticated look. Particularly black ones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pairing jackets and <strong>shorts</strong> can be tough. You don&rsquo;t want to layer up if your goal is to stay cool of course. However, hoodies and athletic jackets can work well if your goal is to run or hit the gym. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue <strong>shorts</strong> paired with a solid white t-shirt adds up for quite the summer color. However, it is so out there that though we may not be able to change the <strong>colors</strong> in this style we could definitely change the way the fabric looks. Let us go for light blue denim <strong>shorts</strong> that have their rims folded and have small rips in patches for a casual look. Complete the look with ankle-high white sneakers and low ankle socks for a clean finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You may wear women’s mid-length <strong>shorts</strong> with various tops, but seldom without tights or leggings. High waist <strong>shorts</strong> are not simply comfy but also fashionable and perfect for women. They are rarely seen in men or males in their natural form. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can also make effective pairings using light jackets. Consider a bomber jacket in suede if your goal is to go about the town. You can even wear a blazer with Bermuda <strong>shorts</strong>. The lighter the color, the better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now I know black may not be the most comfortable summer color however, it is surely a stylish color that goes with almost all the other <strong>colors</strong>. So you just need to use it right and you can do that with the help of the right fabric. Go for a solid black jersey t-shirt; pair it with denim mid-blue slightly ripped <strong>shorts</strong>. Add on a pair of casual white shoes and you may even accessorize with a pair of square frame sunglasses. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So maroon may not be a popular color among men, however, it sure does go well with the right shade of blue. For instance, when a maroon t-shirt with minimal print is paired with worn-out light blue ripped denim <strong>shorts</strong>. And since maroon creates a lot of contrast in this setting; you can mineralize it by wearing a pair of black sneakers with white soles and laces. The white shall provide some softness against all the contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A navy blue <strong>shorts</strong> with a solid white shirt and a light blue denim shirt on top of it is quite a combination. This can be your perfect vacation look when you put on a pair of black gladiators for footwear over sneakers. You could also wear a tan or beige hat to accessorize in a way it complements the gladiators. It doesn’t just look comfortable but it is such a breezy style with that accessible air flow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>came into style during the late 1960s as part of the counter-cultural movement. I do not recommend denim <strong>shorts</strong> as they look sloppy – like you just sheered off your jeans at the knees. Flat-front <strong>shorts</strong> are the most common style of <strong>shorts</strong>. The material lies flat near the zipper for a slim, low-waisted look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As we’ve previously mentioned, red is not the most versatile color so you have to be careful with your choices. If you get the color right, you can wear anything from a buttoned-up Oxford shirt to a loose t-shirt. Polo shirts work well with <strong>shorts</strong> too, especially those in darker <strong>colors</strong>. So let’s have a look at some outfit ideas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Don’t be afraid to try prints. An everyday blue denim pant perfectly complements prints such as stripes and checks dress shirts. Wear different <strong>colors</strong> that match or contrast the dark blue tone of the jeans, and finish the look with dark brown loafers or slip-ons. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><strong>shorts</strong> are commonly found as khakis. It&rsquo;s a timeless, simple color with considerable versatility. Khakis are even the common choice for slightly more formal situations. Gray is a noncolor that matches anything you could muster. You also have your pick of shades ranging from charcoal to light gray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So, what matches red <strong>shorts</strong>? If you’re out and about for a leisurely walk in the park or on the beach, then it’s best to stick to a pair of chino <strong>shorts</strong> and team them up with a short-sleeve shirt or a polo shirt. A white Oxford shirt would work really well too if you want a more formal look when you’re strolling around in a nice park. Tuck it in or leave it out and open the top buttons for a cool look. A light-colored shirt will also complete the look if you are after something more formal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What if your <strong>shorts</strong> are denim? Denim has an urban, street style vibe to them so footwear that’s a little bit sporty will work really well. Plimsolls and canvas trainers (especially Vans) are the easiest options here. Go for a clean white trainer as this will keep the red <strong>shorts</strong> looking smart casual. You can also throw on a funky sweater along with white sneakers to make this look work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>are made with a lightweight fabric and are known for their vivid, brightly-colored patterns. The style takes its name from its home city in India – now named Chennai.

Bermuda <strong>shorts</strong> have been worn with a blazer in certain cultures ever since. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A. With light blue jeans, wear dark color tees, flannels, hoodies, and turtlenecks. And pair light <strong>colors</strong> upper wear with dark color jeans. Usually, light grey, white, and beige color look gorgeous with dark blue jeans so consider them if you have never tried them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Longer <strong>shorts</strong> of cotton, linen, or wool can easily be paired with plain t-shirts or casual button-downs.

It depends on the purpose. One good example is cotton blended with spandex to give you more flexibility. However, blends made for the sake of cost-efficiency are usually poor quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Running <strong>shorts</strong> are designed to facilitate the most freedom of movement during exercise. Most running <strong>shorts</strong> include an inner lining that doubles as underwear. Most are made with polyester. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Avoid elastic waistbands in casual situations. It will pinch around the waist and make a muffin top. Using elastic waistbands with swimming trunks or exercising <strong>shorts</strong>, however, is fine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue ranges from navy all the way to light blue. It&rsquo;s a highly interchangeable color that goes well with the heat. Pairing navy chino <strong>shorts</strong> with a white casual button-down for example is a classic combination. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You also want to take precautions against flaring.

Again, this will make for a ‘skirt effect&rsquo; if ignored. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can keep your outfit dark by wearing a black shirt with your black <strong>shorts</strong> or choosing to lighten things up with a contrasting white top. But the possibilities are endless. Any color shirt will complement black pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Tall men like in the infographic above are taller than 6'1.
