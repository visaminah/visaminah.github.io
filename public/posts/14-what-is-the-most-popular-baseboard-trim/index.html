Costs vary based on the profile and the type of hardwood used. Like pine, these are also prone to warping—don’t forget to check your pieces before purchasing. - Source: Internet Different baseboard profiles offer different thicknesses. While it’s probably not a forethought in your baseboard journey, it’s still important to consider. Not just to be picky—still, by all means, do be picky with your baseboards—but also to complement the trim around your door (called the door casing). - Source: Internet Medium-density fiberboard, also known as MDF, is composed of wood, resin, fibers, and other materials. Since it boasts a more consistent texture than wood, manufacturers can sculpt it into a wide variety of shapes, from simplistic to ornate. Likewise, it’s extremely easy to cut, so it’s an excellent option for DIY baseboard installs in kitchens, living rooms, and bedrooms. - Source: Internet Shoe molding is in the same league as quarter round trim, but with a slightly different shape. Rather than being a perfect quarter of a cylinder, it is still curved but broader. Like quarter round trim, it’s meant to accent and soften the edges of baseboards. - Source: Internet As the name suggests, this baseboard style sports a completely flat profile. It comes in a range of height options, typically falling between 3 and 5 inches tall. The flat shape makes it versatile enough to suit any style of home decor and very easy to clean. - Source: Internet Once you’ve selected the ideal baseboards for your home, you have even more options to dress them up. You can also add heaters to your baseboards to make them next-level functional. Check out these accessories to make your baseboards work for your space. - Source: Internet Pine is another budget-friendly baseboard material that comes either primed or unprimed, giving you free rein to paint or stain. Quality pine is typically free of knots and other blemishes, but its inconsistent texture makes it more difficult to make a straight and splinter-free cut. There’s also a possibility of cracks or warping, so be sure to examine all pieces thoroughly before you buy. Keep in mind that wood materials are not an ideal baseboard material for bathrooms unless you plan to stain it thoroughly to reduce moisture build-up. - Source: Internet If you’re in the mood for something fancier, sculpted baseboard trim is the ideal pick. This baseboard profile features a variety of scalloped or stepped designs on top, moving down to a flat base at the bottom. It offers a wide array of height options, from mid-heights of around 4 to 5 inches to taller heights topping 7 inches or more. - Source: Internet You may know your baseboards as the crevice-creating trim that you always forget to clean . Or you may have never heard the ambiguous-sounding term before. Either way, baseboards are rarely thought about, let alone talked about. - Source: Internet Baseboards also protect drywall from mop water, overturned drinks, and other spills that would otherwise cause moisture damage. They also provide a solid stopping point for dirt and debris. Plus, baseboards provide a functional and attractive cover for hardwood flooring where gaps accommodate natural expansion. - Source: Internet MDF also comes primed and ready to paint, which can be good or bad depending on your plans. This option is ideal for homeowners looking to cut their baseboard costs and planning to paint them anyway. However, homeowners looking to stain their baseboards will have to choose a different material. - Source: Internet Quarter round trim is used in tandem with baseboards. It features a flat back and a front shaped like a perfect quarter-slice of a cylinder. The name “quarter round” derives from “one-quarter of a round dowel.” Its rounded shape sits at the bottom of the baseboard, standing in front of it to visually soften the edges. - Source: Internet Now that you’re a baseboard connoisseur, you have the option to play with color and become a baseboard trendsetter. Matching wood is a standby classic, as is white paint (albeit prone to scuffs and stains). Here are a few unexpected color options to consider. - Source: Internet If you’re wondering what color to paint your baseboards, start by looking at what color you’ll be painting the walls. Then, start looking at tertiary colors or varying tints and shades of the same hue. Of course, this is a jumping-off point—there are no rules in the realm of baseboards (except the one about door casing, of course). Grab some paint strips from your local hardware store and let your creativity run wild. - Source: Internet Following are some suggestions on where to begin your search for data on How To Choose Baseboards:\rYou should try to find what is the most durable baseboard trim-related information from reputable places. Libraries, online resources, and even paid journalists all fall under this category.\rIt’s crucial to be aware of the many electronic media sources available when researching what is the most durable baseboard trim, such as Google and YouTube.
