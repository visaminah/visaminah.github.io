In the fall I love pairing navy with modern beige tones, such as tan and taupe. - Source: Internet Here you can actually see a dark and very rich shade of blue framed by white surfaces but the detail that stands out is actually the vanity. It has a gorgeous mahogany color with a reddish hue and that complements the blue in the sense that they’re both dark color but have different bases altogether. {image from blackknightgroup}. - Source: Internet We mentioned that soft orange looks great with blue. But if you want an unusual and cheerful look for the room you’re designing, tangerine and blue make a great pairing. If you want to temper tangerine’s energy, use dark navy blue. An orange accent wall plus a navy and white striped rug is a great example. - Source: Internet Well, if you need to match your new rug perfectly with your space, be keen to study the colors, light, and patterns in your space.

It may be better if you proceed forward through the article. - Source: Internet While I definitely understand how fear can set in when you’re considering a new sofa for your home, I want to encourage you to make purchases that are unique and true to your style. While yes, navy is a unique color option when it comes to sofas, it is also a fabulous choice and one that you should consider. You can make the room bold and colorful or let the navy sofa set the tone while it accentuates the neutral colors you pair with it. - Source: Internet If you’re creating a room with high-energy, beachy feel, this combination is a great choice. And if you like patterns, you can often find coral and light blue blankets, rugs, or shower curtains. If you find this combination to be a little too high-energy, you can create a room with a mostly navy and white palette and include some coral and light blue accents. - Source: Internet But let’s talk a little about blue and its varieties. We know that everyone sees colours differently. For some this colour is strict and boring, while for others it is relaxing and soothing. The good news is that the power with which it will impress you will be memorable. If you are looking for the dream interior for your living room, the first thing you need to do is determine the style. - Source: Internet If you can’t quite make up your mind between gray and brown, taupe is a great color choice. And as a bonus, many modern homes and apartments use taupe-stained wood for flooring, tabletops, etc. This great neutral base goes well with blue and white wallpaper. Or if you have a kitchen with taupe wood floors, navy blue cabinets are a great way to add a bit of blue. This combination looks great when juxtaposed with white countertops. - Source: Internet If you want a rustic, Southwest-inspired aesthetic, try a palette of warm terra-cotta and cool blue. Some designers recommend pairing dusk blue, a pale near-neutral blue, with terra cotta. But almost any shade of blue will do! - Source: Internet Lights can magically transform any space to make it look bigger and brighter. The addition of symmetric floor or table lamps on either sides of a navy blue couch can elevate the overall look of the area. You can also create interest by opting for a single signature pendant or floor lamp that occupies the awkward corner next to the couch. Select lights that complement the overall design style and theme for pleasing aesthetics. - Source: Internet For another traditional and cozy look try adding a chocolatey brown to your blues. It’s an easy way to dress up or dress down a room that’s needs a sprucing in the family home.{found on georgettewestermaninteriors}. - Source: Internet However, a light blue isn’t the only wall color you can choose besides white. You can pick green, pink, or yellow, depending on the shade of your couch and the tint of the wall paint. Whatever color you choose, you can build the rest of your living room’s color scheme around it. - Source: Internet Pastel yellow is a beautifully light, springlike touch in any room. It’s the color of baby chicks and daffodil petals. It makes a great color for a breakfast nook or sunroom, and it’s a nice lightening touch in a room with navy furniture. For a dining room, try pastel yellow walls with a blue table runner. Just about any blue shade will look nice here. - Source: Internet Cushions are the perfect (perhaps easiest) way to accessorise a blue sofa. From plush velvet to bold prints, a throw cushion can inject an instant boost of colour, comfort and style into your living room. Opt for contrasting colours for a bold statement or try a more subtle look by choosing a cushion of the same shade as your sofa with bright coloured piping. - Source: Internet For a lighter look, even a few lavender accents will add some character to a soft blue room. Start with a lavender-patterned accent pillow or two and then add more lavender accents if needed. One good example is adding soft, sheer lavender curtains to a room with gray walls. - Source: Internet Navy blue is a wonderful choice for a sofa color and decorating around a navy blue sofa can be a challenge to style your own space.. The hue can be treated in a variety of ways to create a somber and intimate or bright and happy environment. Navy blue is likewise a dark hue that requires little maintenance. Because the color is so flexible, it will complement almost any interior design style and color scheme. - Source: Internet Throw pillows and cushions are great accessories to a sofa and make it more warm and inviting. Contrasting colors such as yellow, orange or neutrals can make it look vibrant and attractive. Bring in Hygge by adding a fur throw or blank for a layered look. Experiment with textures for a rather eclectic look to create a Bohemian decor style. - Source: Internet Some people might consider turquoise to be a shade of blue, but many actual turquoise stones are closer to being green. Either way, this shade is one that can be combined with blue for a memorable look. If you like patterned wallpaper, a turquoise and white accent wall can be a great way to add some character to a room. - Source: Internet If you’re going for a calming and classic palette, a combination of blue and chocolate brown just might be the answer. Try a blue and white patterned rug in a room with chocolate brown leather furniture. This look creates a balanced color scheme: the dark brown is a grounding influence, while the lightness of white prevents the overall aesthetic from appearing overly dark. - Source: Internet If you’re looking for a dignified yet non-traditional combination with blue, violet is a great color to choose. And one of the best ways to use this combination is to incorporate a variety of shades ranging from blue to blue-violet. One example is a living room with shades from sky blue to navy blue to deep purple. - Source: Internet Gold makes an especially bold statement against a deep blue somewhere between royal blue and navy. For best results, use this combination sparingly. A gold accent on an otherwise-bare blue wall creates a memorable focal point in any room! But if you want to be subtle, simply add gold hardware on a blue dresser or end table. - Source: Internet Sky blue has a bit of a faded look, as if it’s mixed with a bit of gray. It’s also light but not bright and generally very pleasing to the eyes. It’s a perfect color for a space like the bedroom or the bathroom if you want it to feel calming and relaxing but still look interesting at the same time. Play around with a few other shades of blue for variation or add some gray and white details for contrast. {found on battalionroofing}. - Source: Internet The blue you choose is up to you. Since burnt orange is a lot more muted than bright shades of blue, brighter blues are an option here. Navy or slate blues are also a way to use this combination while still maintaining a relatively calm atmosphere. Burnt orange walls and dark blue appliances can create the perfect balance of creative energy and grounded calm in a kitchen. - Source: Internet Well. According to the rug under couch rules, exactly not. However, to tie the room’s look together, you will want to choose a rug that complements the two or three primary colors of the room. Make sure a solid-color rug complements the color of your sofa and matches the accent colors in the room, like a work of art or pot. - Source: Internet For a striking contrast, pair midnight-blue walls with pieces of terra-cotta pottery placed throughout the room. This look goes well with cool white trim and some greenery. Or for a homey feel, opt for terra-cotta walls with soft blue rugs or furniture. Luckily, both of these shades can be found in abundance in the furniture world, so you’ll have plenty of opportunities to experiment with this exciting combo. - Source: Internet Light wooden shades, be it on the floor or furnishings, look warm and have a unique appeal. For instance, in this spacious and bright bedroom, a light-hued wood-finish floor with its chevron pattern makes for a stylish statement. And as it is paired with a rich navy-blue wall cladding, the room looks interesting and full of personality. Don’t miss how the drapes complement the floor and the pendant lamps jazz up the wall cladding. - Source: Internet Cardinal red can also be used in small doses to balance out a mostly dark room. If you have a kitchen with a good bit of navy (or really any shade of blue), even a red teakettle and a couple of other red appliances can add some brightness. This combination also lends itself to patterns. Try a blue and white rug and a few largely-red wall hangings in a largely-white room to add a dynamic burst of color. - Source: Internet If you’re looking for a way to revitalize a living room, a blue and soft orange color scheme is a great way to do so. And just like most color combinations on the list, you can create a variety of moods with this one depending on the exact shades you use. For an airy, coastal feel, combine sherbet orange with pastel blue. Either one makes a great wall color, and you can even incorporate blue and orange patterned rugs or throws for some high-energy contrast. - Source: Internet In a kitchen, try black tile flooring with a deep blue backsplash and white cabinets and countertops. Or for an old-school look in a moody room, you can even include black-and-blue patterned brocade curtains. You can also go subtle by combining a navy couch with cream-colored walls decorated with black-framed photos or art pieces. - Source: Internet For instance, think about taking a black and white photo near your rug and bed. On a grayscale, you need to change the colors significantly. At the same time, if you choose a multi-color rug, you should match the secondary or tertiary colors to your bed or other large furniture or accessories. This allows for a small change while the items are still flowing together. - Source: Internet When navy-blue colour meets beige, a lot can happen. You can paint your walls with a soft beige colour and add a comfy navy-blue sofa to lend contrast and visual interest. Don’t forget to decorate the sofa with patterned or bright yellow or orange throw pillows. Adding a golden colour lamp next to the sofa will be a classic move. - Source: Internet You can also mix and match navy blue with pastel colors. In addition to the pale pink you can use, navy blue is also a good match for greeny blues, purples, and beige. This color scheme injects some color into the room, but it still keeps the room’s moody look. - Source: Internet For a great combination of cool colors, combine leafy green with blue. You can do this organically with houseplants. Plants look great in a largely-blue room of just about any shade! - Source: Internet If you’re a fan of rich, jewel-tone shades, golden yellow is one that looks great with blue. The shade of blue you choose will make a dramatic difference in any room. Soft blues can work almost like neutrals, so you could make a statement with golden-yellow furniture or a bedspread against a backdrop of soft blue walls. - Source: Internet If you like beige but want something a touch more glitzy, champagne is an excellent choice. Champagne upholstered furniture adds an elegant touch to a mostly-blue palette. One nice yet subtle example is including champagne-framed mirrors or pictures in a room with blue and white patterned wallpaper. - Source: Internet Mustard is a strong color, so one option is to place a mustard yellow couch or chair in a room with soft blue walls. Alternatively, for a cool contrast, place the mustard couch in front of a deep blue accent wall. Couches aren’t your only option here, though. Even a simple mustard-yellow lampshade or two can add some subtle warm energy to a room with a lot of blue. - Source: Internet Emerald green is a beautiful, intense green with plenty of blue undertones. So of course, it goes well with a range of blue shades. For a bolder look, combine emerald green with jewel-tone blues. Alternatively, navy blue’s near-neutral quality makes it a good choice if you want emerald to be the focal point of a room. - Source: Internet No matter the theme or color your decide to accent it with, blue will always work. But that doesn’t mean you can’t go with the best options. Take a peek at 31 of the best colors to pair with blue and see if one strikes a fancy with you! - Source: Internet If you like to create rooms with interesting or unusual features, rooms with dark blue walls can create a striking contrast with a pastel pink chair. Alternatively, pink and blue paisley wallpaper can help you create a beautifully unique accent wall. Pastel pink is also great to pair with both blue and sage green, as the combined cool influence of sage and blue can keep this airy shade of pink grounded. This article offers inspiration for designing with various pastel shades. - Source: Internet Seafoam green also looks great in a room with darker hues. Sheer seafoam curtains look striking against marine-blue walls. This color combination is one that also really lends itself to patterns. A seafoam and blue patterned rug looks especially nice in a largely-white room. You can even add hints of sand or beige for a truly seaside-inspired aesthetic! - Source: Internet Navy blue and dark blue nuances in general look particularly beautiful and elegant when they’re complemented by brass accents. You can see here a very stylish bathroom which takes advantage of this combination. The antique brass details are just what it needs to stand out. {found on hartandlock}. - Source: Internet Sage green is quite a trendy color in design. Its grayish, almost silvery undertone means it’s a great option for pairing with cool colors. Sage looks great with blue, particularly almost-neutral shades like slate blue or navy. Sage is a great color for walls, accessories, pillows, and more. - Source: Internet Brown is a great complement to navy blue, but it’s crucial to balance the two. Therefore, choosing lighter shades of brown when pairing it with navy blue is your best bet. Use lighter brown shades like caramel or tan instead of deeper ones. - Source: Internet A glint of warm metal will highlight a rich, navy sofa, especially one with velvet upholstery. Since metals are considered neutral, they can be worked into any colour scheme and are perfect for decorating around a navy blue sofa. Gold, brass and copper may also feature in Art Deco side tables, an opulent chandelier, vases and cushions. - Source: Internet As an interior designer, I know that convenience and comfort are leading in interior design. And since our focus is navy blue sofa, I will give you some valuable tips on how to combine it with the rest of the interior. And when we talk about the living room, the sofa is the main furniture that everyone dreams of. Find the perfect pieces like velvet sofas or leather sofas, for example, can be a difficult task. - Source: Internet As we’ve seen so far, blue almost always looks good with various shades of brown. And mahogany is a highly dignified shade of brown. The easiest way to integrate it with blue is to incorporate mahogany-stained wood furniture (or even darker-stained wood flooring). Most designers recommend using bolder blues in this context, so navy, marine blue, or even slate blue are all great options. - Source: Internet Although orange and blue are contrasting colours, they work incredibly well together to bring a warm and vibrant lift to a room. One might consider pairing a navy sofa with a bold, tangerine footstool, or a scattering of orange cushions. However, it’s important to balance orange accents with other shades of blue, grey, black and white. - Source: Internet When paired with black or other dark colors, navy blue and similar shades can look quite sophisticated. A décor like this stands out and has depth even though the colors are fairly similar in intensity. Add a few bright touches of color for effect if you want to. - Source: Internet If you prefer largely-neutral palettes, you can sprinkle in a few blue accents when you have a room with champagne furniture and walls. A couple of blue vases, bowls, and throw pillows are often enough. This is also a combination that works well in bathrooms: try soft blue walls (or tile floors) with champagne-colored hardware. - Source: Internet You can find this color in many Persian-style rugs. Even something as simple as adding one of these rugs to a room with blue couches can do wonders. Or if you want something more subtle, go for an eclectic mix of cranberry red and blue vases and/or bowls in a largely neutral space. - Source: Internet As mentioned before, blue goes really well with white because they balance each other out and create a very fresh and clean décor. Similarly, you can pair blue with light gray. The effect would be similar but the contrast would be a bit smoother and less striking from a visual standpoint. {found on langskitchens}. - Source: Internet Black and blue might sound like a strange, bruise-like, and overly dark combination. But the key to success with these colors is to incorporate enough white to balance them out. A living room with navy blue walls, crisp white mantle and wall trim, and a black and white patterned couch or rug creates a unique yet balanced look. - Source: Internet Navy blue is one of those colors that works nicely in just about any setting, whether it be a home office, library, bedroom, or bathroom. It is your best option to avoid using the common neutral colors in your room. However, to improve the overall appearance of your room, you must combine this rich color with other colors because it cannot be used on its own. - Source: Internet Pink and blue might evoke memories of baby showers. But when combined carefully, they can make a lovely palette in any room. Try cornflower-blue couches with a few pink vases, bowls, or accent pillows in a living room. A bedroom with soft blue walls can also look nice with a soft pink bedspread. - Source: Internet If blue is the main theme in your living room, try making your couch the lightest shade. A light blue couch will not only stand out, but it’ll also be a more inviting space amongst the darker tones. Blue living rooms are soothing places because blue tends to be a very calming color. - Source: Internet A solid navy blue sofa may seem too bulky for a living space because of its darker shade. You can well balance it out with a clear glass coffee table with a sleek, slender bottom. It will make the area not only look elegant, but also add some glam to the space. Small glass or crystal decor elements complementing the coffee table can add to the overall look. - Source: Internet You can also create this aesthetic using wooden floors and furniture. Wood with a dark, chocolate stain forms a beautiful pairing with any shade of blue. But to balance out the darkness, always make sure to include a lighter color like white or off-white to create balance. - Source: Internet A blue couch in your living room doesn’t have to be the object of focus. If you like the color but don’t want to make it into a statement, try a smaller-sized couch. Small blue couches can be just as expressive as large ones, without taking up too much attention. - Source: Internet It depends on the room and the atmosphere you’re going for. A blue couch can give a room a nautical or seaside feel, which can be great for a summer house or beach house. It can also be a beautiful accent color in a room with neutral walls and floors. - Source: Internet Neutral colors like beige but also other variations such as ivory or various shades of grey are generally very versatile. They can be used as complementary colors for darker nuances like blue for instance. The beige here helps to tone down the dark blue walls and to make this living room seem brighter.{found on anniesantullidesigns}. - Source: Internet Beige and blue is a classic pairing, and this palette evokes the image of the seashore, especially when you mix in some white. And if you’d rather not track down hard-to-find furniture for your project, this combination is a great choice. Warm beige is a common color, especially for living room furniture. Try combining warm beige couches and chairs with sky blue and white pillows and rugs. - Source: Internet A living room that is laid back with a neutral color palette, feel free to use your navy blue sofa as the highlight element that pops out catching attention. Opt for warm whites for decor styling in case you decide to go for such a design approach. Alternatively, you can also use wall trimming to frame large pieces of artwork, or use wallpaper to create a backdrop for your navy blue sofa. - Source: Internet You can also juxtapose these colors in small doses to add some color to a mostly-neutral room. Royal blue and tangerine pillows add just enough energy to a room with pale gray couches and chairs. Or if you’re a fan of patterns, try simply adding a tangerine and orange throw or blanket. - Source: Internet White, when combined with navy-blue, renders a classic and clean look to any room. This colour combination is a sister of the black and white colour combination. The white colour gleams against its dark counterpart, which gives a room character. As you can see in the bathroom above, shades of white on the walls and sanitary wares have been paired with a navy-blue vanity counter for an interesting look. You can use the white and navy-blue colour combination on cabinets, closets and sofas too. - Source: Internet Sand walls make an ideal backdrop for blue furniture, and they look especially nice in rooms with marine blue and seafoam green. Or you can create a more dramatic look with marine blue walls and sand-colored couches. Don’t feel limited to paint and furniture when choosing sand-colored elements for a room, either. Jute rugs, pale wood flooring, wicker furniture, sprays of wheat, etc. are all great options to choose from. - Source: Internet This is another great option for those who love jewel tones. And burnt orange is ideal for creating an autumn-inspired palette. Adding a little burnt orange is a great quick fix if you feel like a mostly-blue room has become too cold and unwelcoming. Throw pillows or wall hangings that are mostly burnt orange are easy and inexpensive options for evening out a room. If you want to capitalize on this autumnal aesthetic, add in some golden yellow. - Source: Internet Marigold is a beautiful, unusual color that is roughly a combination of burnt orange and gold. Its classic look pairs well with colonial blue, especially when the blue is part of a pattern. Even a marigold lampshade looks beautiful against vintage-inspired, blue-and-white patterned curtains. - Source: Internet Another color that complements blue sofas is pink. This color is known for being neutral and does not overpower the overall room. Pink accent chairs also work well with blue couches. - Source: Internet You already know that green and blue make a good combination. But if you want to go extra-bold, forest green is a great way to make a statement. Forest green makes a surprisingly nice wall color, and you can limit it to an accent wall if you’re cautious about making a room too dark. - Source: Internet There is something magical about the navy-blue colour. Its dramatic presence and classic look make it a favourite among interior designers. Its dark tones grab attention quickly and help radiant colours to pop. Which is why it is often used in modern interiors. - Source: Internet If you prefer a look of quiet elegance in a room, cool grays and various shades of blue go quite well with one another. For a living room, soft gray walls (or even just an accent wall) pair well with blue furniture. Or in a bedroom, try a cool gray bedspread with a few blue accent pillows or a blue rug. - Source: Internet Matching your armchairs with the sofa in the shades and tones of navy blue may seem to be rather dull and repetitive. Instead, use contrasts – juxtapose armchairs in contrasting colors for a more vibrant look. Alternatively, you may also choose printed fabrics for the upholstery to add more personality and dynamism to the seating area. - Source: Internet Even when used sparingly, these colors have the potential to really transform a room. But if you really want to commit, try lime-green drapes and furniture in a room with blue walls! Or you can create a softer aesthetic with blue-gray walls and a few muted lime wall hangings. If you want to be creative and try something off the beaten path, this is an excellent combination to choose. - Source: Internet There are many different shades of olive, so you can choose the right one for the mood you want to create. Cooler, grayish olive greens are good for color schemes closer to neutral. You can combine them with slate blue for a cooler aesthetic. If you want more of a warm/cool dynamic, combine warmer olive with deep blue. - Source: Internet Mint looks great with almost any blue shade. You can use mint green as a neutral and choose darker blues as a grounding force, or opt for a soothing pastel aesthetic with mint and baby blue. To really capitalize on mint’s retro aesthetic, include bronze hardware on cabinets, dressers, etc. - Source: Internet Navy blue is an elegant and sophisticated color, making it a perfect alternative to neutral colors.
