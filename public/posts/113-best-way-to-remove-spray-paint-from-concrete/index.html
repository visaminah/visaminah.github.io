The type of spray paint will define the method to remove it. Enamel spray paints are oil-based and are a bit tricky to remove – needing chemicals to do so. Water-based spray paint, like latex spray paint, is easier to clean up with only a little soap and warm water. - Source: Internet Lacquer Thinner: Nasty stuff, but it melts most paints. Careful: it will also melt many types of plastic etc. Extremely flammable. Use as Acetone, above. - Source: Internet You can use a pressure washer instead of soapy water. It’ll help to clean the surface the entire way through. And try to avoid alcohol for removing spray paint because it’s less workable than TSP and a Pressure Washer. - Source: Internet Well, manual scrubbing and scraping paint off concrete walls could be a time consuming and a labor-intensive method. Even if you use scraper or a grinder, the methods would be ineffective without pressure washer. So, no matter what other methods your use for removing paint of concrete garage or driveways, make sure you give finish with a pressure washer. I’d recommend never scrubbing or scraping paint in dry state because this would release paint dust and fine particles that could end up in your eyes or may get into your lungs, if you’d breathe them in. - Source: Internet Latex is a water-based paint that is similar to acrylic paint but is made with acrylic resin. Being water-mixed, latex paint spills are much easier to remove from concrete surface. You might find it strange, but a lot of people use alcohol to remove latex paint from concrete surfaces. So, just apply a generous amount of alcohol to the affected area and rub it a rag. This will loosen the paint helping you to remove. - Source: Internet Spray painting like a pro takes some time to learn. Even then, there will be times when removing unwanted paint is necessary.

Latex paint bubbles up when exposed to ammonia. Then, the loose paint can be scraped away using a scrub brush. - Source: Internet If you are a nature lover, this product is particularly friendly to the environment because of its water-based formula.

The other is it can remove a whopping 15 layers of many different kinds of paints. - Source: Internet Using a degreaser or soap and water, scrub well to remove the top layer of dirt, dust, or general debris. This means the paint stripper formula can work directly onto the desired surface. Then apply the paint remover liberally and give time for the formula to work, but don’t allow it to fully dry, 15 minutes should be enough. - Source: Internet After the cleaning, some paint may have already started to chip. Scrape off as much as possible and apply paint stripper to the rest of the area. You can use turpentine or mineral spirits. If this doesn’t work, use a paint stripper recommended specifically for concrete. - Source: Internet Rinsing off anything that remains can be done with plain tap water before drying off with a cloth or paper towel. A final step is usually applying a sealant if there was significant overspray present on the surface; follow instructions supplied by your chosen product for best results. For stubborn areas, it might be necessary to call in an expert – such as a professional painter – who can apply more aggressive methods of clean-up. - Source: Internet Again, use your wide-wire brush to scrub off the loosened paint.

Oil-based paints are harder to clean, therefore, proceed to the next step. - Source: Internet Soap molecules have one end that attracts water, and another end that attracts dirt and grease. They essentially pull the dirt and grease off the surface of whatever you are washing. In the case of spray paint, soap may be able to break up the paint with the help of a scrubbing brush, of course! - Source: Internet Don’t use paint strippers containing methylene chloride. These solvent-based strippers work fast, but they are highly toxic when inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Recently the EPA banned the sale of these paint strippers to consumers, and major home-improvement stores are no longer carrying them. - Source: Internet Oil-based paint is rather difficult to remove, calling for a little more elbow grease. In such a case, you can use paint strippers and paint absorbents. Mix the two and apply them on the concrete surface and give them enough time to perform their magic, say one hour or so. - Source: Internet Many of the same chemical strippers designed for removing paint from wood can also be used on concrete and masonry surfaces. Make sure the stripper is formulated for the type of paint you’re trying to remove. Some products will only remove water-based latex paint while others will work on both oil- and water-based paints. - Source: Internet If your arm is aching from all the scrubbing and no matter how hard you scrub, the spray paint is just too stubborn and will not go away. This means you require a pressure wash to get the job done. If you are living in a drought-stricken area, this is more environmentally friendly as it does not use nearly as much water as the general garden hose. This means that this method might be more recommended for large graffiti works. - Source: Internet If soapy water, TSP, nor the pressure washer have managed to remove the unwanted graffiti, you might need to resort to the extreme chemicals – Paint strippers and solvents. If you were wondering what solvents are, another commonly used term for it is acetone which people use to remove nail polish.

Here are some of your options, along with a few tips for getting the best results. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once all the <strong>paint</strong> has been removed, hose down the area to rinse off all the <strong>paint</strong> stripper and any other chemicals you might have used. After the surface is completely dry, you can seal or <strong>paint</strong> it as you desire. Sealing or staining the concrete surface not only improves its appearance but also protects it from harmful UV rays and the elements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This power washer can also be rented or borrowed. This method does not require chemical usage because the pressure of water is sufficient. If the <strong>paint</strong> is too old, power washing may not be enough to remove it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When starting to understand how to get <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> off concrete, you might want to learn about the different kinds of <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong>s available. The type of <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> will define the method to remove it. Enamel <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong>s are oil-based and are a bit tricky to remove – needing chemicals to do so. Water-based <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong>, like latex <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong>, is easier to clean up with only a little soap and warm water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Lacquer Thinner: Nasty stuff, but it melts most <strong>paint</strong>s. Careful: it will also melt many types of plastic etc. Extremely flammable. Use as Acetone, above. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can use a pressure washer instead of soapy water. It’ll help to clean the surface the entire way through. And try to avoid alcohol for removing <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> because it’s less workable than TSP and a Pressure Washer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Well, manual scrubbing and scraping <strong>paint</strong> off concrete walls could be a time consuming and a labor-intensive method. Even if you use scraper or a grinder, the methods would be ineffective without pressure washer. So, no matter what other methods your use for removing <strong>paint</strong> of concrete garage or driveways, make sure you give finish with a pressure washer. I’d recommend never scrubbing or scraping <strong>paint</strong> in dry state because this would release <strong>paint</strong> dust and fine particles that could end up in your eyes or may get into your lungs, if you’d breathe them in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Latex is a water-based <strong>paint</strong> that is similar to acrylic <strong>paint</strong> but is made with acrylic resin. Being water-mixed, latex <strong>paint</strong> spills are much easier to remove from concrete surface. You might find it strange, but a lot of people use alcohol to remove latex <strong>paint</strong> from concrete surfaces. So, just apply a generous amount of alcohol to the affected area and rub it a rag. This will loosen the <strong>paint</strong> helping you to remove. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Spray <strong>paint</strong>ing like a pro takes some time to learn. Even then, there will be times when removing unwanted <strong>paint</strong> is necessary. You could say that effective cleanup is part of the <strong>paint</strong>ing process. Numerous products effectively remove <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong>, but trouble can happen if you use a product that damages the item&rsquo;s surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Mix half a teaspoon of it with 8 liters of water. Use warm water for the mixture. Now use a fiber bristle brush to rub off the surface. Remove the <strong>paint</strong> rubbing. Sometimes the <strong>paint</strong> sticks so strongly with the concrete that you might need to keep the TSP mixture for 25 minutes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The ammonia solution should be allowed to stand for about an hour. Latex <strong>paint</strong> bubbles up when exposed to ammonia. Then, the loose <strong>paint</strong> can be scraped away using a scrub brush. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are a nature lover, this product is particularly friendly to the environment because of its water-based formula. This gives it less of a pungent smell and is remarkably biodegradable. Two more added benefits with Dumond’s SmartStrip Advanced Paint Remover, are not needing to neutralize the surface once you are finished removing the <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> because the formula is of a neutral pH. The other is it can remove a whopping 15 layers of many different kinds of <strong>paint</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Using a degreaser or soap and water, scrub well to remove the top layer of dirt, dust, or general debris. This means the <strong>paint</strong> stripper formula can work directly onto the desired surface. Then apply the <strong>paint</strong> remover liberally and give time for the formula to work, but don’t allow it to fully dry, 15 minutes should be enough. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After the cleaning, some <strong>paint</strong> may have already started to chip. Scrape off as much as possible and apply <strong>paint</strong> stripper to the rest of the area. You can use turpentine or mineral spirits. If this doesn’t work, use a <strong>paint</strong> stripper recommended specifically for concrete. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Rinsing off anything that remains can be done with plain tap water before drying off with a cloth or paper towel. A final step is usually applying a sealant if there was significant over<strong>spray</strong> present on the surface; follow instructions supplied by your chosen product for best results. For stubborn areas, it might be necessary to call in an expert – such as a professional <strong>paint</strong>er – who can apply more aggressive methods of clean-up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Again, use your wide-wire brush to scrub off the loosened <strong>paint</strong>. Continue until no more <strong>paint</strong> comes off. If the stain was from latex <strong>paint</strong>, using warm soapy water as you scrub should be enough. Oil-based <strong>paint</strong>s are harder to clean, therefore, proceed to the next step. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Soap molecules have one end that attracts water, and another end that attracts dirt and grease. They essentially pull the dirt and grease off the surface of whatever you are washing. In the case of <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong>, soap may be able to break up the <strong>paint</strong> with the help of a scrubbing brush, of course! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Don’t use <strong>paint</strong> strippers containing methylene chloride. These solvent-based strippers work fast, but they are highly toxic when inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Recently the EPA banned the sale of these <strong>paint</strong> strippers to consumers, and major home-improvement stores are no longer carrying them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Oil-based <strong>paint</strong> is rather difficult to remove, calling for a little more elbow grease. In such a case, you can use <strong>paint</strong> strippers and <strong>paint</strong> absorbents. Mix the two and apply them on the concrete surface and give them enough time to perform their magic, say one hour or so. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Many of the same chemical strippers designed for removing <strong>paint</strong> from wood can also be used on concrete and masonry surfaces. Make sure the stripper is formulated for the type of <strong>paint</strong> you’re trying to remove. Some products will only remove water-based latex <strong>paint</strong> while others will work on both oil- and water-based <strong>paint</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your arm is aching from all the scrubbing and no matter how hard you scrub, the <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> is just too stubborn and will not go away. This means you require a pressure wash to get the job done. If you are living in a drought-stricken area, this is more environmentally friendly as it does not use nearly as much water as the general garden hose. This means that this method might be more recommended for large graffiti works. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If soapy water, TSP, nor the pressure washer have managed to remove the unwanted graffiti, you might need to resort to the extreme chemicals – Paint strippers and solvents. If you were wondering what solvents are, another commonly used term for it is acetone which people use to remove nail polish. Turpentine and <strong>paint</strong> strippers are also highly effective in the removal of <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pressured water can also be used to remove <strong>paint</strong> from concrete without chemicals. At high pressure levels, it can easily clean off layer of <strong>paint</strong>, dust, grease, and other dirt from concrete surface. Before using a pressure washer, you may want to apply the <strong>paint</strong> stripper and clean the surface with detergent and water. With such, use the pressure washer in circular movements to completely remove the <strong>paint</strong> from the concrete surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Spray <strong>paint</strong> out of a can creates a fine mist that can end up almost anywhere in the room where you’re <strong>paint</strong>ing. To avoid over<strong>spray</strong> and mistakes, cover everything nearby, including your skin. Wear protective clothing and a respirator when using <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong>. Use drop cloths and tape plastic or paper sheets over everything not being <strong>paint</strong>ed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Anyhow, I’ve been using ammonia to clear off the latex-based <strong>paint</strong> spills off my concrete driveway. I mostly use a cloth saturated with ammonia to get best results. You can apply a generous layer of ammonia to the affected area and let it sit for an hour. Ammonia will cause the <strong>paint</strong> to bubble off that you can easily scrub off using brush. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Removing dried <strong>paint</strong> from concrete, however, can be a rather frustrating process because concrete readily absorbs the <strong>paint</strong>.

Here are a few techniques: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to remove <strong>paint</strong> from surfaces, soap and water will do the trick. Graffiti remover can take <strong>paint</strong> off of concrete or metal. Paint thinner or stripper may be necessary for tougher coats of <strong>paint</strong> that resist scrubbing with soap and water alone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Brake Cleaner? Yes. If the lacquer thinner doesn’t work or works too slowly, try brake cleaner in a <strong>spray</strong> can. This one is “moderate VOC” which means it’s dangerous. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Nonetheless, concrete is a highly robust material designed to last a lifetime or more. Please don’t stand there staring at unattractive spills when you can easily remove them. Make every effort to respond to <strong>paint</strong> stains quickly and efficiently. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>, make sure to leave the <strong>paint</strong> stripper on the <strong>spray</strong>-<strong>paint</strong>ed area for at least half an hour, but, dried <strong>paint</strong> stripper is quite a difficult substance to clean so be aware of the time when you apply it.

Then, scrub the surface with a floors towel and steam machine. Burst of steam should loosen any residual <strong>paint</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For stubborn <strong>paint</strong> spills that can’t be removed by power washing or chemical strippers, an effective and environmentally friendly alternative is soda blasting. This method, which uses granular sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) blasted at high pressure onto the surface, can remove multiple layers of <strong>paint</strong> or coatings fast.

Leave the solvent or <strong>paint</strong> stripper to sit on the <strong>spray</strong>-<strong>paint</strong>ed area for half an hour If you see a bubbling effect on the <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> that means the chemicals are working If some spots are not bubbling, you might need to scrub the <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> with the wired-bristled scrubbing brush using a circular motion When working with solvents instead of <strong>paint</strong> strippers, remember they do evaporate and disappear quickly so you will have to forgo the half-hour sitting period. Once the <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> is removed you can rinse the surface down with whatever method suits you best, either the bucket of water or the hose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Removing <strong>paint</strong> from concrete can be a painstaking process.
