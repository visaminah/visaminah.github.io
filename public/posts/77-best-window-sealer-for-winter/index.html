A good caulking gun is essential to every home repair toolkit. Caulking guns can be found at hardware stores and are used to load the caulk cartridge and apply caulk. Look for a smooth-rod, dripless caulk gun that has a spring-loaded mechanism to deliver even pressure with minimal force. This prevents messy excess caulk and ensures even, consistent application. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After caulking around the outside of the <strong>window</strong>, move inside and use weather stripping to seal around the sash. (The sashes are the movable parts of a <strong>window</strong> that open and close.)

You can now peel off the backing paper and push the foam or rubber strip into place. It will attach immediately. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Improving <strong>window</strong> function – If you have <strong>window</strong>s that are not of good quality, plastic for <strong>window</strong>s produced by better brands will enhance their function.

The OSI Quad is composed of elastomeric polymers and high-quality synthetic resins. It is a thick sealant that can be applied in a variety of building materials to provide one of the strongest, dirt and UV-resistant seals. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Since adverse weather conditions impact the outside of your <strong>window</strong>, you should use stronger plastic if you place it there. It needs to withstand strong winds, snow, blizzards, and heavy rains. The negative side of outside plastic concerns an aesthetic issue since it doesn’t look nice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Maintaining your <strong>window</strong>s is one way to ensure your home stays in peak condition through the seasons. Just as fall is a great time to begin extra maintenance procedures, it’s also an ideal time to review your home insurance policy. Are you adequately covered? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A tried and true method, storm <strong>window</strong>s are certainly efficient at keeping cold air out, but they can be a bit pricier than other <strong>window</strong> sealing options. If you have single-pane <strong>window</strong>s, this may be your best option. Storm <strong>window</strong>s can be installed on either the interior or exterior of your <strong>window</strong>. They are typically easy to install, as they just snap into place. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You’ve picked out your gorgeous new <strong>window</strong>s. You know what style you want, the size and color, and when they’re getting installed. Now you just to decide how to seal them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Oh Canada. Cue scenes of picturesque snowfalls, frozen lakes, and gorgeous mountaintops. Although beautiful, Canadian winters can make staying warm feel like a fulltime job. So how do you make your home a well-insulated winter refuge? With the right <strong>window</strong>s! Good <strong>window</strong>s will keep the cold air out of your home, so you won’t need to crank the heat (and foot the bill that goes with it). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Among these top products, we recommend the Gorilla silicone caulk (US$15, Amazon) as the best clear silicone waterproof sealant and the Loctite polyurethane sealant (US$7.58, Amazon) as an equally effective, durable sealant that can also be painted. For sealing gaps and cracks around interior <strong>window</strong> frames, Dap Alex Plus acrylic latex caulk (US$7.99, Amazon) is an efficient and affordable option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Aluminum Window Frames: Aluminum is a very strong, durable <strong>window</strong> frame material. Because of its strength, aluminum frames can be thinner than vinyl frames without sacrificing strength. However, aluminum <strong>window</strong>s have a very high thermal conductivity, meaning that heat transfers very easily through the material. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Particularly in older homes, <strong>window</strong> panes can start to see damage that causes cold air to seep into the house. This happens when the wooden <strong>window</strong> frame is exposed to moisture, which makes it expand and contract. This can cause the wood to crack or rot, and then heated air escapes through the damaged portions. While rotted <strong>window</strong> frames will need to be replaced, you can repair cracks with a polyurethane caulk that’s designed for <strong>window</strong>s. Here’s how to do it: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Winter can be a magical time with all the festive holidays, cozy sweaters, and hot chocolate. The season can also get extremely cold and uncomfortable in some regions, and people in these areas tend to crank up the heat in their homes. Homeowners may also winterize their homes when the weather gets chilly — and you should too, starting with your <strong>window</strong>s. We’ll discuss why you should seal <strong>window</strong>s for winter and how to do it on a budget. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As far as installation is concerned, all you have to do is clean your <strong>window</strong> panes, measure the film and apply it to your <strong>window</strong> frames using sticky tape. Then, use a regular hair dryer to make the plastic shrink and stick to the <strong>window</strong> panes. You can also use a small piece of cardboard or hard paper to remove the wrinkles and air bubbles by moving them across the surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, you can pick out the inside plastic for <strong>window</strong>s, as well. It is a better option since it is thinner, saves energy, looks not bad, and you can see clearly through it. All in all, it seems that inside plastic for <strong>window</strong>s has more advantages. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Siliconized latex is similar to acrylic latex but contains silanes, a type of silicone. It has many of the same properties as acrylic latex but has greater resistance to weather and creates more durable bonds. This makes siliconized latex a good choice for exterior <strong>window</strong> caulking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Check that your <strong>window</strong>s operate with ease. Specifically test out the cranks, handles, and latches. If you are straining to open and close your <strong>window</strong>s, they may not close securely and have a good enough seal for winter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’d rather not have plastic on your <strong>window</strong>s for the winter, another effective <strong>window</strong> insulation method can be found in <strong>window</strong> treatments. Honeycomb blinds are <strong>window</strong> shades that have a cellular design. The air in the cells act as insulation and blocks cold air from entering the home. Similarly, thick blackout curtains are a great way to not only block out light but also trap in warm air and prevent it from seeping out through the <strong>window</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Begin by scraping off any old caulk or peeling paint from around the exterior perimeter of the <strong>window</strong>. You could use a regular metal to scrape the surface clean, but a much better option is a . This specialty tool has stiff, beveled scraping blade and pointed tip that’s great for raking hardened caulk out of narrow cracks and crevices. And if the beveled end becomes dull or damaged, you can always sharpen it with a bench grinder. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Knowing if your <strong>window</strong>s need insulation is vital for keeping your preferred room temperature from being tampered with by the weather. Start by inspecting your <strong>window</strong>s. Checking for cracks or gaps in your <strong>window</strong>s and frames is a good indicator of whether you need to insulate them or not. You can also wait until summer or winter rolls around and try to feel for any drafts coming in from your <strong>window</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bubble wrap <strong>window</strong> insulation is one of the best ways to keep your home warm this winter season. Though your <strong>window</strong>s may not look as pretty once you’ve covered them with this material, your home will definitely feel warmer. Moreover, you can easily find bubble wrap sheets at your local hardware store, as it is widely used for packing stuff and is quite cheap. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Window insulation film is a great way to keep out the harsh temperatures. By applying an insulation film on the outside of your <strong>window</strong>, it can cover up a lot of the gaps and reduce drafts. Additionally, insulation film offers protection from UV rays and still lets you enjoy natural light. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it’s time to hunker down for the winter, keeping your home toasty warm is essential.

That way, you can determine if you need plastic for <strong>window</strong>s and what to expect of this product. Also, keep in mind that weather conditions in the region where you live, type of <strong>window</strong>s in your house, your budget, and draft problems make the solution even more complicated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>How about aesthetically pleasing <strong>window</strong> treatments to suit the season? Replace your light and airy <strong>window</strong> treatments with layered or insulated ones. It’s like wearing a cozy sweater, but for your <strong>window</strong>! These treatments help to keep the draft out and cold air from spilling into the room. If it’s a sunny day out, draw back the curtains and let the warmth of the sun naturally warm your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As I have mentioned above, many experts have different opinions towards using plastic for <strong>window</strong>s in the house. Let’s stick to the facts and see all of the positive and negative sides of this product in one place. It will help you to make the decision undoubtedly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most silicone caulks are clear and cannot be painted. Many manufacturers offer tinted silicone caulks in white, black, or gray to match different <strong>window</strong> finishes. Silicone caulks are available in cartridges or tubes. Unlike regular caulk, silicone versions are fully waterproof, tend to dry fast, and work within a few minutes after application, making them arguably the best exterior caulk type available. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You’re probably familiar with this <strong>window</strong> insulation method if you’ve lived in a cold region for a while. While they’re not the best option for aesthetics, plastic <strong>window</strong> films do a great job of adding a layer of insulation to <strong>window</strong>s. You can pick up a <strong>window</strong> film kit at your local hardware store. Here’s how to install them: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Weather stripping is typically made from rubber, foam, or a spongy material. It comes in various widths and thicknesses and often has an adhesive side that sticks to the bottom of the sliding piece of the <strong>window</strong> while it’s open. Once the <strong>window</strong> is closed, the weather stripping compresses down and seals the gap completely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Inspect each <strong>window</strong> and feel around the frame for cold drafts. If any cool air is detected, use a caulking gun to apply caulk to the crack and seal it. Be sure the area you’re applying the caulk to is a stationary piece of <strong>window</strong> pane that doesn’t need to move for the <strong>window</strong> to open. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At Feldco, we take care of <strong>window</strong>s with the best sealant on the market. We use Osi Quad Max sealant on all our replacement <strong>window</strong>s. As a result, many homeowners who choose to go with Feldco for their <strong>window</strong> replacement will receive cost-saving benefits and energy efficiency. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Low-E coatings are transparent coatings added to the glass panes that regulate the passage of solar radiation through the <strong>window</strong>’s glass. This coating is effective while also not compromising the light flow through the <strong>window</strong>s. Gas fills: The space between the <strong>window</strong>’s glass units are filled with krypton, argon, or xenon gas. These heavier, noble gases work to impede the transfer of heat through a <strong>window</strong> compared to a standard air fill. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Weather stripping materials and draft stoppers are great tools to use on drafty <strong>window</strong>s. They seal up any gaps left open when the <strong>window</strong> is closed. Draft stoppers are incredibly easy to use. Similar to door snakes, they are a tube-shaped cloth filled with insulation material. Simply place one across the base of the <strong>window</strong> where it normally opens, and the cold air won’t get in through the gap. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When caulking an old <strong>window</strong>, aside from making sure that all surfaces are clean and dry, you will also need to remove any old caulk. This can be done with the help of a putty knife or scraper. Some silicone caulks can be smoothed into the joints using your finger and are water-ready within an hour. Polyurethane caulks can be easily cut to frame after drying. Always refer to the product instructions for each sealant’s curing time and handling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>During the summer, this plastic wrapping will keep the freshness inside your house. It will reduce the use of a <strong>window</strong> air conditioner, which will preserve energy. Moreover, it will shield your furniture from UV light coming through the <strong>window</strong> and consequently fading. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Loctite Tite Foam comes with an easy-to-use straw applicator for precise application. Any excess foam can be easily trimmed when dry and, if necessary, painted. A happy reviewer who was finally able to keep roaches out by sealing a wide <strong>window</strong> crack wrote, “This is an excellent product,” and added that the foam is “soft but firm when applied and does the job.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Gorilla 8050002 is one of the best silicone sealants for your DIY interior or exterior projects. Hundreds of homeowners recommend this tough multi-purpose silicone sealant caulk for sealing gaps and cracks around <strong>window</strong>s. The caulk is mold and mildew resistant and forms a lasting seal that will not shrink or crack over time. This caulking product will prevent leaks and stop air drafts and pests. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Though before we begin, it is important to mention that a single-glazed glass pane can lose about ten times as much heat as the same surface area of an insulated wall. Even double-glazed <strong>window</strong>s don’t offer as much insulation as most people believe they would. So, unless you have triple-glazed glass panes, you might want to follow some of these tricks to keep your house warm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A lot of homeowners mention that this caulk is very easy to apply around <strong>window</strong> and door frames. For smaller applications, the caulk is also available in a 5.5-ounce tube. One reviewer who used this product to caulk around baseboards and <strong>window</strong>s wrote that it is really easy to work with and added that they noticed a difference in energy savings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Windows with two or three glass panes have more layers, which result in reduced energy loss and better insulation. Low-E (emissivity) glass: Low-E coatings are transparent coatings added to the glass panes that regulate the passage of solar radiation through the <strong>window</strong>’s glass. This coating is effective while also not compromising the light flow through the <strong>window</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Self-adhesive rubber and foam strips act as amazing sealants. They are pretty easily available at hardware stores in a variety of sizes with different levels of thickness and adhesiveness. Apart from providing <strong>window</strong> insulation, these rubber and foam strips or tapes are also used for sound-proofing, cushioning, padding and sealing purposes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Old and damaged <strong>window</strong>s can be really problematic when it comes to energy efficiency. The Loctite Tite Foam is a great solution for keeping air and moisture outside your house and maintaining comfortable temperatures at home. It has a uniform cell structure and high density for improved durability that can fill and seal larger gaps. It expands and bonds to most common building materials and keeps drafts and pests away, without bending frames. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Plastic for <strong>window</strong>s is a thin, transparent folium through which you can see. It resembles the plastic foil for food covering. However, it is of better quality, thicker, and much more durable. You can purchase it in every hardware store all over the US or order it from the Net. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once you have cleaned the <strong>window</strong>s and <strong>window</strong> frames, you can start measuring. When cutting the film, try to leave some space, about 10cm, on all sides just in case. Now you will need to grab your sticky tape and place it along with the <strong>window</strong> frame. After that’s complete, place insulation film on the sticky tape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you determine that the <strong>window</strong> frames are in good condition, you’re not necessarily out of the woods yet. The glass on your <strong>window</strong>s itself allows a lot of heat loss in the winter, so it’s a good idea to take measures that will seal up <strong>window</strong>s and block the cold air from entering. Here are a few economical methods. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sold in various sizes, foam tape is great for any sized cracks. Equipped with a stick back it goes on easily. Like the felt, this tape is meant to be applied on <strong>window</strong> sashes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can find many different opinions on the Net about the plastic for <strong>window</strong>s, and you can quickly get lost if you don’t know what signs to follow. Sometimes it is hard to recognize the correct information. Some experts recommend using plastic for <strong>window</strong>s, but there are a lot of them who are against this method. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Understandably, this type of home improvement project is a big one and may take a bit of budget planning for most families. However, the benefits of brand-new replacement <strong>window</strong>s are far greater than the cost. You really cannot put a price on getting the utmost comfort and security out of your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Caulk tends to harden as it ages, usually breaking away from its surface leaving moisture to accumulate beneath. Without sufficiently removing old caulk you risk leaving old moisture on the surface of the <strong>window</strong>. Use a putty knife or sharp tool to remove it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cracks can form as a <strong>window</strong> frame expands and contracts through the seasons. Many sealants shrink over time, pulling away from the frame. That’s why this GE Silicone 2+ Window & Door Sealant is a good choice for sealing your replacement <strong>window</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Window insulation kits: block cold air by sealing the entire <strong>window</strong> behind a large sheet of shrink-wrap plastic. The plastic adheres to the interior <strong>window</strong> casing with double-sided tape; you then use a blow dryer to seal it in place. Window insulation kits are very effective at sealing out drafts, but keep in mind that you won’t be able to open the <strong>window</strong> until next spring, when you peel off the plastic wrap. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Winter is on its way, if it’s not already arrived for you. One of the most cost-effective and easy ways to seal <strong>window</strong>s for winter is by installing winter <strong>window</strong> inserts. Insulating your <strong>window</strong>s for winter doesn’t have to come with costly replacements or extra labor; not when DIY winter <strong>window</strong> inserts can take all the hassle out of home protection. Drafty <strong>window</strong>s can make your home freezing cold in winter as heat flows outside and force your air conditioner to work extra hard in the summer—leading to high energy bills all year long. To learn about the benefits of <strong>window</strong> inserts and to discover how to seal <strong>window</strong>s for the winter, both before the cold season and during, continue reading and prepare for immense time and money savings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After taking into consideration all the desiring sides and downsides of plastic for <strong>window</strong>s, you can choose the <strong>window</strong> insulation kit according to your preferences. If you are skillful, you can read the instruction on how to install it and finish the job on your own. On the other hand, you can call the expert to do it for you. However, keep in mind that it will cost you more money. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When placing the plastic over your <strong>window</strong>, a tampon zone in between them will create the air insulation. Keep in mind that the <strong>window</strong> locks are always between the <strong>window</strong> and plastic wrap. That means you don’t need to do additional trims and cuts for locks, <strong>window</strong> regulators, and handles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You may be used to seeing it in heavy-duty spray foam, but polyurethane caulk is a great alternative to silicone. This <strong>window</strong>, door and siding sealant from Loctite is high performing but perfect for keeping a beautiful exterior. It’s even paintable so you can DIY without fear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it is sunny outside, open the curtains to let in sunlight and natural warmth. Without sunlight, heat escapes through your <strong>window</strong>s. So make use of heavy thermal curtains to trap the warmth when the sun sets and the heater is on. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One 20-ounce cartridge of this professional-grade foam can properly seal approximately 15-18 <strong>window</strong>s, while it can only be used with the Great Stuff Pro foam dispensing gun. Many contractors use this system exclusively, including one carpenter with many years of experience in door and <strong>window</strong> installation who explained, “It creates a great airtight seal, locks the units to the framing, [and] it doesn’t expand excessively.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Changing weather causes expansion and contraction within the <strong>window</strong>, leading to seal failure and major insulation issues over time. Luckily, warm edge spacers are an effective solution that insulates the edges of the <strong>window</strong> unit and keeps the glass panes firmly apart from each other. These spacers add structural stability and mitigate the stress that comes with thermal expansion and contraction in different weather conditions. By expanding and contracting at the same rate as the insulated glass unit, they help to prevent any gas from escaping and the <strong>window</strong>’s seal from failing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now that the caulk gun is ready, you can start at the areas where it is needed and slowly apply the caulk. Make sure to use light pressure on the trigger when applying. Once you have covered up all the cracks, you can use a smooth utensil or finger to create a smooth surface on the caulk. Slowly the caulk will begin to harden and create an airtight seal for the <strong>window</strong> and cracks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Silicone caulks are among the best caulks for sealing <strong>window</strong>s. Silicone helps provide a long-lasting seal that can be applied against interior or exterior <strong>window</strong>s and its flexible material will not crumble in hot or cold temperatures. These properties make it an excellent exterior caulk that remains flexible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Thermal <strong>window</strong>s are specifically designed to keep the cold air from entering your home. Although they make look like normal curtains on the surface, the thermal ones are lined with a reflective film layer, vapour barrier coating and an outer covering featuring different patterns and designs. The drapes don’t allow any transfer of heat and are thus considered the best way to insulate <strong>window</strong>s for winter in Pakistan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The first type of <strong>window</strong> insulation is caulking. Caulking is generally inexpensive and fairly easy to use. There are several different types of caulk - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Energy Star has characterized plastic for <strong>window</strong>s as an efficient and environmentally friendly solution because it saves from 20 to 50% energy. Therefore, once you decide to purchase this product, you should look for an energy star label on it. The energy star kit guarantees the quality of the equipment, hence the quality of your <strong>window</strong> insulation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another option for insulating your <strong>window</strong>s is using weather strips. These strips are applied to the movable parts of the <strong>window</strong>. Once you put the weather strips on, do not open that <strong>window</strong> again for the season, or else you will have to reapply it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A good seal is essential for protecting the lifespan of your replacement <strong>window</strong>s. The gaps in a <strong>window</strong> can let in the elements and end up raising your energy bill. But like anything you trust for your home, not all sealants are made equal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Loosing of guarantee – Some <strong>window</strong>s have the guarantee for several years after installing. If you apply plastic for <strong>window</strong>s, the manufacturer or building company can cancel that warranty. Therefore, you should read the guarantee list carefully before deciding to implement this type of cover over your <strong>window</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Polyurethane caulk will last from 10 – 20 years, can be painted over and adheres well. Polyurethane spray foams are heavy duty and tend to expand as they dry. This is a common option for exterior <strong>window</strong> caulking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Dap Alex Plus latex caulk is enhanced with silicone additives that make it extra-flexible and durable. It is ideal for sealing interior <strong>window</strong>s as it has a low odor and can be easily cleaned with water. The cured caulk is paintable and mildew-resistant and creates a flexible and strong seal that can fix leaks and stop air drafts. This caulking product remains permanently flexible even after it is fully dried. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hint: to find out if you’ve missed any cracks, try the incense test. Hold a smouldering stick of incense against the edges of a <strong>window</strong>. If there’s a draft, the smoke will be blown out horizontally. If not, it will rise as normal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Felt: is one of the oldest types of weather stripping. It’s commonly sold in rolls with or without an adhesive backing and is also available with an attached metal mounting flange. Felt is used as a compression weather stripping around the inside of double-hung, casement, and sliding <strong>window</strong>s. Felt is affordable and easy to install, but it doesn&rsquo;t last as long as other types of weather stripping and must be replaced every four to six years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>V Strip can be folded into a “V” shape that will open to close gaps. The V Strip has a peel and stick, so it will stay once it’s put on. It can be applied to the sides of the <strong>window</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The right <strong>window</strong>s will allow you to enjoy comfortable indoor air temperatures (no matter what the outdoor temperature is!) and save money. When you rely less on your heating and air conditioning to regulate your home temperature, you aren’t paying for extra energy. Since <strong>window</strong>s can account for up to 25% of the total heat loss in a home, you could be saving a quarter on your monthly energy bills with the right winter <strong>window</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There’s no shortage of products available to seal your replacement <strong>window</strong>s. And it’s the last thing on your mind when you’re planning a home renovation or refresh. When purchasing caulk, think about how it’ll fit your specific needs. Time-tested formulas guarantee a quality, durable seal. It may seem small but sealant’s a crucial step in making and keeping your home beautiful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now, in order to insulate house <strong>window</strong>s with bubble wrap, you first need to measure the size of your <strong>window</strong> panes and cut out pieces of bubble wrap accordingly. Then, use a spray bottle to spray some water on your <strong>window</strong> and press the bubble wrap on the surface while it is still wet. You’ll have to press it on your <strong>window</strong> panes, with the bubble side facing the glass, and hold it until it sticks. You can even use transparent tape to stick the edges to the <strong>window</strong>, though be careful as removing the tape might ruin your paint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=http://papers.co/wallpaper/papers.co-vr69-rain-drop-window-blue-sad-pattern-34-iphone6-plus-wallpaper.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Best Window Sealer For Winter - Window Sealant Waterproof">
