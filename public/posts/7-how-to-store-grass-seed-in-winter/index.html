The date is when the seeds’ germination rate was tested. That rate should be 80 to 95 percent, depending on the type of grass. The rate should remain valid through at least the first year of storage after the test date, unless the seed is kept improperly. Each additional year of storage after the first year reduces the germination rate by 10 to 20 percent. - Source: Internet Grass seed should be kept in a cool, dry place where air can circulate around it and the temperature will stay between 40 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit. The seed should not be stored in an unheated shed, garage or any other place where the temperature will drop below 32 F. Keep bags of grass seed off the floor and someplace where mice can’t get to them. A basement or cellar is a suitable storage place as long as it is dry. The seed also can be stored in a working refrigerator if an open box of baking soda or a commercial desiccant is placed in the appliance to remove moisture. - Source: Internet Even if you’ve taken great care over your bag of seed over 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, with each passing year fewer seeds will germinate. This means that your coverage rate will go down significantly compared with a fresh mix. So, you’ll need more seeds to cover less area. That being said, overseeding with old seed will not have any damaging affect on your lawn. - Source: Internet Grass seed, like any other plant seed, has a finite shelf life. Grass seed stored for more than one year gradually has fewer seeds that would sprout, or germinate, if planted. The shelf life of lawn grass seed depends mainly on the strength and health of the grass plants (Poaceae plant family) that produced the seed and how the seed was stored after it was harvested. - Source: Internet At Manderley, we test our seed yearly to ensure we are providing our customers with the best possible coverage, year after year. Did you know that Canada No. 1 Grade Seed only requires a 70% germination rate? Manderley PRO Grade and Less Water lines use only the highest quality seed which leave Canada No. 1 grade in their dust! That means you get the best seed, without any filler, bringing you fuller and longer lasting results than the competition. - Source: Internet Storage conditions do have a major influence of the long-term viability of stored seed. Storing your seed outside in a shed, or garage is not ideal due to the exposure to heat and humidity. Instead, try storing your seed indoors in a cool, dry area, to extend your purchase’s shelf life. - Source: Internet It’s not quite as simple as stamping an expiry date on a bag of seed. You can still get results from a bag of grass seed for many years, but the actual “expiry date” depends on how well you store your seed. It’s impossible to provide an exact estimation of how much less viable a seed mix can become over time, but seed stored in a typical residential garage could lose as much as 10% germination each year. - Source: Internet To begin started, here are some tips for finding information about how to store unused grass seed over the winter:\r- Research Store Grass Seed In Refrigerator-related information from credible sources.
