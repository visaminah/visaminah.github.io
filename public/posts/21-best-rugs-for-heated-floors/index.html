To keep your house or flat warm, underfloor heating is becoming increasingly popular. Yet the myth that <strong>rugs</strong> and underfloor heating do not go together remains. However, we are of the opinion that there is absolutely no doubt that those two definitely do form a great team! Underfloor heating is convenient, but why leave the beloved rug in the attic to gather dust? It surely does not have to end like that! We want to let you know which <strong>rugs</strong> are suitable for underfloor heating and what other guidelines you should be considering when pairing <strong>rugs</strong> and underfloor heating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Under the carpet, electric heating not only makes carpets warm, inviting, and incredibly comfortable to the touch, but it also can provide supplemental heat to the room. In fact, many people use radiant heat under a carpet as a primary heat source, particularly if it is installed in a room that rests on top of a concrete slab. A family room that is built on a concrete slab, for example, may be very difficult to keep warm during the winter months. Heated carpet <strong>floors</strong> not only add a touch of luxury to this type of room but they also evenly distribute heat to the space until the desired room temperature is reached. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A: Rugs themselves can have problems when placed near a heat source for a long period of time. This is especially true if your rug is tufted onto a synthetic material that can melt when exposed to high temperatures. Avoid melting by purchasing high-quality <strong>rugs</strong> made from natural fibres. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://www.vincentflooring.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/honey-oak-h2.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Best Rugs For Heated Floors - Best Carpet Pad For Radiant Floor Heat">
