So we want to keep that in mind when it comes to finding paint colors to work with it. For example, if you were thinking of using white, choose a creamy white as opposed to a bright white. The bright white can sometimes appear a little too harsh against red brick. An off-white will give the appearance of white against the brick, but a little softer. - Source: Internet You would love the effect that yellow color would deliver on your house’s exterior with red bricks.

Picking more than one accent color helps to ensure that your color scheme is more complex and interesting. - Source: Internet For a lot of clients the body color takes up a large amount of their home.

It suggests that both orange and purple will work well with red brick. However, consider the shade of orange or purple you desire.

Likewise, instead of a bright orange, select a more muted hue for an eye-pleasing palette. - Source: Internet To decide which colors go best with brick, consider the color schemes you find most appealing. What do you like about them? Many color palettes are based on the color wheel, which demonstrates how colors work together and can help you decide on the right scheme.

Pair the intensity of the neutral with that of your brick, or opt for a rich neutral like charcoal gray with a paler brick and a light taupe with deeper brick. A glossy black works with red brick to create a modern look. - Source: Internet A complementary color palette draws on color from opposite sides of the wheel, with some variation in the shades. Given this, a red brick house would suit certain accents. The shade of your brick will determine the shade of green most suitable. For example, a deep burgundy-red will look good with a softer, yellow green. A more orange-red brick will work with a rich more blue-green hue. - Source: Internet Some brick homes have a facade that includes another material, such as stucco, which means the brick might hold less color dominance. The landscaping will also help determine how your brick color scheme looks. A front yard that features lots of flowers and colors might look best with an exterior palette that’s more neutral, while a mostly green yard might benefit from a home that includes strategic pops of brighter hues. - Source: Internet It appears completely different when coupled with bare brick.

This shows how good-looking your structures can be and increases their resale value. One of these ways is using red brick and siding combinations which gives an aesthetic look. - Source: Internet Brick is a traditional material that’s reminiscent of old schoolhouses and stately fireplaces. To bring this feature into the 21st century, pair it with white, off-white, beige, or light gray. These simple neutrals can brighten the space, and the minimalist approach transforms the exposed brick into an envy-inspiring statement piece. Additionally, modern design is all about lightweight materials so, since exposed brick can appear dark and heavy, be sure to include daintier accents like breezy curtains, glass side tables, and simple picture frames. - Source: Internet Both kinds function admirably when painted on properly prepared brick. Because the front-facing bricks seem off-white and the cracks between the bricks appear gray, Seapearl looks particularly attractive on brick. Painting all of the non-brick sidings in Sherwin Williams’ Iron Ore and the trim and accents in Benjamin Moore’s Onyx creates a rich, deep contrast that brings out Seapearl’s gray undertones. - Source: Internet Red brick houses can be difficult to decorate because of the intensity of the brick.

This allows you to have both a dynamic contrast and complementary tones. - Source: Internet When the brick is painted beige or off-white, it looks fresh and modern with orange clay tile roofs. Redbrick can’t compete with such a distinctive roof as the focal point of an external design. Benjamin Moore’s Grant Beige is a go-to beige for many designers. - Source: Internet LRV 41 SW Gateway Gray is considered a greige but it leans a tad more on the gray side. Gateway has some slight green undertones to it which is why I love it next to brick. It’s a greige that has a little something extra in it. It’s also very muted, again another reason it pairs so nicely with red brick. - Source: Internet Hands down, the best shades to complement a red brick house are in the cool-toned family.
