Medium and brighter shades of these cool colors will be inviting and pleasing to the eye. While deep, dark purples, blues and greens will also look great. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Of course – black goes with everything – <strong>grey</strong> being no different. A black shirt paired with a pair of <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong> creates an instant sleek, sophisticated, well-put-together look. A black top and <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong> will look professional – if that’s the look you’re going for. But it can also look just as clean for a casual or semi-casual affair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Get the taste of fashion with the <strong>grey</strong> pant matching shirt for men options. As it rhymes too. Here are some of the examples to catch upon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Patterns like paisley, checks, and stripes are all a great way to add interest to an otherwise neutral outfit. For example, charcoal <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong> and pale blue or white shirt can look great with a paisley or checked patterned tie.

It’s well worth spending money on a high-quality leather pair as they’ll last a long time. You don’t have to stick to wearing them with your <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong> either, as they’ll match any suit or trousers you have in your wardrobe, and can even be worn to smarten up a pair of jeans for a date. And dress shoes don’t need to be dull either – shoes from Bold Society Shoes’ Wingtip collection add a pop of color to any outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The key to choosing the right socks to complement your outfit is to choose a pair with colors that either contrast with or complement your <strong>pants</strong> and shoes. For a bolder choice, you could opt for pattern mixing – for example, wearing pinstripe <strong>grey</strong> trousers with striped <strong>grey</strong> socks. This is a great way to start out experimenting with patterns and colors before going all out and choosing a colorful pair of socks like Soxy’s Lawyer Socks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What Color Looks Best With Grey? This is a classic. Gray and white are two of the most popular colors to pair, and they can be used in any room or style. A barely-there <strong>grey</strong> can be paired with a crisp white for a bright and airy space, or a deep, moody charcoal can be used to contrast white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grey <strong>pants</strong>, however, hit all the notes. Depending on the fabric, they’re a year-round must-have. And once you’ve found the <strong>pants</strong> of your choice, the next question is, what to wear with <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong>? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Choose your hat carefully if you decide to wear one, as they can easily make or break your outfit. With dress <strong>pants</strong>, you’re going to want a smart hat, so stay away from sporty, casual styles such as caps or knit hats. A smart, formal style hat like a fedora or trilby is a great option, depending on the occasion. You can either choose a hat in a complementary color, such as gray, brown or black, add some contrast with a pastel or neutral shade like white, ecru, or pink, or be bold with a daring hat in magenta, burgundy, green or red. Of course, the color of hat you choose will depend largely on the occasion you’re attending, whether that’s a wedding, a corporate event or just the office! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While perhaps not the best accessory for indoor events (nobody wants to be THAT guy), sunglasses or shades are a great accessory for hot summer days when you’re having lunch at the park or on your way to meet clients. Aviator styles are a cool retro option to pair with your <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong>, or opt for a classic black framed pair of shades for classic style. For something a little more on-trend, a round, horn-rimmed tortoiseshell pair of sunglasses is a colorful option to add to your <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong>! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So, when thinking about what color shirt goes with <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong>, you can be a little more adventurous. Grey and olive green make a great pair, as do <strong>grey</strong> and navy, pink, or pale blue. And even the elusive and risky orange can make friends with <strong>grey</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We’ve all been taught black shoes go with black <strong>pants</strong>– so the idea of wearing gray <strong>pants</strong> with brown shoes might seem a little daunting. But it’s not so much about the color of the trousers, or the shoes, it’s more about the tone or hue. Even a black belt and brown shoes go together, as long as you get the tone right! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What Color Pants Go With Green Shirt? It is best to pair light green T-shirts with light colored <strong>pants</strong>. You can wear a light green shirt with tan or khaki <strong>pants</strong> to many different occasions in a nice, casual look. In addition to light green, white <strong>pants</strong> or other very light colors pair well with it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Patterned <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong>: This is another great option. Of all the basic tones for checkered <strong>pants</strong>, <strong>grey</strong> is our favorite. They often have tones of navy, brown, charcoal, and black running through the print, making it easy to pair them with other items. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grey is like a dream color for fashion. It can be worn in so many ways you will never lack a well-put-together outfit. From day to night – winter to spring, your favorite pair of <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong> can truly be worn all year round. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Casual looks can easily be created with your favorite pair of <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong> by wearing your favorite tank top or t-shirt. Thankfully, <strong>grey</strong> is so versatile that it won’t matter if your favorite is an old band tee or a nicer v-neck. All tank tops can look great, too – choose a plain ribbed scoop neck or a strappier tank with lace embellishment – either will be cool and casual. For casual looks – tennis shoes are trendy and comfortable – sandals, of course, for warmer weather. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Accessories are your opportunity to add a little fun and personalization to your outfit. Even the most somber charcoal <strong>pants</strong> and brown shoes combination can be spiced up with accessories. So, what accessories could you add to your outfit? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For example, in this classic outfit, the pleated <strong>pants</strong> have a straight wide leg and a loose-fitting to the pant. The way to balance it out is to wear something fitted on top. Otherwise, if you wear something equally loose on top this could potentially make you look bigger than you actually are. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grey and brown may not be the most interesting color combination, but you can add other colors when it comes to your shirt and other accessories. That’s the beauty of starting with simple <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong> and brown shoes! Start by experimenting with darker colors before adding lighter shades and playing around with patterns. Here are a few ideas for colors and patterns to try: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Shades of blue – or even blue and white stripes – are a welcome look for summer. Medium-toned colors – of any shade or hue – are all welcome matches for <strong>pants</strong> in lighter shades of <strong>grey</strong>. The great thing about <strong>grey</strong> – when paired just right – is that you can get away with wearing just about any shade in any season. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There’s nothing worse than a man wearing mismatched socks – except, perhaps, somebody wearing sports socks with their designer trousers. They say clothes make the man; well, socks make the suit! If you’re wondering ‘Do brown shoes go with <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong>?’ then the answer is yes, but be careful which socks you’re wearing. Here are a few things to think about when choosing the right socks for your outfit: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Remember to style up the rest of the outfit too, you don&rsquo;t just want to be concentrating on a gray shirt and what <strong>pants</strong> color combination to go with. Are you going to wear a jumper over the shirt, perhaps a blazer? Then what shoes are you going to wear? A pair of loafers for somewhere that&rsquo;s a bit more sophisticated, chuck on a pair of Chukka boots for a place that&rsquo;s a bit more casual. Even a pair of Jordans for a much more casual setting, there are a lot of options available to you to explore with Gray <strong>pants</strong> as they are so versatile in nature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Colorful or patterned ties, bow ties, and pocket squares add a little contrast to any outfit. With charcoal <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong> and brown shoes, you could add anything from a simple neutral colored tie to pastel colors such as pale pink or baby blue and even bright, bold colors like purple, magenta, and lime green. Don’t be afraid to use bold, deep colors like navy blue, bottle green, and burgundy too, particularly if you’re attending a formal event, as these will add a touch of class to your outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is another mindblowing combo, a blue shirt with <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong> and brown shoes. This is a formal look. So, you need a full-sleeve dark blue shirt to match your <strong>grey</strong> pant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Does A Green Shirt Go With Grey Pants? Grey is a tonal shade, not a color in its own right, so you can really match it with any color. You can pair a darker <strong>grey</strong> trouser with a lighter shade top – whether it’s green, blue, purple, etc. – and vice versa. You can pair a light <strong>grey</strong> trouser with a dark red, blue, green, or black item. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Green is another cool tone that offers many options for pairing with <strong>grey</strong>. You could go for a more muted tone of green – like sage, army, or olive – and look well put together. Or choose something brighter for a welcome pop of color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now whether your trousers are high-waist or they sit at the hips, these trousers work with almost anything. The best way to wear pleated <strong>pants</strong> is on the loose side. If they are too tight, the pleats will pull and it won’t look as easy going. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It all comes down to math. Now I hate math, it’s never been my strong suit, but even I know that black + white = <strong>grey</strong>. And <strong>grey</strong> just happens to be the ultimate all-purpose shade for <strong>pants</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the best things about <strong>grey</strong> is that it is incredibly versatile. It comes in different shades that can match your mood, the season, or any sort of particular occasion. You can create numerous different looks with just one pair of <strong>pants</strong>, adding value to putting this neutral in your closet. So, what color shirts go with <strong>grey</strong>? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Conventional wisdom holds that the first pair of dress <strong>pants</strong> you get (aka trousers for fancy people, and also people who don’t want Brits to think we’re talking about underwear) should be light gray. That’s on account of their ultimate versatility. From a color perspective, gray is neutral, so it’ll pair with every color you’d want to wear (except other light gray tops that are too close in brightness to the <strong>pants</strong>). From a contrast perspective, they complement most of the jackets you’ll be buying in the world of classic menswear: navy, dark browns, dark greens, even jackets in the tan range like gun clubs, etc. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A dressier evening look is to wear <strong>grey</strong> silk separates if you can find them. A silk or polyester bow blouse matched with silk polyester palazzo <strong>pants</strong> in textured or tone- on- tone fabric or an unusual colorful print look very elegant and more unusual than black. A belt with a beautiful buckle complete the look. If you go for pattern or floral prints, match a camisole, bustier or off the shoulder top to one of the predominant colors in the pattern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grey is an invaluable color in your wardrobe – its versatility is key for creating countless looks for every season and occasion. Grey can be dressed up or down – one of the greatest things about this neutral is that it looks classy even when worn casually. Grey looks great with neutrals and colors alike. Below we will go over eight specific examples of colors that look great with a pair of <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For an easily matched outfit, go for a charcoal or mid <strong>grey</strong> three-piece trouser suit with slim leg <strong>pants</strong>, vest, and a jacket. All you’ll need is a pair of heels and some stylish jewelry to feminize the look. Pop a shirt or sweater under the vest when the temperature drops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But jokes on them, because charcoal <strong>pants</strong> do everything black <strong>pants</strong> do. They especially pair beautifully with—you guessed it—black. Wearing charcoal <strong>pants</strong> to an all-black outfit adds a little dimension to your look, without you having to sacrifice your favorite all-black-everything image. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of my absolute favorite color combinations – is pink and <strong>grey</strong>. There’s just something about it that makes everything feel right. Shades of pink – dark or light – look great when worn with <strong>grey</strong> – also in just about any shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To make it simple, I’ve attached a video, which outlines 7 simple ways to style one pair of high waist pleated <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong>. Create multiple looks for different occasions whether it is formal or casual. I hope you find it helpful. Also, check out the video to see how I would wear each look! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re looking for an easy way to create a good look for a pair of <strong>pants</strong> in a lighter <strong>grey</strong> – look for a darker shirt. Contrast is the number one easy way to put together a nice look. Black is the obvious choice – but a darker color can look just as great. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Contrast is a go-to when putting together an outfit. If you have a lighter pair of <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong> – opt for a shirt in a darker shade of blue. Something bright, medium, or even a deep navy – would look sharp paired with a nice pair of light <strong>grey</strong> slacks. If your <strong>pants</strong> are on the darker side, there are myriad shades of lighter blue to choose from that would look just as great. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>All of the hues complement <strong>grey</strong> well, including emerald, sage, lime, and teal, as well as reds like crimson, burgundy, and purple, as well as purples like violet, lavender, and periwinkle. If you pair gold or lemon with dark <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong>, they will look great. Colors of all stripes can be mixed and matched, with pastels such as turquoise, coral, and rose pink. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grey and taupe are the most neutral of all the neutrals. This outfit is extremely well-balanced. The slimness of the <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong> compliments the oversized, intentional messiness of the pullover. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grey <strong>pants</strong> are the perfect option to be work ready by pairing them with a nice blue or white button-down shirt. A sweater or blazer over the top looks clean and sophisticated as well. Burgundy and navy blue are great choices for darker colors. Light pink or green are perfect for spring. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now if you have read about what color shirt goes with Navy <strong>pants</strong>, then you will know that Navy Blue is also a great option for those wearing a Gray shirt. This is a nice level up from the playing it safely above, however, is not too out there either. This is a go-between for those who want to inject a bit of life and color into their outfit, but don&rsquo;t want to go too far with it either. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Black is an obvious choice when looking for something that will look good with <strong>grey</strong>. It will provide desirable contrast – if the <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong> are of a lighter shade – or create an edgier monochrome look when worn with darker <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong>. However, you choose to wear it – black can always be counted on to create a winning outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A sophisticated, classy color – burgundy matches well with <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong>. As a deep rich tone, it is naturally drawn to medium to light shades of <strong>grey</strong> – providing eye-pleasing contrast in the outfit. Burgundy is a classic color for cooler months – a great choice for winter and fall. Depending on the style of the shirt, it could work well for many different occasions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One thing that’s definitely not recommended is pairing your <strong>grey</strong> dress <strong>pants</strong> with sandals. Yes, it can be hot in the summer months, but sandals will ruin the smart style of your outfit and make you stand out for all the wrong reasons. Ditto for socks with sandals – just don’t go there! For dress shoes in the summer months, loafers and boat shoes are both excellent choices. It’s ok to skip socks in the summer months, but do make sure you’re wearing leather shoes so that your feet can breathe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For a classic style, light <strong>grey</strong> trousers with a pale blue, long-sleeved shirt is hard to get wrong. You can add a patterned tie with checks or stripes, for an individual touch that never strays too far from the classic. This style also works great with a tweed suit during the winter months. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to belts, it’s best to keep things fairly simple. So forget those chunky, cowboy-style belts or anything with too much detailing and instead opt for a chunky or skinny plain leather belt in black, dark <strong>grey</strong>, brown or burgundy to add a touch of style to your <strong>pants</strong>. The simpler the belt, the more you’ll be able to wear it – a black belt goes with anything from jeans to a suit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Choosing a monochrome color palette is a safe choice that looks sharp. Any shade of <strong>grey</strong> and black and/or white will constitute a monochrome look. Depending on the shade of your jeans – a black or white shirt can provide contrast while staying within the monochrome boundary. Another shade of <strong>grey</strong> will work too. T-shirts are the natural pairing for jeans – so this is the perfect pair of <strong>pants</strong> to wear with your favorite one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A white tank or tee would look clean as a more casual getup. Compared to a black shirt – a white top would provide a contrasting aesthetic when worn with darker charcoal <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong>. For a lighter overall outfit – white would still look great with a lighter shade of <strong>grey</strong> – especially in the spring or summer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grey <strong>pants</strong> are the perfect <strong>pants</strong> to pair with patterns! Get a comfortable, flattering pair and you’ll be able to put together an infinite number of amazing outfits. Any pattern will look great with a nice-fitting pair of <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong>. Since the color of the <strong>pants</strong> is neutral and versatile – you won’t have to worry about the color palette of the pattern on the shirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>3 The Blues Blue is the most popular color, and a range of shades complement charcoal gray. A sky-blue shade portrays professionalism and reliability, such as the trusty light-blue button-down so frequently paired with charcoal <strong>pants</strong> for the office. A medium hue such as cornflower suggests creativity and is a good-looking combo with charcoal flannel <strong>pants</strong> in both fall and winter. Deep blue shades such as navy connote conservatism, mystery and intrigue, and they are perfect for an dressy casual evening affair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For a casual occasion, many women reach for a pair of blue jeans and call it a night. Grey jeans are an alternative to black or dark denim jeans that help you stand out from the crowd. You can also transition smoothly from day to night with <strong>grey</strong> trousers by swapping your blazer for a leather jacket in dark green, purple, burgundy or cream and pair a camisole, sweater or blouse to add color. Change your trouser shoes to <strong>grey</strong> heels or ankle boots - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Any color shoe can go with <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong> and red, purple, burgundy or a deep silvery metallic are unusual choices. A good optical illusion is to wear <strong>grey</strong> mid-heel boots or shoes with <strong>grey</strong> hosiery that will elongate your legs when the eye is taken directly from knee to floor. You can pick funky shoes such as <strong>grey</strong> and beige snakeskin when the accessory will pop or moccasins to make the outfit more traditional or casual. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grey is great for running around town – it’s also a sharp look for the office. A tailored pair of <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong> will always look sleek and sophisticated when paired with the right shirt. A classic woven button-up is the epitome of workplace wear – under a cardigan or blazer if the weather permits. Fitted sweaters are great for the workplace – especially with a collared shirt underneath and when paired with a classy pair of heels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Because of that, this is when splurging a little is a good idea. Always invest in the most high-end basics, and save frugality for when you decide you want to buy orange <strong>pants</strong>. (Hopefully, that day will never come.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It works better when the Gray shirt tends to be a distinctively darker shade than the <strong>pants</strong>. You don&rsquo;t really want to have it all the same shade, so make sure there is some distinction there when pairing up the Gray shirt and <strong>pants</strong> combination. Pair this with a Brown leather belt and some Brown loafers or Chukka boots to complete the overall look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Beige is a color that can sometimes be overlooked – often categorized as boring or bland. But despite its neutrality, beige can provide the perfect base for an eye-catching outfit. Beige – in varying tones – works wonderfully when paired with <strong>grey</strong>. The key is choosing a shade that works well with your skin tone – then pair it with a complementary shade of <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now depending on you definition, these aren&rsquo;t strictly <strong>pants</strong> but they are a great option to pair with a Gray shirt. Plus, if you are after a lot more of a casual look that&rsquo;s easy to pull off but it is a classic go to, then you can&rsquo;t go far wrong with a Gray shirt and the ripped denim jeans look. Again, you can opt for Black jeans but personally a proper blue denim can be a really good look as the jeans actually pop the color whereas the Gray helps to neutralise it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to dress it up just a bit – but not so much as to be office-ready – <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong> are a perfect choice for a smart casual look. Structured tops and flirty blouses – in any color or pattern – are a bit nicer than a plain black or white tee. But if you do want to wear a fitted t-shirt, throw a blazer on top and you’ll be ready to go! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grey leggings? No: Not ever. Normally we’re not one for staunch rules, but heather <strong>grey</strong> leggings are up there with tight white capri <strong>pants</strong>. Wear properly-tailored trousers: This is the last thing to keep in mind with <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong>, although it’s not <strong>grey</strong> pant-specific. If you, like most of us, aren’t a standard off-the-rack shape and size, taking the time to have your <strong>pants</strong> properly fitted is important. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So, you’ve chosen your <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong> and now you’re wondering just how to select the right brown shoes to complement your amazing trousers! The good news is that brown shoes come in a huge variety of different styles, so you’re bound to find the right pair. Think about when you want to wear the shoes – for example, is it for an event with a dress code, or are you looking for something more casual? It’s also a good idea to consider the time of year, as you may want to select dress shoes for winter and something more casual like loafers for the summer months. Here are just a few of the different styles available: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Watches are a very personal style statement and whether you’re wearing one that was a gift or have chosen it yourself, it speaks volumes about your style and personality. With <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong> and brown shoes, accessories can either be simple or colorful. A sleek, black watch with a metal strap keeps it simple and adds a touch of class to your outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Play it safe by pairing a black or white shirt with your <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong>. If you’re heading to an important meeting or event, a collared, long-sleeved shirt is obviously going to be your best option. For something more casual, a short-sleeved shirt is the way to go. You can always add interest with a patterned tie in navy, black or white, if you like. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>4 Fade To Black Then, of course, there is black &ndash; a classic color to wear with charcoal gray. You can pair charcoal flannel <strong>pants</strong> with a black, cashmere turtleneck sweater in the winter, and team charcoal worsted wool slacks with a matte black, cotton-blend dress shirt in the summer. These looks work for multiple occasions, including after-work gatherings, dancing and Casual Friday office wear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Any pattern – from ornate to simple – can work well with <strong>grey</strong>. Simple stripes – in any combination of colors – and polka dots can add slight interest to the outfit. Checks and plaid are great with <strong>grey</strong> as well – especially for fall. When the <strong>grey</strong> weather rolls around – why not bring out the <strong>grey</strong> <strong>pants</strong> and your favorite plaid flannel as well?! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://cdnb.lystit.com/photos/2013/11/01/jcrew-grey-ludlow-slim-suit-pant-in-prince-of-wales-glen-plaid-english-wool-product-5-14604020-134337252.jpeg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="What Color Goes Well With Dark Grey Pants - What Colors Go With Charcoal Grey Clothes">
