There’s no scanning or faxing. And overall, it lacks some of the sophisticated features of other models on this list. But if you’re just looking for a hardworking, high-volume printer this does offers excellent value. - Source: Internet We have already established that buying a modern printer is to increase convenience and reduce the hassle of having to do all things manually. A duplex printer is a printer that can print both sides of the paper either manually or automatically. An automatic duplex printer is the best printer for offices or small business. However, duplex printing is a headache if you have to do it manually, and your small business will suffer if that is the case. In addition, you can accidentally confuse the arrangement and completely mess up the printing process. - Source: Internet Still, if you want to know about our top pick, it has to be the Epson EcoTank Wireless Printer. From superior wireless connectivity to superb printing quality, the printer can cater to all your printing needs and improve workplace efficiency. Since it’s a Supertank printer, it’ll also lower your ink replacement costs. - Source: Internet Besides that, this is a very capable multifunctional printer, offering mono printing, scanning and copying (although not faxing). You can print via Ethernet, USB or Wi-Fi. On the negative side, there’s no duplex printing, the paper capacity is limited to 150 sheets, and the small LCD display isn’t the best. But overall, this is a good, solid performer that delivers quality results, time after time. - Source: Internet It is always safe to turn them off when not in use when using any electronic. Turning the electronics off increases the system’s longevity and reduces the running costs tremendously. However, if you are busy and do not have the time to move around switching off electronics, an auto-off feature on the electronic will make work very easy for you. For example, you can have an easy time knowing your printer will not be running all night, even if you forget to switch it off. In addition, commercial environments can use an auto-off feature on electronics because no one will claim responsibility in a sea of employees if something goes wrong. - Source: Internet Moving on with our list, we bring you the Canon imagePROGRAF wide-format color printer for architects. It delivers gallery-quality prints that can bring your architectural diagrams and designs to life. The superior inkjet printing technology makes printing so much easier and enhances your productivity. - Source: Internet This laser printer from HP has the name ‘Neverstop’ because it uses a refillable toner tank instead of disposable cartridges. This isn’t just good for the environment, it also saves you money: up to 60 per cent on toner each time you reload. Not to mention that you’re already getting 5,000 pages of toner right out of the box. - Source: Internet Printers have a minimum print quality of 600x600, and prints with that quality are black and white printers. A wide format printer that prints in color can have a resolution of up to 4800x2400. Such a printer prints pictures with excellent quality that can do well in a commercial setting. Laser printers do pretty well because of the printing technique, which is accurate and advanced. An all-in-one printer will get you the images that make sense in an office setting. - Source: Internet It also offers auto-duplex printing and convenient media handling, along with an excellent speed that allows you to print stacks of documents instantly. It offers print speeds of 9.2 ISO PPM for black-and-white and 9.0 ISO PPM for color prints. Also, thanks to its fast wireless connectivity, the printer supports printing documents and photos directly from your laptops, Android tablets, or iPhones. - Source: Internet If you will buy a laser printer, then it is vital to know the difference between laser printers and inkjet printers. The printers, more often than not, give similar results. However, a laser printer is more accurate and crisp than your typical inkjet printer. - Source: Internet On the other hand, a laser printer utilizes static electricity to create characters on the sheet of paper in the printer. Static electricity uses the principle of negatives and positives attracting to create prints on a sheet of paper. Of course, different paper types will react differently to the static charge, but that is nothing to worry about. Once the static electricity is created on the sheet of paper, you will get your print. - Source: Internet Although the printer offers wireless connectivity and supports your Alexa device, you might face certain network glitches. Connecting the machine with your personal Wi-Fi network can be a bit troublesome, and it might take some time to establish a strong connection. So, its poor connectivity can be a letdown while printing important documents. - Source: Internet Not only does it offer wide-format printing, but also delivers exceptional quality in your printer photos and documents. Thanks to its high printing speed, you can develop color and monochrome prints instantly. Moreover, you can use different paper sizes ranging from 3″ x 5″ to 11″ x 17″ as per your requirements. - Source: Internet Xerox WorkCentre 6515dni printer The best colour laser printer for a small office Specifications Output: Color Multifunctional: Yes Wi-Fi: Yes Print speed: 28ppm Paper capacity: 250 Resolution: 1,200 x 2,400dpi Dimensions: 42 x 50.6 x 50cm Weight: 30.7kg Today’s Best Deals View at Adorama (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + High resolution prints + Connect up to 7 people + Scan, copy and fax Reasons to avoid - Expensive - Source: Internet The Epson Workforce multifunction printer is a printer you will love working with. The printer embodies its name as a workforce and delivers good results. The printer has an auto-duple function which massively saves your work and makes your life easier. Having to figure out where which print goes on the back can be a bit frustrating, and the printer gets that taken care of. - Source: Internet Effortless paper handling is another important criterion to consider while purchasing a printer. Always select printers that come with a large feeder tray with a capacity of 250 to 500 sheets. In that way, you don’t need to worry about replacing the papers frequently. Better paper handling facilitates top-notch print speed. - Source: Internet This Epson WorkForce Pro is a great printer for architects as it is highly versatile and durable. It allows high-quality borderless prints, thanks to its PrecisionCore technology. Also, it is compatible with Ethernet and Wi-Fi Direct, thereby offering easy wireless printing. You can also pair it with your Alexa device and use voice commands to control all printing operations. - Source: Internet We can look at 11x17 color laser printers in two ways; paper size and printing techniques. An 11x17 laser printer is a wide format printer and print sizes up to A3, which not many office printers do. In addition, the 11x17 color laser can be considered an all-in-one printer because of the inbuilt and automated functions. You no longer have to manually do anything because of features like the auto document feeder. - Source: Internet Note that this is a one-use printer: there’s no scanning, copying or faxing. And while there is a touchscreen display, it’s pretty small and basic. But that helps keeps the cost down, and so as long as none of these are deal-breakers, this is an excellent value buy. - Source: Internet This is a more obvious reason that affects the printing speed. Tabloid printers have technical specifications that directly impact the printing speed. For example, if you buy a laser printer and an inkjet printer and put them side by side, the paper will not come out at the same time. This is because the printers use different technologies to print the paper, and therefore can not have similar results. Two printers can print the same tabloid size but not at the same rate. - Source: Internet Most laser printers are better than traditional printers in terms of ink usage and ink cost efficiency. They usually come with a larger ink capacity, offering uninterrupted printing. The laser printer inks are much more affordable than traditional cartridges, so you can save a lot of money on ink replacements. - Source: Internet This color laser printer is one the expensive side, but you do get good value for money. The Brother MFC-L3770CDW allows you to print, copy, scan and fax, via Wi-Fi or USB. It has a lovely 9.3cm color touchscreen, that makes it easy to access the printer’s wide range of document handling functions. - Source: Internet Brother HL-L5100DN The best cheap laser printer Specifications Output: Mono Print speed: 40ppm Multifunctional: No Wi-Fi: No Paper capacity: 300 Resolution: 1,200dpi Dimensions: 485 x 450 x 377 mm Weight: 10.7kg Today’s Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Newegg (opens in new tab) View at Walmart (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Low price + Fast print speeds Reasons to avoid - No faxing or scanning - No Wi-Fi - Source: Internet Additionally, having a printer that connects via an ethernet cable or a USB port is an advantage because you can still print when the Wi-Fi is low. Furthermore, having options will ensure you do not get stuck under any circumstances. Finally, having Google cloud print will be one of the best features you can get on a printer. - Source: Internet It starts with a perfect balance of print speed and connectivity. So you will want an 11×17 advanced printer with various connectivity options such as Ethernet, Wireless direct printing, Apple Air Print, Google Cloud Print, and is Wi-Fi certified. The best 11×17 printer should be fast with colour print speeds of up to 40 pages per minute as the average but look for one with faster printing speed if you need it. Although some come at an affordable price, don’t scrimp on quality. Look for an all-in-one printer with an excellent build, compact design, and outstanding production-level performance. - Source: Internet HP Neverstop 1202nw Laser Printer The best laser printer with refillable toner Specifications Output: Mono Multifunctional: Yes Wi-Fi: Yes Print speed: 20ppm Paper capacity: 150 Resolution: 600dpi Dimensions: 38 x 38.5 x 52cm Weight: 8.78kg Today’s Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + 5,000 pages of toner included + Saves money over time + Multifunctional Reasons to avoid - Lacks duplex printing - Source: Internet A newer printer will be more efficient than an older generation printer. While the technology may be similar, one machine can be more efficient in executing the same technology compared to the other machine. One page will take a shorter time to print on the latest technology, and the running costs will differ tremendously. Tabloid size printing speed will slightly differ in the different machines depending on the efficiency. - Source: Internet Next up, we bring you the Epson WorkForce Prowide-format printer that comes with inkjet technology and offers superior professional printing. Like the Epson EcoTank model, it is also an all-in-one printer with copy, fax, and scan functions. Thanks to its wireless quality, printing photos has become quick and hassle-free for professional architects. - Source: Internet What is the biggest difference between a laser printer and an inkjet printer? The printing technique is what makes the biggest difference between the two printers. An inkjet printer has small nozzles that spray ink droplets on the paper as the paper passes through the printer. The inkjet printer uses electricity to create heat, forcing the ink to expand into a bubble and squirt on the paper, creating a print. Once the ink bubble is out, a vacuum is created, and more ink is drawn into the nozzle. As a result, many droplets have to be released to form a single character at any given time. - Source: Internet Xerox is known for high quality and performance, but its printers are generally pretty expensive. Here’s a notable exception. The Xerox B215 offers mono printing, via Ethernet, Wi-Fi or USB, as well as scanning, faxing and copying, at an affordable price. And it’s a very decent performer too. - Source: Internet It comes with a 250-sheet paper tray and a rear feed tray for specialty paper, making it ideal for office use.

It is safe to say that this is one of the best inkjet printers on the market. - Source: Internet You can easily control its operations using the intuitive 2.65″ color touchscreen.

Talking about PC-free printing, you can use this HP printer to directly print from your smartphones and tablets because of its super-fast wireless connectivity. Overall, it can be a great addition to your office to maintain a seamless workflow. - Source: Internet The best laser printer will cost more than an inkjet, and not be that great at printing photos. (If that’s your priority, see our roundup of the best photo printers). But when it comes to printing and copying documents, the quality will be much better. And if you’re printing a lot, you’ll find a laser printer much faster, and with lower running costs overall. - Source: Internet This Canon printer comes with eight dye-based inks that offer amazing and rich color gradients. The three grayscale inks deliver beautiful and sharp black and white prints, while the other inks are excellent for printing colored photos. It also has an image generating system for producing the right colors through optimum ink placement and combination. - Source: Internet Laser printers are pretty good. However, you need to understand that you can pick the resolution you want for your prints. The resolution you use will depend on your reason for printing. For example, if you are working at home and are printing non-commercial prints, there is no need to get a super-high quality printer that will print the crispest images. However, if you are in a commercial setting, a wide format printer with the most detailed images will need for the business to grow. - Source: Internet Check the color gradients that the printer inks offer before purchasing any printer. It’s best to look at printers that deliver an enhanced color gamut producing vivid and stunning color prints. You can choose laser printers or traditional printers, but make sure they come with different ink colors. - Source: Internet An inkjet printer does about 15 pages every minute for black ink. A wide-format color inkjet would take slightly longer than a single-colored printer. If you are printing larger documents, the printing time will take slightly longer than printing smaller ones. An A4 paper takes a shorter time to print than an A3 paper. - Source: Internet Buying a printer is dead easy, you run a search on Google and it gets you the best picks. But getting something that makes a difference is important. Don’t you think? - Source: Internet When we talk about the best printers for architects, it’s impossible not to mention the HP DesignJet large-format printer.

It is an all-in-one printer that works as a scanner, copier, and fax machine. This printer can be ideal for both home and office use. - Source: Internet This Canon PIXMA printer is on the heavier side and weighs around 43.4 pounds, so it’s not easily portable and takes up a lot of space. Before you purchase this printer, make sure you have ample room on the work desk to set it up. - Source: Internet The automatic document feeder works by slotting sheets of paper into the printer without any human aid of any kind. The automatic feeder ensures that the printer can be in another room while in your office.

Therefore, the printer will determine the number of dots per inch printed on paper, and in turn, how much ink you will be using in a month. - Source: Internet This Canon printer is not an all-in-one printer and offers only printing functions.

There&rsquo;s no scanning or faxing. And overall, it lacks some of the sophisticated features of other models on this list. But if you&rsquo;re just looking for a hardworking, high-volume <strong>printer</strong> this does offers excellent value. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We have already established that buying a modern <strong>printer</strong> is to increase convenience and reduce the hassle of having to do all things manually. A duplex <strong>printer</strong> is a <strong>printer</strong> that can print both sides of the paper either manually or automatically. An automatic duplex <strong>printer</strong> is the best <strong>printer</strong> for offices or small business. However, duplex printing is a headache if you have to do it manually, and your small business will suffer if that is the case. In addition, you can accidentally confuse the arrangement and completely mess up the printing process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Still, if you want to know about our top pick, it has to be the Epson EcoTank Wireless Printer. From superior wireless connectivity to superb printing quality, the <strong>printer</strong> can cater to all your printing needs and improve workplace efficiency. Since it’s a Supertank <strong>printer</strong>, it’ll also lower your ink replacement costs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Besides that, this is a very capable multifunctional <strong>printer</strong>, offering mono printing, scanning and copying (although not faxing). You can print via Ethernet, USB or Wi-Fi. On the negative side, there&rsquo;s no duplex printing, the paper capacity is limited to 150 sheets, and the small LCD display isn&rsquo;t the best. But overall, this is a good, solid performer that delivers quality results, time after time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It is always safe to turn them off when not in use when using any electronic. Turning the electronics off increases the system&rsquo;s longevity and reduces the running costs tremendously. However, if you are busy and do not have the time to move around switching off electronics, an auto-off feature on the electronic will make work very easy for you. For example, you can have an easy time knowing your <strong>printer</strong> will not be running all night, even if you forget to switch it off. In addition, commercial environments can use an auto-off feature on electronics because no one will claim responsibility in a sea of employees if something goes wrong. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Moving on with our list, we bring you the Canon imagePROGRAF wide-format color <strong>printer</strong> for architects. It delivers gallery-quality prints that can bring your architectural diagrams and designs to life. The superior inkjet printing technology makes printing so much easier and enhances your productivity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>laser</strong> <strong>printer</strong> from HP has the name &lsquo;Neverstop&rsquo; because it uses a refillable toner tank instead of disposable cartridges. This isn&rsquo;t just good for the environment, it also saves you money: up to 60 per cent on toner each time you reload. Not to mention that you&rsquo;re already getting 5,000 pages of toner right out of the box. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Printers have a minimum print quality of 600x600, and prints with that quality are black and white <strong>printer</strong>s. A wide format <strong>printer</strong> that prints in color can have a resolution of up to 4800x2400. Such a <strong>printer</strong> prints pictures with excellent quality that can do well in a commercial setting. Laser <strong>printer</strong>s do pretty well because of the printing technique, which is accurate and advanced. An all-in-one <strong>printer</strong> will get you the images that make sense in an office setting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It also offers auto-duplex printing and convenient media handling, along with an excellent speed that allows you to print stacks of documents instantly. It offers print speeds of 9.2 ISO PPM for black-and-white and 9.0 ISO PPM for color prints. Also, thanks to its fast wireless connectivity, the <strong>printer</strong> supports printing documents and photos directly from your laptops, Android tablets, or iPhones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you will buy a <strong>laser</strong> <strong>printer</strong>, then it is vital to know the difference between <strong>laser</strong> <strong>printer</strong>s and inkjet <strong>printer</strong>s. The <strong>printer</strong>s, more often than not, give similar results. However, a <strong>laser</strong> <strong>printer</strong> is more accurate and crisp than your typical inkjet <strong>printer</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>On the other hand, a <strong>laser</strong> <strong>printer</strong> utilizes static electricity to create characters on the sheet of paper in the <strong>printer</strong>. Static electricity uses the principle of negatives and positives attracting to create prints on a sheet of paper. Of course, different paper types will react differently to the static charge, but that is nothing to worry about. Once the static electricity is created on the sheet of paper, you will get your print. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although the <strong>printer</strong> offers wireless connectivity and supports your Alexa device, you might face certain network glitches. Connecting the machine with your personal Wi-Fi network can be a bit troublesome, and it might take some time to establish a strong connection. So, its poor connectivity can be a letdown while printing important documents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Not only does it offer wide-format printing, but also delivers exceptional quality in your <strong>printer</strong> photos and documents. Thanks to its high printing speed, you can develop color and monochrome prints instantly. Moreover, you can use different paper sizes ranging from 3″ x 5″ to 11″ x 17″ as per your requirements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=4><li>Xerox WorkCentre 6515dni <strong>printer</strong> The best colour <strong>laser</strong> <strong>printer</strong> for a small office Specifications Output: Color Multifunctional: Yes Wi-Fi: Yes Print speed: 28ppm Paper capacity: 250 Resolution: 1,200 x 2,400dpi Dimensions: 42 x 50.6 x 50cm Weight: 30.7kg Today&rsquo;s Best Deals View at Adorama (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + High resolution prints + Connect up to 7 people + Scan, copy and fax Reasons to avoid - Expensive - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>The Epson Workforce multifunction <strong>printer</strong> is a <strong>printer</strong> you will love working with. The <strong>printer</strong> embodies its name as a workforce and delivers good results. The <strong>printer</strong> has an auto-duple function which massively saves your work and makes your life easier. Having to figure out where which print goes on the back can be a bit frustrating, and the <strong>printer</strong> gets that taken care of. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Effortless paper handling is another important criterion to consider while purchasing a <strong>printer</strong>. Always select <strong>printer</strong>s that come with a large feeder tray with a capacity of 250 to 500 sheets. In that way, you don’t need to worry about replacing the papers frequently. Better paper handling facilitates top-notch print speed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This Epson WorkForce Pro is a great <strong>printer</strong> for architects as it is highly versatile and durable. It allows high-quality borderless prints, thanks to its PrecisionCore technology. Also, it is compatible with Ethernet and Wi-Fi Direct, thereby offering easy wireless printing. You can also pair it with your Alexa device and use voice commands to control all printing operations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We can look at 11x17 color <strong>laser</strong> <strong>printer</strong>s in two ways; paper size and printing techniques. An 11x17 <strong>laser</strong> <strong>printer</strong> is a wide format <strong>printer</strong> and print sizes up to A3, which not many office <strong>printer</strong>s do. In addition, the 11x17 color <strong>laser</strong> can be considered an all-in-one <strong>printer</strong> because of the inbuilt and automated functions. You no longer have to manually do anything because of features like the auto document feeder. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Note that this is a one-use <strong>printer</strong>: there&rsquo;s no scanning, copying or faxing. And while there is a touchscreen display, it&rsquo;s pretty small and basic. But that helps keeps the cost down, and so as long as none of these are deal-breakers, this is an excellent value buy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a more obvious reason that affects the printing speed. Tabloid <strong>printer</strong>s have technical specifications that directly impact the printing speed. For example, if you buy a <strong>laser</strong> <strong>printer</strong> and an inkjet <strong>printer</strong> and put them side by side, the paper will not come out at the same time. This is because the <strong>printer</strong>s use different technologies to print the paper, and therefore can not have similar results. Two <strong>printer</strong>s can print the same tabloid size but not at the same rate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most <strong>laser</strong> <strong>printer</strong>s are better than traditional <strong>printer</strong>s in terms of ink usage and ink cost efficiency. They usually come with a larger ink capacity, offering uninterrupted printing.

The printing technique is what makes the biggest difference between the two <strong>printer</strong>s. An inkjet <strong>printer</strong> has small nozzles that spray ink droplets on the paper as the paper passes through the <strong>printer</strong>. The inkjet <strong>printer</strong> uses electricity to create heat, forcing the ink to expand into a bubble and squirt on the paper, creating a print. Once the ink bubble is out, a vacuum is created, and more ink is drawn into the nozzle. As a result, many droplets have to be released to form a single character at any given time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Xerox is known for high quality and performance, but its <strong>printer</strong>s are generally pretty expensive.
