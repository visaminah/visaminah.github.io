Found only 150 miles away from the popular New York City, Albany is situated on the west bank of the Hudson River. Ranking in the top 50 among the largest metropolitan areas in the United States for its high quality of life and strong job market, Albany is definitely one of the top cities in the state to call home. Its ability to maintain an exciting and fun downtown district alongside a commercial center is one of its most impressive qualities. Plus, even though it is known as a large and progressive city, the area is not as expensive or as crowded as other similar areas. - Source: Internet SIXTY SoHo If you’re looking for a solid mid-range option, check out SIXTY SoHo. This boutique hotel in the heart of Soho features contemporary rooms complete with elegant marble bathrooms, flat-screen TVs, and well-stocked minibars. Hit the gym, then hit Bistro Leo for a sampling of French cuisine. Slip up to the rooftop lounge for a cocktail and some stunning city views. - Source: Internet Stroll the legendary cobbles of Stone Street, dating back to 1658. Take in the neighborhood’s stunning architectural features, or check out quirky hole-in-the-wall eateries. Head harbor-side for some great photo ops. Stand at the top of One World Trade Center for breathtaking vistas of the city, and pay your respects at the National September 11 Memorial and Museum. - Source: Internet Moving to New York City is a dream for many people. The “Center of the Known Universe,” NYC is the heart of the nation’s entertainment, trade, and financial engines. Thousands of new professionals and dreamers come to the city every year to prove themselves and to find their destinies on the streets of the Five Boroughs. - Source: Internet I would recommend staying in downtown Manhattan for young adults visiting New York. This would include the West \u0026 East Village areas, Chelsea, \u0026 Flatiron. You will still have easy access to attractions but will be in the heart of some of the best nightlife and restaurants that the city has to offer. - Source: Internet As depicted in the hit television series Gossip Girl, The Upper East Side is a posh and exclusive residential neighborhood in Manhattan. Considered one of the most affluent neighborhoods in all of New York City, The Upper East Side is the safest neighborhood in Manhattan and has some of the most upscale real estate in the area. Known for its highly-rated prep schools, designer boutiques, classy eateries, and luxurious townhomes, this is a beautiful neighborhood that offers its residents a sense of peace and quiet away from busy city life. Featuring a mixture of high-rise apartments and brownstones, this dense urban neighborhood is found in a perfect location next to Central Park. - Source: Internet Wondering where to stay in New York City? Planning a sightseeing tour of the Big Apple can at first seem overwhelming. There are so many attractions in the city that you won’t want to miss, but seeing all of New York City can take a lifetime. The neighborhood in which you’re staying plays a huge role in your trip. You want to choose a hotel that’s located in an area close to major attractions, such as: - Source: Internet Although the Upper East Side neighborhood in Manhattan is known for upscale living, you can find everything from reasonably priced apartments to luxury townhouses and brownstones. Residents of the Upper East Side enjoy a quieter lifestyle thanks to low crime rates and a shared border with the ever-charming Central Park. But don’t worry—the excitement of the city is still accessible from nearby subway lines 4, 5, 6, F, N, Q, and R. Plus, proximity to high-end cultural establishments—like Museum Mile, Metropolitan Opera, New York Philharmonic, and The Met—makes the Upper East Side one of the best neighborhoods to live in NYC, especially for young professionals and singles who love the arts! - Source: Internet The only part of New York City that is connected to the New York State mainland, the Bronx tends to be an overlooked part of the city. North of Harlem, the borough was known for being the home of most of the city’s ethnic communities. This gave the borough a multicultural flair and flavor that exists nowhere else in the city. While gentrification has threatened this in much of the borough, there are still pockets that survived the push, like the following. - Source: Internet Yes, it gets crowded but there is no more convenient home base than the Theater District, roughly 42nd Street to 50th Street west of Sixth Avenue. This area has the greatest variety of affordable lodging choices, is an easy walk to Fifth Avenue and (of course) Times Square and the theaters. The great central location eliminates the need to fight crowds for transportation after a Broadway show. Another plus: The 42nd Street Broadway subway stop is served by many lines, making it easy to visit other parts of the city. The The Chatwal (luxury) and the Row NYC (midrange) are great places to stay for New York first-timers. - Source: Internet When most people think of New York City — skyscrapers, museums, yellow taxis, Central Park — they are thinking of Manhattan. Manhattan is a narrow island at the center of New York’s five boroughs. While geographically very small, there are dozens upon dozens of small Manhattan neighborhoods offering differing costs of living, unique experiences, and their own mix of residents. Bustling, crowded, and bursting with new things to see and experience around every corner, Manhattan is ideal for someone looking for a fast-paced lifestyle and access to big-city amenities. - Source: Internet In Hudson Yards, you’ll find The Edge Observation Deck, currently the highest outdoor sky deck in the Western Hemisphere. The elevator ride to the outside deck alone is worth the price of admission. Once outside you’ll be rewarded with spectacular views of the city as far as the eye can see. These sights are the reason words like “breathtaking” were invented. If you get tickets for a cloudy day, they will exchange them for a clear day. - Source: Internet Times Square is one of my favorite neighborhoods in Manhattan. It feels like the very soul of the city and reflects its character; brash, in-your-face, unapologetic, exciting, loud, colorful, full of life and flashing neon. It is also one of the central connection points on the New York subway. You can get to anywhere from Times Square. Make sure to download a handy New York City subway map and plan your trip BEFORE you get on the train. - Source: Internet Rents in different neighborhoods pay for different benefits. In Queens or Staten Island, you get more space for your money but sacrifice quick access to Manhattan luxuries like shopping, dining, and a shorter commute. For some, it’s worth being farther out to enjoy extra square footage. Especially if you have or plan on having children, you’ll want to consider whether you want to live in a building with less space or a home with a yard. Regardless of where you end up, you’ll want to find reliable city moving and storage services to help you navigate moving to your new home in the Big Apple. - Source: Internet Found in Monroe County in northwestern New York, the city of Rochester is the third most populous city in the state. Located on Lake Ontario, Rochester is a unique city that is steeped in history and culture. While many residents tend to gravitate towards the suburbs instead of living in the downtown area, many single-family homes that are available are over 100 years old. Since most buildings are undergoing recent massive renovations, the city is witnessing a spike in growth and interest in innovation. - Source: Internet The High Line is actually a city park built on an abandoned elevated train track. It starts at about 34th Street at Hudson Yards, although it is being further extended north, and ends at Grosvenor Street in the Meatpacking District. The railroad tracks were going to be demolished but someone had the bright idea of turning it into a “floating park,” a crazy idea in a city of crazy ideas that worked. Today, this 2 mile stretch of city park winds through tenements, luxury buildings, gardens, art exhibits and coffee shops – the only structure of its kind in the world. - Source: Internet One of the best places to stay to avoid the big city rush is Lake Placid. Here, the mountains roll across the scenery like waves and the glassy lake shimmers under the summer sun. Lake Placid is well, placid. It’s a tranquil experience that is a great opportunity for travelers to take a deep breath and for residents to enjoy a relaxed, outdoor lifestyle. - Source: Internet Queens is the easternmost borough of New York City, and geographically the largest of the five. With a relaxed, suburban feel, Queens neighborhoods are unpretentious but still close to the big-city perks you love. Bonus: as one of the most diverse areas in the nation, you’ll enjoy incredible ethnic food options and fabulous music. - Source: Internet The southern-most city on NJ’s Gold Coast is Bayonne. It’s also one of the newest cities in the area to experience an influx of new residents, as it offers less in the way of public transportation. That’s changed in recent years as the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail was expanded to Bayonne in 2011. A new ferry service from Bayonne to Manhattan is also expected to open in the fall of 2020. This means that commuting from Bayonne to Downtown Manhattan takes about 30-40 minutes or about 50 minutes to Midtown. - Source: Internet Across the street from Rockefeller Center is Saint Patrick’s Cathedral (the famous new one). Go inside and admire the Gothic architecture and stained glass windows. Saint Patrick’s is on New York’s Fifth Avenue, perhaps the city’s most famous street. Here is where all the top brand store are located. Just stroll the avenue and enjoy a few hours of window shopping. - Source: Internet This influx, however, has made New York City among the most expensive cities to live in. Three of the city’s five boroughs—Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens—are among the fifteen most expensive cities in the United States in which to find housing in 2021. New York City can also be a dangerous place to live. While not as crime-ridden as it was in the 1980s and 1990s, the city saw a 59% jump in crime in 2022 from the year before. Property crimes are leading this increase, with auto theft jumping 105%, and grand larceny up 79%. - Source: Internet According to US News and World Report’s latest ranking of best places to live in the US, one of the world’s favorite concrete jungles only came up fifth on the New York list. The state’s winner is Albany, which was officially named the best city to live in New York. On a nationwide scale, the New York capital gained the 21st spot, while it is Huntsville, Alabama that brings home the gold medal. - Source: Internet Known as Downtown by most New Yorkers, Manhattan is the beating heart of the city. The home of the city’s government offices, many of the nation’s banks and major stock exchanges, and a large assortment of national and international corporations, the borough is one of the wealthiest communities in the world. With only Miami being more expensive to live in, Manhattan presents a uniquely expensive challenge that many home seekers avoid by targeting the other boroughs. But for those interested in living near the middle of everything, Manhattan offers relatively cheap and safe enclaves like the following. - Source: Internet Note that what qualifies as a “park” in the city can vary widely. One might be a vast green expanse that invites you to lounge and picnic. Another might be a series of benches on a boulevard. The best advice is to visit your nearest parks in person if green space is essential to you. - Source: Internet For city slickers, the Hudson Valley has been a popular choice for local travel and to move permanently. Poughkeepsie has been at the center of this movement, and provides all who come with a long list of fun things to do. The downtown area is laden with delightful restaurants and pubs, there are 17 public parks, a dozen museums (including the Roosevelt Presidential Library) and an abundance of local nature. - Source: Internet This is the buzzing financial heart of the city, home to Wall Street and glittering skyscrapers that form deep canyons between the buildings. Wall Street is named after an actual wall. The Dutch built a wall to separate the settlers from the native Americans and the name stuck. Today the area is called both the Financial District, Wall Street and sometimes lower Manhattan. - Source: Internet Comprised of five separate boroughs, residents should first decide whether they want to live in Manhattan, Queens, The Bronx, Brooklyn, or Staten Island. Located in different sections throughout the city, each borough has its own unique vibe and amenities for its residents. Whether you want to live in a trendy and chic neighborhood or an industrial and artsy district, New York City has a place for you. With so many people moving to the state of New York it’s no surprise New York City is one of the most popular destinations for those relocating. We have put together another great list if you decide that living in New York City is not for you and want to check out some of the other best places to live in the state of New York. - Source: Internet “If someone is completely new to the city, the best advice I give them is to first reach out to any family or friends and get some guidance from them,” says Nora Ali, a licensed real estate salesperson for Corcoran. “The next thing I always recommend is for them actually to go and spend time in areas of interest.” - Source: Internet Before the beautiful new Saint Patrick’s Cathedral on Fifth Avenue there was the Basilica of Saint Patrick’s Old Cathedral in the Nolita neighborhood near SOHO. Built between 1809 and 1815, it was the heart of the Catholic community until the new Saint Patrick’s Cathedral was built in 1879. Back in its heyday religious services were celebrated in English, Italian and German. Today they are celebrated in English, Spanish and Chinese. That’s New York for you, the always evolving and accommodating city of immigrants. - Source: Internet A lively neighborhood in Manhattan, Murray Hill is known to draw in recent graduates and young people in NYC due to its reasonable rent prices and casual bar scene. Singles and young professionals often unwind at bars in Murray Hill for after-work drinks and happy hours, so you’ll have no trouble meeting new people in this Manhattan neighborhood. Plus, Murray Hill is close to Midtown and a short walk from Grand Central Terminal, making it easy to get to other parts of the city. And while pre-war townhouses and Beaux-Arts mansions line the streets of Murray Hill, you can also find great deals on roomy Murray Hill high-rise apartments with views of the Empire State Building and Chrysler Building. - Source: Internet Brooklyn is different now, compared to just 20 years ago. Due to gentrification, many of the borough’s historic neighborhoods—mostly home to Black and Latino communities—have been taken over by the influx of new residents that found the high rents of Manhattan untenable. The borough’s proximity to Manhattan has largely turned the city’s second-largest borough into a sleeper community. Despite this, Brooklyn remains colorful, loud, and proud. - Source: Internet Staten Island is the cheapest borough to live in New York City in part because it is the most removed from Manhattan. Accessible only by one bridge or by ferries from the rest of NYC, Staten Island has the feel of being more akin to New Jersey than New York. Almost all of Staten Island’s neighborhoods top the list of the cheapest places to live in the city. - Source: Internet Walking south on the High Line, just before it ends, is Little Island, one of Manhattan’s newest attractions. The brainchild of fashion maven Diane Von Furstenberg and husband, mogul Barry Diller, Little Island is 2.5 acres of nature that appear to be floating on the Hudson River. The concept is unique; separate giant pods of greenery joined together to support a beautiful city park. - Source: Internet What makes Bayonne a great place to live in is the attractive real estate prices, which are some of the lowest you’ll find anywhere on the New Jersey Gold Coast, its family-friendly atmosphere, and the many wonderful parks in the city. Best of all, Bayonne is a very safe area and has also been experiencing a development boom. Numerous residential buildings are under construction, and many new businesses have opened their doors in the city, including Costco. - Source: Internet Soho Grand Hotel The Soho Grand Hotel couldn’t be more central: it’s right on Broadway! This luxury hotel is close to art galleries, designer shops, and popular restaurants. The Soho Grand features an outdoor restaurant, and all rooms have cityscape views. Work up a sweat in the 24-hour gym, then treat yourself to a cocktail in the Club Room, or slip out to the patio to enjoy an alfresco meal. - Source: Internet Home to both the largest city and biggest state park in the country, New York provides residents with urban playgrounds and impressive natural amenities. While New York City garners much of the tourism attention, the rest of the state offers highly livable communities. The best places to live in New York include Albany, Syracuse and White Plains. Residents enjoy a wealth of entertainment options from Broadway shows to pro sports teams like the New York Yankees and the Buffalo Bills. - Source: Internet Union Square has one of the best farmer’s markets in the city and plenty of restaurants \u0026 stores surrounding it. For an underrated and relatively unknown view, you can head to the top floor of DSW Warehouse (south side) and Barnes and Noble (north side) for great views of the NYC skyline. The area also has some of the best bookstores in NYC. - Source: Internet Union Square is centrally located toward the southern tip of Manhattan. It is just east of Chelsea and northeast of Greenwich Village. The Flatiron building, which was constructed in the early 20th century, is probably the most iconic sight in this part of the city. One of the biggest advantages of the Union Square/Flatiron area is that it is located at a central hub of the New York City subway system, making it a convenient place to stay for those who are planning on getting around by subway. Tip: Union Square/Flatiron is a good option for an area to stay if you want to hit both Midtown attractions like Times Square and the Empire State Building while also making it to some of the major attractions way downtown like the Statue of Liberty and the 9/11 Memorial \u0026 Museum. - Source: Internet Central Park is the lungs of New York City. I shudder to imagine what the city would be without it. Established in 1858 on 778 acres of city land, the park was designed by architect Frederick Law Olmstead (the same who built the Biltmore Estate) and landscape architect Calvert Vaux who had won a competition to design a city greenspace. - Source: Internet Buffalo is the second-most populous city in New York State and remains an industrial hot-spot. Located on Lake Erie, Buffalo is a prime waterfront destination that is only 20-miles away from Niagra Falls and is considered to be the best town to live in upstate New York. Even though this industrial city took a major hit during the Great Depression back in the day, the area has been making a comeback over the years as more businesses decide to call Buffalo home. While this may be a major city, the small-town and welcoming feel that it provides its residents is one of the major draws to the area. Plus, housing costs, utilities, groceries, and health care costs are all below the national average which makes this an affordable place to live in New York State. - Source: Internet New York City is known to be the largest metropolitan area in the United States. Recognized for its thriving financial district and awe-inspiring skyscrapers, the city stands as a beacon of freedom and hope for people all over the world. While the Statue of Liberty stands as a gateway to the land of opportunity, nearly 900,000 people are moving to New York City every single year. Even though the city is famous for its large expenses and high rent prices, there are plenty of fantastic neighborhoods and safe areas that can fit any budget. - Source: Internet New York is made up of five major areas or “boroughs,” some separated by rivers and connected via ferry or bridge. So, what are the five boroughs of New York? Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and The Bronx. Read on to explore which area of New York is right for what you’re looking for in our NYC neighborhood guide for the five New york boroughs, explained. - Source: Internet The High Line ends at Gansevoort Street in the heart of the Meatpacking District. This area started off as a Lenape Indian trading post before the Dutch arrived. Then it became an army fort. Much later it became the city’s official slaughterhouse where cattle and partially processed meats were transported by rail from the country’s cattle ranches to be packed and distributed to restaurants and warehouses, hence the area’s name. - Source: Internet As the fifth most populous city in the state, Syracuse provides the perfect mix of urban and suburban living to its residents alongside safe and sought-after neighborhoods. Plus, with access to the great outdoors, spend the day at an award-winning winery, try out a new hiking trail, or put the snow to good use by skiing and snowboarding. Not only is this a great place to live with many things to do, but its location in central New York makes it only a four-hour drive to New York City and a three-hour drive to Buffalo. - Source: Internet There are two places in Manhattan that if you don’t visit you can’t really say you’ve been in the city. One is Times Square (you’ll see why as you read on) and the other is the Statue of Liberty on Liberty Island. If you’re in New York City for the first time, you really have to visit the Statue of Liberty. There is also a new museum on the on the island which is interactive and informative. - Source: Internet The city provides a constant sense of adventure for newly minted New Yorkers. Where else can you ogle world-famous art, nosh on soup dumplings, then beeline to the beach to watch the sunset with your toes in the sand? But if all you know about NYC comes from binge-watching TV shows and movies, you may be a little worried about how it is in real life. The big question: which NYC neighborhoods are right for you to stake your flag in? We chatted with real estate experts and longtime New Yorkers for advice on finding the best NYC neighborhood for you, depending on your preferences and lifestyle. - Source: Internet Trinity Church. This is the first church built in the city and once was the highest structure in town. The church’s cemetery is even more interesting. Alexander Hamilton tomb is the highlight. Make sure to leave a coin on the tomb. - Source: Internet There aren’t many big towns in New York that get as much snow as Syracuse. It’s no surprise the Upstate city is the punchline of many a weather joke. In Syracuse, over 120 inches of snow falls annually, but for locals it’s an easy trade off as they enjoy a strong communal culture and some fantastic outdoor opportunities. - Source: Internet North of SOHO is Greenwich Village one of Manhattan’s oldest neighborhoods. In the 1800s and early 1900s The Village was one of the most posh neighborhoods to live in Manhattan. In the 1960s it was the center of counter culture New York City. Today it still retains some of its counterculture-ish character. Some of the city’s best jazz clubs are here and at the center of it all sits Washington Square park with its central fountain, massive arch, street musicians and colorful characters. - Source: Internet Move to Manhattan if you’re looking for a classic “New York City” experience. Convenient for those who work on the island, there’s also never a shortage of things to do in Manhattan, no matter the time. Well-connected and densely populated, Manhattan is city living at its core. With this prime location and added convenience often comes a higher price tag and less living space. Keep in mind that the cost of extra storage space may need to be factored into your total expenses! - Source: Internet There are pockets of the city that are relatively cheap to find housing in and have a lower crime rate. While the average rent in NYC is just over $3,500 a month for a one-bedroom apartment—more than twice the national average of $1,450—not all boroughs are the same. Manhattan drives up the average with an average monthly rent of $4,140, per RentCafé. Brooklyn comes in at $3,080 per month, Queens at $2,683, the Bronx at $1,628, and Staten Island at $1,400. Even the most expensive boroughs have enclaves where you can find a good deal on your lease without sacrificing your safety and well-being. - Source: Internet It’s a charming town but far from sleepy. As adorable and colorful as Ithaca is, there’s much to do here. Beyond the galleries and chic cafes, there is fantastic hiking to embark on in the city’s surrounds, including the 100+ gorges and waterfalls within minutes of downtown. - Source: Internet With a lifestyle that balances a perfect mixture of work and play, it is easy to see why New York State is such a desirable place to live.

By factoring in safety, affordability, and overall quality of life, our team has comprised this city guide to help you decide where you belong. While there may be many cities to choose from, it is important to first consider what you desire most in a new home and community. - Source: Internet The Bronx is home of the New York Yankees, is the cradle of hip hop, and boasts the biggest park in the city. Geographically, this borough is located north of Manhattan over the Harlem River. The Bronx features plenty of attractions that make it a unique place to live, including Pelham Bay Park, Bronx Zoo, Yankee Stadium, and phenomenal opportunities to experience culture. What’s the downside? While the subway is set up to take people back and forth to Manhattan, transportation within the borough itself can be a bit cumbersome. - Source: Internet Museum of the City of New York. This exceptional museum does justice to the city it represents. Learn about the history of New York from its founding to the present via dramatic and innovative exhibits presented in multi-media. - Source: Internet As if all the interesting little historical tidbits about Old Saint Patrick’s were not enough, there is a catacomb beneath the church where famous New Yorkers are buried and you can actually visit their tombs deep in the vaults of the city. One celebrity buried there is Francis Delmonico, founder of the first restaurant in NYC. Others include politicians, actors and even a countess. The underground catacomb tour is one of the the most interesting and underrated New York City attractions you can have in town.

Found only 150 miles away from the popular New York City, Albany is situated on the west bank of the Hudson River. Ranking in the top 50 among the largest metropolitan areas in the United States for its high quality of life and strong job market, Albany is definitely one of the top cities in the state to call home. Its ability to maintain an exciting and fun downtown district alongside a commercial center is one of its most impressive qualities. Plus, even though it is known as a large and progressive <strong>city</strong>, the area is not as expensive or as crowded as other similar areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>SIXTY SoHo If you’re looking for a solid mid-range option, check out SIXTY SoHo. This boutique hotel in the heart of Soho features contemporary rooms complete with elegant marble bathrooms, flat-screen TVs, and well-stocked minibars. Hit the gym, then hit Bistro Leo for a sampling of French cuisine. Slip up to the rooftop lounge for a cocktail and some stunning <strong>city</strong> views. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Stroll the legendary cobbles of Stone Street, dating back to 1658. Take in the neighborhood’s stunning architectural features, or check out quirky hole-in-the-wall eateries. Head harbor-side for some great photo ops. Stand at the top of One World Trade Center for breathtaking vistas of the <strong>city</strong>, and pay your respects at the National September 11 Memorial and Museum. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Moving to New York City is a dream for many people. The “Center of the Known Universe,” NYC is the heart of the nation’s entertainment, trade, and financial engines. Thousands of new professionals and dreamers come to the <strong>city</strong> every year to prove themselves and to find their destinies on the streets of the Five Boroughs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I would recommend staying in downtown Manhattan for young adults visiting New York. This would include the West & East Village areas, Chelsea, & Flatiron. You will still have easy access to attractions but will be in the heart of some of the best nightlife and restaurants that the <strong>city</strong> has to offer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As depicted in the hit television series Gossip Girl, The Upper East Side is a posh and exclusive residential neighborhood in Manhattan. Considered one of the most affluent neighborhoods in all of New York City, The Upper East Side is the safest neighborhood in Manhattan and has some of the most upscale real estate in the area. Known for its highly-rated prep schools, designer boutiques, classy eateries, and luxurious townhomes, this is a beautiful neighborhood that offers its residents a sense of peace and quiet away from busy <strong>city</strong> life. Featuring a mixture of high-rise apartments and brownstones, this dense urban neighborhood is found in a perfect location next to Central Park. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wondering where to stay in New York City? Planning a sightseeing tour of the Big Apple can at first seem overwhelming. There are so many attractions in the <strong>city</strong> that you won&rsquo;t want to miss, but seeing all of New York City can take a lifetime. The neighborhood in which you&rsquo;re staying plays a huge role in your trip. You want to choose a hotel that&rsquo;s located in an area close to major attractions, such as: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although the Upper East Side neighborhood in Manhattan is known for upscale living, you can find everything from reasonably priced apartments to luxury townhouses and brownstones. Residents of the Upper East Side enjoy a quieter lifestyle thanks to low crime rates and a shared border with the ever-charming Central Park. But don’t worry—the excitement of the <strong>city</strong> is still accessible from nearby subway lines 4, 5, 6, F, N, Q, and R. Plus, proximity to high-end cultural establishments—like Museum Mile, Metropolitan Opera, New York Philharmonic, and The Met—makes the Upper East Side one of the best neighborhoods to live in NYC, especially for young professionals and singles who love the arts! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The only part of New York City that is connected to the New York State mainland, the Bronx tends to be an overlooked part of the <strong>city</strong>. North of Harlem, the borough was known for being the home of most of the <strong>city</strong>’s ethnic communities. This gave the borough a multicultural flair and flavor that exists nowhere else in the <strong>city</strong>. While gentrification has threatened this in much of the borough, there are still pockets that survived the push, like the following. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yes, it gets crowded but there is no more convenient home base than the Theater District, roughly 42nd Street to 50th Street west of Sixth Avenue. This area has the greatest variety of affordable lodging choices, is an easy walk to Fifth Avenue and (of course) Times Square and the theaters. The great central location eliminates the need to fight crowds for transportation after a Broadway show. Another plus: The 42nd Street Broadway subway stop is served by many lines, making it easy to visit other parts of the <strong>city</strong>. The The Chatwal (luxury) and the Row NYC (midrange) are great places to stay for New York first-timers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When most people think of New York City — skyscrapers, museums, yellow taxis, Central Park — they are thinking of Manhattan. Manhattan is a narrow island at the center of New York’s five boroughs. While geographically very small, there are dozens upon dozens of small Manhattan neighborhoods offering differing costs of living, unique experiences, and their own mix of residents. Bustling, crowded, and bursting with new things to see and experience around every corner, Manhattan is ideal for someone looking for a fast-paced lifestyle and access to big-<strong>city</strong> amenities. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In Hudson Yards, you’ll find The Edge Observation Deck, currently the highest outdoor sky deck in the Western Hemisphere. The elevator ride to the outside deck alone is worth the price of admission. Once outside you’ll be rewarded with spectacular views of the <strong>city</strong> as far as the eye can see. These sights are the reason words like “breathtaking” were invented. If you get tickets for a cloudy day, they will exchange them for a clear day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Times Square is one of my favorite neighborhoods in Manhattan. It feels like the very soul of the <strong>city</strong> and reflects its character; brash, in-your-face, unapologetic, exciting, loud, colorful, full of life and flashing neon. It is also one of the central connection points on the New York subway. You can get to anywhere from Times Square. Make sure to download a handy New York City subway map and plan your trip BEFORE you get on the train. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Rents in different neighborhoods pay for different benefits. In Queens or Staten Island, you get more space for your money but sacrifice quick access to Manhattan luxuries like shopping, dining, and a shorter commute. For some, it’s worth being farther out to enjoy extra square footage. Especially if you have or plan on having children, you’ll want to consider whether you want to live in a building with less space or a home with a yard. Regardless of where you end up, you’ll want to find reliable <strong>city</strong> moving and storage services to help you navigate moving to your new home in the Big Apple. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Found in Monroe County in northwestern New York, the <strong>city</strong> of Rochester is the third most populous <strong>city</strong> in the state. Located on Lake Ontario, Rochester is a unique <strong>city</strong> that is steeped in history and culture. While many residents tend to gravitate towards the suburbs instead of living in the downtown area, many single-family homes that are available are over 100 years old. Since most buildings are undergoing recent massive renovations, the <strong>city</strong> is witnessing a spike in growth and interest in innovation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The High Line is actually a <strong>city</strong> park built on an abandoned elevated train track. It starts at about 34th Street at Hudson Yards, although it is being further extended north, and ends at Grosvenor Street in the Meatpacking District. The railroad tracks were going to be demolished but someone had the bright idea of turning it into a “floating park,” a crazy idea in a <strong>city</strong> of crazy ideas that worked. Today, this 2 mile stretch of <strong>city</strong> park winds through tenements, luxury buildings, gardens, art exhibits and coffee shops – the only structure of its kind in the world. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the best places to stay to avoid the big <strong>city</strong> rush is Lake Placid. Here, the mountains roll across the scenery like waves and the glassy lake shimmers under the summer sun. Lake Placid is well, placid. It’s a tranquil experience that is a great opportunity for travelers to take a deep breath and for residents to enjoy a relaxed, outdoor lifestyle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Queens is the easternmost borough of New York City, and geographically the largest of the five. With a relaxed, suburban feel, Queens neighborhoods are unpretentious but still close to the big-<strong>city</strong> perks you love. Bonus: as one of the most diverse areas in the nation, you’ll enjoy incredible ethnic food options and fabulous music. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The southern-most <strong>city</strong> on NJ’s Gold Coast is Bayonne. It’s also one of the newest cities in the area to experience an influx of new residents, as it offers less in the way of public transportation. That’s changed in recent years as the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail was expanded to Bayonne in 2011. A new ferry service from Bayonne to Manhattan is also expected to open in the fall of 2020. This means that commuting from Bayonne to Downtown Manhattan takes about 30-40 minutes or about 50 minutes to Midtown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Across the street from Rockefeller Center is Saint Patrick’s Cathedral (the famous new one). Go inside and admire the Gothic architecture and stained glass windows. Saint Patrick’s is on New York’s Fifth Avenue, perhaps the <strong>city</strong>’s most famous street. Here is where all the top brand store are located. Just stroll the avenue and enjoy a few hours of window shopping. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This influx, however, has made New York City among the most expensive cities to live in. Three of the <strong>city</strong>’s five boroughs—Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens—are among the fifteen most expensive cities in the United States in which to find housing in 2021. New York City can also be a dangerous place to live. While not as crime-ridden as it was in the 1980s and 1990s, the <strong>city</strong> saw a 59% jump in crime in 2022 from the year before. Property crimes are leading this increase, with auto theft jumping 105%, and grand larceny up 79%. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>According to US News and World Report&rsquo;s latest ranking of best places to live in the US, one of the world&rsquo;s favorite concrete jungles only came up fifth on the New York list. The state&rsquo;s winner is Albany, which was officially named the best <strong>city</strong> to live in New York. On a nationwide scale, the New York capital gained the 21st spot, while it is Huntsville, Alabama that brings home the gold medal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Known as Downtown by most New Yorkers, Manhattan is the beating heart of the <strong>city</strong>. The home of the <strong>city</strong>’s government offices, many of the nation’s banks and major stock exchanges, and a large assortment of national and international corporations, the borough is one of the wealthiest communities in the world. With only Miami being more expensive to live in, Manhattan presents a uniquely expensive challenge that many home seekers avoid by targeting the other boroughs. But for those interested in living near the middle of everything, Manhattan offers relatively cheap and safe enclaves like the following. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Note that what qualifies as a “park” in the <strong>city</strong> can vary widely. One might be a vast green expanse that invites you to lounge and picnic. Another might be a series of benches on a boulevard. The best advice is to visit your nearest parks in person if green space is essential to you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For <strong>city</strong> slickers, the Hudson Valley has been a popular choice for local travel and to move permanently. Poughkeepsie has been at the center of this movement, and provides all who come with a long list of fun things to do. The downtown area is laden with delightful restaurants and pubs, there are 17 public parks, a dozen museums (including the Roosevelt Presidential Library) and an abundance of local nature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is the buzzing financial heart of the <strong>city</strong>, home to Wall Street and glittering skyscrapers that form deep canyons between the buildings. Wall Street is named after an actual wall. The Dutch built a wall to separate the settlers from the native Americans and the name stuck. Today the area is called both the Financial District, Wall Street and sometimes lower Manhattan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Comprised of five separate boroughs, residents should first decide whether they want to live in Manhattan, Queens, The Bronx, Brooklyn, or Staten Island. Located in different sections throughout the <strong>city</strong>, each borough has its own unique vibe and amenities for its residents. Whether you want to live in a trendy and chic neighborhood or an industrial and artsy district, New York City has a place for you. With so many people moving to the state of New York it&rsquo;s no surprise New York City is one of the most popular destinations for those relocating. We have put together another great list if you decide that living in New York City is not for you and want to check out some of the other best places to live in the state of New York. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“If someone is completely new to the <strong>city</strong>, the best advice I give them is to first reach out to any family or friends and get some guidance from them,” says Nora Ali, a licensed real estate salesperson for Corcoran. “The next thing I always recommend is for them actually to go and spend time in areas of interest.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before the beautiful new Saint Patrick’s Cathedral on Fifth Avenue there was the Basilica of Saint Patrick’s Old Cathedral in the Nolita neighborhood near SOHO. Built between 1809 and 1815, it was the heart of the Catholic community until the new Saint Patrick’s Cathedral was built in 1879. Back in its heyday religious services were celebrated in English, Italian and German. Today they are celebrated in English, Spanish and Chinese. That’s New York for you, the always evolving and accommodating <strong>city</strong> of immigrants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A lively neighborhood in Manhattan, Murray Hill is known to draw in recent graduates and young people in NYC due to its reasonable rent prices and casual bar scene. Singles and young professionals often unwind at bars in Murray Hill for after-work drinks and happy hours, so you’ll have no trouble meeting new people in this Manhattan neighborhood. Plus, Murray Hill is close to Midtown and a short walk from Grand Central Terminal, making it easy to get to other parts of the <strong>city</strong>. And while pre-war townhouses and Beaux-Arts mansions line the streets of Murray Hill, you can also find great deals on roomy Murray Hill high-rise apartments with views of the Empire State Building and Chrysler Building. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Brooklyn is different now, compared to just 20 years ago. Due to gentrification, many of the borough’s historic neighborhoods—mostly home to Black and Latino communities—have been taken over by the influx of new residents that found the high rents of Manhattan untenable. The borough’s proximity to Manhattan has largely turned the <strong>city</strong>’s second-largest borough into a sleeper community. Despite this, Brooklyn remains colorful, loud, and proud. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Staten Island is the cheapest borough to live in New York City in part because it is the most removed from Manhattan. Accessible only by one bridge or by ferries from the rest of NYC, Staten Island has the feel of being more akin to New Jersey than New York. Almost all of Staten Island’s neighborhoods top the list of the cheapest places to live in the <strong>city</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Walking south on the High Line, just before it ends, is Little Island, one of Manhattan’s newest attractions. The brainchild of fashion maven Diane Von Furstenberg and husband, mogul Barry Diller, Little Island is 2.5 acres of nature that appear to be floating on the Hudson River. The concept is unique; separate giant pods of greenery joined together to support a beautiful <strong>city</strong> park. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What makes Bayonne a great place to live in is the attractive real estate prices, which are some of the lowest you’ll find anywhere on the New Jersey Gold Coast, its family-friendly atmosphere, and the many wonderful parks in the <strong>city</strong>. Best of all, Bayonne is a very safe area and has also been experiencing a development boom. Numerous residential buildings are under construction, and many new businesses have opened their doors in the <strong>city</strong>, including Costco. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Soho Grand Hotel The Soho Grand Hotel couldn’t be more central: it’s right on Broadway! This luxury hotel is close to art galleries, designer shops, and popular restaurants. The Soho Grand features an outdoor restaurant, and all rooms have <strong>city</strong>scape views. Work up a sweat in the 24-hour gym, then treat yourself to a cocktail in the Club Room, or slip out to the patio to enjoy an alfresco meal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Home to both the largest <strong>city</strong> and biggest state park in the country, New York provides residents with urban playgrounds and impressive natural amenities. While New York City garners much of the tourism attention, the rest of the state offers highly livable communities. The best places to live in New York include Albany, Syracuse and White Plains. Residents enjoy a wealth of entertainment options from Broadway shows to pro sports teams like the New York Yankees and the Buffalo Bills. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Union Square has one of the best farmer’s markets in the <strong>city</strong> and plenty of restaurants & stores surrounding it. For an underrated and relatively unknown view, you can head to the top floor of DSW Warehouse (south side) and Barnes and Noble (north side) for great views of the NYC skyline. The area also has some of the best bookstores in NYC. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Union Square is centrally located toward the southern tip of Manhattan. It is just east of Chelsea and northeast of Greenwich Village. The Flatiron building, which was constructed in the early 20th century, is probably the most iconic sight in this part of the <strong>city</strong>. One of the biggest advantages of the Union Square/Flatiron area is that it is located at a central hub of the New York City subway system, making it a convenient place to stay for those who are planning on getting around by subway. Tip: Union Square/Flatiron is a good option for an area to stay if you want to hit both Midtown attractions like Times Square and the Empire State Building while also making it to some of the major attractions way downtown like the Statue of Liberty and the 9/11 Memorial & Museum. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Central Park is the lungs of New York City. I shudder to imagine what the <strong>city</strong> would be without it. Established in 1858 on 778 acres of <strong>city</strong> land, the park was designed by architect Frederick Law Olmstead (the same who built the Biltmore Estate) and landscape architect Calvert Vaux who had won a competition to design a <strong>city</strong> greenspace. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Buffalo is the second-most populous <strong>city</strong> in New York State and remains an industrial hot-spot. Located on Lake Erie, Buffalo is a prime waterfront destination that is only 20-miles away from Niagra Falls and is considered to be the best town to live in upstate New York. Even though this industrial <strong>city</strong> took a major hit during the Great Depression back in the day, the area has been making a comeback over the years as more businesses decide to call Buffalo home. While this may be a major <strong>city</strong>, the small-town and welcoming feel that it provides its residents is one of the major draws to the area. Plus, housing costs, utilities, groceries, and health care costs are all below the national average which makes this an affordable place to live in New York State. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>New York City is known to be the largest metropolitan area in the United States. Recognized for its thriving financial district and awe-inspiring skyscrapers, the <strong>city</strong> stands as a beacon of freedom and hope for people all over the world. While the Statue of Liberty stands as a gateway to the land of opportunity, nearly 900,000 people are moving to New York City every single year. Even though the <strong>city</strong> is famous for its large expenses and high rent prices, there are plenty of fantastic neighborhoods and safe areas that can fit any budget. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>New York is made up of five major areas or “boroughs,” some separated by rivers and connected via ferry or bridge. So, what are the five boroughs of New York? Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and The Bronx. Read on to explore which area of New York is right for what you’re looking for in our NYC neighborhood guide for the five New <strong>york</strong> boroughs, explained. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The High Line ends at Gansevoort Street in the heart of the Meatpacking District. This area started off as a Lenape Indian trading post before the Dutch arrived. Then it became an army fort. Much later it became the <strong>city</strong>’s official slaughterhouse where cattle and partially processed meats were transported by rail from the country’s cattle ranches to be packed and distributed to restaurants and warehouses, hence the area’s name. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As the fifth most populous <strong>city</strong> in the state, Syracuse provides the perfect mix of urban and suburban living to its residents alongside safe and sought-after neighborhoods. Plus, with access to the great outdoors, spend the day at an award-winning winery, try out a new hiking trail, or put the snow to good use by skiing and snowboarding. Not only is this a great place to live with many things to do, but its location in central New York makes it only a four-hour drive to New York City and a three-hour drive to Buffalo. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are two places in Manhattan that if you don’t visit you can’t really say you’ve been in the <strong>city</strong>. One is Times Square (you’ll see why as you read on) and the other is the Statue of Liberty on Liberty Island. If you’re in New York City for the first time, you really have to visit the Statue of Liberty. There is also a new museum on the on the island which is interactive and informative. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>city</strong> provides a constant sense of adventure for newly minted New Yorkers. Where else can you ogle world-famous art, nosh on soup dumplings, then beeline to the beach to watch the sunset with your toes in the sand? But if all you know about NYC comes from binge-watching TV shows and movies, you may be a little worried about how it is in real life. The big question: which NYC neighborhoods are right for you to stake your flag in? We chatted with real estate experts and longtime New Yorkers for advice on finding the best NYC neighborhood for you, depending on your preferences and lifestyle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Trinity Church. This is the first church built in the <strong>city</strong> and once was the highest structure in town. The church’s cemetery is even more interesting. Alexander Hamilton tomb is the highlight. Make sure to leave a coin on the tomb. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There aren’t many big towns in New York that get as much snow as Syracuse.
