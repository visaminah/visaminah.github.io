Lack of a knob indicates that you have a non-diverter tub spout. If your spout is connected to the water supply pipe using a small screw underneath it you have a slip-on spout, otherwise you have threaded spout. - Source: Internet A bathtub spout can last for many years depending on its quality among other factors. Nonetheless, at one point or another you will need to replace it. To do that you will first need to know the type of bathtub you have. - Source: Internet The slip-on type of tub spout features a setscrew, which is a tiny screw that you can find on the bottom of the spout. A slip-on tub spout is intended to be slipped onto a pipe that is 1/2 inch in size without using any threads. You must take precaution when using this type of tub spout so that the end of the copper that is inserted is free of any rough edges or burrs. - Source: Internet In essence front-ended threaded spouts (non-diverter) will need a longer pipe than wall-ended (diverter) threaded spouts. If you are installing a front-end spout, measure the entire length of the pipe and order a spout of that size. Wall-end threaded spouts will need a nipple of not more than ½ inch while telescoping threaded nipples need a nipple of not more than 1 3/8 inches in length. - Source: Internet Telescoping tub spouts – Telescoping threaded bathtub spouts as their name suggest affords you some flexibility by letting you make adjustments of up to 1 inch from the finished wall. You can therefore push them away or towards the wall within the range of 1 inch. They attach to ½ or ¾ nipple. - Source: Internet New bathtub spouts come with these specifications. What you want to see on the spout’s specification sheet is the recommended pipe length and diameter of the pipe. The type of threads also matter. Slip-on tub spouts will need a 1- 2 7/8 inches pipe in length. - Source: Internet Thread the tub spout on the pipe, starting off slowly. A good trick to thread properly is to first turn the spout to the left and after engaging the first thread turn it to the right. This way you avoid cross threading. Tighten the spout in place but not crazy tight. - Source: Internet Ideally, slip-on bathtub spouts are installed on a ½-inch water supply pipe (usually copper) which must be of the correct length and without dents/burrs. You must therefore be very careful while removing the old one to prevent damaging it. A burred water pipe will often cause leaks. - Source: Internet Slip-on bathtub spouts are connected to the water supply line using a screw at the bottom of the spout. They are the easiest to remove and install. The only tool you need is an Allen wrench to loosen/tighten the screw. - Source: Internet The front of the brass adapter is threaded while the rear has an O-ring to provide a water seal. When the adapter is connected to the pipe, the spout is then threaded on the adapter. The design allows you to adjust the position of the spout (back or forth) depending on the position of the brass adapter on the pipe. - Source: Internet Sometimes you have a slip-on or threaded tub spout that instead of being connected directly to the water supply pipe on the wall it is attached to a brass adapter. They are rare though. The brass adapter is either threaded, slipped-on or soldered soldered on the pipe. - Source: Internet Rear-threaded tub spout – A rear-threaded also known as wall-ended bathtub spout is more versatile than the front-end threaded spout. It can be connected to a ½ or ¾-inch spout stub-out nipple at the wall end of the spout. Rear-threaded tub spouts can be used with the usual shower diverters or even with a secondary outlet that allows the use of hand-held showers. - Source: Internet The telescoping type of tub spout is another version of the threaded tub spout. This spout allows for flexibility in many kinds of installation situations by permitting you to make adjustments of up to 1 inch for the wall that has been finished. This type of tub spout connects to 1/2 to 3/4-inch long nipples with the Celcon bushing. - Source: Internet Grab the spout with both hand and pull it out gently. If it is not coming out freely stop and make sure that the screw is completely loose. If the spout has been in there for a couple of years, it will not come out smoothly. Twist it right and left as pull you it out. - Source: Internet The front-end threaded type of tub spout does not feature a setscrew. Instead, it will simply twist off of either the pipe itself or the nipple. Use a front-end threaded tub spout in two ways, either with a tub valve without a shower or with a tub valve that features a shower diverter built right into the tub valve. - Source: Internet The rear-end threaded type of tub spout will provide additional convenience. It may be attached to a tub spout stub-out nipple either 1/2 or 3/4 inch long. It can be attached at the wall end of a tub spout that features a Celcon bushing. Use a rear-end threaded type for new construction as well as remodeling jobs. A selection of different models is available, such as those with a special outlet attachment or those that feature a regular diverter close to the wall. - Source: Internet Seeing the screw under the tub might not be easy so you might need to bend and look keenly. Grab a flashlight and check under and at the back of spout. You can also use your finger to feel the groove where the screw is located. - Source: Internet Diverter bathtub spouts are the bathtub spouts you see in bathtub-shower-combinations. There is a knob at the top of the spout for diverting the water from the tub spout to the shower head. But how does a diverter bathtub work. - Source: Internet Push and thread the new tub spout on the brass adapter being careful not to damage the O-ring. The spout should only be hand tight. Make sure that you tighten it all the way to the wall but with the right orientation. - Source: Internet To begin started, here are some tips for finding information about types of tub spout diverters:\r- Research Slip-On Tub Spout With Diverter-related information from credible sources.
