I’ve also pondered on how brown might have been somebody’s idea of a good color for earth/ground, but the English-speaking world just settled on green instead.Here’s the typical European ES holder: - Source: Internet The 8th Edition of the IEE Wiring Regulations was entitled ‘Regulations for the Electrical Equipment of Buildings’ and was issued in 1924. The ‘recommendation’ for identifying cables by colour became a requirement, Regulation 85 stated ‘where colours are used to distinguish the conductors the following shall be employed’. A note stated that the colours adopted for switchboard connections were different from those specified in Regulation 85 for cables and Regulation 63 N referred to British Standard Specification No. 158, which is ‘Marking and arrangement of switchgear busbars, main connections and small wiring’. - Source: Internet Most businesses adhere to the NEC because it’s state law. Others follow it because it’s considered a best practice for improving workplace safety. Injuries and incidents may be costly, so wiring, regardless of its scope or scale, should be taken seriously. - Source: Internet Posted By: djk Re: Some german electrical info 06:32 PM Flex is rare in fixed wiring here. Even cables suitable for a 45A cooker tend to be solid. You litterally need to use tools to bend them. - Source: Internet Posted By: C-H Re: Some german electrical info 04:13 PM Sweden uses the same devices as Germany (or did until Swedish-made devices forced them off the market) but 1.5 mm2 stranded wires for the in wall wiring. Ferrules are not used. - Source: Internet When you look up at the sky to see the wires on telephone poles, you mostly see blue (assume it’s a nice clear sunny day). And thus the hot wires should be colored blue. And look at the ground, it is either brown (bare) or green with grass. So brown should be the neutral. - Source: Internet The 13th Edition of the IEE Wiring Regulations published in 1955, saw the first use of a table for colour identification. ‘Table 7, Identification of bare conductors and cable cores by colour’ specified the requirements for AC and DC conductors is shown in Figure 2. Funnily enough, the phases are referred to as phase R, Y and B for the first time, but the colours specified were red, white, and blue respectively. Also, the colour for earth was specified for the first time, black was used for fixed wiring although green was used in flexible cords. - Source: Internet Electricity powers the world. It lights up, turns on and charges nearly everything we touch, all with the flick of a switch. But behind switch plates and outlets lies a colorful, spaghetti-like network of wires: red, black, yellow, green — each designed to connect, and keep us safe. - Source: Internet The wire color coding guidance provided below applies to electrical wiring in the United States. Though there may be exceptions (e.g., old wiring, regional differences, the wrong color wire was installed), this section can be used as a general overview for electrical wire color codes. - Source: Internet In addition to making new installations safer, following the NEC provides communication for future projects. Workers, maintenance crews and contractors (who frequently update wires) have come to rely on this color-coding system. It makes troubleshooting easier, and faster. - Source: Internet On the color code issue, the U.K. had a similar problem when the European colors were adopted for flex, as blue was (and still is) used as a phase in fixed wiring. - Source: Internet It took until 1928 for wire color coding to make its debut. The National Electrical Code® (NEC) was the first to reference it, and today continues to set the standards for the electrical industry. Following a uniform color code makes it easier to assess electrical wiring, and ensure safety among licensed professionals and homeowners alike. - Source: Internet Instead of wondering … Is this wire hot? Neutral? For grounding? A quick look at a wire’s color can reveal its role in powering an appliance or circuit. It’s simple. It’s safe. And, it’s designed to take the guesswork out of electrical work. - Source: Internet a unique color code with 3 differend colors would be good. i would prefer the violet in this case, because this is used nowhere else here. Back in time (30 years), gray was used fopr neutral here which could bring some more confusion in. Our house is still wired with the old code which is - Source: Internet Education and consistency If you’d like to become a licensed electrician, your training will require a solid understanding of the NEC. This ensures consistency, whether on new construction or if updating wiring in a pre-existing building. Cost There is no extra cost for following the wire coding standards. The thin, PVC sheath that wraps each wire costs the same for each color. - Source: Internet 3-Phase Wire Color Codes Whether adding a home appliance or industrial machinery, you’ll need to know these electrical wiring color codes. In the U.S., these color-coded wires carry power from a circuit breaker to a device. - Source: Internet I assume Germany is all set to adopt the new CENELEC-recommended phase colors (Black, brown, gray) in the near future. The U.K. will be switching to those in a couple of years. - Source: Internet Brady also makes pre-printed and custom tags and safety signs. These can also be created with on-demand label printers. Informing others about potential electrical hazards (conduit labels, voltage markers, electrical panels, arc flash, lockout tagout) can reduce the threat of injury. Whether posting indoors or outdoors, just know the text, graphics and color will hold up to the elements, abrasion and repeated spills and cleanings. - Source: Internet The use of blue as a neutral was originally adopted from IEC 446 published in 1973, what is now IEC 60446 Basic and safety principles for the man-machine interface, marking and identification, which specified blue shall be used for the neutral with black numerically identified phase conductors. At the time of developing this Standard, the Wiring Regulations Committee were not consulted, possibly because it was a BSI committee which was considering the international proposals and they therefore felt that they had no need to consider the Wiring Regulations which were, at that time, not a standard. It is also possible that the BSI committee thought that it applied only to machine wiring. - Source: Internet Whether you install, repair or upgrade wires, you may have noticed, no two wiring systems are exactly the same. But most do share at least one thing in common: a way to identify each wire. And that way is with color. Simply put, color makes it easier to work with wires.
