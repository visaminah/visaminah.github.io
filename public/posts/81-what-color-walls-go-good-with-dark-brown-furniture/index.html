Light gray walls, white trim, and cream-colored accents keep the couch from feeling too heavy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You could also go southwestern and paint your walls in terracotta tones.

Brown possesses rich earthly qualities that are warm, dramatic and enveloping. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you absolutely do not want an orange room but still want to design a contemporary room, consider a deep, glossy <strong>brown</strong> for the walls. Brown on <strong>brown</strong> may seem redundant, but switching up the sheen can add interest while maintaining a sense of continuity. Plus, a high-gloss paint will reflect light and open up the space, as opposed to creating a cave-like atmosphere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The most classic color to pair with a <strong>brown</strong> couch is cream. They just always look good together and create a really warm atmosphere. However, a plain cream rug can be a little boring, so something like this with a little print or pattern throughout is a good way to add some variety. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Brown may be the last color you think of when it comes to curating elegance, but, when handled properly, this hue can be as chic as the classic black and white scheme.

The creamy shade contrasts with the depth of the <strong>brown</strong> to give a clean, upscale vibe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Start with wood tones if you&rsquo;re unsure what color goes with a <strong>brown</strong> leather sofa.

These homeowners used white accent <strong>furniture</strong> and lots of pillows to balance out the chocolaty-<strong>brown</strong> seating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Turquoise blended with a rich shade of <strong>brown</strong> is one of the trendiest combinations that is going around right now.

When choosing your paint colors, then you can’t go wrong, pulling hues from nature. Try a cloudy, creamy white; neutral greige; or dark, leafy green, (Gratefully Grass is a right choice) — or, like this room, a combo of all three. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=2><li>Beige Walls. Beige paint is another option that can help create a warm and inviting space.

Decorative items like coffee table accessories, throw pillows, and an area rug adds more vibrant colors that help minimize the sofa&rsquo;s dark upholstery. For high-traffic areas, choose a washable area rug like this distressed Persian rug ($89, Walmart). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=7><li>White Wall Paint.

Orange – Orange and <strong>brown</strong> are another natural color combination as, together, these are reminiscent of autumn. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But bright white walls and <strong>brown</strong> <strong>furniture</strong> aren’t a great combination. Your <strong>furniture</strong> will look washed out. You should avoid red shades on the walls as well. Red can look fantastic with <strong>brown</strong> <strong>furniture</strong> when you use it for accent pieces like pillows or throws, but it tends to look mucky and dull on the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dark shades of wooden cabinetry paired with quirky shades of Fuchsia on the walls, heighten the drama in every room. Any room with a <strong>brown</strong> foundation can be transformed into a feminine and energetic setting by adding fuchsia accents to it.

If you want to create a space with a traditional feel or Mid-Century modern ascetic, consider pairing <strong>brown</strong> <strong>furniture</strong> with light blues. A more saturated, sky blue shade can make the room overwhelming, but you may use it for an accent wall or in decor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Another way to prevent a <strong>brown</strong> leather couch from overwhelming a room is to make almost everything else white. It takes a lot of a lighter color to balance a very dark one, so feel free to go all-white if you&rsquo;d like. Crisp white ceilings, walls, and floors help keep this cozy nook light and bright. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yes, <strong>brown</strong> <strong>furniture</strong> is making a comeback. In truth, for many, it never went out of style. Brown can give a room richness, depth, and warmth like no other color can. Plus, <strong>brown</strong> is always neutral, which means you can pair it with just about anything! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Brown <strong>furniture</strong> sometimes gets a bad rap for being boring or outdated, but it can be a surprisingly classic and classy addition to the home. Some may even argue that <strong>brown</strong> <strong>furniture</strong> is stylish and coming back into vogue.

Blending this wonderful shade of minty green to a room with <strong>brown</strong> wooden furnishings will lend a fresh and organic vibe to the overall ambiance of your room. Dress up your front porch in this combination to give off a naturally masculine yet soft feel to the look of it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Look to the outdoors to inspire color schemes for living rooms with dark <strong>brown</strong> sofas.

You’re better off aiming for timeless colors that you love unless you plan on redecorating every few years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While white cabinets are still the most popular cabinet color, <strong>brown</strong> is a close second. And we love these hot chocolate-colored base cabinets. The lack of upper cabinets makes the room look bigger. And the rosy <strong>brown</strong> accent wall, like Cool Clay, paired with the white paint color in the rest of the space, makes it the place everyone wants to gather. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Depending on the style and vibe you&rsquo;re going for within the space your <strong>brown</strong> couch co-exists within your home, shades like white, cream, and ivory (as seen above) may enhance a cozy and clean aura effortlessly. Like a Roman sunset, yellow and orange may give off a vibrant yet relaxed flare and a southwest vibe. Similarly, whether dark or light, blue is a suitable contrast that can create cool drama, sand and waves visuals, or a clear sky over the desert. Indoors or out, whichever paint colors you choose, the right choice will enhance your practical <strong>furniture</strong> with flawless distinction.

Because grey and <strong>brown</strong> are both neutral colors, they will absolutely agree with each other. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to go bold, <strong>brown</strong> <strong>furniture</strong> is the way to go. Pairing deep <strong>brown</strong>s with natural oranges is upscale 1970s chic all the way. Orange adds a dash of energy to any space, especially when it’s a pure, bright shade.

If you have dark <strong>brown</strong> <strong>furniture</strong> and want the room to be your sanctuary, mid-tone walls are the way to go. Think about incorporating golden yellow, soft blues, grayish-greens, soothing greys, and creamy beiges. With these tones, the walls seem to welcome you in rather than pop for attention. If your sofa is a lighter <strong>brown</strong>, use deeper shades for the walls like navy blue or slate grey. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In this room, a dark <strong>brown</strong> leather couch with tufting pairs well with traditional-style furnishings and fixtures for an updated but classic look.

However, this bright and charming shade can be combined with a dark shade of <strong>brown</strong> to tone down the bright accents of gold and make your room look lively and charming. The look that can be achieved by combining the two colors is one that looks extremely luxurious and refined. The golden undertones in the table lamp and bright designs on the floor look expensive and glamorous against the chocolaty <strong>brown</strong> in the background. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In this room, the greige walls, using Silent Smoke, act as a foil for all the colors of the room, providing a unifying backdrop for the gray sofa and <strong>brown</strong> wood coffee table and shelves. They also help the orange in the rug make sense in the color scheme. Subtle — and beautiful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The warmth of Orange combines beautifully with the neutral <strong>brown</strong> to give an amazing contrasting effect which gleams of energy and fun.
