The soothing light, the energy efficiency, the absence of concern about plant and structural damage. - Source: Internet The best place to install outdoor solar lights is an open place where there is ample sunlight. Try to find a spot which doesn’t have any shades due to buildings, trees, poles or other objects so that the sun rays are not blocked. Also, keep the area surrounding the solar lights clean as plants can grow and obstruct the sunlight from falling on the panel. - Source: Internet The light is left turned on as long as there is a movement within its sensor’s vicinity and it automatically turns off when the person leaves the sensor’s range. For this very security feature and purpose, it is important for you to know and pick a good quality solar panel sensor with the right coverage. For a PIR Sensor, there are two factors that are at play to determine its quality. - Source: Internet These solar lights are used for lighting up a single area or highlighting trees and shrubs. They also double as security lights, as they’re good for dark spots that could use brief bursts of bright light, like the front of sheds when you’re locking or unlocking a door, or alleyways when you’re putting the bins out. If you’re looking for gentle mood lighting, these might not be for you. - Source: Internet We tested a variety of solar lights, putting them through their paces between early February to late May 2022. They were in a range of urban, suburban and rural gardens across the country, and subjected to changing weather and hours of daylight for nearly four months. They were then assessed according to the following criteria with equal marks attributed to each: - Source: Internet These lights come with a separate light and land spikes unlike most of the landscape lights. The light’s height is fully adjustable. You can drive it in the ground with its stick to become a pathway landscape light or remove the stick and place it on the wall to become a wall light as well. - Source: Internet Key features: 200 lights, 19.9 metres long (3 metres to the first light and then 19.9 metres), claimed battery life of up to eight hours during the summer, It’s recommended you store the lights away over the winter, 8 light settings, warm white light. - Source: Internet Solar lights are available in several designs and styles. They are available in different colors, shapes, sizes and types as well. Some solar lights are designed specifically for certain purpose. Some of designed to enhance the areas aesthetically. So, it will not be too difficult to find the right option for your requirements and expectations. - Source: Internet Before the tests even commenced in earnest, these lights were left outside in a garden for six weeks over the winter. During this period the country shivered in a cold snap and temperatures in the garden remained below zero for five consecutive days. Our Best Buys have now survived outside for two consecutive winters. - Source: Internet For help in choosing them, I asked award-winning garden designer and BBC Gardeners’ Question Time panellist Matthew Wilson. You can find all of Matthew’s advice on how choose garden lights, where to put them and how to get the best out of them at the bottom of this feature. His key advice was to go for ambience over brightness - I was looking for charming glows, twinkles and flickers, not glare. - Source: Internet With string and fairy lights, try to keep an eye out for how much cable there is between the solar panel and the first bulb. At least a metre of this lead-in is useful, as it means you have more flexibility when placing your solar panel. With enough cable, you can still put your panel in a sunny spot and trail your lights up a trellis a few metres away, even if it’s in the shade. - Source: Internet The next test was to find out how well they charged in both direct and indirect sunlight. I placed one of each type of light in my front yard to receive direct sunlight, and another of each in my backyard against the house since the sun rarely shines there. Then, I waited for the lights to charge, checking to see if they were able to charge in a day. - Source: Internet Built about 17″ high and 5.4″ wide, the garden solar path lights are built from stainless steel and watertight diamond glass shade for outdoor usage.

Solar spotlights can be used to mark walkways, highlight decorative features, detect movement, or serve as focal design elements in their own right. What’s more, because they charge using a solar panel, they don’t require any landscape wiring and don’t cost any extra money to run. - Source: Internet As the name implies, they are used for illuminating fence areas for visibility from both inside and outside. Solar Lanterns – They are also known as hanging solar lights or garden lanterns. They are compact and portable making it perfect for providing light in remote places, especially in the backyard. - Source: Internet This focused on the hours needed to charge and the lights’ runtime after a full charge. We looked at how soon after sunset the lights switched on, and checked the lights’ brightness to see if they provided practical or aesthetic lighting. We made sure to check if the lights worked on overcast days, and finally if there was any sign of degradation or rusting. Value for Money. Considered all of the above plus any special features, RRP and warranty. - Source: Internet While designs can vary, fundamentally all solar lights work in a similar way, using a solar panel, rechargeable battery and, of course, a lamp. During the day the solar panel is used to charge up an internal rechargeable battery. Once the sun sets, the internal battery is then used to power the lamp. Some lights will turn on automatically when it gets dark, while others use a manual switch. - Source: Internet These string lights are good quality and although the bulbs look like glass, they’re made of tough plastic and more than capable of holding up to accidental knocks. The solar panel is discrete, and they’re easy to control through an on/off switch and eight lighting modes. There’s also generous three metre lead of cable between the panel and the first light, so there’s a lot of slack to play with when you’re setting these up. However, despite being a white light we found these lights a little dim, especially from a distance. They could also sometimes be slow to turn on, and have a weather resistance rating of IP44. - Source: Internet We put a range of solar lights to the test, using them in urban, suburban and rural gardens across the country. We started testing at the end of February 2022, and collected our results in late May, so we’ve put these lights through months of different lighting and weather conditions. They’ve seen wind, rain, hail and sleet; cold snaps, heat waves, and even dust from the Sahara. - Source: Internet But surely they’re not all that bad? We purchased fairy lights ranging in price from £7 to £70, and put them through a range of durability tests to simulate the delights of a good old British winter. Our Best Buys were then left out and have survived two British winters. Read on to find out how they fared, and which are the best garden fairy lights. - Source: Internet Cheapest price: £69.99 at PowerBee (available to pre-order).

So, it is very important to purchase waterproof or IP 55 certified <strong>solar</strong> <strong>lights</strong>. Because these <strong>lights</strong> are specially constructed with durable materials that can withstand the surrounding environment properly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>These are the most common and popular <strong>solar</strong> <strong>lights</strong>. Most of them are installed outside the houses like in the driveways, around the house, entry gate, in front of the houses, and other areas. These <strong>lights</strong> may look like normal <strong>lights</strong>, but they double up to be security <strong>lights</strong> as well. They have in-built sensors with a detection range of certain angle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The light comes with a 2200 mAh rechargeable lithium-ion battery. Adding to this, the monocrystalline <strong>solar</strong> panels have a good efficiency of 20.5% at a rate of 1.2 watts of energy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When sunsets, the <strong>solar</strong> power <strong>lights</strong> will automatically detect it and switch on the <strong>lights</strong>. As sunlight is their main energy source, you have to install these <strong>lights</strong> where there is more sun exposure. Apart from PV panels, <strong>solar</strong> <strong>lights</strong> also have a controller. This component is specially designed to sense the sunlight and automatically turn on/off the LED <strong>lights</strong> using the energy stored from sunlight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With a 3000k soft white brightness, the bulbs have an overall life span of 20,000 hours. These <strong>lights</strong> come with about 2 years of manufacturer’s warranty from the date of purchase. This and their better support adds on to make it a good buy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Batteries used in <strong>solar</strong> <strong>lights</strong> come in four different types – Lithium-Ion, NiMH, Lead-Acid and NiCad. Among them, lithium-ion batteries are the popular choice as they have higher capacities and still have a small size. Solar Panel: They are available in three different types – monocrystalline, polycrystalline and amorphous <strong>solar</strong> panels. Among them monocrystalline <strong>solar</strong> panels are effective but they are a bit expensive. Polycrystalline and amorphous <strong>solar</strong> panels are less expensive but have less efficiency. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For example, a <strong>solar</strong> panel with a 10W capacity can provide 10W of electricity per hour. It is usually represented as 10-watt hours. So, if the bulb has a higher luminosity, then you have to go for higher watt rated panels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Good Solar Lights can last a long time. The LEDs in <strong>solar</strong> <strong>lights</strong> can easily work for 10 years without any degrading performance. Coming to the battery, you can expect anywhere between 3 to 4 years of good battery backup but after that, the battery starts to lose its capacity. You have to recycle the old battery and replace it with a new one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Easy to install and use, you wouldn’t be needing any additional tools for installing it. Just dive it to the ground in place of ample sunlight. The <strong>lights</strong> are ready to go. The panels come attached to the top of the <strong>lights</strong> hence charging is direct and easy as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Finally, we moved into durability testing. First, I gently kicked each of the <strong>lights</strong> several times, looking to see if it would crack, stop working, or fall over. I then poured water over each of them to simulate wet weather conditions. Mother Nature helped with this test as well, providing both a blizzard and an ice storm as additional tests. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Thanks to the versatile design of the lamp, with its three way fixture it can shine light at a very wide angle. The sensing angle of the PIR motion sensors of this light is large too. These Sensors have a 20% higher sensitivity than general <strong>solar</strong> <strong>lights</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sometimes, we may purchase a product that turns out faulty after using it for couple of months. In such cases, warranty can be very helpful as you can get it repaired or replaced during this period. Most of the brands give you warranties ranging from 1 or 2 to 3 years too which is great for outdoor <strong>lights</strong>. Indoor lamp-based <strong>lights</strong> may not be as fruitful to have warranties. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In <strong>solar</strong> <strong>lights</strong>, durability came down almost entirely to the materials that the <strong>lights</strong> were made of. The <strong>solar</strong> <strong>lights</strong> that are made primarily of plastic crack very easily. The ones made of glass and metal are much more durable, both in terms of their physical durability and their ability to stand up to the weather. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dust and waterproof in nature, the bulbs are durable and can withstand any kind of weather and the panels are made out of IP 65 Waterproof material. Furthermore, they are very simple and easy to install anywhere. The <strong>lights</strong> come with a 1-year manufacturer’s warranty from the date of purchase. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What’s bright, pretty, and okay for the environment?

You can install them easily on patio, barbeque deck, pool, or garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Each Solar light has a 25 lumen output from the diamond-shaped LED light and combined they can light up to 8 to 12 hours. The battery is different from other Solar <strong>lights</strong> as it contains a 14500 LiFePo4 battery with 600 mAh capacity. It can be recharged in 6 to 8 hours. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Common reasons that stop the <strong>solar</strong> <strong>lights</strong> from functioning are bulb failure. Battery failure and panel failure. Below, we have mentioned ways to fix these problems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Actually, LED <strong>lights</strong> are designed to last for several hours of operation that ranges between 7 to 15 years. If the panels are made up of PV cells, then they can last for around 20 years as well. But when it comes to battery performance, it is not that long. They usually last for 2 or 3 years’ maximum. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Just make sure you are placing the <strong>lights</strong> within good exposure to sunlight or any bright <strong>lights</strong> during day time.
