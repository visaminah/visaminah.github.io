Cool colors, like hues of <strong>blue</strong>, purple, green, etc., are soothing colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Like some other combinations on the list, this one works well when there’s a color gradient involved. Coral looks nice in an outfit that incorporates <strong>blue</strong>, green, and the spectrum of colors between. And of course, incorporating white is a fairly simple way to lighten up the look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The first recorded use of gray as a color name in the English language was in 700. Gray is an achromatic color, a color without hue, like white and black. A chromatic gray is a gray color in which the red, green, and <strong>blue</strong> codes are not exactly equal, but are close to each other, which is why it appears to be a shade of gray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It&rsquo;s pretty obvious from just a quick scroll on Pinterest that dark <strong>blue</strong> walls are having a bit of a moment. Who hasn&rsquo;t got a Hague Blue wall right now? But there&rsquo;s a reason everyone loves this deep hue so much – it&rsquo;s dramatic, it&rsquo;s bold and yet it&rsquo;s actually a super versatile shade that works perfectly with all neutrals, including grey. Dark <strong>blue</strong> is like the colorphobes way of bringing in something brave, without it interrupting the previous color scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yes, navy <strong>blue</strong> can go with greige. The two colors can complement each other nicely, especially if you use different shades or tones of each color. For example, you could pair a light greige with a dark navy <strong>blue</strong>, or vice versa. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue is my favourite color too. I have a wardrobe full of different <strong>blue</strong> colored garments and then I learn that <strong>blue</strong> is not suited to me. I feel as if I have been living a lie! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dusty pink, soft rose, peach, jade green, taupe, gray, off-white and <strong>blue</strong>. Colours to avoid: Bright red, bright yellow. Try to steer clear of any super bright or neon colours that can overwhelm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you like the energy of yellow but prefer something closer to a jewel tone, a golden shade of yellow like the one pictured is a great way to go. It pairs well with medium <strong>blue</strong> and even denim <strong>blue</strong>, so this look works well for casual outfits. And of course, if you like patterns, shirts or dresses that use this combination are a nice way to stand out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best accent colors to pair with grey and <strong>blue</strong> in a living room as those on the opposite sides of the color wheel. We are talking oranges and yellows, but what tones you pick totally depends on your style. If you are after a more subtle contrast a warm terracotta orange can look lovely or for something bolder try a pop of vibrant yellow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Red and green, violet and yellow, <strong>blue</strong> and orange – complementary colors, as the name goes, work best when put together. These are exactly opposite to each other on the color wheel. They might seem bold to look at, but the outputs will be perfect. If you observe carefully, your spring and summer clothing is mostly designed using complementary colors. While some might argue against this concept, it is actually a matter of choice as some like making bold statements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue is the quintessential color when it comes to menswear, as I guarantee everyone reading this has plenty of <strong>blue</strong> in their wardrobe already. Whether it’s jeans, suits, sports coats or T-shirts, we tend to gravitate toward <strong>blue</strong>. It’s an effortless color to wear. But what colors go well with <strong>blue</strong>? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>And if you’re currently shopping for new looks, this is a fairly easy one to create. Navy <strong>blue</strong> is a common color for just about every clothing item, and you can also find tan leather accessories quite easily. Plus, navy and tan is a versatile combination that works well with casual outfits and formal wear alike. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Burgundy is an underused but classic menswear color that pairs well with neutrals like white, gray, and light brown. It can look great when combined with light <strong>blue</strong>s or with yellow accents, which both pop against the darker shade of red. Despite its inherent darkness, it also pairs surprisingly well with navy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are tons of different theories on why it seems difficult to find colours that match with purple or how to incorporate purple into one’s aesthetic. Purple seems “foreign” to some because it’s not as “naturally occurring” as green or <strong>blue</strong>. It could also be because in colour psychology purple is often associated with darkness, mysticism, and magic. But these are just theories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grey pants can go with a <strong>blue</strong> shirt, but it depends on the shade of <strong>blue</strong> and the shade of grey. If you want a more casual look, try pairing light grey pants with a navy shirt. For a more formal look, try pairing darker grey pants with a light <strong>blue</strong> shirt. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;As versatile as grey is, it is important to consider undertones when pairing it with another shade&rsquo; says Richard. &lsquo;Cool greys are best paired with cooler colour schemes, such as <strong>blue</strong>, green, and light purple, while warm greys better complement reds, oranges, and yellows. For fans of the monochrome look, incorporate different shades of grey, alongside white and black, to create depth and visual interest.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are looking to add a splash of color to a monochrome scheme, a lovely light <strong>blue</strong> can really lift a space. See how this couch makes the deep <strong>blue</strong>/black and white seem less stark? It brightens up the space and softens it at the same time. If you don&rsquo;t want to commit to a colored couch, bring in those <strong>blue</strong>s with artwork, lampshades, cushions or a rug would work too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The color wheel is a visual guide to the color spectrum. You can see how different colors relate to each other by how far apart they are on the wheel. Understanding the color wheel for <strong>clothes</strong> can help you create a balanced outfit as a beginner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After taking a peek at some street style inspiration, we&rsquo;ve realized it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Red, pink, beige, black — mysteriously, all the colors go with navy <strong>blue</strong>. Don&rsquo;t believe us? Here are a few great navy outfit ideas to prove it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But, as we all know, there isn’t just one shade of red. Women are typically more in-tune with their ‘colour profile’ because of hours spent finding the right shade of foundation or right shade of red lipstick for their complexion. There are dusty reds, maroons, wine-reds, true reds, pinky-reds, orangey-reds… and just as a <strong>blue</strong> undertone separates the colour from true red, so too does our undertone or level of contrast dictate what type of red looks best on us. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Brown is a safe color that can go with just about any other color, but goes especially well with white, <strong>blue</strong> and green. For a more daring look, you might wear brown with orange or yellow which both look fantastic against brown. You can also wear different shades of brown, as it creates a pleasant earthy appearance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are also other women who like to combine gray tops with skirts and this would look sexy as well. If you want to use this method of clothing, then try matching your top with black bottoms for more sophisticated look. We all know that black is considered as the most elegant <strong>clothes</strong> color so if it can match with almost every other colors out there, then pair it up with gray and you will see how good it looks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gray tops are also great to use if you want to wear jeans or skirt with them. Try pairing up a shirt with <strong>blue</strong> jean and do not forget to match your shoes to your top! Wearing this kind of outfit will surely make you look sharp and classy. Remember, even though gray is considered as a cool color, there is no rule that says it can only be combined with cold colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Earlier, we mentioned a combination of light <strong>blue</strong> and navy. If you like the <strong>blue</strong>-on-<strong>blue</strong> look but want something a little brighter, you might want to try out royal <strong>blue</strong> and sky <strong>blue</strong>. This is a great look for beachwear and casual summer outfits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to take this intriguing combination out of the office, try pairing yellow-orange accessories (belts, shoes, purses, etc.) with a pastel-<strong>blue</strong> dress or top. And since this yellow-orange shade essentially works as a neutral, it looks nice alongside various shades of brown or tan, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Owen Wilson, Mahershala Ali, and Ed Sheeran. What to consider: Muted hues such as light <strong>blue</strong>s and greys work particularly well on those on the lighter side of the spectrum, whereas those with a richer skin tone will find it easier to experiment with bold colours. Every colour you wear should help create a contrast that lacks in your complexion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grey and <strong>blue</strong> is such a versatile combo. You can go for a really contrasting scheme with light <strong>blue</strong> and a deep charcoal grey or create a really cohesive look where your colors blend so seamlessly you barely notice the difference between the two. There are so many ways you can work this classic combination into your living room, and we&rsquo;ve pulled together plenty of looks to get you inspired. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Instead of reaching for harsh colour pairings, opt for more neutral bases and then add a warm version of your favourite colour such as a pine green or a warm <strong>blue</strong> to keep it interesting. When donning bright colours, such as a bright red, add it in through your tie or pocket square, alongside a muted <strong>blue</strong> button-up and navy suit. Tip: Stay away from clear colours such as icy <strong>blue</strong>s and stark white. Opt for a warmer alternative to bring out the warmth in your complexion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As you likely already know, red and white also look great with navy <strong>blue</strong>. If you like this combination but don’t want to look like a 4th of July parade, try incorporating subtle navy <strong>blue</strong> accents. Even a red and white flannel with a few stripes of navy is a great way to do this. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grey and <strong>blue</strong> is a cool combo, literally speaking, but it&rsquo;s really easy to warm up those tones with some wooden touches. If you&rsquo;ve been blessed with wooden floorboards, easy, that&rsquo;s all the warmth you need. And if not, wooden shelving, a cute wooden side table or even just some wooden picture frames will have a similar effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can also combine colors that all belong to the same hue, but differ in intensity. This creates a monochromatic outfit. For example, pairing light <strong>blue</strong> with dark <strong>blue</strong>, or a muted green with light green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you wear black <strong>clothes</strong> with other black <strong>clothes</strong>, you must make sure that they are the exact same shade, as otherwise, one garment will look washed out. For the same reason, you should avoid wearing grays that look almost black. Otherwise, black goes with any other color, but looks especially good when contrasted against light or bold, vibrant colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A crucial thing to notice is that <strong>blue</strong> suits reflect self-confidence and boldness.

A pale <strong>blue</strong> wall is really going to make those brighter, warmer colors pop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Define <strong>blue</strong>-greys with an indigo <strong>blue</strong> accent.

A <strong>blue</strong> patterned wallpaper helps to add personality to the scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are pale or yellow toned, opt for colors from the colder side of the palette, such as grey, navy <strong>blue</strong>, varying shades of green, aqua, emerald, burgundy, etc. If you have a deeper skin tone, you can pull off brighter or warmer shades of brown, coral, honey, gold, amber, taupe, etc., as they look amazing on this skin tone.

However, when you wear <strong>clothes</strong> with black as the dominant color, you should make sure that it is complemented with your personal style. Generally, most women love to wear black clothing because it gives an edgy and powerful look. However, for some women, wearing black <strong>clothes</strong> will not do since these colors are not their natural shades, and prefer to dress in colors that reflect their true personalities.

If you have a warm skin tone you should avoid <strong>blue</strong> and similar cool colors. But if you have a cool skin tone, go ahead and splurge on <strong>blue</strong>. I have warm skin tone, so there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you consider yourself to have fair or light skin (cold/<strong>blue</strong> undertone), you will most likely fit into a few other categories as well. Your hair is an intense colour, either very blonde, very dark, or red. The sun is not a friend, and you’re burnt more often than tanned.

A woman should not be afraid to embrace the colors of life. All three colors — red, yellow, and <strong>blue</strong> — can be worn in a multitude of shades and tones.

The best way to dress in gray is to pair it with your favorite colors when you are looking for ways to wear gray clothing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What makes this room so inviting, despite the lack of light and the cooler tones, is all that layering going on with really similar shades.

Plus, all the cushions and throws help soften up the space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;If I’m using a cool-toned grey I like to use pops of a hot color,&rsquo; says Annie. &lsquo;It’s a very effective way to make a room vastly more lively and rewarding to look at, and you only need small amounts of your accent color. I also love a <strong>blue</strong>-grey with terracotta as these colors contrast beautifully to give a delicious, juicy, contrast. In the past I’ve painted a wall in grey, then used terracotta tones to accentuate panels on the wall.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Regardless of the shade, <strong>blue</strong> and gray work well together. This is especially true of shades of <strong>blue</strong> and shades of cool gray. From a practical standpoint, charcoal gray is a great choice to pair with sky <strong>blue</strong>. This deep and dignified gray is a common color for blazers, suit jackets, and pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Since both of these colors are dark, it’s a good idea to incorporate lighter colors alongside them to create a balance. Try putting together an outfit that incorporates a gradient of color. You can see this in the picture: the model wears a dark navy <strong>blue</strong> top, while her scarf includes teal, several shades of lighter <strong>blue</strong>-green, and white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>These comprise red, yellow, and <strong>blue</strong>. No two colors can be mixed to achieve these shades. Everything else is derived from these colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A really easy way to create a two-tone <strong>blue</strong> and grey living room is with furniture. Combine a <strong>blue</strong> sofa with a grey armchair and you already have your new color scheme sorted, then it&rsquo;s up to you have much further you take it. You could keep the rest of the space neutral with pale grey walls and wooden decor. Or bring out more - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Try using intense sunny yellow for a bold contrast or soft yellow for an airier look.

On the wheel, there are primary colors consisting of red, <strong>blue</strong>, and yellow and secondary colors of green, purple, and orange. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most people would say that gray does not match with navy <strong>blue</strong>, but it can depend on the shade of gray and navy <strong>blue</strong>.

If you have a light gray and a light navy <strong>blue</strong>, then they may also match well together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Navy <strong>blue</strong> and tan is one of the classic combinations on the list. Navy <strong>blue</strong> works nicely with just about any neutral, but the warmth of tan creates an especially balanced look. As you can see in the pictured outfit, tan leather accessories (belts, shoes, and purses) are an easy way to bring this look together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Orlando Bloom, David Beckham, and Zayn Malik. What to consider: Instead of reaching for harsh colour pairings, opt for more neutral bases and then add a warm version of your favourite colour such as a pine green or a warm <strong>blue</strong> to keep it interesting. When donning bright colours, such as a bright red, add it in through your tie or pocket square, alongside a muted <strong>blue</strong> button-up and navy suit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>According to the color wheel, the complementary color of <strong>blue</strong> is orange. This is because <strong>blue</strong> and orange are opposite each other on the wheel. Blue is a cool color, while orange is a warm color. Together, they create a. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>These are colors directly adjacent from each other on the wheel. Associated colors are important for monochromatic looks. Think <strong>blue</strong> jeans and a <strong>blue</strong> t-shirt or a navy suit and chambray button-up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sometimes, pairing similar colors results in a striking look. That’s the case with navy <strong>blue</strong> and teal. Teal is a very deep <strong>blue</strong>-green that pairs nicely with the deep <strong>blue</strong> of navy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are looking for a color that just going to work in all sized spaces, all levels of natural light, a pale warm-toned grey is the way to go. It just makes any room feel so lofty and elegant, and it looks lovely paired with bolder, jewel-toned <strong>blue</strong>s. For this look, stick to greys for the walls and floors and bring in those pops of color with furniture and accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Those with high contrast colouring typically have very dark hair (such as black or dark brown) with very pale skin. And, if you tan, there’s still a noticeable shift between the colour of your skin and the colour of your hair. People with this kind of complexion typically have very deep brown eyes or clear <strong>blue</strong> eyes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gray <strong>clothes</strong>, whether they’re light gray or dark gray, pair the best with lighter or brighter colors. Gray makes colors stand out against it, making it the ultimate support color. Whether it’s red, green, <strong>blue</strong> or orange, gray makes all these colors pop. Avoid combining gray with other muted colors as it creates too muddy of an appearance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One example of contrasting colors is red and <strong>blue</strong>. It’s no wonder why red ties pair so well with soft <strong>blue</strong> shirts and dark <strong>blue</strong> or navy suits. Thus, the best practice involves matching a darker tone of each variant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As we’ve seen so far, <strong>blue</strong> and brown seem to pair well together regardless of shade.

As you can see in the photo, a medium-<strong>blue</strong> tie looks great with a chocolate brown blazer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The color wheel shows a plethora of color options for a tie. Certainly, you can go for a <strong>blue</strong>, light red or pink tie. But my favorite tie choices will be navy ties with pink decorations like dots, stripes, or floral segments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can wear <strong>blue</strong> with white, black and gray. It reminds of seas and beaches when paired with brown and makes easy pairing with analogous colors cyan, turquoise and green. Lastly, it provides fetching contrasts with yellow, brown, red and orange. You almost can’t go wrong with <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Keeping it in the family is a mantra you need to remember. The safest way to do this is by blending different shades of the same color. However, that will inevitably get monotonous and boring very soon. Remember how we discussed complementary colors? (Red and green, violet and yellow, <strong>blue</strong> and orange.) Play around with a combination of these colors; they will look great when put together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Red and purple usually clash. But there’s a saying that goes, “you need to know the rules to break them”.

So, if you’re looking for more colours that go with purple <strong>clothes</strong>, red can work if you’re brave enough to try it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Right now, certain colors seem more popular than others (we&rsquo;re looking at you, hot pink), but one shade that never goes out of style is navy <strong>blue</strong>. It continues to be a mainstay in our wardrobe year-round, whether we&rsquo;re rocking a striped navy and white swimsuit by the beach or bundling up in a knit navy sweater. However, despite this neutral being such a classic, deciding what colors go with navy <strong>blue</strong> can sometimes feel tricky. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For the best appearance, match the <strong>blue</strong> suit with a white dress shirt. It really empowers the <strong>blue</strong> suit. Finally, finish the look with a red, soft <strong>blue</strong>, or dark <strong>blue</strong> tie. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Beige is a neutral color that goes with any other color. It pairs well with other shades of brown, and looks great with green and <strong>blue</strong>. Beige is an excellent color to wear in summer when you combine it with white or other light hues like mint green or sky <strong>blue</strong>. If you’re looking to create more contrast, beige also makes a great combo with navy, maroon or darker browns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>’When introducing colour accents to lighter greys, think about the undertones of the pairing first and then the contrast you wish to achieve. Ammonite a soft stony grey will team beautifully with <strong>blue</strong>s and greens such as Inchyra Blue or Hague Blue as both have the gentle undertones of nature, such as the delicate brown note found in Ammonite and the green in Inchyra Blue.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The combination of colors that are equidistant from each other on the color wheel is called ‘triadic.’ They look great together, but some might argue that they can be OTT.

A pair of green cargos with a pastel pink top and powder <strong>blue</strong> accessories or shoes will look sophisticated and tasteful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want your grey to remain cool and tranquil, watery shades of <strong>blue</strong> are the ideal colour to introduce.

Mustard yellow, army green and light <strong>blue</strong> make particularly fetching color combos for red. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you like the look of very bright colors but want to pair them with something a little quieter, the combination of bright <strong>blue</strong> and soft gray is ideal. And as you can see in the picture, this is an ideal combination for activewear or athleisure: it’s easy to pair a bright <strong>blue</strong> hoodie with gray sweatpants. If you’re going for a look that is lighter and brighter overall, you can incorporate white accents or accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue is an unavoidable color in most of our wardrobe.

Many brand logos have the color <strong>blue</strong> (think Facebook)- a testimony to the power of <strong>blue</strong> color to impart confidence. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Low contrast refers to the lack of differentiation between one’s hair and skin colour. So, those who have tanned skin and light brown/dark blond hair, or those with dark skin and dark hair.
