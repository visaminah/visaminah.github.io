Concrete patios, basement floors, and garage floors are transformed by <strong>paint</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Removing <strong>paint</strong> from concrete can be a troublesome project. Concrete is porous and rough, creating a textured surface to which <strong>paint</strong> easily adheres. Muriatic acid works very well at removing stains and <strong>paint</strong> from concrete, but can etch the surface if it is left on for too long or proportioned incorrectly. Muriatic acid will damage skin and clothes, so wear protective equipment at all times and work in well-ventilated areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This method uses Baking soda as the scouring agent that removes the <strong>paint</strong>. It’s another method that is considered more environmentally friendly as there isn’t any use for chemicals and does minimal damage to the concrete below! You will need a specialised blasting unit (a local hardware store may be able to rent this out to you, as well as the baking soda. We would recommend checking with the same store to see if they have the amount of baking soda you would need.

We also used Dawn soap and hot water, but I don’t think the soap is completely necessary. Up to you on if you want to use it or try getting those stains up without it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Again, use your wide-wire brush to scrub off the loosened <strong>paint</strong>. Continue until no more <strong>paint</strong> comes off. If the stain was from latex <strong>paint</strong>, using warm soapy water as you scrub should be enough. Oil-based <strong>paint</strong>s are harder to clean, therefore, proceed to the next step. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One concrete block wall was completely bare, and water was leaking inside the restaurant.

This coating stopped the water from leaking through the concrete block and onto the inside of the restaurant walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Concrete has porosity due to which it absorbs the liquid which is applied on the surface of Concrete. Due to the absorbing nature of concrete, it ships the layer of <strong>paint</strong> in it.

I think it would work well then. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blast the place that has been <strong>paint</strong>ed.

Make sure you’re wearing the proper safety equipment such as goggles, a breathing mask and gloves!
