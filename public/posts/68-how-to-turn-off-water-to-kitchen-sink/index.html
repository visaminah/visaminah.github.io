Water supply pipes from the city typically run from the street side of your house to the indoors. So check out utility areas—such as the garage, laundry room, or basement—along exterior walls facing the street. A likely place to start looking is near your water heater. In a basement, the pipe will likely be at eye level; on main floors, it will often be located lower down. - Source: Internet If your home has an interior sprinkler system for fire suppression like many condominiums must now have, learn how to shut this system off. In multi-unit buildings, i.e. condominiums, the water supply may be shared and either an onsite manager or the fire department should know how to shut the water off if the owner of the unit with the shutoff valve isn’t home. - Source: Internet Gate valves consist of a circular handle attached with a stem to the body of the valve. When you turn the handle, it slowly closes a gate inside the body of the valve, blocking the flow of water. Turning the valve in the opposite direction will open the gate and allow the water to flow freely. - Source: Internet There’s no one universal spot in every house where water supply valves are located, so it could take some time to find them—time that you won’t have if water is rapidly soaking through the second-floor ceiling. Before there’s any urgency (or water all over the floor) at your place, consider familiarizing yourself now with how to turn off the water supply. Show family members, too, where the valves are and how to cut them off quickly. This knowledge will make regular maintenance easier, and could save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars of repair costs in a worst-case scenario. - Source: Internet Turning off the water to the entire home will also stop the flow of water into the water heater. However, if you have a tank-style water heater, then the water inside the tank may still flow out of the water heater. Open a faucet on the lowest level of the home to drain any water remaining in the line. If the hot water continues to flow, locate the isolation valve above the hot water heater and turn it off to stop the flow of hot water. - Source: Internet Of course, once you’re done with your project, you can turn the water back on. If you turned off the water in the whole house, you’ll need to go through the house and bleed off the air by slowly opening the hot and cold faucets throughout your home one by one. Expect a lot of noise, sputtering, and a bit of splashing as the pipes are purged of air and returned to normal operating conditions. - Source: Internet The external stop tap, is often located near the boundary of a premises under a small cover, about the size of a CD case. If you have a water meter, it will generally be located in the same pit or chamber as the meter. If it appears to be made of a plastic type material it may only require a quarter of a turn to turn off the water. When the lever is in line with the pipe it is on and when across the pipe it is off. - Source: Internet A three-way rotary valve has two outlines and an inline. They are generally seen under kitchen sinks, where they are used for both the faucet and the dishwasher. Three-seater grandstands are accessible in various arrangements. Some are crossed, with both entrances pointing in inverted headings, while others have stores in an “L” or “Y” design. - Source: Internet You may need some special tools used for plumbing repairs, so here they are (you can get them on Amazon or your local hardware store). You’ll find them useful when installing or replacing one/more of your water shut off valves. If you have to cut the shut off valve off, you’ll also need a pipe cutter (here they are on Amazon). Stanley 6 in, Adjustable Wrench Stanley 12 in, Groove Joint Pliers - Source: Internet Different appliances will have valves in different locations. Faucets will generally have two shutoff valves – one for hot water, one for cold – underneath the sink. Toilets will have a single shutoff valve right below the tank. Dishwashers, washing machines, and other appliances will have a single shutoff valve near the floor (or, potentially, beneath the floor in the basement). Water heaters, depending on the type will have a shutoff valve before the intake. - Source: Internet The water main shutoff valve could be in a number of places, depending on the age of your home and the climate of your location. Valves can sometimes be buried inside drywall or behind the furnace. If your valve is in one of these tight locations you may need a professional plumber to relocate the valve or to install an easy-to-access secondary valve further down the line. The shutoff will either be a gate valve, which looks like a circular spigot, or a ball valve, which has a lever-style handle. - Source: Internet People who sound without shutoff valves surprise me. The best course of action is to immediately correct the situation. Where the water pipe enters the house, there should be the main shut-off valve. Every toilet, warm and cold line in bathtubs/showers, sinks, and sinks should have one. - Source: Internet If you want to turn off the water supply to bathroom taps, the valve is likely to be under the sink. Using a flathead screwdriver, turn the valve until the slot on the valve is at a right angle to the pipe. Run the tap as you isolate the tap to check if the water is off. Another option is to turn the main valve off for the property. - Source: Internet The main water shutoff valve is usually located on the main water line, where it enters the home. In most cases, this will be in a basement, cellar, or crawlspace because the water line extends from the neighborhood water main and enters the home from under the ground. In warmer areas where freezing pipes isn’t a concern, the main water shutoff might also be found outdoors on an exterior wall, or buried near the street. - Source: Internet Fortunately, in most cases, turning water on or off doesn’t require any tools. However, in some cases, you may need a crescent wrench, or basin wrench to get at the shutoff valves. This is usually only the case for the main water supply discussed later. You might want to have a can of WD-40 or another penetrating agent on hand in case the valves don’t turn freely. - Source: Internet , typically 12 inches long, so that when you shutoff the water, there’s no water left in the pipe near the exterior wall. Here’s an important video on the correct way to install Outdoor Hose Faucets. Install a water shut off valve on your new frost free faucet. - Source: Internet Hot water cylinders also have a valve that you can turn. Again, turn this valve clockwise to shut off the hot water. Properties with combination boilers will have the water supply cut off when the main shutoff valve for the property is turned. - Source: Internet Look for two chrome-plated or plastic stop valves under the sink, usually at the back of the cabinet. These are connected to the water supply tubes that serve the faucet—one for cold, and the other for hot. The cold is usually on the right-hand side. To shut off a single-handle faucet, you will need to turn off both. Turn the valves clockwise to turn them off. - Source: Internet Main Water Shut-Off Valve Sometimes main water shut-off valves require a “meter key.” You can purchase one at your local home improvement store, or use a crescent wrench and a screwdriver. Secure either the meter key or the wrench on the valve, and then turn it clockwise to stop the flow of water. If you turn off your main line, you’ll also need to go back into your home and release pressure from the pipes by running both your cold and hot water lines until water no longer runs. - Source: Internet Next to this pipe, you will find two different metal pipes or flexible lines. These will run from the tailpiece of the faucet into the wall or sometimes into the floor. These pipes are known as the hot and cold water lines. The cold water one is often on the right side and the hot one is found on the left. - Source: Internet Burst pipes and water leaks from appliances and fixtures can rapidly result in thousands of dollars in water damage to your home – and a sky high water bill. Quick action is key, before repair needs turn your home into a money pit. How can you prevent water damage headaches? It all starts with a little 4-1-1 on the water shut-off valves throughout your home. - Source: Internet : The shutoff valve for a dishwasher is generally located inside a lower kitchen cabinet, and may even be under the kitchen sink, depending on the proximity of the dishwasher to the sink in the kitchen layout. Turn off this valve before repairing or replacing the dishwasher to avoid flooding the kitchen. Refrigerator : Not all refrigerators have a water line, but for those that do, the shutoff valve is typically located behind the refrigerator. Simply pull the fridge out from the wall to access the shutoff valve before you move, disconnect, or replace the refrigerator. - Source: Internet Fortunately, it’s pretty easy to replace the washer (and the washer sealing around the shaft where it exits to meet the handle) without removing the valve. Just shut off water upstream, release pressure, and carefully undo the packing nut (the nut just under the handle) to remove the whole shaft assembly. Either replace the two washers or the whole shaft and reassemble, adjusting the packing nut tightness to prevent leaking around the shaft. Here’s a photo of a typical replacement kit: - Source: Internet Note these different water lines. Before they enter into the wall, you will notice a lever on each pipeline. This lever can also look like a knob or other adjustable mechanism. - Source: Internet The shutoff valve is attached to the pipe behind the toilet. You will be able to put a flathead screwdriver in the slot of the isolation valve and turn 90 degrees. This means you do not need to turn off the water supply to the entire property. Some older toilets do not have an isolation valve, and therefore you will need to use the main water shut off valve. - Source: Internet In the event you need to turn off the water to your entire house, you can use the main water valve on the house side of your water meter. Your water meter is often located outside of your home in a cement box buried in the ground. It can also sometimes be found in the house. In some cases, the main water shutoff can be found in a basement or crawlspace. The main shut off valve will always have a water meter with it. - Source: Internet Before we jump in though, a bit of advice. The best time to learn where all the valves in your house are is before you’re rushing around with a bucket and a mop dealing with a leak. If you have the good luck to be reading this article at a time when water isn’t spraying all over your bathroom, we’d recommend reading through it and then walking through your house looking at all the places there is water access—the kitchen, the bathroom, the utility room, etc. As you do, ask yourself “Where is the valve for this?” - Source: Internet While you’re draining the system, be sure to turn off your water heater. Electric heaters are simple to turn off and back on, but if you have an older gas water heater and aren’t familiar with how it works, please contact your utility company or knowledgeable contractor or friend to help. Typically for a gas heater you don’t turn it completely off, but simply dial it back to the pilot light setting. You should only need to cut the gas to the water heater entirely if you’re draining the water heater itself as part of your leak repair. - Source: Internet Water emergencies happen often from a plumbing leak inside your home to water entering your home from outside. You need to respond to water problems quickly. Why? Water or high levels of moisture left too long can cause damage, often hidden damage, which increases the risk of mold along with higher repair costs. - Source: Internet To turn the water supply off, give a gate valve a few turns clockwise until you can’t turn it any longer. For ball valves, turn the lever clockwise 90 degrees. In most cases, you won’t need any additional tools to turn off the main water shut off valve. These valves are designed for simple manual hand turning, but if you are having trouble turning it or if the valve is completely seized, you may need to use a channel lock wrench or pipe wrench. - Source: Internet : Faucet repair and replacement is one of the most common DIY plumbing jobs, so it’s important to know that the isolation valve for these fixtures can generally be found under the sink. In some instances, the hot and cold water lines may have independent valves that need to both be turned off to stop the flow of water through the faucet. Toilet: The shutoff valve for most toilets is located behind the toilet or slightly off to one side. This valve can be used to turn off the water for repairs or replacement, but it can also be used to quickly stop the flow of water into the toilet to prevent it from overflowing in the case of a clog. - Source: Internet Particularly standing valves are regularly observed where the water supply pipe is created under the floor or the cabinet. On a line similar to the inventory pipe, the tailings pile pipe is connected to the highest point of the valve. The handle of a valve that has just stopped is located in the valve body between the shaft and the outflowing inputs. - Source: Internet To shut off the water supply, turn the valve clockwise to close. To turn the water back on, simply turn the valve anti-clockwise. Turn it on and off slowly, never force it. if you over tighten or use excessive force to operate the stop tap you may damage it. - Source: Internet Please note that the external stop tap belongs to your local water supplier and you may need to seek permission to operate the external stop tap even in an emergency. If you do turn off the external stop tap in an emergency you may need to seek permission from your water supplier to turn it back on. Not all water suppliers will give permission to use the external stop tap and if you do operate it and cause damage then you may be liable for repairs. - Source: Internet Some properties share a water supply pipe and external stop tap. If you’re on a shared supply, remember that turning off the external stop tap will shut off the water supply to all the properties on the same supply. You’ll need to let your neighbours know before you shut off their supply so that you can complete your work. - Source: Internet You rarely see them unless you look inside the bathroom vanity or behind a toilet or washing machine. In more recent years, it’s becoming more common to add shut off valves near the washing machine and leaving these visible to remind you to shut the valves when you leave for an extended period of time. If you have a shut off valve that looks like the one pictured here, you need to turn the handle a full 90º to shut it off. How to remember, if the handle is in line with the piping, the water is flowing. If the handle is perpendicular to the pipe, the water supply is off. - Source: Internet If you’re having trouble using the stop tap, it could be that a key is needed to operate it. A universal stop tap key should work for most situations (some water meter housings need a specialist key and you will need to contact your water suppliers if it is not in the meter box), they can be purchased at plumbing merchants. A qualified plumber should also have the tools to operate your external stop tap. To find a plumber near you, use our WaterSafe approved plumbing business search. - Source: Internet There are a few places where you can shut off the flow of water, starting from the malfunctioning fixture and working your way backward. Appliances and fixtures have shutoff valves, and your whole house has a shutoff valve. The key is to work backward starting with the shutoff points closest to the leak (there’s no reason to kill the flow of water to your dishwasher and water heater if the leak is the toilet tank in the bathroom, after all). - Source: Internet You could also find the water heater area if you can’t see the shut-off valves. Two pipes will be located by the water heater. One of them is hot and this one leads out of the heater itself. This pipe is responsible for supplying hot water. - Source: Internet Refrigerators with water dispensers and icemakers as well as dishwashers SHOULD also have a water shut-off valve, but some may not. For dishwashers, look for a second valve on the hot water supply line (the one under your kitchen sink) that has a horizontal pipe leading away from it. For refrigerators, it’s usually located at the wall at the back of the refrigerator – sometimes hidden in a panel. Valves MIA? Check the attic/basement ceiling directly above/below the appliance. - Source: Internet Outdoor faucets are the most challenging and you really do want a water shut off valve for each outside faucet if you live where there’s any possibility of freezing weather. You need to install two (3 actually) things to reduce the risk of water leaks from these faucets: Replace your current faucet with a frost free faucet that has a longer stem , typically 12 inches long, so that when you shutoff the water, there’s no water left in the pipe near the exterior wall. Here’s an important video on the correct way to install Outdoor Hose Faucets. - Source: Internet Water leaks are never fun. When you detect a leak, the first thing you need to do is locate it and then shut the water off. Here’s how. - Source: Internet There are several water shut-off valves around your home, allowing you to cut off water flow at the source before problems become titanic. Waiting until you need to break out flotation devices to find them is a bad idea. It is extremely important for you and everyone in your home to know where your home’s water shut-off valves are and how to use them BEFORE disaster occurs. - Source: Internet A toilet just has a single cold-water valve, called a “stop valve.” Locate the “stop valve” and shut it off by turning the handle clockwise, just like the standard valves on a faucet discussed above. If the valve is too difficult to turn by hand, try wearing a work glove, or grip the handle with a pair of slip-joint pliers. - Source: Internet Learn where your main water shutoff valve is located. Label the valve so there’s no confusion as to which valve needs to be shut off in an emergency. Make sure every family member knows where the shut off valve is located and practice shutting the water off. - Source: Internet For example, let’s say your kitchen faucet is leaking. If shutting off the faucet doesn’t work, go back to the shutoff valve under the sink. If that doesn’t work, head down to the basement and see if there is a shutoff valve under the kitchen. If that doesn’t work, you can head to the whole house valve. Let’s take a look at the different kinds of valves you’ll encounter. - Source: Internet If it is a knob, you will need to turn it clockwise. This should then shut off the water supply. However, it is a lever; the water supply line is open if the lever is parallel to the pipeline. To turn the water off, you will need to turn it to a right angle to the pipeline. - Source: Internet : Not all refrigerators have a water line, but for those that do, the shutoff valve is typically located behind the refrigerator. Simply pull the fridge out from the wall to access the shutoff valve before you move, disconnect, or replace the refrigerator. Washing machine : In most cases, you can find the shutoff valve behind the washing machine, though it can also be installed off to one side or even above the machine so that it’s easier to access. If you are working on the washing machine or replacing it, then you need to pull it out from the wall anyway. Take this opportunity to turn off the shutoff valve before continuing. - Source: Internet You need to shutoff exterior faucets to avoid problems if/when the temperature drops below freezing. Typically you’ll have one or more outside faucets for watering the lawn, washing the car, etc. Each exterior faucet should have a shutoff valve inside the house where you can turn off the source of water to the outside faucet. - Source: Internet Chances are, there will come a time when you’ll have to turn off the water supply to your home: You may need to do so for a scheduled plumbing repair, or before leaving on a long trip. Then there are the emergency situations, such as when a pipe bursts somewhere behind the drywall or your bathroom is flooded with water, when you’ll need to cut the water off—and fast. Even if repairs or emergencies haven’t come up yet, it’s still important to know where the main water valves are and how they function: Closing and reopening them periodically will prevent them from getting stuck in place, and will give you an opportunity to inspect them for corrosion or broken connections. - Source: Internet After turning off the water to the house, you should open a faucet on the lowest level of the home to allow the water left in the pipes to drain. Leave the faucet open while you work. When you turn the water back on, keep the faucet open to give air trapped in the pipes a place to escape. Let the water run for about five to 10 minutes, then close the faucet. - Source: Internet Water leaks are never fun and definitely messy. The sooner you learn where your water shut off valve is and how to turn them off, the better. Sometimes your plumbing will spring a leak because a pipe or connector splits. Winter is more challenging if you live up north where temperatures drop below freezing. - Source: Internet Many appliances have an individual isolation valve, handy if you discover that an appliance has had a leak. Simply insert the screwdriver into the slot and turn it 90 degrees. This will shut off the water to the appliance or bathroom fixtures. - Source: Internet The alternate pipe will be for the cold water supply. Find the shutoff valves located on the pipes and twist them both clockwise for knobs and perpendicular for levers, as mentioned earlier in the article. If the shut-off valve for the kitchen sink does not switch the water off, you can still turn off the main valve. This is the valve that supplies water to the entire household. The valve is on the main water line. - Source: Internet Also, you may find water pressure diminished in some fixtures after turning the water back on. This is often due to sediment that has shaken loose and is now trapped in the water fixture. Most water fixtures have a screen, aerator, or cartridge that has become clogged with sediment. Remove the screen and clear the blockage and you should find water pressure returned to normal levels. - Source: Internet A stopcock valve is a brass valve with a water pipe on each side. Simply turn the tap clockwise to close off the water. If the main valve has not been turned in a while, it might be a bit stiff so use some WD40 to help loosen it ready to turn it clockwise. - Source: Internet To shut off the water supply to a washing machine or dishwasher, firstly locate the main water shut off valve for the appliance. For washing machines served by two valves (hot and cold), they simply work like outdoor valves. Turn them both off clockwise. Some washing machines may have a lever-style valve to shut off the water to the machine. To use this type of valve, simply pull the lever down. - Source: Internet Once I called a plumber to my home for some fixing purposes and when he saw there is no shutoff valve under my sink then he immediately calls me and said your sink must have a shut-off valve. But when I asked for the reason he told me that you may face sometime leakage problems in your sink. So, what will you do then? - Source: Internet To shut off a water heater, turn off the cold water valve above the water heater. This may be a lever or a regular circular-handle valve. If it is a lever, pull it 90 degrees from its open position. If it is a circular valve, turn it clockwise until it is closed. - Source: Internet When the water is off to the home, it cannot refill the toilet tank. So, if you flush the toilet when the water is off, the water from the tank will empty into the toilet bowl, leaving the tank empty until the water is turned back on. This means that the toilet can be flushed one time, even with the water off, but will not be able to be flushed again until the tank is refilled. - Source: Internet For this reason, it’s recommended to locate and test your main shutoff valve now, instead of scrabbling to try to find it when water is pouring into your home from a broken water line. The valve should work properly without relying on any tools. If you find that it is seized or that the valve doesn’t completely shut off the water to the home, then you should contact a plumber to replace the valve. - Source: Internet Every house has a main water shutoff valve. Sadly that can’t be said for each and every place in your home where you use water which can leak for some reason. Building codes keep improving but they focus first on safety like preventing fires which is why we now have smoke alarms. As a homeowner you might think a flooded basement is just as big a catastrophe but home repairs don’t have the same emotional impact as a ride in an ambulance. - Source: Internet Bathroom showers and bathtubs are the most challenging, because all of the plumbing is buried inside the walls. Typically you have to turn off the main water shut off valve to work on these bathroom features. Sometimes whirlpool bathtubs will have an access panel and shutoff valve, as they tend to require more repairs. - Source: Internet Once you are done making repairs or your plumbing emergency is no longer a problem, turn the water back on by rotating the valve counter-clockwise. The faucet that you previously opened will spit out some air as the water fills the pipes throughout the home. Allow a few minutes for the water to force out any air left in the lines, then turn the faucet off again. - Source: Internet When you move into a new house, there are so many things to learn that it’s easy to forget a few of them.

So if you don’t already know where your main water shut off valve is, here are the places to check. And you’re right that it would be nice if there was an industry standard, but there isn’t one. - Source: Internet Relieve the pressure in the pipes by draining the water that’s already in them. Turn on a sink located in the lowest level of your home, so water in the pipes from the floors above drain all the way down. Make sure to open both the hot and cold taps and run them until they empty completely.

Water supply pipes from the city typically run from the street side of your house to the indoors. So check out utility areas—such as the garage, laundry room, or basement—along exterior walls facing the street. A likely place to start looking is near your <strong>water</strong> heater. In a basement, the pipe will likely be at eye level; on main floors, it will often be located lower down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your home has an interior sprinkler system for fire suppression like many condominiums must now have, learn how to shut this system off. In multi-unit buildings, i.e. condominiums, the <strong>water</strong> supply may be shared and either an onsite manager or the fire department should know how to shut the <strong>water</strong> off if the owner of the unit with the shutoff valve isn’t home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gate valves consist of a circular handle attached with a stem to the body of the valve. When you turn the handle, it slowly closes a gate inside the body of the valve, blocking the flow of <strong>water</strong>. Turning the valve in the opposite direction will open the gate and allow the <strong>water</strong> to flow freely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There’s no one universal spot in every house where <strong>water</strong> supply valves are located, so it could take some time to find them—time that you won’t have if <strong>water</strong> is rapidly soaking through the second-floor ceiling. Before there’s any urgency (or <strong>water</strong> all over the floor) at your place, consider familiarizing yourself now with how to turn off the <strong>water</strong> supply. Show family members, too, where the valves are and how to cut them off quickly. This knowledge will make regular maintenance easier, and could save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars of repair costs in a worst-case scenario. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Turning off the <strong>water</strong> to the entire home will also stop the flow of <strong>water</strong> into the <strong>water</strong> heater. However, if you have a tank-style <strong>water</strong> heater, then the <strong>water</strong> inside the tank may still flow out of the <strong>water</strong> heater. Open a faucet on the lowest level of the home to drain any <strong>water</strong> remaining in the line. If the hot <strong>water</strong> continues to flow, locate the isolation valve above the hot <strong>water</strong> heater and turn it off to stop the flow of hot <strong>water</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Of course, once you’re done with your project, you can turn the <strong>water</strong> back on. If you turned off the <strong>water</strong> in the whole house, you’ll need to go through the house and bleed off the air by slowly opening the hot and cold faucets throughout your home one by one. Expect a lot of noise, sputtering, and a bit of splashing as the pipes are purged of air and returned to normal operating conditions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The external stop tap, is often located near the boundary of a premises under a small cover, about the size of a CD case. If you have a <strong>water</strong> meter, it will generally be located in the same pit or chamber as the meter. If it appears to be made of a plastic type material it may only require a quarter of a turn to turn off the <strong>water</strong>. When the lever is in line with the pipe it is on and when across the pipe it is off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A three-way rotary valve has two outlines and an inline. They are generally seen under kitchen <strong>sink</strong>s, where they are used for both the faucet and the dishwasher. Three-seater grandstands are accessible in various arrangements. Some are crossed, with both entrances pointing in inverted headings, while others have stores in an “L” or “Y” design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You may need some special tools used for plumbing repairs, so here they are (you can get them on Amazon or your local hardware store). You&rsquo;ll find them useful when installing or replacing one/more of your <strong>water</strong> shut off valves. If you have to cut the shut off valve off, you&rsquo;ll also need a pipe cutter (here they are on Amazon). Stanley 6 in, Adjustable Wrench Stanley 12 in, Groove Joint Pliers - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Different appliances will have valves in different locations. Faucets will generally have two shutoff valves – one for hot <strong>water</strong>, one for cold – underneath the <strong>sink</strong>. Toilets will have a single shutoff valve right below the tank. Dishwashers, washing machines, and other appliances will have a single shutoff valve near the floor (or, potentially, beneath the floor in the basement). Water heaters, depending on the type will have a shutoff valve before the intake. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>water</strong> main shutoff valve could be in a number of places, depending on the age of your home and the climate of your location. Valves can sometimes be buried inside drywall or behind the furnace. If your valve is in one of these tight locations you may need a professional plumber to relocate the valve or to install an easy-to-access secondary valve further down the line. The shutoff will either be a gate valve, which looks like a circular spigot, or a ball valve, which has a lever-style handle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>People who sound without shutoff valves surprise me. The best course of action is to immediately correct the situation. Where the <strong>water</strong> pipe enters the house, there should be the main shut-off valve. Every toilet, warm and cold line in bathtubs/showers, <strong>sink</strong>s, and <strong>sink</strong>s should have one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to turn off the <strong>water</strong> supply to bathroom taps, the valve is likely to be under the <strong>sink</strong>. Using a flathead screwdriver, turn the valve until the slot on the valve is at a right angle to the pipe. Run the tap as you isolate the tap to check if the <strong>water</strong> is off. Another option is to turn the main valve off for the property. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The main <strong>water</strong> shutoff valve is usually located on the main <strong>water</strong> line, where it enters the home. In most cases, this will be in a basement, cellar, or crawlspace because the <strong>water</strong> line extends from the neighborhood <strong>water</strong> main and enters the home from under the ground. In warmer areas where freezing pipes isn’t a concern, the main <strong>water</strong> shutoff might also be found outdoors on an exterior wall, or buried near the street. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fortunately, in most cases, turning <strong>water</strong> on or off doesn’t require any tools. However, in some cases, you may need a crescent wrench, or basin wrench to get at the shutoff valves. This is usually only the case for the main <strong>water</strong> supply discussed later. You might want to have a can of WD-40 or another penetrating agent on hand in case the valves don’t turn freely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>, typically 12 inches long, so that when you shutoff the <strong>water</strong>, there&rsquo;s no <strong>water</strong> left in the pipe near the exterior wall. Here&rsquo;s an important video on the correct way to install Outdoor Hose Faucets. Install a <strong>water</strong> shut off valve on your new frost free faucet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hot <strong>water</strong> cylinders also have a valve that you can turn. Again, turn this valve clockwise to shut off the hot <strong>water</strong>. Properties with combination boilers will have the <strong>water</strong> supply cut off when the main shutoff valve for the property is turned. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Look for two chrome-plated or plastic stop valves under the <strong>sink</strong>, usually at the back of the cabinet. These are connected to the <strong>water</strong> supply tubes that serve the faucet—one for cold, and the other for hot. The cold is usually on the right-hand side. To shut off a single-handle faucet, you will need to turn off both. Turn the valves clockwise to turn them off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Main Water Shut-Off Valve Sometimes main <strong>water</strong> shut-off valves require a “meter key.” You can purchase one at your local home improvement store, or use a crescent wrench and a screwdriver. Secure either the meter key or the wrench on the valve, and then turn it clockwise to stop the flow of <strong>water</strong>. If you turn off your main line, you’ll also need to go back into your home and release pressure from the pipes by running both your cold and hot <strong>water</strong> lines until <strong>water</strong> no longer runs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Next to this pipe, you will find two different metal pipes or flexible lines. These will run from the tailpiece of the faucet into the wall or sometimes into the floor. These pipes are known as the hot and cold <strong>water</strong> lines. The cold <strong>water</strong> one is often on the right side and the hot one is found on the left. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Burst pipes and <strong>water</strong> leaks from appliances and fixtures can rapidly result in thousands of dollars in <strong>water</strong> damage to your home – and a sky high <strong>water</strong> bill. Quick action is key, before repair needs turn your home into a money pit. How can you prevent <strong>water</strong> damage headaches? It all starts with a little 4-1-1 on the <strong>water</strong> shut-off valves throughout your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>: The shutoff valve for a dishwasher is generally located inside a lower kitchen cabinet, and may even be under the kitchen <strong>sink</strong>, depending on the proximity of the dishwasher to the <strong>sink</strong> in the kitchen layout. Turn off this valve before repairing or replacing the dishwasher to avoid flooding the kitchen. Refrigerator : Not all refrigerators have a <strong>water</strong> line, but for those that do, the shutoff valve is typically located behind the refrigerator. Simply pull the fridge out from the wall to access the shutoff valve before you move, disconnect, or replace the refrigerator. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to replace the washer (and the washer sealing around the shaft where it exits to meet the handle) without removing the valve. Just shut off <strong>water</strong> upstream, release pressure, and carefully undo the packing nut (the nut just under the handle) to remove the whole shaft assembly. Either replace the two washers or the whole shaft and reassemble, adjusting the packing nut tightness to prevent leaking around the shaft. Here&rsquo;s a photo of a typical replacement kit: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Note these different <strong>water</strong> lines. Before they enter into the wall, you will notice a lever on each pipeline. This lever can also look like a knob or other adjustable mechanism. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The shutoff valve is attached to the pipe behind the toilet. You will be able to put a flathead screwdriver in the slot of the isolation valve and turn 90 degrees. This means you do not need to turn off the <strong>water</strong> supply to the entire property. Some older toilets do not have an isolation valve, and therefore you will need to use the main <strong>water</strong> shut off valve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In the event you need to turn off the <strong>water</strong> to your entire house, you can use the main <strong>water</strong> valve on the house side of your <strong>water</strong> meter. Your <strong>water</strong> meter is often located outside of your home in a cement box buried in the ground. It can also sometimes be found in the house. In some cases, the main <strong>water</strong> shutoff can be found in a basement or crawlspace. The main shut off valve will always have a <strong>water</strong> meter with it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before we jump in though, a bit of advice. The best time to learn where all the valves in your house are is before you’re rushing around with a bucket and a mop dealing with a leak. If you have the good luck to be reading this article at a time when <strong>water</strong> isn’t spraying all over your bathroom, we’d recommend reading through it and then walking through your house looking at all the places there is <strong>water</strong> access—the kitchen, the bathroom, the utility room, etc. As you do, ask yourself “Where is the valve for this?” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While you’re draining the system, be sure to turn off your <strong>water</strong> heater. Electric heaters are simple to turn off and back on, but if you have an older gas <strong>water</strong> heater and aren’t familiar with how it works, please contact your utility company or knowledgeable contractor or friend to help. Typically for a gas heater you don’t turn it completely off, but simply dial it back to the pilot light setting. You should only need to cut the gas to the <strong>water</strong> heater entirely if you’re draining the <strong>water</strong> heater itself as part of your leak repair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Water emergencies happen often from a plumbing leak inside your home to <strong>water</strong> entering your home from outside. You need to respond to <strong>water</strong> problems quickly. Why? Water or high levels of moisture left too long can cause damage, often hidden damage, which increases the risk of mold along with higher repair costs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To turn the <strong>water</strong> supply off, give a gate valve a few turns clockwise until you can’t turn it any longer. For ball valves, turn the lever clockwise 90 degrees. In most cases, you won’t need any additional tools to turn off the main <strong>water</strong> shut off valve. These valves are designed for simple manual hand turning, but if you are having trouble turning it or if the valve is completely seized, you may need to use a channel lock wrench or pipe wrench. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>: Faucet repair and replacement is one of the most common DIY plumbing jobs, so it’s important to know that the isolation valve for these fixtures can generally be found under the <strong>sink</strong>. In some instances, the hot and cold <strong>water</strong> lines may have independent valves that need to both be turned off to stop the flow of <strong>water</strong> through the faucet. Toilet: The shutoff valve for most toilets is located behind the toilet or slightly off to one side. This valve can be used to turn off the <strong>water</strong> for repairs or replacement, but it can also be used to quickly stop the flow of <strong>water</strong> into the toilet to prevent it from overflowing in the case of a clog. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Particularly standing valves are regularly observed where the <strong>water</strong> supply pipe is created under the floor or the cabinet. On a line similar to the inventory pipe, the tailings pile pipe is connected to the highest point of the valve. The handle of a valve that has just stopped is located in the valve body between the shaft and the outflowing inputs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To shut off the <strong>water</strong> supply, turn the valve clockwise to close. To turn the <strong>water</strong> back on, simply turn the valve anti-clockwise. Turn it on and off slowly, never force it. if you over tighten or use excessive force to operate the stop tap you may damage it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Please note that the external stop tap belongs to your local <strong>water</strong> supplier and you may need to seek permission to operate the external stop tap even in an emergency. If you do turn off the external stop tap in an emergency you may need to seek permission from your <strong>water</strong> supplier to turn it back on. Not all <strong>water</strong> suppliers will give permission to use the external stop tap and if you do operate it and cause damage then you may be liable for repairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some properties share a <strong>water</strong> supply pipe and external stop tap. If you&rsquo;re on a shared supply, remember that turning off the external stop tap will shut off the <strong>water</strong> supply to all the properties on the same supply. You&rsquo;ll need to let your neighbours know before you shut off their supply so that you can complete your work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You rarely see them unless you look inside the bathroom vanity or behind a toilet or washing machine. In more recent years, it&rsquo;s becoming more common to add shut off valves near the washing machine and leaving these visible to remind you to shut the valves when you leave for an extended period of time. If you have a shut off valve that looks like the one pictured here, you need to turn the handle a full 90º to shut it off. How to remember, if the handle is in line with the piping, the <strong>water</strong> is flowing. If the handle is perpendicular to the pipe, the <strong>water</strong> supply is off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;re having trouble using the stop tap, it could be that a key is needed to operate it. A universal stop tap key should work for most situations (some <strong>water</strong> meter housings need a specialist key and you will need to contact your <strong>water</strong> suppliers if it is not in the meter box), they can be purchased at plumbing merchants. A qualified plumber should also have the tools to operate your external stop tap. To find a plumber near you, use our WaterSafe approved plumbing business search. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are a few places where you can shut off the flow of <strong>water</strong>, starting from the malfunctioning fixture and working your way backward. Appliances and fixtures have shutoff valves, and your whole house has a shutoff valve. The key is to work backward starting with the shutoff points closest to the leak (there’s no reason to kill the flow of <strong>water</strong> to your dishwasher and <strong>water</strong> heater if the leak is the toilet tank in the bathroom, after all). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You could also find the <strong>water</strong> heater area if you can’t see the shut-off valves. Two pipes will be located by the <strong>water</strong> heater. One of them is hot and this one leads out of the heater itself. This pipe is responsible for supplying hot <strong>water</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Refrigerators with <strong>water</strong> dispensers and icemakers as well as dishwashers SHOULD also have a <strong>water</strong> shut-off valve, but some may not. For dishwashers, look for a second valve on the hot <strong>water</strong> supply line (the one under your kitchen <strong>sink</strong>) that has a horizontal pipe leading away from it. For refrigerators, it’s usually located at the wall at the back of the refrigerator – sometimes hidden in a panel. Valves MIA? Check the attic/basement ceiling directly above/below the appliance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Outdoor faucets are the most challenging and you really do want a <strong>water</strong> shut off valve for each outside faucet if you live where there&rsquo;s any possibility of freezing weather. You need to install two (3 actually) things to reduce the risk of <strong>water</strong> leaks from these faucets: Replace your current faucet with a frost free faucet that has a longer stem , typically 12 inches long, so that when you shutoff the <strong>water</strong>, there&rsquo;s no <strong>water</strong> left in the pipe near the exterior wall. Here&rsquo;s an important video on the correct way to install Outdoor Hose Faucets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Water leaks are never fun. When you detect a leak, the first thing you need to do is locate it and then shut the <strong>water</strong> off. Here’s how. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are several <strong>water</strong> shut-off valves around your home, allowing you to cut off <strong>water</strong> flow at the source before problems become titanic. Waiting until you need to break out flotation devices to find them is a bad idea. It is extremely important for you and everyone in your home to know where your home’s <strong>water</strong> shut-off valves are and how to use them BEFORE disaster occurs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A toilet just has a single cold-<strong>water</strong> valve, called a “stop valve.” Locate the “stop valve” and shut it off by turning the handle clockwise, just like the standard valves on a faucet discussed above. If the valve is too difficult to turn by hand, try wearing a work glove, or grip the handle with a pair of slip-joint pliers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Learn where your main <strong>water</strong> shutoff valve is located. Label the valve so there&rsquo;s no confusion as to which valve needs to be shut off in an emergency. Make sure every family member knows where the shut off valve is located and practice shutting the <strong>water</strong> off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For example, let’s say your kitchen faucet is leaking. If shutting off the faucet doesn’t work, go back to the shutoff valve under the <strong>sink</strong>. If that doesn’t work, head down to the basement and see if there is a shutoff valve under the kitchen. If that doesn’t work, you can head to the whole house valve. Let’s take a look at the different kinds of valves you’ll encounter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If it is a knob, you will need to turn it clockwise. This should then shut off the <strong>water</strong> supply. However, it is a lever; the <strong>water</strong> supply line is open if the lever is parallel to the pipeline. To turn the <strong>water</strong> off, you will need to turn it to a right angle to the pipeline. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>: Not all refrigerators have a <strong>water</strong> line, but for those that do, the shutoff valve is typically located behind the refrigerator. Simply pull the fridge out from the wall to access the shutoff valve before you move, disconnect, or replace the refrigerator. Washing machine : In most cases, you can find the shutoff valve behind the washing machine, though it can also be installed off to one side or even above the machine so that it’s easier to access. If you are working on the washing machine or replacing it, then you need to pull it out from the wall anyway. Take this opportunity to turn off the shutoff valve before continuing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You need to shutoff exterior faucets to avoid problems if/when the temperature drops below freezing. Typically you&rsquo;ll have one or more outside faucets for <strong>water</strong>ing the lawn, washing the car, etc. Each exterior faucet should have a shutoff valve inside the house where you can turn off the source of <strong>water</strong> to the outside faucet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Chances are, there will come a time when you’ll have to turn off the <strong>water</strong> supply to your home: You may need to do so for a scheduled plumbing repair, or before leaving on a long trip. Then there are the emergency situations, such as when a pipe bursts somewhere behind the drywall or your bathroom is flooded with <strong>water</strong>, when you’ll need to cut the <strong>water</strong> off—and fast. Even if repairs or emergencies haven’t come up yet, it’s still important to know where the main <strong>water</strong> valves are and how they function: Closing and reopening them periodically will prevent them from getting stuck in place, and will give you an opportunity to inspect them for corrosion or broken connections. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After turning off the <strong>water</strong> to the house, you should open a faucet on the lowest level of the home to allow the <strong>water</strong> left in the pipes to drain. Leave the faucet open while you work. When you turn the <strong>water</strong> back on, keep the faucet open to give air trapped in the pipes a place to escape. Let the <strong>water</strong> run for about five to 10 minutes, then close the faucet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Water leaks are never fun and definitely messy. The sooner you learn where your <strong>water</strong> shut off valve is and how to turn them off, the better. Sometimes your plumbing will spring a leak because a pipe or connector splits. Winter is more challenging if you live up north where temperatures drop below freezing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Many appliances have an individual isolation valve, handy if you discover that an appliance has had a leak. Simply insert the screwdriver into the slot and turn it 90 degrees. This will shut off the <strong>water</strong> to the appliance or bathroom fixtures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The alternate pipe will be for the cold <strong>water</strong> supply. Find the shutoff valves located on the pipes and twist them both clockwise for knobs and perpendicular for levers, as mentioned earlier in the article. If the shut-off valve for the kitchen <strong>sink</strong> does not switch the <strong>water</strong> off, you can still turn off the main valve. This is the valve that supplies <strong>water</strong> to the entire household. The valve is on the main <strong>water</strong> line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Also, you may find <strong>water</strong> pressure diminished in some fixtures after turning the <strong>water</strong> back on. This is often due to sediment that has shaken loose and is now trapped in the <strong>water</strong> fixture. Most <strong>water</strong> fixtures have a screen, aerator, or cartridge that has become clogged with sediment. Remove the screen and clear the blockage and you should find <strong>water</strong> pressure returned to normal levels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A stopcock valve is a brass valve with a <strong>water</strong> pipe on each side. Simply turn the tap clockwise to close off the <strong>water</strong>. If the main valve has not been turned in a while, it might be a bit stiff so use some WD40 to help loosen it ready to turn it clockwise. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To shut off the <strong>water</strong> supply to a washing machine or dishwasher, firstly locate the main <strong>water</strong> shut off valve for the appliance. For washing machines served by two valves (hot and cold), they simply work like outdoor valves. Turn them both off clockwise. Some washing machines may have a lever-style valve to shut off the <strong>water</strong> to the machine. To use this type of valve, simply pull the lever down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once I called a plumber to my home for some fixing purposes and when he saw there is no shutoff valve under my <strong>sink</strong> then he immediately calls me and said your <strong>sink</strong> must have a shut-off valve. But when I asked for the reason he told me that you may face sometime leakage problems in your <strong>sink</strong>. So, what will you do then? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To shut off a <strong>water</strong> heater, turn off the cold <strong>water</strong> valve above the <strong>water</strong> heater. This may be a lever or a regular circular-handle valve. If it is a lever, pull it 90 degrees from its open position. If it is a circular valve, turn it clockwise until it is closed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When the <strong>water</strong> is off to the home, it cannot refill the toilet tank. So, if you flush the toilet when the <strong>water</strong> is off, the <strong>water</strong> from the tank will empty into the toilet bowl, leaving the tank empty until the <strong>water</strong> is turned back on. This means that the toilet can be flushed one time, even with the <strong>water</strong> off, but will not be able to be flushed again until the tank is refilled. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For this reason, it’s recommended to locate and test your main shutoff valve now, instead of scrabbling to try to find it when <strong>water</strong> is pouring into your home from a broken <strong>water</strong> line. The valve should work properly without relying on any tools. If you find that it is seized or that the valve doesn’t completely shut off the <strong>water</strong> to the home, then you should contact a plumber to replace the valve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Every house has a main <strong>water</strong> shutoff valve. Sadly that can&rsquo;t be said for each and every place in your home where you use <strong>water</strong> which can leak for some reason. Building codes keep improving but they focus first on safety like preventing fires which is why we now have smoke alarms. As a homeowner you might think a flooded basement is just as big a catastrophe but home repairs don&rsquo;t have the same emotional impact as a ride in an ambulance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bathroom showers and bathtubs are the most challenging, because all of the plumbing is buried inside the walls. Typically you have to turn off the main <strong>water</strong> shut off valve to work on these bathroom features. Sometimes whirlpool bathtubs will have an access panel and shutoff valve, as they tend to require more repairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once you are done making repairs or your plumbing emergency is no longer a problem, turn the <strong>water</strong> back on by rotating the valve counter-clockwise. The faucet that you previously opened will spit out some air as the <strong>water</strong> fills the pipes throughout the home. Allow a few minutes for the <strong>water</strong> to force out any air left in the lines, then turn the faucet off again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you move into a new house, there are so many things to learn that it&rsquo;s easy to forget a few of them. That&rsquo;s why I wrote 30 New Homeowner Tips You Don&rsquo;t Want to Skip. Number 17 reads … “Find your main <strong>water</strong> shutoff and learn how to turn your <strong>water</strong> off (guess where that points)”. So if you don&rsquo;t already know where your main <strong>water</strong> shut off valve is, here are the places to check. And you&rsquo;re right that it would be nice if there was an industry standard, but there isn&rsquo;t one. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Relieve the pressure in the pipes by draining the <strong>water</strong> that’s already in them. Turn on a <strong>sink</strong> located in the lowest level of your home, so <strong>water</strong> in the pipes from the floors above drain all the way down. Make sure to open both the hot and cold taps and run them until they empty completely. At this point, you can start working on any plumbing projects that require the <strong>water</strong> to be shut down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When a home’s <strong>water</strong> supply system leaks or a repair to one of the plumbing fixtures is needed, you’ll have to shut off the <strong>water</strong>. It’s best to do this at the valve that’s closest to the problem. That way, the rest of the house will still have a functioning <strong>water</strong> supply. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>: In most cases, you can find the shutoff valve behind the washing machine, though it can also be installed off to one side or even above the machine so that it’s easier to access. If you are working on the washing machine or replacing it, then you need to pull it out from the wall anyway. Take this opportunity to turn off the shutoff valve before continuing. Sink : Faucet repair and replacement is one of the most common DIY plumbing jobs, so it’s important to know that the isolation valve for these fixtures can generally be found under the <strong>sink</strong>. In some instances, the hot and cold <strong>water</strong> lines may have independent valves that need to both be turned off to stop the flow of <strong>water</strong> through the faucet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=http://woulfefamily.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/Big_2_Maurice.343183653_std.JPG onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="How To Turn Off Water To Kitchen Sink - how to turn off water supply to kitchen sink uk">
