It is important not to confuse this species with Schefflera actinophylla, which is toxic. In the world of Schefflera arboricola, it is either a beloved or despised species. - Source: Internet Sometimes, a plant is given a common name that is difficult to understand. With the umbrella tree (​Schefflera actinophylla), ​that is not the case at all. This tropical tree has large, palmlike, shiny leaves positioned atop its thin trunks, looking for all the world like a tall umbrella. Enjoy and appreciate the umbrella tree, but make sure your pets or guests don’t nibble on it. - Source: Internet Umbrella plant is best propagated during the spring. To propagate the umbrella tree, cut out a stem of about 2 – 6 inches long. Trim off all leaves except for a set of leaves on the stem. - Source: Internet When planting umbrella trees, it is best to use a high quality soil, such as our Plantura Organic Flower Compost. It retains its structure over a long period of time and can therefore store water and nutrients for a long time whilst making them available to the plant. The expanded clay ensures good permeability First, fill the pot with a drainage layer of coarse material, so that water can always drain away and will not lead to waterlogging. This is followed by a layer of soil, upon which the root ball of the Schefflera should be placed. Finally, fill in all the gaps with substrate and lightly press down so that the umbrella plant gets a good hold. - Source: Internet Also never fertilize your umbrella plant if it is having issues. Fertilizer is not a plant medicine. It will only stress out an already stressed-out plant. Analyze, adjust, and when your plant recovers, continue your normal care routine. - Source: Internet Can a Schefflera bloom? With ideal environmental conditions and appropriate care of the umbrella plant Schefflera can even bloom as a houseplant. The flowering period extends from July to August. Cool overwintering at around 16 °C, as well as refraining from regular pruning, both promote flower formation. - Source: Internet A Schefflera plant, native to Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands, is often called an Umbrella Tree because of its large, shiny, dark green leaflets that drape down like the spokes of an umbrella. In nature, the plant can be a tall tree or a short bush with woody stems, growing as tall as 10-50 ft. In some outdoor areas, a Schefflera is called an Octopus Tree because it produces impressive, tentacle like flowers. - Source: Internet As the plant grows, the lower branches will turn brown and die. Prune these off to keep the plant looking neat. Prune any dead or damaged branches. If the umbrella plant is too tall, you can trim off the top above the last leaves. Trimming the growth tip this way will also make the plant bushier. - Source: Internet Umbrella tree care is easy if you site the plant properly. Place the umbrella tree in bright, indirect light of the kind it would get at an east-, west-, or south-facing window. During the growing season, water it whenever the soil is moderately dry, but cut back on water in winter. - Source: Internet Its pests include spider mites and scale insects. An important quality of umbrella plant over other plants is that aside from giving off oxygen into the air, it absorbs toxins. Umbrella plant purifies the air and improves the quality of air in and around your home. - Source: Internet The umbrella tree is a desirable houseplant, making any room or patio feel tropical. The trees are fast growers, and when planted outside, they create dense hedges or windbreaks for property lines, but their invasive tendencies outweigh their usefulness. Indoors is a different story. - Source: Internet Chameleons are a type of lizard that can change the color of their skin. They are found in warm climates and are known for their long tongues and ability to climb trees. Dwarf umbrellas are a type of plant that is native to Madagascar. They are a member of the genus Podocarpus and are often used as ornamental plants. - Source: Internet When grown outdoors in warmer climates, the umbrella plants produce bright red flowers that resemble tentacles. The flowers grow on long stems above the foliage. This is where one of the popular names for the plant comes from: octopus tree. - Source: Internet Every 18-24 months, you will need to repot your umbrella plant. If you want it to continue to grow, go up 2 inches in pot diameter. Otherwise, remove the existing potting mix and replace it with new potting mix, then put the plant back in the same pot. If the roots are growing out of the drainage holes, you need to go up to a larger pot. - Source: Internet In conclusion, umbrella plants are easy to grow plants. They grow quickly and can tolerate a range of light conditions. Umbrella plants are readily available at nurseries and online. - Source: Internet This species is very common as a houseplant and is available in several varieties. It is robust, easy to care for and grows between 30 and 200 cm tall. Dwarf umbrella tree ‘Gold Capella’: With this variety, the dark green leaves are variegated yellowish or light green. - Source: Internet Tip: The ratio of light and temperature is important for the growth of Schefflera. If the umbrella tree is too warm or too shaded, it tends to become leggy – that is, it forms long shoots with few leaves. Therefore, for compact growth, cooler temperatures of 18 to 20 °C should be maintained or lighting should be improved. For this purpose, for example, a plant lamp can be used. - Source: Internet One thing you need to remember, though, is that older umbrella trees typically need to be supported by a moss stick or a stake. In case you wish to use a moss stick make sure to choose the one that has matured enough and has aerial roots. The only way to prevent this is to regularly prune and pinch your umbrella plant. - Source: Internet Umbrella plants are multi trunk trees.

Defoliation is often seen when dwarf umbrella trees are grown as indoor bonsai trees. - Source: Internet The Schefflera is slightly poisonous, especially to pets. It contains oxalate crystals, which cannot be broken down by cats and dogs and lead to symptoms of poisoning if ingested. Skin contact should be avoided for safety, and the plant should not be consumed.

They typically have multiple branches with palmate compound or whorled leaves. You will recognize them by their distinctive look: they resemble fingers coming from the stalk. They typically have 4 to 12 leaflets. This gives them an umbrella spoke appearance, hence the name. - Source: Internet Turn the umbrella plant a quarter turn once a week, so the trunk stays straight. Dust the leaves with a clean, soft cloth. Inspect the plant for pests and diseases. Pests like to hide on the underside of leaves, so look there, too. - Source: Internet Commonly referred to as an “umbrella tree,” the Shefflera plant has a fashionable look in a large corner pot.

Some plants, such as the Schefflera arboricola and Split Leaf Philodendron, provide some hiding and climbing habitats for your chameleon, but they are not as safe as other types of plants for them to consume and drink from. Several poisonous plants have been reduced to stems by Veiled Chameleons, but philodendrons and crocon remain dangerous plants that the chameleons continue to consume. In this regard, it is critical to research which plants and beverages are safe for your chameleon to consume. - Source: Internet When to repot, an umbrella plant should be during springtime. This time the plant is inactive and would not require you feeding it for about the next four weeks.

Trim off all leaves except for a set of leaves on the stem. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When planting <strong>umbrella</strong> trees, it is best to use a high quality soil, such as our Plantura Organic Flower Compost. It retains its structure over a long period of time and can therefore store water and nutrients for a long time whilst making them available to the plant. The expanded clay ensures good permeability First, fill the pot with a drainage layer of coarse material, so that water can always drain away and will not lead to waterlogging. This is followed by a layer of soil, upon which the root ball of the Schefflera should be placed. Finally, fill in all the gaps with substrate and lightly press down so that the <strong>umbrella</strong> plant gets a good hold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Also never fertilize your <strong>umbrella</strong> plant if it is having issues. Fertilizer is not a plant medicine. It will only stress out an already stressed-out plant. Analyze, adjust, and when your plant recovers, continue your normal care routine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Can a Schefflera bloom? With ideal environmental conditions and appropriate care of the <strong>umbrella</strong> plant Schefflera can even bloom as a houseplant. The flowering period extends from July to August. Cool overwintering at around 16 °C, as well as refraining from regular pruning, both promote flower formation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A Schefflera plant, native to Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands, is often called an Umbrella Tree because of its large, shiny, dark green leaflets that drape down like the spokes of an <strong>umbrella</strong>. In nature, the plant can be a tall tree or a short bush with woody stems, growing as tall as 10-50 ft. In some outdoor areas, a Schefflera is called an Octopus Tree because it produces impressive, tentacle like flowers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As the plant grows, the lower branches will turn brown and die. Prune these off to keep the plant looking neat. Prune any dead or damaged branches. If the <strong>umbrella</strong> plant is too tall, you can trim off the top above the last leaves. Trimming the growth tip this way will also make the plant bushier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Umbrella tree care is easy if you site the plant properly. Place the <strong>umbrella</strong> tree in bright, indirect light of the kind it would get at an east-, west-, or south-facing window. During the growing season, water it whenever the soil is moderately dry, but cut back on water in winter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Its pests include spider mites and scale insects. An important quality of <strong>umbrella</strong> plant over other plants is that aside from giving off oxygen into the air, it absorbs toxins. Umbrella plant purifies the air and improves the quality of air in and around your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>umbrella</strong> tree is a desirable houseplant, making any room or patio feel tropical. The trees are fast growers, and when planted outside, they create dense hedges or windbreaks for property lines, but their invasive tendencies outweigh their usefulness. Indoors is a different story. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Chameleons are a type of lizard that can change the color of their skin. They are found in warm climates and are known for their long tongues and ability to climb trees. Dwarf <strong>umbrella</strong>s are a type of plant that is native to Madagascar. They are a member of the genus Podocarpus and are often used as ornamental plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When grown outdoors in warmer climates, the <strong>umbrella</strong> plants produce bright red flowers that resemble tentacles.

This is where one of the popular names for the plant comes from: octopus tree. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Every 18-24 months, you will need to repot your <strong>umbrella</strong> plant. If you want it to continue to grow, go up 2 inches in pot diameter. Otherwise, remove the existing potting mix and replace it with new potting mix, then put the plant back in the same pot. If the roots are growing out of the drainage holes, you need to go up to a larger pot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In conclusion, <strong>umbrella</strong> plants are easy to grow plants. They grow quickly and can tolerate a range of light conditions. Umbrella plants are readily available at nurseries and online. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This species is very common as a houseplant and is available in several varieties. It is robust, easy to care for and grows between 30 and 200 cm tall. Dwarf <strong>umbrella</strong> tree ‘Gold Capella’: With this variety, the dark green leaves are variegated yellowish or light green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Tip: The ratio of light and temperature is important for the growth of Schefflera. If the <strong>umbrella</strong> tree is too warm or too shaded, it tends to become leggy – that is, it forms long shoots with few leaves. Therefore, for compact growth, cooler temperatures of 18 to 20 °C should be maintained or lighting should be improved. For this purpose, for example, a plant lamp can be used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One thing you need to remember, though, is that older <strong>umbrella</strong> trees typically need to be supported by a moss stick or a stake. In case you wish to use a moss stick make sure to choose the one that has matured enough and has aerial roots. The only way to prevent this is to regularly prune and pinch your <strong>umbrella</strong> plant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Umbrella plants are multi trunk trees.

Removing all leaves during the active growing season. This will promote branching out and will result in smaller leaf size when new growth returns. Defoliation is often seen when dwarf <strong>umbrella</strong> trees are grown as indoor bonsai trees. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Schefflera is slightly <strong>poisonous</strong>, especially to pets. It contains oxalate crystals, which cannot be broken down by cats and dogs and lead to symptoms of poisoning if ingested. Skin contact should be avoided for safety, and the plant should not be consumed. Place the <strong>umbrella</strong> plant out of reach of children and pets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most <strong>umbrella</strong> plants have two or more trunks, though it is not unheard of to find those with only one trunk. They typically have multiple branches with palmate compound or whorled leaves. You will recognize them by their distinctive look: they resemble fingers coming from the stalk. They typically have 4 to 12 leaflets. This gives them an <strong>umbrella</strong> spoke appearance, hence the name. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Turn the <strong>umbrella</strong> plant a quarter turn once a week, so the trunk stays straight.

Umbrella plants, for example, are safe to eat and drink from, and they provide a safe place for chameleons to hide and climb. Some plants, such as the Schefflera arboricola and Split Leaf Philodendron, provide some hiding and climbing habitats for your chameleon, but they are not as safe as other types of plants for them to consume and drink from. Several <strong>poisonous</strong> plants have been reduced to stems by Veiled Chameleons, but philodendrons and crocon remain dangerous plants that the chameleons continue to consume. In this regard, it is critical to research which plants and beverages are safe for your chameleon to consume. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When to repot, an <strong>umbrella</strong> plant should be during springtime. This time the plant is inactive and would not require you feeding it for about the next four weeks. The nutrients in the new compost will sustain its growth and developmental needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One important thing you need to remember about <strong>umbrella</strong> plants is that they are toxic to cats and dogs. Keep this in mind if you wish to grow <strong>umbrella</strong> trees in your home. It is best to grow them only in places where your pets don&rsquo;t have access to. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Keep in mind that it is important to repot your <strong>umbrella</strong> tree once in 2 years. During repotting, it is vital to provide your plant with anew potting mix. Always repot during spring. To stay on the safe side, avoid fertilizing your plant for one month after repotting.
