If the time change means the sun is up before you are, blackouts curtains can be a worthwhile investment: Experts told us they look like typical curtains but feature a blackout lining that stops light from filtering into your room. They can also help regulate how well you sleep overall — studies have found that shifts in exposure to light before you rise can reduce your quality of sleep, disrupt circadian rhythm (the internal process that regulates sleep) and make you feel fatigued much earlier in the day. - Source: Internet O’Brien also noted that curtains with blackout lining are heavier than typical curtains, so investing in a good quality drapery rod is important. “Don’t buy the thinnest, least expensive rod — you don’t want it to sag or break,” she said, adding that shoppers should look for a rod that has a larger diameter of about 1 inch that can hold more fabric. And while there’s a price jump, both O’Brien and Brown recommended a traverse rod, which features a baton or string that you pull to open and close the curtains for additional ease. - Source: Internet Available in three different sizes ranging from 80 inches to 104 inches in length, these curtains with pole pockets can be a simple yet effective choice, explained Brown. “This selection accomplishes all of your needs for a beautifully designed blackout curtain that’s still reasonably priced,” she said. The curtain is offered individually or in a set of two and you can purchase separate ring clips for ease of use. - Source: Internet For your bedroom, these thermal insulated drapes can block up to 99 percent of light, according to the brand.

You can select from two widths — 50 inches and 100 inches — as well as three lengths: 84 inches, 96 inches and 108 inches. - Source: Internet Depending on the length of your ceiling and where the window is located, Brown recommended measuring at least 8 to 10 inches from the sides of the window, if possible, so the curtains are wider than your actual windows. And as a rule of thumb for floor-length curtains, Brown suggested they “kiss the floor,” meaning curtains should be an inch or so above the ground. Our experts emphasized that hiring a professional to measure the right size curtain can help avoid mistakes and costly replacements. - Source: Internet If you’re looking at a specific curtain that’s not offered as a blackout option, or if you simply want to keep the curtains you already have in your home, placing a blackout curtain liner under your regular curtain can be an effective (and often more economical) way to get the blackout effect, according to Peters. “You can buy any curtains that fit your style and pair them with a blackout curtain or blackout curtain liner,” she said. Our experts recommended this blackout liner that comes with two panels and drapery rings, is machine washable and blocks out up to 99 percent of light, according to the brand. - Source: Internet .
