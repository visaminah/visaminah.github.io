We love how the carpet flows with the language of the room, speaking its language but not sowing discord. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Maybe it’s not the decorative accents that bring the color to the space but an accent wall instead. Yes, please! I love the depth that the blue <strong>walls</strong>, brown sofa, and white accents achieve here. The dark chocolate brown sofa is as dark as you could imagine but the space still feels so very light and bright. The brown sofa feels less heavy with the addition of a textured rug and neutral accent pillows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yellow is sunny and vibrant and brings positivity into a room.

Using light <strong>walls</strong> helps prevent dark <strong>furniture</strong> from dominating a space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, if you don’t want to overdo yellow, go for mustard yellow.

I think brown leather sofas are great for family homes and can be used in a variety of spaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can also add other <strong>furniture</strong> of a different color to your rooms and make them look better with dark brown <strong>furniture</strong>.
