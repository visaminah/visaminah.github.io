It’s characterful, yet still entirely practical and functional. See her home makeover. - Source: Internet From Prussian to Tiffany to cobalt, it’s safe to say designers are mad about blue. The cool hue, renowned for its ability to incite feelings of calmness is a designer go-to for bedrooms. While some revere hushed shades of blue that conjure up visions of sea and sky, others prefer more attention-getting shades—think: royal blue and cerulean—that evoke nautical notes, especially when paired with snippets of bright white. And let’s not forget the moodiest iterations of all: indigo and navy. Both hues pair effortlessly with neutrals like cognac (not to mention, quasi-neutrals like leopard), and have a knack for making even basics like plain white bedding look magnificently richer. - Source: Internet 21 of 23 Nautical Blue Color Palette Robert Brinson Ocean Blue + Off-White + Scarlet Get a maritime look with a nautical color scheme. Use off-white on the upper walls and ceiling, pale ocean blue on the main wall areas, and white upholstery or bedding, as seen in this pretty bedroom. Bright red accents and warm wooden furnishings help bolster the subtle nautical motif. - Source: Internet Window treatments are hugely important in a bedroom; some people prefer that not a chink of light can get in, while others like to wake up with the daylight. Long, luxurious curtains are beautiful in a bedroom, in a thick material that will feel cosy in winter, perhaps with sheer blinds behind to let the light in during the daytime. There are plenty of readymade curtains out there if you’re on a budget, and blinds alone can also be a cost-effective way to dress your windows. Having a blackout blind made in a fabric of your choice does not have to cost the earth. - Source: Internet The walls here are in Benjamin Moore HC-155 Newburyport Blue. It’s a gorgeous color that establishes a royal blue theme for the ultimate calming and relaxing space. Don’t forget to choose blue bedsheets too! - Source: Internet 04 of 23 Upbeat Blue Color Palette CARSON DOWNING Navy Blue + Mustard Yellow Choose colors on opposite sides of the color wheel to create energizing, high-contrast color schemes. Blue and yellow make a refreshing combination for bedrooms and living areas. Tone down the brightness by choosing darker shades like navy and mustard yellow. - Source: Internet Emily and Sam kept a curated selection of furniture from their last house, including the pieces in the guest bedroom, along with a co-ordinating Barker \u0026 Stonehouse bed. As with the main bedroom, they’ve gone with a dark shade for the walls and painted them in inky Hague Blue by Farrow \u0026 Ball. See their home makeover. - Source: Internet ‘At first, we painted the guest bedroom white and just left it,’ Ruth says. ‘In September 2018 I had a double lung transplant. By December, I felt much stronger and wanted to celebrate by painting the spare room, so in three days over the Christmas period David and I totally transformed it. I chose a punchy hue – Valspar’s Winter Spruce – to reflect our joy at my new-found life and energy.’ See their home makeover. - Source: Internet The scheme for a bedroom should be something that you find relaxing and cosy, although a quick look through our gallery of ideas suggests that there are plenty of ways to interpret that. Pale paint colours and understated patterns certainly have their moment, but spare rooms are often a great place to run riot with colour and pattern, perhaps in the form of a bedroom wallpaper, since they’re unlikely to be occupied every day. Make sure the bones of the room work for how you use the room. If space and budget allow, some built-in joinery can make all the difference for storage, and give the room a more seamless feel than if it’s stuffed with furniture. - Source: Internet Unlike the rest of the house, the master bedroom has a dark colour scheme, chosen by Faye to add comfort. Teamed with plush furnishings and fancy artwork, the bedroom could easily pass as a hotel suite. See her home makeover. - Source: Internet Niamh chose calm blues and whites with just a touch of dusty pink for a light, uncluttered look in this bedroom. The wall colour is Beade from Colourtrend Paints; the pink throw and cushions came from Arnott’s Department Store; the bed and bedside lamp were from IKEA.
