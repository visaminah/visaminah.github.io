I’ll never need another ruler. The weight and heft are classic Alvin. The markings come in 6 different dimensions, and the faces are all made out of plastic with a bamboo core. This gives the Alvin ruler the heft you’d expect out of aluminium rulers, with the safety features of plastic rulers. A win win situation! - Source: Internet The color coded grooves are easily visible and make your job much simpler. However, the markings are embossed and not etched – and time is not kind to embossed markings. Clearly, there have been some compromises made as per the price. The fact remains, however, that it is a fairly sturdy and inexpensive ruler that gets the job done. - Source: Internet Coming to the point of accuracy, the markings are precisely embossed and will last for a fairly long time. This scales are all machined to a high quality and will give you years of no-nonsense operation. We would like to note that this product is geared squarely for professionals, and students should make sure they can handle the edges before use. - Source: Internet That’s true for a lot of scales out there, though at the same time, they tend to be priced much higher than this one is. This scale is perfect for those who are just starting off with their use of an architectural ruler and/or need something cheap but relatively long lasting. Another plus point is that this ruler comes with both imperial and metric demarcations. - Source: Internet This will influence not only the material, but the kind of lettering to go with the scale too. If you have something more than a passing interest or are transitioning from being a novice to an amateur, we would recommend going in for an aluminium ruler. Plastic rulers are best suited as secondary or spare rulers, or as a first ruler for those just starting out with drawing. - Source: Internet If quality and robustness of use are what you’re looking after, your search is likely to end right here. It offers the right mix of weight, sturdiness and ease of use – it is not heavy enough to intrude into your work, but holds well enough to give you accurate measurements. The scales have been machined precisely and are cogent enough for all operations. - Source: Internet The scales available on this ruler are 3/32, 3/16, ⅛, ¼, ⅜, ½, ¾, 1, 1-½, 3, 16 (which means 16 gradations from 0” to 1”). The lettering, just like the finish, is truly unique – this is distinctive and readable, and the user experience is made just that much better by these small changes. However, do make sure that you take care in using it – it does not have finger protection. - Source: Internet A choice of 11 different scales on three sides makes for a versatile scale, but the major compromise here has been differentiation – it is rather hard to get a hang of the various scales. The dark background means you’ll have to have suitable lighting under any case. However, all things considered, this makes for a long lasting architectural ruler. - Source: Internet This scale is very sturdy for a scale that costs very little, and is likely to last long. The markings are not etched, but instead are printed on – however, the legibility of the ruler is not in any way compromised by the fact of the numbers being printed. The scales themselves will take some time to get used to because they’re not demarcated in any way. - Source: Internet This scale is one of the regular listings on various “top 10” architectural rulers across a number of renowned architectural blogs. This ruler comes with 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 3/8, 3/16, 3/32, 1, 3 and 16 scaled markings across 3 colour-marked sides. The sides of the ruler are coated with plastic which protects you from sharp metallic edges which can cause cuts. - Source: Internet This one has the most impact on which scales you will be considering for purchase. This is for the sole reason that plastic rulers offer the flexibility, lightness, safety and ease of use which aluminium rulers just cannot. On the other hand, aluminium rules the roost when it comes to sturdiness and long term use. Aluminium is also a fair bit more expensive than plastic. - Source: Internet It is no surprise that architecture majors end up working much longer than most other majors. Hence, tools which come in bundles have a distinct edge over singular rulers. This set (three rulers) comes with two architectural rulers with different scales, and one simple aluminium ruler. All of the rulers are 12 inches long as is the standard. - Source: Internet Another major win in the favor of this set is that the finish on the architectural ruler is a far cry from the drab silver which is present on almost every ruler. The laser etched grooves and markings make reading measurements a far less painful experience than it is on other comparable scales. All in all, this scale scores major points for novelty and ease of use. - Source: Internet The gradations are marked clearly in inches, and the edges are tapered for best possible use. The usage of this instrument is not limited to just architectural students and architects, however – these are useful for people across a number of different fields. Be careful about the corners, which sadly have no plastic coverage – a nitpick on an otherwise useful ruler. - Source: Internet VGOOP has brought a rather interesting product to the market lately. This product comes with a number of different features which set it apart from your garden variety architectural ruler. This ruler actually comes in a bundle – a rare turquoise aluminium finished architectural ruler, coupled with a standard aluminium ruler. - Source: Internet Aluminium rulers further offer the choice of getting the lettering either embossed or laser etched onto the ruler. Laser etched rulers tend to be more expensive, but people report theirs having lasted for over three decades. Hence, you should have a clear idea about your intended use before you go out there and buy an architectural ruler. - Source: Internet This one is a blast from the past, figuratively speaking. This scale was the bread and butter requirement of most architects way long back before aluminium and plastic had made their entry into the market. This one, however, still holds its own among the hordes of aluminium and plastic rulers. - Source: Internet This set of rulers has been on the market for while. The ruler is a standard triangular architect’s ruler, with three color coded sides for ease of use. All three sides have different scales, hence the color coding helps with remembering which scale is on which side. There are six scales spread over three sides on this ruler. - Source: Internet You’ll surely appreciate the bending which never occurs on account of the incredibly sturdy construction. The company offers a full refund if the products are not to your satisfaction – the first we’ve heard of in the entire market. The fibre laser etched markings will definitely last much longer than a plastic scale – and won’t bend or break. It’s definitely worth the outlay. - Source: Internet This scale comes in at a much cheaper price, mostly because it’s made from plastic and not metal as a lot of people are usually used to. However, it comes with no compromises in terms of sturdiness or legibility, and the machining has been done incredibly cleanly. The length of the scale is, as is standard, a cool 12 inches. - Source: Internet This scale is one of the best all round scales, and it comes with a certain finish which is not commonly seen in architectural rulers. This matte aluminium finish is truly outstanding and feels much more premium than most aluminium rulers on the market. Further, it is light enough due to its hollow metallic construction – giving the best of both possible scenarios. - Source: Internet This point is slightly more technical. This point squarely depends on how many scales offered are of any realistic use to you – most scales go for the full fledged 11 scale treatment which is neither feasible nor usable for many architectural users. Hence, you should make sure you only go for the scales you actually need, rather than going in for the novelty of all 11 scales. - Source: Internet This ruler does all that you’d expect from an architectural ruler. It has a number of scaled markings which give you the requisite accuracy as well as precision for getting the results you deserve. Then, we come to the measurements, which are legible (albeit embossed rather than etched). The ruler comes with three colored markings, which are red, green and silver. - Source: Internet This ruler comes highly recommended from both students and professionals worldwide – and the major reason is that it does the job incredibly well. The readings are coherent and precise, and accurate to a fault. The machining of the aluminium ruler set makes it much safer and intuitive to use than most other products on offer, making sure kids and students can use it without worry. - Source: Internet Here are some recommendations for locating information about Engineering Scale Chart to get you started:\r- Research Staedtler-Mars Engineer triangular scale, passed down to me from my mother.

This matte aluminium finish is truly outstanding and feels much more premium than most aluminium <strong>ruler</strong>s on the market. Further, it is light enough due to its hollow metallic construction – giving the best of both possible scenarios. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This point is slightly more technical. This point squarely depends on how many <strong>scale</strong>s offered are of any realistic use to you – most <strong>scale</strong>s go for the full fledged 11 <strong>scale</strong> treatment which is neither feasible nor usable for many architectural users. Hence, you should make sure you only go for the <strong>scale</strong>s you actually need, rather than going in for the novelty of all 11 <strong>scale</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>ruler</strong> does all that you’d expect from an architectural <strong>ruler</strong>. It has a number of <strong>scale</strong>d markings which give you the requisite accuracy as well as precision for getting the results you deserve. Then, we come to the measurements, which are legible (albeit embossed rather than etched). The <strong>ruler</strong> comes with three colored markings, which are red, green and silver. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>ruler</strong> comes highly recommended from both students and professionals worldwide – and the major reason is that it does the job incredibly well. The readings are coherent and precise, and accurate to a fault. The machining of the aluminium <strong>ruler</strong> set makes it much safer and intuitive to use than most other products on offer, making sure kids and students can use it without worry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://architecturalrulers.com/assets/5232648.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Engineer Scale Ruler Vs Architect - Architectural Vs Engineering">
