Remember, you are not sanding to remove the old paint or stain. You are simply scuff sanding which means that you are sanding the surface of the cabinets just enough, so they aren’t slick. This helps the new primer and paint adhere well and it’s a step you never want to skip! TO make it go faster, here is my favorite electric sander: Tack life Electric Sander (click here for the current price). - Source: Internet Later, latex or water-based paints began to come on the scene. They had some malleability which led to less cracking but this also make them less durable and not quite as smooth. They had low VOCs and easier clean-up, but the surface wasn’t as buttery smooth as their oil-based counterparts. - Source: Internet Few kitchen before and afters are complete without a new cabinet color. Painting or refacing your cabinets requires the best paint and primer technology—as well as a few days of work and curing time. Stick to gloss, semi-gloss or satin finishes since kitchen cabinets see a lot of use and cleaning. - Source: Internet It’s generally best to complement this kitchen cabinet color with oil-rubbed bronze, satin brass, or antique nickel finish on the lighting fixtures and pull handles. You can even choose matte black but know that it will protrude against the warm white paint. Secondly, feel free to use a lighter greige, warm white, or black countertop against this paint color. - Source: Internet Sherwin Williams Creamy cabinets are warm, and soft, and may dominantly peek a yellow undertone in certain lighting conditions. This warm white cabinet color is creamier and ‘yellower’ than SW Alabaster and SW Greek Villa. However, note that this color isn’t too yellow – but actually feels CREAMY most of the time. - Source: Internet Shellac primers and paints are some of your most durable paint options, making them perfect for highly trafficked kitchens. The downside of its resilience is that it can be difficult to correct or clean up mistakes. Ask your local paint supplier for tips before you DIY with shellac products. - Source: Internet Most builder-grade cabinets are made of MDF boards that are layered underneath a sheet of smooth vinyl, or laminate. These manufactured sheets are too slick to paint on directly. Prep them by sanding with steel wool or fine sandpaper before using a highly adhesive transition primer. - Source: Internet However, the test I learned the most from was the mascara test. I got this idea when I got mascara on the surface of my grandma’s vanity I painted. I assumed I would have to repaint it but to my surprise, it was scrubbed off with a microfiber cloth without any of the paint coming off. - Source: Internet SW Greek Villa is a white kitchen cabinet paint that pairs beautifully with warm wood tones, satin brass, and also clear glass. Choose SW High Reflectance White for the ceiling, trims, and door and window moldings. The countertop could be either creamy white, white, or black – depending on the overall color palette. - Source: Internet “Probably 95% of the kitchens we’re asked to design are white,” says Alabama kitchen designer Cyndy Cantley. “It’s so classic, doesn’t date itself, and always looks pretty.” Cyndy likes to coat the ceiling, cabinets, and walls in Benjamin Moore’s Winter White (2140-70), a fresh, bright shade with a blueish-gray undertone. When making her selection, she makes certain to choose a color that complements the warm or cool veining of the countertops. - Source: Internet What makes it difficult is that it’s not obvious what paints are in which category. If you are looking at an oil-based paint, it usually includes the words “enamel paint” or “alkyd paint”. The hybrid paints will usually have one of these words but also include “water-based” or “water-borne” in the title. - Source: Internet Latex paints have been improving steadily, leading some pros to give up oil-based paints entirely. Because they dry quickly and clean up with water, latex paints are more user-friendly than oil-based paints. But many pros still favor oil-based topcoats, arguing that they form a harder, more durable paint film and level out to a smoother finished surface. Latex paints also take longer (up to three weeks) than oil-based paints to fully cure. In the meantime, they’re susceptible to damage. - Source: Internet I wish I could tell you that all you needed to do is add new hardware and you are good to go. But while some oak cabinets are coming back in style, take note they are stained in cooler wood tones. In other ways, they don’t have that orange honey oak stain that so many outdated oak cabinets have today. And the easiest way to get rid of the orange tint and give your kitchen a whole new look is with paint! If you want to paint your cabinets to look like wood, take a look at this post: How To Apply Paint That Looks Like Stain - Source: Internet What’s your interior design style like? Is it rustic and warm like modern farmhouse or sleek and calm like transitional? Well, this aspect needs to be considered when choosing the best white for kitchen cabinets. Generally, you must finalize the overall vibe you’re aiming to create in the kitchen! Looking for a cooler-toned palette? Well, pick the cool whites. Else, choose from the warm whites for modern, traditional, modern farmhouse, and Scandinavian design styles. - Source: Internet An easy way to update your cabinets is by adding new hardware. I like to drill holes for new hardware before sanding and priming so if I make a mistake, I can easily stop and fill the hole at that point. New hardware can easily update the look of cabinets without a lot of extra work or cost. - Source: Internet Acrylic paint is the best choice when it comes to durability. It also adheres best to wooden materials. So if you’re painting your wooden cabinets, emerald paint is best. As a bonus, It’s also peel-resistant! - Source: Internet – The ability of the paint to smooth out even over surface defects. This is especially important when trying to find the best paint for oak cabinets. Flow – The ability of a paint to level and spread to a smooth film - Source: Internet Satin seems to be the finish du jour for paintwork right now, and this V33 Renovation Smooth Satin paint is proving especially popular among the contenders. Specially designed for use on kitchen cupboards and cabinets, reviewers found it applied beautifully with a foam roller, and provided opaque coverage that made cabinets look just like new after application. They also found a little went a long way, and that post-painting, any splashes or splatters could be easily wiped off without any detriment to the finish, proving this paint’s staying power – it’s one of the best washable paints in our guide. - Source: Internet If you are concerned about durability or have extremely high traffic areas in your home, you might want to consider semi-gloss paints. It’s not much glossier than a satin finish but is also a little more durable. As long as you stick with high-quality paint brands, satin finishes or semi-gloss finishes are the best options and will give you all the durability you need. - Source: Internet So, you’re thinking of an Interior Painting project, maybe just painting the kitchen walls of your home or even a kitchen cabinet refinishing project. There are a few factors to consider before painting your kitchen walls or cabinets. Here are some reasons to have it done professionally before you waste time and money trying to DIY a kitchen painting project. Those can be even more expensive to fix in the end. - Source: Internet These significant decisions must be made before engaging in any cabinet refinishing or interior painting project. Many kitchen cabinet painting experts recommend using oil-based paint because it creates a more complex surface when dries. This will be an advantage due to the kitchen’s busy (and potentially messy) nature. - Source: Internet New paint gives your cabinets a facelift that updates and refreshes your whole kitchen. Choose a paint finish that’s easy to clean and forgiving of surface imperfections. Satin and semigloss both fit the bill. The best one for your cabinets depends on how you use your kitchen as well as the look you want to achieve. - Source: Internet A cool white paint color would be a blunder in a kitchen with ample warm wood on the shelves, lighting fixtures, and exposed beams. So, if you have a warm color palette running around the house, it’s ideal to pick a neutral or warmer color for the kitchen cabinets as well. On the other hand, a cooler-toned palette like coastal would embrace the use of cooler whites on the cabinets. Cohesiveness is the ultimate key to a well-balanced home! So, now that we’ve discussed some important aspects of choosing white paint colors for cabinets, let’s have a look at the best specific examples from the manufacturers, Sherwin Williams and Benjamin Moore. To make it simpler for you, I am going to subcategorize it into three major types! - Source: Internet For anyone who wants to steer clear of a gloss finish, this Dulux Quick Dry Satinwood Paint available in 20 colours, will prove a nice change. Its advanced water-based formula, a far cry from earlier experimentations, goes on in thin, but high-coverage coats, and reviewers loved its smooth, even, slightly lustrous finish with a tough coating that can stand up to the rigours of life in a busy kitchen. On that front, this Dulux cupboards paint’s properly quick-dry formula is a blessing too, meaning you can get on with life as quickly as possible after painting your kitchen cupboards. - Source: Internet Alabaster cabinets are a great fit for north, east, and west-facing kitchens. In the south-facing rooms with yellow artificial light, expect this Sherwin Williams white cabinet paint color to sneak a yellow undertone. But all in all, it doesn’t look yellow but is definitely creamy and smooth. When pairing with hardware, you can consider the metallic tones of oil-rubbed bronze, satin brass, antique copper, and gold. - Source: Internet For these reasons, we recommend you opt for using high-quality brushes instead. Invest in a good, 3- to 4-inch-wide square brush, whose straight ends will make short work of large, flat panels, as well as an angled brush in the 2½- or 3-inch-wide range, which will help you get paint into the corners of doors with molding and can coat door frames in one pass. Latex paint should be applied with a synthetic bristle brush, which doesn’t absorb water; oil-based paint should be applied with a natural-bristle brush. - Source: Internet So often readers ask me what the best oil-based paint for cabinets is and I understand what they are getting at. If you are going to go to all the trouble of painting your cabinets, you want to paint them with a tougher, more-durable oil-based enamel. But what I didn’t know before starting this process is how far alkyd hybrids have come. - Source: Internet As I mentioned above, alkyd hybrids have all the positives of traditional oil paint without the negatives. In other words, they have the durability and hardening capacity but without the higher VOCs (volatile organic compounds), brittleness, and yellowing of the final coat. You can also clean up hybrid paints with soap and warm water. So if you are asking what is the best oil-based (hybrid) paint, then the answer is Benjamin Moore Advance. If you are wanting to know the best traditional oil-based paint, farther down the ‘overall best paint list’ you’ll find Sherwin Williams Emerald Urethane Enamel. - Source: Internet This paint can be used on cabinets, furniture, or even concrete. It is said to be an all-in-one product but I always like to primer cabinets first. This has a chalky finish and ironically is really smooth with both a brush and roller which is why I selected it as the Best Chalk Paint for Cabinets. It’s not quite as scrubbable as its competitors but you could add an optional topcoat. It’s also durable and has low VOCs. - Source: Internet The shinier the finish the easier it will be to clean and the more it will show any texture or imperfections underneath. Paint for kitchen cabinets is unique since it requires special care and technology to bond paint to wood or laminate. If you’re considering repainting your kitchen as an update or as part of a larger kitchen remodel, make sure you know which type of paint to consider. - Source: Internet The light but soft hue of Sherwin-Williams Pure White (SW 7005) is one of our top choices for kitchen ceilings and walls. This paint color has a touch of gray that pairs well with cool colors. Pure White will make your kitchen feel open and expansive while creating a clean backdrop for more saturated colors. - Source: Internet In the north-facing rooms, expect this white cabinet color to feel cool and crisp whereas in the south-facing rooms, this color is quietly likely to feel like a “true” white paint that’s much softer. Furthermore, feel free to use chrome, brass, oil-rubbed bronze, or antique nickel finish to go with this paint color. For the countertop, feel free to use shades of black, brown, or gray to complement! - Source: Internet Oil-based (alkyd) paint is more durable than latex in wet areas like kitchens. However, oil-based paints are being phased out because they emit VOCs (volatile organic compounds). You might recognize VOCs as “new paint smell.” If you opt for oil-based, be sure to ventilate the space and wear a paint respirator for safer application. - Source: Internet Plus, it’s relatively easy to keep clean. If you want a classic look for your kitchen cabinets, white dove is a great option. It’s neutral enough that it will go with almost any color scheme but still has enough personality to make your kitchen stand out. - Source: Internet Lastly, this is one of the most important aspects when picking the best white paint for the kitchen cabinet. Especially if you have the cabinets reaching up to the bottom of the ceiling, the color of the kitchen cabinet has a major say. Let’s say, if you have a warmer and creamy tone of white paint on the ceiling, the ultra and crisp white paint on the cabinet will contradict it and make that “unappealing” appearance. On the other hand, if you have crisp white paint on the ceiling, the white paint with the ‘yellow’ undertone on the cabinet will butt against it! So, in this case, what do you do? - Source: Internet High-gloss, or enamel, finishes are shiny and the most durable type of paint finish. The effect can be luxurious and dramatic. This option is best used on doors, cabinets, trim and shutters. - Source: Internet In my books, this may not be the best white for kitchen cabinets since it’s slightly challenging to pair with complementary stone countertop, backsplash, and hardware. The taupe undertones don’t make the color feel warmer but rather align towards the cooler end of the scale. This white kitchen color cabinet idea is ideal if you have a mix and blend of neutral tones on the flooring and other architectural features. I highly recommend that you pair matte black, nickel, and satin chrome hardware and pull handles to go with this paint color. - Source: Internet The entering natural light in your kitchen is a single MAJOR reason for how the white painted cabinets will appear. Picking the wrong color will immediately make that calm and soft off-white peek unexpected blue, yellow, or green undertones. And you don’t want to face that, right? So, it’s always ideal to analyze the compass direction of your kitchen and choose that white paint color wisely. - Source: Internet Painting your own cabinets is such a budget-friendly way to make a huge upgrade in the room of your house that is most important for resale. I was quoted a cost of over $3,000 to hire painters for my kitchen cabinets, but by doing it myself, I paid just $492. See exactly how much it costs to paint your cabinets vs hiring a pro here: How Much Does It Cost To Paint Kitchen Cabinets - Source: Internet Sherwin Williams Alabaster kitchen cabinets are soft, creamy, and warm – making a popular best white paint for cabinets. It has a perfect tinge of yellow and gray – making it one of the most versatile, sophisticated, and elegant white cabinet color choices. With plenty of natural light in the kitchen, this color is bound to further look airy, soft, warm, and subtle. - Source: Internet Benjamin Moore Advance was not only the best overall cabinet paint but it was also the best paint for coverage. I was really impressed with how well a single coat covered without using much paint. I was stunned that I just used a little over a gallon on all of my cabinets. - Source: Internet Satin finish is the most popular type of interior paint. Satin paint’s velvety sheen makes it better suited to high-traffic kitchens than eggshell or matte finishes. Opt for this middle-of-the-road choice if you have textured walls such as skip trowel or splatter knockdown. This will minimize textures that might date your kitchen and simplify cleanup. - Source: Internet Now it’s time for the primer. If the cabinets are heavily stained, use a stain-blocking primer, which dries quickly and seals knots and other surface defects that might bleed through the topcoats. In most situations, however, stain-blockers shouldn’t be necessary, and an oil-based or 100 percent acrylic latex primer will work just fine. - Source: Internet I was impressed with not only how smooth this paint settled out but also on how well it covered. Dixie Silk is Dixie Belle’s newest formula of mineral paint that has a topcoat combined. I love the color options and it is NO-VOC so you can feel completely at ease painting around children and pets. It also has a fast dry time and great “scrubbability.” Dixie Belle Silk doesn’t only give your cabinets a beautiful finish but is also fun to paint with. - Source: Internet The last thing you would need is to waste money destroying your cabinets and walls. On top of that, painting tools and equipment can be costly. The Picky Painters in Berea, neighboring Strongsville, Ohio, use top-of-the-line washable wall paint with a matte sheen. Its washable matte sheen is the best for both cleanability and durability. - Source: Internet But don’t worry! This piece of blog is dedicated to my TOP picks of WHITE paint colors for kitchen cabinets from Benjamin Moore and Sherwin Williams. When diving further down the line, whites can be subcategorized into warm whites, neutral whites, and cool whites. Depending upon your interior design style, the existing architectural elements, the finish of hardware, and the compass direction – the best white paint for kitchen cabinets can be chosen. So, before I reveal those majestic white paint colors, first let’s have a look at the bigger picture! - Source: Internet Another rustic style is the distressed look, which doesn’t require a special paint. This finish is made up of layered colors and spattered dark paint. When the paint is dry, to reveal the colors underneath, distress the finish by hitting it with a chain and lightly sanding in the spots where the cabinets get the most use. - Source: Internet White painted kitchen cabinets can be versatile, classy, elegant, and extremely sophisticated. It’s always like, “whenever in doubt” – pick the best shade of white paint for kitchen cabinets. However, the task of picking the best white paint color for cabinets may not be that easy! Well, yes! White paint colors can be quite overwhelming since there’s a wide array of hidden undertones and shades to work with. - Source: Internet If white gloss appeals for an instant facelift and a clean and tidy look, this Ronseal One Coat Cupboard gloss looks to be the best kitchen cupboard paint around. As the name suggests, it’s specifically engineered for use on melamine and MDF cupboards, as well as drawers, furniture and doors, making it a handy one to keep in the garage, but the best bit is its practicality. Not needing a primer, this cupboard paint gives a full-coverage, smooth and glossy finish in just one coat, and once on, it’s said not to scuff or scratch. In our opinion, this is the best kitchen cupboard paint if you’re after something white gloss, quick to apply which has a smooth finish. - Source: Internet I prefer semi-gloss paint for kitchen cabinets. I think it shows slightly less fingerprints and mess compared to glossy paint. However, both are totally fine options and glossy looks great in ultra-modern spaces! If you don’t have kids or pets or cook much (or have a maid) – super glossy is great! - Source: Internet Want the best kitchen cupboard paint for a rustic, chalky finish? The unique look of chalk-based paint is more popular than ever, and while it may come as a surprise that our top pick comes from small supplier easichalk, Shabby Chic Chalk Based Furniture Paint has got the rave reviews to take on the big brands. Its vintage-look, almost velvety ultra-matte finish left reviewers impressed, and they found that despite initial reservations about the size of the tin, a little went a very long way. Plus, for anyone looking to hop on the black-on-black kitchen trend, reviewers recommend the shade Liquorice as the perfect black for the best paint for kitchen cupboards. - Source: Internet To test coverage, I painted a black line down the length of two sides of the line after painting on a couple of coats of primer. Then, I painted each sample of paint in 10-inch bands on the board. After the second coat of paint, the brands that no longer showed the black line had the best coverage. The one where the black line was most prominent had the worst coverage. - Source: Internet Tip: To speed up the drying time for doors, you can twist two screw hooks into holes drilled in an inconspicuous door edge (the lower edge for bottom cabinets, the upper edge for top cabinets). Paint the door’s outside face and let it dry for an hour while resting flat, then tilt the door up onto its hooks and put a drywall screw into an existing hardware hole. Hold the tilted door up by the screw and paint the door’s back side. - Source: Internet You’re finally ready to paint! If you’re using roughly the same shade as the existing color, two coats ought to do the job. You might even get away with one. Painting over a dark finish with a light color is tougher and could require three coats. Break out a new brush for each coat. - Source: Internet For painting cabinets, you can either brush, roll or spray. You can also do a combination of two. If you opt for spraying, you can paint the cabinet doors in your garage and roll the cabinet bases. That way you don’t have to take all the extra time to tape off your cabinet boxes. - Source: Internet To help you pick the best colors for cabinets we asked our painting experts here at Improovy for the latest and greatest hues. From classic white cabinets, painting kitchen islands, to darker colors, our trend-worthy list covers it all. Likewise, we’ll showcase before and after pictures of cabinet painting projects to inspire your next kitchen makeover. - Source: Internet Once you’ve narrowed down the finish of your paint, check the material and condition of your wood to see if it’s laminate or not. Sand down the cabinets of dust and residue to bring ease to your application process for a flawless finish. You can also add a great primer before you begin! - Source: Internet Farrow \u0026 Ball Estate Eggshell Paint Best kitchen cabinet paint for wide colour range and heritage shades Specifications Best for: Wide range of colours Capacity: 750ml, 0.75ltrs, 2.5ltrs Base type: Water Colours: 100+ Today’s Best Deals View at B \u0026 Q (opens in new tab) View at Designerpaint (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Low-VOC and -odour formula Reasons to avoid - Pricey - Source: Internet We were on a tight budget and didn’t want to spend a lot so what did we do? We went to Lowe’s and bought the cheapest paint we could find…Olympic Paint in Pure White. (I didn’t test this paint because it is no longer being sold.) - Source: Internet Sherwin Williams Pure White is one of the best white paints for kitchen cabinets. Personally, I have recommended this neutral white color a couple of times for the ceiling, moldings, built-in shelves, as well as cabinets. And trust me, this Sherwin Williams white color has never disappointed me! It has a perfect tinge of gray and warmth to it – hence, being able to easily pair with warmer as well as cooler-toned palettes. - Source: Internet Glossy finishes are often the best for kitchen applications. However, if you’re not a fan of shinier walls, then satin or matte sheen would be best. A matte sheen is also ideal for painting over walls with surface imperfections. The best sheen is a personal preference. However, if you want something easy to clean with a nice finish, go with satin or a high-quality matte. - Source: Internet Professional painters are efficient and fast with high-quality results. Most Interior Painting projects we complete take 1-5 days depending on how many rooms you are having us complete for you. We are a full-service Interior House Painting company that cleans up when we leave. - Source: Internet Our go-to white paint for cabinets and trim is White Dove (OC-17) by Benjamin Moore. This classic, slightly creamy paint will make your all-white kitchen gleam—not blind. For cabinets, it’s best to avoid ultra-pure shades of white, as they tend to lend a chilly feel to a kitchen. This shade will make your cabinets and trim look luminous in any light (including natural, diffused, or bright overhead), and though it technically resides in the “off-white” family, White Dove will read as a bright, cheerful, and clean shade of white in any space. - Source: Internet Sherwin Williams Snowbound is a great white paint for cabinets since it offers the best of both worlds. Yes, I am talking about the subtle taupe undertones that don’t emerge to be too warm and rather make the color work the best with cooler tones. Even with ample natural light pouring in, expect this Sherwin Williams white paint to feel calm, cool, and slightly soft and crisp. - Source: Internet The most popular finish for kitchen cabinets is a glossy white lacquer. Many people prefer this finish because it is easy to clean and withstand daily use. Additionally, lacquered cabinets can brighten up a kitchen due to its sheen and make it look more spacious. - Source: Internet Sherwin Williams Morning Fog is a great medium gray with subtle blue undertones without being a blue-gray. It is very upbeat and pairs nicely with a navy or blue-gray island. It’s a great color for gray kitchen cabinets when you want the space to still feel light and airy. - Source: Internet Personally, we prefer to use the Behr Scuff Defense line of paint. I have 2 toddlers and 2 pets and I have 0 scuffing or scratches on my eggshell walls. I wipe them with a magic eraser without issue. - Source: Internet Pour some trim and cabinet enamel paint into the paint tray and load the brush and roller with paint. Use the brush to cut in along the edges, push the paint into the corners, and leave out roller strokes.

A white kitchen feels as light and airy as a spring breeze and provides a perfect canvas for decorating in vivid splashes of color. But with thousands of white paint options on the market, how do you go about choosing the best white paint for your space?

With trim paint, you will be painting fewer flat surfaces which means more painting with a brush than a roller.

Based on my testing, Benjamin Moore Advance is the best paint for cabinets and trim. - Source: Internet With Sherwin-Williams’ Creamy (7012), the name says it all. This dreamy hue is an excellent choice for balancing out cooler colors in a kitchen. “My favorite colors are blue-green tones and the shades of old wicker and worn rugs—mostly hues you’d see outdoors here,” says Florida homeowner Nikki Colquitt. Her designers at Maison Studios painted the kitchen cabinets in a gray-green (Sherwin-Williams’ Austere Gray, SW 6184) and then painted the shiplap paneled walls and ceiling in Creamy to keep the room light. - Source: Internet This has been my go-to paint for years and it has never let me down. I got the idea for the waterproof mascara scrubbability test from using this paint on my grandmother’s vanity.

Also, since it’s a traditional latex it is fast drying and easy to use. - Source: Internet A paint’s sheen, or finish, describes how glossy or reflective the paint is when it’s dry. Common finishes include flat or matte, eggshell, satin, semi-gloss and high-gloss. Glossier finishes are better for busy rooms like kitchens and bathrooms because they are resistant to moisture and easier to clean. - Source: Internet Before you head out to the paint store, however, examine your cabinets to see if they can be resuscitated in the first place. Even the highest-quality paint job can’t revive cheap cabinets that have grown frail with age. Thin veneers peel or delaminate, particleboard cabinet bottoms or shelves sag or break, and hanging rails come loose. If these are the issues you’re dealing with, you’d actually be better off replacing your kitchen cabinets. - Source: Internet My favorite brushes for cabinets are Zibra brushes. They not only give you a flawless finish but the brushes just glide over the surface of whatever you are painting. They are a little more expensive but I’ve never lost a bristle with these and they are fun to use: Zibra Brushes for Cabinets - Source: Internet But the main reason high gloss finishes aren’t used on cabinets is because of style.

If you go this route, make sure to take the proper preparation steps—including a light sanding and a deep cleaning—and spring for a high-quality paint formulated specifically for floors. Our favorite is All White (No. 2005) by Farrow \u0026 Ball. It’s pricey, but worth it for its ability to hold up for years in high-traffic areas. - Source: Internet Painting your own cabinets is worthwhile but it is still a lot of work. Don’t leave the finished product up to chance by using just any old paint. Cabinet paints are not created equal and as you’ll see from my testing, the most expensive paints are not necessarily the best! - Source: Internet Your most important prep work when painting cabinets is choosing the right paint. Finding an option that is not only a durable paint but goes on smoothly and covers well is vital to the success of your cabinet painting project. Fortunately, I’ve done all the research and testing for you to find the absolute best paint for kitchen cabinets! - Source: Internet Sherwin Williams Extra White is a bright, crisp, and cool white paint for kitchen cabinets. This is one of the best white colors for cabinets if you’re aiming to achieve a cooler color palette in your home. However, you must be slightly careful when pairing this cool white cabinet color since it has the potential to appear slightly blue and gray in the north-facing rooms. On the other hand, in the south-facing rooms, this paint can counteract with the yellow light to appear slightly softer. - Source: Internet If you’re the average homeowner who’s just trying to get a project done as cheap as possible, you will likely make more of a mess than necessary. Different types of glosses, paints and sheens are designed for different surfaces and applications. A professional painter will know exactly what kind to use. - Source: Internet Matte paint is offered by some paint brands. It is a flat finish that gets a slight protective film as it dries. This makes it more cleanable than flat paint. - Source: Internet If you’ve noticed the cost of new appliances, countertops, and cabinets, it’s no surprise that renovating a kitchen is one of the most expensive remodeling projects. While few homeowners find ways to boost the look of a dated refrigerator or tired granite, transforming a kitchen by freshening the cabinets that make up most of the room’s visual space is entirely within reach. But there’s more to the job than buying a gallon of your favorite color. - Source: Internet However, arguably the most important bit of the best paint for kitchen cabinets is the formula. Finish can have almost as big an effect on your overall kitchen aesthetic as colour, and eggshell and gloss have long been prized in tricky spaces like kitchens for their smooth sheen and wipe-clean finish, however even some of our satin picks are tougher than they look. Our top tip? A mid to soft sheen will look more contemporary than anything glossy, and will give your kitchen an instant update. - Source: Internet Then, hybrids came on the market often called “acrylic-alkyd formulas”. These hybrids are special cabinet paints that have easy clean-up, low VOC and fast-drying times of latex paints BUT also have the durability and smooth finish of oil-based paints. The fact that they have the same or better durability is so important for cabinets that are subject to daily use and are subject to a lot of wear. - Source: Internet Designer and founder of her namesake paint brand Annie Sloan believes it is important to choose a paint that is designed to coat and protect interior woods and metals. “Satin Paint is the perfect choice for the hardest working areas of busy, lived-in homes, from kitchen cabinets to staircases, handrails, skirting boards, doors, architraves, and windowsills,” Sloane explains. Her newest launch of self-leveling satin paint can be used without waxing beforehand or a lacquer. It is a one-step process, leaving a smooth, silky finish you won’t have to wait long to see. - Source: Internet On the other end of the spectrum is a high-gloss finish, which will transform your kitchen into a polished, modern space. To shine up your cabinets, paint a high-gloss clear acrylic varnish over your final coat. This technique will add depth to the color and cover the surface of your kitchen with a glassy sheen. - Source: Internet The hardware finish has a major role to play when picking the perfect white for kitchen cabinets. Generally, if gold, brass, or oil-rubbed bronze fixtures are what you prefer, it’s ideal to choose a neutral or warmer-toned white paint color for your kitchen cabinets. Moreover, if you also have one of these finishes running across the lighting fixtures and artwork frames – remember to play around with neutral or warm white paint colors. - Source: Internet Here I’ll be sharing my favorite white paint colors. I’ll also be sharing what makes them great. Hopefully you’ll be inspired! - Source: Internet If you’re open to spicing up your kitchen’s look, incorporating a faux finish can transform its style into shabby chic, rustic, provincial, or modern. Crackling glaze, which is available at paint stores, can, with very little effort, give your cabinets a weathered look. Just apply the glaze over a dry base coat, brushing in only one direction (thick for large cracks, thin for fine cracks), and let it dry. Finish with a flat topcoat of the base color brushed on perpendicular to the glaze. The paint will start to form cracks as it dries, a process that takes about an hour. - Source: Internet This interior paint not only brushed on well but also rolled beautifully to a satiny smooth finish which is so important when painting wood cabinets. Benjamin Moore Advance cures to an extremely hard and durable finish. I found that I could easily scrub off dried waterproof mascara without taking off any of the painted surface. It is rare to find so many positive attributes in one paint product making it your best bet for your kitchen cabinet painting project. - Source: Internet If you’re looking to make your trim pop, Farrow \u0026 Ball Pointing (No. 2003) will do the job with style. The color was inspired by the bright white pointing in masonry, but with a slightly warm undertone. Pointing is our top choice for highlighting ornate trim and results in the cleanest, crispest look. The glossier the paint, the more visible every line (and imperfection) will be. - Source: Internet Painting cabinets yourself is always cheaper than buying new cabinets or cabinet doors.

To test for a smooth surface, I painted one side of the board I mentioned above with a brush and the other side with a roller for every paint sample. I’m glad I tested both because some paints that did great with brush strokes did not go on very smoothly with a roller! - Source: Internet INSLX Cabinet Coat is a urethane-acrylic formula meaning it falls into the hybrid category. This paint gives cabinets a hard, durable finish with great coverage. It also adheres well to wood surfaces and levels into large open wood grains really well. While it doesn’t leave many brush strokes, it left more roller marks than some of its competitors. - Source: Internet Some of the brands of cabinet paints such as Behr Marquee can also be used on walls. Not all wall paints perform well as cabinet paint though and that’s one of the reasons I performed the above tests. Good cabinet paints are extremely durable, non-yellowing, and settle out well for a smooth surface. - Source: Internet Little Rock designer P. Allen Smith selected another cool white, Benjamin Moore’s Snow White (OC-66), for cabinets, walls, and trim throughout his kitchen and cottage. The blue-hued white is as bright as a wintery day, providing an excellent contrast for dark floors. This color will look cheeriest in a south-facing kitchen with plenty of sunshine and warmest when accented with wood finishes. - Source: Internet Benjamin Moore Swiss Coffee kitchen cabinets are very similar to those of White Dove. Except the former paint color has slightly yellow and green undertones! When paired with the wrong countertop and yellow artificial natural lighting, this white paint color has the tendency to appear slightly flat and dull. However, in a room with ample incoming natural light, this may be a great white paint for the kitchen cabinets. - Source: Internet Before choosing an amazing color to blend in with your aesthetic, it’s important to narrow down on the finish of your paint. Opt for a satin, gloss, or semi-gloss, as their performance qualities are super reliable in the kitchen. Rick Watson, Sherwin-Williams’s director of product information explains, “For high-traffic spaces like the kitchen, use a finish with a higher gloss. It’s durable and easy to clean, which is important for surfaces that are prone to messes like kitchen cabinets.” - Source: Internet When choosing a color for your kitchen, remember the style you want to achieve. What color will make you feel motivated and comfortable to be productive? Finding inspiration and using samples before making a final decision is best. Remember that it should blend or flow with the rest of your house. Having a bright-colored kitchen with a home painted in neutrals or earth colors won’t match very well either. - Source: Internet Cabinets for a 10-by 12-foot kitchen can easily top $5,000—and your new cabinets may actually be of lower quality than the ones you’re replacing. On the other hand, a few fresh coats of paint can go a long way toward transforming your existing cabinets for a fraction of that price. In fact, the cost of painting should be no more than about $200, plus a weekend or two of your time. - Source: Internet For DIYers, I personally recommend brushing or rolling your cabinets. There is definitely a learning curve with a paint sprayer and while it can be easy to use at first, it can be hard to troubleshoot problems unless you have some experience. Not only does it take time to learn to use a paint sprayer, prepping the space to spray the cabinet boxes can be daunting. If you are going to use a paint sprayer, I recommend just spraying the cabinet doors and drawer fronts and rolling the boxes. Here is an easy-to-use spray for spray painting cabinet doors: HomeRight Max Paint Sprayer - Source: Internet When paired with SW High Reflectance White or BM Decorator’s White – you can observe the ultimate notable undertone in this cool white cabinet paint color. I highly recommend that you pair it with cool blues, greens, and grays on the lower kitchen cabinet. On the countertop and backsplash, you have the opportunity to style with cooler whites and grays. Try to avoid beige with this Benjamin Moore white cabinet paint color! - Source: Internet Sherwin Williams High Reflective White is the whitest white paint color with almost no undertones. It’s bright, refreshing, and extremely crisp – hence, can beautifully pair with warmer as well as cooler-toned palettes. If you compare SW High Reflective White with SW Pure White, you’d observe how much brighter this popular white paint color for kitchen cabinets is. This color has a very clean look, so ensure that there’s considerable natural light entering the kitchen else, it may feel too crisp! With little or no light, this color may feel quite cool and crisp, which may not align with the existing warner woods or traditional elements. - Source: Internet Somewhere between the shabby chic finish of upcycler’s favourite chalk paint, and the traditional finish of white gloss, there’s this not-quite-matt Johnstone’s One Coat Quick Dry Satin Paint. Reviewers were impressed with its performance, saying that it covers evenly in just one coat, is touch-dry in two hours, and feels like silk. As luck would have it, it looks a little like silk too, with what DIYers said was a beautiful sheen and a great finish. Longer term users commended the wash-clean, non-smudging finish, too. If you’re after a satin finish, this is the best kitchen cabinet paint that you can buy. - Source: Internet Benjamin Moore’s Swiss Coffee (OC-45) is our top pick for warm white walls. Swiss Coffee makes the perfect backdrop for all-white cabinets and trim in an eggshell finish for medium-to-large spaces or a satin finish in a super-small kitchen. A favorite among designers for its versatility and depth, Swiss Coffee is a creamy, sophisticated white—it will complement and enhance other shades of white in the room without appearing cold or stark, especially in kitchens that get a lot of natural light. Tip: Extend this color to coat your ceilings, as well, for a uniform look and a warm, friendly glow in the evenings. - Source: Internet For this post, I tested paints from Sherwin Williams, Benjamin Moore, the big box stores, and also specialty paints like chalk paint. While there are some great professional catalyzed coatings out there, I’m not reviewing those because the scope of this post is what the average DIYer can get their hands on and ease of use at a low cost. Also, for each of the paints evaluated, you can use a paint roller and brush or a paint sprayer. - Source: Internet All of the above information about paints for kitchen cupboards also applies to bathroom cabinets. Since bathroom cabinets experience more moisture and condensation on a regular basis, I would always use a satin or even a semi-gloss sheen to better protect them. However, all of the cabinet paints I tested did really well when it came to holding up to moisture. - Source: Internet Although several prefer a foam roller, my favorite roller for painting cabinets is this 3/8″ microfiber roller from Home Depot. It gives you an incredibly smooth finish without roller marks and is very forgiving when painting over defects in the painted surface. I absolutely love this roller and used it on my own cabinets and on every furniture project. You can see the current price here: Home Depot Best Roller - Source: Internet Benjamin Moore Decorator’s White is a clean and bright cool white paint color with a slightly gray undertone. It feels fresh, rejuvenating, and extremely smooth when used on the kitchen cabinets. In the north-facing rooms, this color can exhibit a deep cool gray undertone that can be slightly difficult to pair with other complementary hues, countertop materials, fabrics, and textures. In the south-facing rooms, this color may feel like a “true white” paint which is rather soft and subtle. - Source: Internet Designer Suzanne Kasler updated what was an overly dark Atlanta kitchen with the creamy white cabinets and walls pictured here. For a seamless look, she chose to paint the walls, trim, cabinetry, and ceiling all with Benjamin Moore’s Linen White (OC-146) in the same eggshell finish. To keep the monochromatic space from becoming too stark, she added contrasting metal pendant lights, bright fabrics, and a dark stain on the refinished wood floors. - Source: Internet It has yellow and green undertones making it a warm white. This is one of my absolute favorite white paint colors. We actually used this color to paint the exterior of our home. - Source: Internet If you are a DIYer, you are in the right place! People have strong opinions when it comes to cabinet paint. For this post, my goal was to find the best paint for the average DIY homeowner. Some professional painters might have access to specialty brands of paint that you have to spray on or buy in bulk. But my goal with this post was to find the paint that makes the most sense for the average Joe (or Jolean). There are several amazing cabinet paints but if they are cost-prohibitive or they have to be sprayed on our bought in bulk, that’s not the right paint for DIYers. - Source: Internet Behr’s Interior Satin Cabinet and Trim Enamel is an unbelievable paint for the price. It has incredible coverage, and durability and dries fast. It wasn’t quite as “scrubbable” as numbers 1 and 2 but I don’t want that to minimize how well it performed in all categories at such a low price point of $0.36 an ounce! That’s why I chose Behr’s Satin Cabinet and Trim enamel as the Best Budget Option! - Source: Internet Benjamin Moore Chantilly Lace is one of the brightest white paint colors for the kitchen cabinets. It’s refreshing, and cool, and can feel extra bright and crisp in a kitchen with tons and tons of natural light. This best white for cabinets feels true to the hue, but in the north-facing rooms, it may slightly outcast a blue undertone. However, that’s not very dominant though! On the other hand, in the south-facing rooms, this true white cabinet color will feel crisp and extra bright. - Source: Internet From sticky fingers to spills and incidents with kitchen appliances—the ability to remove tough stains and spills is key when choosing kitchen paint. Flat or matte paints won’t hold up to the wear and tear that cabinets take in your day-to-day kitchen activities. “You’ll want paints that are designed for cabinets. They provide excellent flow and leveling characteristics for a smooth and durable finish. They should be washable, as well as stain and scratch-resistant,” Watson shares. - Source: Internet This is one of the best white paints for kitchen cabinets, especially north-facing ones. The incoming cool gray and blue light neutralizes the warmth of the off-white on the cabinets to create a sense of harmony and balance indoors. In the south-facing rooms, the warm white cabinet color may come out a little yellow! So, don’t forget to try a sample in various directions to know the true hue. - Source: Internet Behr Marque has been my go-to paint for trim as its coverage is great and it will not show brush strokes. Although it does show some roller marks, they are minimal. You can also find Behr Marque at any Home Depot store and it comes in unlimited color options. - Source: Internet Also, you’ll notice Annie Sloan chalk paint is listed. Most people wouldn’t consider chalk paint to be cabinet paint but because so many are using it on cabinets, I decided to include it. Also, all of the specialty paints had tutorials on their homepages with instructions on how to use their products to paint cabinets. Also, the chalk paint was waxed for the water and scrub tests. - Source: Internet The shinier or glossier a paint is the more durable it is. However, glossier finishes show defects and surface imperfections more easily. For that reason, it’s unconventional to use glossy finishes for cabinets. - Source: Internet When it comes to a smooth finish, I’m such a stickler! Unfortunately, one of the downsides to painting honey oak kitchen cabinets is that they have a very open grain. In other words, you can see lots of small indentions on the entire wood surface. To specifically test which paint finishes would settle into the wood grain to make smooth surfaces, I painted a sample of each on the back of one of my own cabinet doors. - Source: Internet As you can see in the video, this paint also levels out well on open wood grains and has outstanding coverage even on dark cabinets. It’s available in almost an unlimited number of colors and is Low VOC.

In terms of hardware, feel free to choose from nickel, matte black, satin brass, polished chrome, and oil-rubbed bronze. - Source: Internet No matter your kitchen layout, you don’t have to paint the walls, ceiling and cabinets white to have a bright and beautiful cooking space.

For use on interior wood, melamine, MDF cupboards and furniture, a little goes a long way, and because of its thick consistency you’ll only need one coat for good coverage.

Remember, you are not sanding to remove the old <strong>paint</strong> or stain. You are simply scuff sanding which means that you are sanding the surface of the <strong>cabinets</strong> just enough, so they aren’t slick. This helps the new primer and <strong>paint</strong> adhere well and it’s a step you never want to skip! TO make it go faster, here is my favorite electric sander: Tack life Electric Sander (click here for the current price). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Later, latex or water-based <strong>paint</strong>s began to come on the scene. They had some malleability which led to less cracking but this also make them less durable and not quite as smooth. They had low VOCs and easier clean-up, but the surface wasn’t as buttery smooth as their oil-based counterparts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Few kitchen before and afters are complete without a new cabinet color. Painting or refacing your <strong>cabinets</strong> requires the best <strong>paint</strong> and primer technology—as well as a few days of work and curing time. Stick to gloss, semi-gloss or satin finishes since kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> see a lot of use and cleaning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s generally best to complement this kitchen cabinet color with oil-rubbed bronze, satin brass, or antique nickel finish on the lighting fixtures and pull handles. You can even choose matte black but know that it will protrude against the warm white <strong>paint</strong>. Secondly, feel free to use a lighter greige, warm white, or black countertop against this <strong>paint</strong> color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sherwin Williams Creamy <strong>cabinets</strong> are warm, and soft, and may dominantly peek a yellow undertone in certain lighting conditions. This warm white cabinet color is creamier and ‘yellower’ than SW Alabaster and SW Greek Villa. However, note that this color isn’t too yellow – but actually feels CREAMY most of the time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Shellac primers and <strong>paint</strong>s are some of your most durable <strong>paint</strong> options, making them perfect for highly trafficked kitchens. The downside of its resilience is that it can be difficult to correct or clean up mistakes. Ask your local <strong>paint</strong> supplier for tips before you DIY with shellac products. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most builder-grade <strong>cabinets</strong> are made of MDF boards that are layered underneath a sheet of smooth vinyl, or laminate. These manufactured sheets are too slick to <strong>paint</strong> on directly. Prep them by sanding with steel wool or fine sandpaper before using a highly adhesive transition primer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, the test I learned the most from was the mascara test. I got this idea when I got mascara on the surface of my grandma’s vanity I <strong>paint</strong>ed. I assumed I would have to re<strong>paint</strong> it but to my surprise, it was scrubbed off with a microfiber cloth without any of the <strong>paint</strong> coming off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>SW Greek Villa is a white kitchen cabinet <strong>paint</strong> that pairs beautifully with warm wood tones, satin brass, and also clear glass. Choose SW High Reflectance White for the ceiling, trims, and door and window moldings. The countertop could be either creamy white, white, or black – depending on the overall color palette. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&ldquo;Probably 95% of the kitchens we&rsquo;re asked to design are white,&rdquo; says Alabama kitchen designer Cyndy Cantley. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so classic, doesn&rsquo;t date itself, and always looks pretty.&rdquo; Cyndy likes to coat the ceiling, <strong>cabinets</strong>, and walls in Benjamin Moore&rsquo;s Winter White (2140-70), a fresh, bright shade with a blueish-gray undertone. When making her selection, she makes certain to choose a color that complements the warm or cool veining of the countertops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What makes it difficult is that it’s not obvious what <strong>paint</strong>s are in which category. If you are looking at an oil-based <strong>paint</strong>, it usually includes the words “enamel <strong>paint</strong>” or “alkyd <strong>paint</strong>”. The hybrid <strong>paint</strong>s will usually have one of these words but also include “water-based” or “water-borne” in the title. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Latex <strong>paint</strong>s have been improving steadily, leading some pros to give up oil-based <strong>paint</strong>s entirely. Because they dry quickly and clean up with water, latex <strong>paint</strong>s are more user-friendly than oil-based <strong>paint</strong>s. But many pros still favor oil-based topcoats, arguing that they form a harder, more durable <strong>paint</strong> film and level out to a smoother finished surface. Latex <strong>paint</strong>s also take longer (up to three weeks) than oil-based <strong>paint</strong>s to fully cure. In the meantime, they’re susceptible to damage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I wish I could tell you that all you needed to do is add new hardware and you are good to go. But while some oak <strong>cabinets</strong> are coming back in style, take note they are stained in cooler wood tones. In other ways, they don’t have that orange honey oak stain that so many outdated oak <strong>cabinets</strong> have today. And the easiest way to get rid of the orange tint and give your kitchen a whole new look is with <strong>paint</strong>! If you want to <strong>paint</strong> your <strong>cabinets</strong> to look like wood, take a look at this post: How To Apply Paint That Looks Like Stain - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What’s your interior design style like? Is it rustic and warm like modern farmhouse or sleek and calm like transitional? Well, this aspect needs to be considered when choosing the best white for kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. Generally, you must finalize the overall vibe you’re aiming to create in the kitchen! Looking for a cooler-toned palette? Well, pick the cool whites. Else, choose from the warm whites for modern, traditional, modern farmhouse, and Scandinavian design styles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>An easy way to update your <strong>cabinets</strong> is by adding new hardware. I like to drill holes for new hardware before sanding and priming so if I make a mistake, I can easily stop and fill the hole at that point. New hardware can easily update the look of <strong>cabinets</strong> without a lot of extra work or cost. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Acrylic <strong>paint</strong> is the best choice when it comes to durability. It also adheres best to wooden materials. So if you’re <strong>paint</strong>ing your wooden <strong>cabinets</strong>, emerald <strong>paint</strong> is best. As a bonus, It’s also peel-resistant! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>– The ability of the <strong>paint</strong> to smooth out even over surface defects. This is especially important when trying to find the best <strong>paint</strong> for oak <strong>cabinets</strong>. Flow – The ability of a <strong>paint</strong> to level and spread to a smooth film - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Satin seems to be the finish du jour for <strong>paint</strong>work right now, and this V33 Renovation Smooth Satin <strong>paint</strong> is proving especially popular among the contenders. Specially designed for use on kitchen cupboards and <strong>cabinets</strong>, reviewers found it applied beautifully with a foam roller, and provided opaque coverage that made <strong>cabinets</strong> look just like new after application. They also found a little went a long way, and that post-<strong>paint</strong>ing, any splashes or splatters could be easily wiped off without any detriment to the finish, proving this <strong>paint</strong>’s staying power – it&rsquo;s one of the best washable <strong>paint</strong>s in our guide. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are concerned about durability or have extremely high traffic areas in your home, you might want to consider semi-gloss <strong>paint</strong>s. It’s not much glossier than a satin finish but is also a little more durable. As long as you stick with high-quality <strong>paint</strong> brands, satin finishes or semi-gloss finishes are the best options and will give you all the durability you need. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So, you’re thinking of an Interior Painting project, maybe just <strong>paint</strong>ing the kitchen walls of your home or even a kitchen cabinet refinishing project. There are a few factors to consider before <strong>paint</strong>ing your kitchen walls or <strong>cabinets</strong>. Here are some reasons to have it done professionally before you waste time and money trying to DIY a kitchen <strong>paint</strong>ing project. Those can be even more expensive to fix in the end. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>These significant decisions must be made before engaging in any cabinet refinishing or interior <strong>paint</strong>ing project. Many kitchen cabinet <strong>paint</strong>ing experts recommend using oil-based <strong>paint</strong> because it creates a more complex surface when dries. This will be an advantage due to the kitchen’s busy (and potentially messy) nature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>New <strong>paint</strong> gives your <strong>cabinets</strong> a facelift that updates and refreshes your whole kitchen. Choose a <strong>paint</strong> finish that&rsquo;s easy to clean and forgiving of surface imperfections. Satin and semigloss both fit the bill. The best one for your <strong>cabinets</strong> depends on how you use your kitchen as well as the look you want to achieve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A cool white <strong>paint</strong> color would be a blunder in a kitchen with ample warm wood on the shelves, lighting fixtures, and exposed beams. So, if you have a warm color palette running around the house, it’s ideal to pick a neutral or warmer color for the kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> as well. On the other hand, a cooler-toned palette like coastal would embrace the use of cooler whites on the <strong>cabinets</strong>. Cohesiveness is the ultimate key to a well-balanced home! So, now that we’ve discussed some important aspects of choosing white <strong>paint</strong> colors for <strong>cabinets</strong>, let’s have a look at the best specific examples from the manufacturers, Sherwin Williams and Benjamin Moore. To make it simpler for you, I am going to subcategorize it into three major types! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For anyone who wants to steer clear of a gloss finish, this Dulux Quick Dry Satinwood Paint available in 20 colours, will prove a nice change. Its advanced water-based formula, a far cry from earlier experimentations, goes on in thin, but high-coverage coats, and reviewers loved its smooth, even, slightly lustrous finish with a tough coating that can stand up to the rigours of life in a busy kitchen. On that front, this Dulux cupboards <strong>paint</strong>&rsquo;s properly quick-dry formula is a blessing too, meaning you can get on with life as quickly as possible after <strong>paint</strong>ing your kitchen cupboards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Alabaster <strong>cabinets</strong> are a great fit for north, east, and west-facing kitchens. In the south-facing rooms with yellow artificial light, expect this Sherwin Williams white cabinet <strong>paint</strong> color to sneak a yellow undertone. But all in all, it doesn’t look yellow but is definitely creamy and smooth. When pairing with hardware, you can consider the metallic tones of oil-rubbed bronze, satin brass, antique copper, and gold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For these reasons, we recommend you opt for using high-quality brushes instead. Invest in a good, 3- to 4-inch-wide square brush, whose straight ends will make short work of large, flat panels, as well as an angled brush in the 2½- or 3-inch-wide range, which will help you get <strong>paint</strong> into the corners of doors with molding and can coat door frames in one pass. Latex <strong>paint</strong> should be applied with a synthetic bristle brush, which doesn’t absorb water; oil-based <strong>paint</strong> should be applied with a natural-bristle brush. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So often readers ask me what the best oil-based <strong>paint</strong> for <strong>cabinets</strong> is and I understand what they are getting at. If you are going to go to all the trouble of <strong>paint</strong>ing your <strong>cabinets</strong>, you want to <strong>paint</strong> them with a tougher, more-durable oil-based enamel. But what I didn’t know before starting this process is how far alkyd hybrids have come. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As I mentioned above, alkyd hybrids have all the positives of traditional oil <strong>paint</strong> without the negatives. In other words, they have the durability and hardening capacity but without the higher VOCs (volatile organic compounds), brittleness, and yellowing of the final coat. You can also clean up hybrid <strong>paint</strong>s with soap and warm water. So if you are asking what is the best oil-based (hybrid) <strong>paint</strong>, then the answer is Benjamin Moore Advance. If you are wanting to know the best traditional oil-based <strong>paint</strong>, farther down the ‘overall best <strong>paint</strong> list’ you’ll find Sherwin Williams Emerald Urethane Enamel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>paint</strong> can be used on <strong>cabinets</strong>, furniture, or even concrete. It is said to be an all-in-one product but I always like to primer <strong>cabinets</strong> first. This has a chalky finish and ironically is really smooth with both a brush and roller which is why I selected it as the Best Chalk Paint for Cabinets. It’s not quite as scrubbable as its competitors but you could add an optional topcoat. It’s also durable and has low VOCs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The shinier the finish the easier it will be to clean and the more it will show any texture or imperfections underneath. Paint for kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> is unique since it requires special care and technology to bond <strong>paint</strong> to wood or laminate. If you’re considering re<strong>paint</strong>ing your kitchen as an update or as part of a larger kitchen remodel, make sure you know which type of <strong>paint</strong> to consider. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The light but soft hue of Sherwin-Williams Pure White (SW 7005) is one of our top choices for kitchen ceilings and walls. This <strong>paint</strong> color has a touch of gray that pairs well with cool colors. Pure White will make your kitchen feel open and expansive while creating a clean backdrop for more saturated colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In the north-facing rooms, expect this white cabinet color to feel cool and crisp whereas in the south-facing rooms, this color is quietly likely to feel like a “true” white <strong>paint</strong> that’s much softer. Furthermore, feel free to use chrome, brass, oil-rubbed bronze, or antique nickel finish to go with this <strong>paint</strong> color. For the countertop, feel free to use shades of black, brown, or gray to complement! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Oil-based (alkyd) <strong>paint</strong> is more durable than latex in wet areas like kitchens. However, oil-based <strong>paint</strong>s are being phased out because they emit VOCs (volatile organic compounds). You might recognize VOCs as “new <strong>paint</strong> smell.” If you opt for oil-based, be sure to ventilate the space and wear a <strong>paint</strong> respirator for safer application. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Plus, it’s relatively easy to keep clean. If you want a classic look for your kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>, white dove is a great option. It’s neutral enough that it will go with almost any color scheme but still has enough personality to make your kitchen stand out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Lastly, this is one of the most important aspects when picking the best white <strong>paint</strong> for the kitchen cabinet. Especially if you have the <strong>cabinets</strong> reaching up to the bottom of the ceiling, the color of the kitchen cabinet has a major say. Let’s say, if you have a warmer and creamy tone of white <strong>paint</strong> on the ceiling, the ultra and crisp white <strong>paint</strong> on the cabinet will contradict it and make that “unappealing” appearance. On the other hand, if you have crisp white <strong>paint</strong> on the ceiling, the white <strong>paint</strong> with the ‘yellow’ undertone on the cabinet will butt against it! So, in this case, what do you do? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>High-gloss, or enamel, finishes are shiny and the most durable type of <strong>paint</strong> finish. The effect can be luxurious and dramatic. This option is best used on doors, <strong>cabinets</strong>, trim and shutters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In my books, this may not be the best white for kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> since it’s slightly challenging to pair with complementary stone countertop, backsplash, and hardware. The taupe undertones don’t make the color feel warmer but rather align towards the cooler end of the scale. This white kitchen color cabinet idea is ideal if you have a mix and blend of neutral tones on the flooring and other architectural features. I highly recommend that you pair matte black, nickel, and satin chrome hardware and pull handles to go with this <strong>paint</strong> color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The entering natural light in your kitchen is a single MAJOR reason for how the white <strong>paint</strong>ed <strong>cabinets</strong> will appear. Picking the wrong color will immediately make that calm and soft off-white peek unexpected blue, yellow, or green undertones. And you don’t want to face that, right? So, it’s always ideal to analyze the compass direction of your kitchen and choose that white <strong>paint</strong> color wisely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Painting your own <strong>cabinets</strong> is such a budget-friendly way to make a huge upgrade in the room of your house that is most important for resale. I was quoted a cost of over $3,000 to hire <strong>paint</strong>ers for my kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>, but by doing it myself, I paid just $492. See exactly how much it costs to <strong>paint</strong> your <strong>cabinets</strong> vs hiring a pro here: How Much Does It Cost To Paint Kitchen Cabinets - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sherwin Williams Alabaster kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> are soft, creamy, and warm – making a popular best white <strong>paint</strong> for <strong>cabinets</strong>. It has a perfect tinge of yellow and gray – making it one of the most versatile, sophisticated, and elegant white cabinet color choices. With plenty of natural light in the kitchen, this color is bound to further look airy, soft, warm, and subtle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Benjamin Moore Advance was not only the best overall cabinet <strong>paint</strong> but it was also the best <strong>paint</strong> for coverage. I was really impressed with how well a single coat covered without using much <strong>paint</strong>. I was stunned that I just used a little over a gallon on all of my <strong>cabinets</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Satin finish is the most popular type of interior <strong>paint</strong>. Satin <strong>paint</strong>’s velvety sheen makes it better suited to high-traffic kitchens than eggshell or matte finishes. Opt for this middle-of-the-road choice if you have textured walls such as skip trowel or splatter knockdown. This will minimize textures that might date your kitchen and simplify cleanup. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now it’s time for the primer. If the <strong>cabinets</strong> are heavily stained, use a stain-blocking primer, which dries quickly and seals knots and other surface defects that might bleed through the topcoats. In most situations, however, stain-blockers shouldn’t be necessary, and an oil-based or 100 percent acrylic latex primer will work just fine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I was impressed with not only how smooth this <strong>paint</strong> settled out but also on how well it covered. Dixie Silk is Dixie Belle’s newest formula of mineral <strong>paint</strong> that has a topcoat combined. I love the color options and it is NO-VOC so you can feel completely at ease <strong>paint</strong>ing around children and pets. It also has a fast dry time and great “scrubbability.” Dixie Belle Silk doesn’t only give your <strong>cabinets</strong> a beautiful finish but is also fun to <strong>paint</strong> with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The last thing you would need is to waste money destroying your <strong>cabinets</strong> and walls. On top of that, <strong>paint</strong>ing tools and equipment can be costly. The Picky Painters in Berea, neighboring Strongsville, Ohio, use top-of-the-line washable wall <strong>paint</strong> with a matte sheen. Its washable matte sheen is the best for both cleanability and durability. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But don’t worry! This piece of blog is dedicated to my TOP picks of WHITE <strong>paint</strong> colors for kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> from Benjamin Moore and Sherwin Williams. When diving further down the line, whites can be subcategorized into warm whites, neutral whites, and cool whites. Depending upon your interior design style, the existing architectural elements, the finish of hardware, and the compass direction – the best white <strong>paint</strong> for kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> can be chosen. So, before I reveal those majestic white <strong>paint</strong> colors, first let’s have a look at the bigger picture! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another rustic style is the distressed look, which doesn’t require a special <strong>paint</strong>. This finish is made up of layered colors and spattered dark <strong>paint</strong>. When the <strong>paint</strong> is dry, to reveal the colors underneath, distress the finish by hitting it with a chain and lightly sanding in the spots where the <strong>cabinets</strong> get the most use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>White <strong>paint</strong>ed kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> can be versatile, classy, elegant, and extremely sophisticated. It’s always like, “whenever in doubt” – pick the best shade of white <strong>paint</strong> for kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. However, the task of picking the best white <strong>paint</strong> color for <strong>cabinets</strong> may not be that easy! Well, yes! White <strong>paint</strong> colors can be quite overwhelming since there’s a wide array of hidden undertones and shades to work with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If white gloss appeals for an instant facelift and a clean and tidy look, this Ronseal One Coat Cupboard gloss looks to be the best kitchen cupboard <strong>paint</strong> around. As the name suggests, it’s specifically engineered for use on melamine and MDF cupboards, as well as drawers, furniture and doors, making it a handy one to keep in the garage, but the best bit is its practicality. Not needing a primer, this cupboard <strong>paint</strong> gives a full-coverage, smooth and glossy finish in just one coat, and once on, it’s said not to scuff or scratch. In our opinion, this is the best kitchen cupboard <strong>paint</strong> if you&rsquo;re after something white gloss, quick to apply which has a smooth finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I prefer semi-gloss <strong>paint</strong> for kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. I think it shows slightly less fingerprints and mess compared to glossy <strong>paint</strong>. However, both are totally fine options and glossy looks great in ultra-modern spaces! If you don’t have kids or pets or cook much (or have a maid) – super glossy is great! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Want the best kitchen cupboard <strong>paint</strong> for a rustic, chalky finish? The unique look of chalk-based <strong>paint</strong> is more popular than ever, and while it may come as a surprise that our top pick comes from small supplier easichalk, Shabby Chic Chalk Based Furniture Paint has got the rave reviews to take on the big brands. Its vintage-look, almost velvety ultra-matte finish left reviewers impressed, and they found that despite initial reservations about the size of the tin, a little went a very long way. Plus, for anyone looking to hop on the black-on-black kitchen trend, reviewers recommend the shade Liquorice as the perfect black for the best <strong>paint</strong> for kitchen cupboards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To test coverage, I <strong>paint</strong>ed a black line down the length of two sides of the line after <strong>paint</strong>ing on a couple of coats of primer. Then, I <strong>paint</strong>ed each sample of <strong>paint</strong> in 10-inch bands on the board. After the second coat of <strong>paint</strong>, the brands that no longer showed the black line had the best coverage. The one where the black line was most prominent had the worst coverage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Tip: To speed up the drying time for doors, you can twist two screw hooks into holes drilled in an inconspicuous door edge (the lower edge for bottom <strong>cabinets</strong>, the upper edge for top <strong>cabinets</strong>). Paint the door&rsquo;s outside face and let it dry for an hour while resting flat, then tilt the door up onto its hooks and put a drywall screw into an existing hardware hole. Hold the tilted door up by the screw and <strong>paint</strong> the door&rsquo;s back side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You’re finally ready to <strong>paint</strong>! If you’re using roughly the same shade as the existing color, two coats ought to do the job. You might even get away with one. Painting over a dark finish with a light color is tougher and could require three coats.

This classic, slightly creamy <strong>paint</strong> will make your all-white kitchen gleam—not blind. For <strong>cabinets</strong>, it&rsquo;s best to avoid ultra-pure shades of white, as they tend to lend a chilly feel to a kitchen.

This dreamy hue is an excellent choice for balancing out cooler colors in a kitchen. &ldquo;My favorite colors are blue-green tones and the shades of old wicker and worn rugs—mostly hues you&rsquo;d see outdoors here,&rdquo; says Florida homeowner Nikki Colquitt.

I got the idea for the waterproof mascara scrubbability test from using this <strong>paint</strong> on my grandmother’s vanity.

Also, since it’s a traditional latex it is fast drying and easy to use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A <strong>paint</strong>’s sheen, or finish, describes how glossy or reflective the <strong>paint</strong> is when it’s dry. Common finishes include flat or matte, eggshell, satin, semi-gloss and high-gloss. Glossier finishes are better for busy rooms like kitchens and bathrooms because they are resistant to moisture and easier to clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before you head out to the <strong>paint</strong> store, however, examine your <strong>cabinets</strong> to see if they can be resuscitated in the first place.

Thin veneers peel or delaminate, particleboard cabinet bottoms or shelves sag or break, and hanging rails come loose.

They are a little more expensive but I’ve never lost a bristle with these and they are fun to use: Zibra Brushes for Cabinets - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But the main reason high gloss finishes aren’t used on <strong>cabinets</strong> is because of style. The look of matte and eggshell <strong>paint</strong> finishes are much more sought-after as farmhouse decor has risen in popularity. But while matte and eggshell finishes aren’t very durable a great compromise and the most popular choice for <strong>cabinets</strong> is a satin <strong>paint</strong> finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A lot of people prefer latex <strong>paint</strong> when <strong>paint</strong>ing.

This is one of the best white colors for <strong>cabinets</strong> if you’re aiming to achieve a cooler color palette in your home.

On the other hand, in the south-facing rooms, this <strong>paint</strong> can counteract with the yellow light to appear slightly softer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re the average homeowner who’s just trying to get a project done as cheap as possible, you will likely make more of a mess than necessary.

A professional <strong>paint</strong>er will know exactly what kind to use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Matte <strong>paint</strong> is offered by some <strong>paint</strong> brands. It is a flat finish that gets a slight protective film as it dries. This makes it more cleanable than flat <strong>paint</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’ve noticed the cost of new appliances, countertops, and <strong>cabinets</strong>, it’s no surprise that renovating a kitchen is one of the most expensive remodeling projects. While few homeowners find ways to boost the look of a dated refrigerator or tired granite, transforming a kitchen by freshening the <strong>cabinets</strong> that make up most of the room’s visual space is entirely within reach. But there’s more to the job than buying a gallon of your favorite color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, arguably the most important bit of the best <strong>paint</strong> for kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> is the formula. Finish can have almost as big an effect on your overall kitchen aesthetic as colour, and eggshell and gloss have long been prized in tricky spaces like kitchens for their smooth sheen and wipe-clean finish, however even some of our satin picks are tougher than they look. Our top tip? A mid to soft sheen will look more contemporary than anything glossy, and will give your kitchen an instant update. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Then, hybrids came on the market often called “acrylic-alkyd formulas”. These hybrids are special cabinet <strong>paint</strong>s that have easy clean-up, low VOC and fast-drying times of latex <strong>paint</strong>s BUT also have the durability and smooth finish of oil-based <strong>paint</strong>s. The fact that they have the same or better durability is so important for <strong>cabinets</strong> that are subject to daily use and are subject to a lot of wear. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Designer and founder of her namesake <strong>paint</strong> brand Annie Sloan believes it is important to choose a <strong>paint</strong> that is designed to coat and protect interior woods and metals. &ldquo;Satin Paint is the perfect choice for the hardest working areas of busy, lived-in homes, from kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> to staircases, handrails, skirting boards, doors, architraves, and windowsills,” Sloane explains. Her newest launch of self-leveling satin <strong>paint</strong> can be used without waxing beforehand or a lacquer. It is a one-step process, leaving a smooth, silky finish you won&rsquo;t have to wait long to see. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>On the other end of the spectrum is a high-gloss finish, which will transform your kitchen into a polished, modern space. To shine up your <strong>cabinets</strong>, <strong>paint</strong> a high-gloss clear acrylic varnish over your final coat. This technique will add depth to the color and cover the surface of your kitchen with a glassy sheen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The hardware finish has a major role to play when picking the perfect white for kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. Generally, if gold, brass, or oil-rubbed bronze fixtures are what you prefer, it’s ideal to choose a neutral or warmer-toned white <strong>paint</strong> color for your kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. Moreover, if you also have one of these finishes running across the lighting fixtures and artwork frames – remember to play around with neutral or warm white <strong>paint</strong> colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Here I’ll be sharing my favorite white <strong>paint</strong> colors. I’ll also be sharing what makes them great. Hopefully you’ll be inspired! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re open to spicing up your kitchen’s look, incorporating a faux finish can transform its style into shabby chic, rustic, provincial, or modern. Crackling glaze, which is available at <strong>paint</strong> stores, can, with very little effort, give your <strong>cabinets</strong> a weathered look. Just apply the glaze over a dry base coat, brushing in only one direction (thick for large cracks, thin for fine cracks), and let it dry. Finish with a flat topcoat of the base color brushed on perpendicular to the glaze. The <strong>paint</strong> will start to form cracks as it dries, a process that takes about an hour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This interior <strong>paint</strong> not only brushed on well but also rolled beautifully to a satiny smooth finish which is so important when <strong>paint</strong>ing wood <strong>cabinets</strong>. Benjamin Moore Advance cures to an extremely hard and durable finish. I found that I could easily scrub off dried waterproof mascara without taking off any of the <strong>paint</strong>ed surface. It is rare to find so many positive attributes in one <strong>paint</strong> product making it your best bet for your kitchen cabinet <strong>paint</strong>ing project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;re looking to make your trim pop, Farrow & Ball Pointing (No. 2003) will do the job with style. The color was inspired by the bright white pointing in masonry, but with a slightly warm undertone. Pointing is our top choice for highlighting ornate trim and results in the cleanest, crispest look. The glossier the <strong>paint</strong>, the more visible every line (and imperfection) will be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Painting <strong>cabinets</strong> yourself is always cheaper than buying new <strong>cabinets</strong> or cabinet doors.

To test for a smooth surface, I <strong>paint</strong>ed one side of the board I mentioned above with a brush and the other side with a roller for every <strong>paint</strong> sample. I’m glad I tested both because some <strong>paint</strong>s that did great with brush strokes did not go on very smoothly with a roller! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>INSLX Cabinet Coat is a urethane-acrylic formula meaning it falls into the hybrid category. This <strong>paint</strong> gives <strong>cabinets</strong> a hard, durable finish with great coverage. It also adheres well to wood surfaces and levels into large open wood grains really well. While it doesn’t leave many brush strokes, it left more roller marks than some of its competitors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some of the brands of cabinet <strong>paint</strong>s such as Behr Marquee can also be used on walls. Not all wall <strong>paint</strong>s perform well as cabinet <strong>paint</strong> though and that’s one of the reasons I performed the above tests. Good cabinet <strong>paint</strong>s are extremely durable, non-yellowing, and settle out well for a smooth surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Little Rock designer P. Allen Smith selected another cool white, Benjamin Moore&rsquo;s Snow White (OC-66), for <strong>cabinets</strong>, walls, and trim throughout his kitchen and cottage. The blue-hued white is as bright as a wintery day, providing an excellent contrast for dark floors. This color will look cheeriest in a south-facing kitchen with plenty of sunshine and warmest when accented with wood finishes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Benjamin Moore Swiss Coffee kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> are very similar to those of White Dove. Except the former <strong>paint</strong> color has slightly yellow and green undertones! When paired with the wrong countertop and yellow artificial natural lighting, this white <strong>paint</strong> color has the tendency to appear slightly flat and dull. However, in a room with ample incoming natural light, this may be a great white <strong>paint</strong> for the kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before choosing an amazing color to blend in with your aesthetic, it&rsquo;s important to narrow down on the finish of your <strong>paint</strong>. Opt for a satin, gloss, or semi-gloss, as their performance qualities are super reliable in the kitchen. Rick Watson, Sherwin-Williams&rsquo;s director of product information explains, &ldquo;For high-traffic spaces like the kitchen, use a finish with a higher gloss. It’s durable and easy to clean, which is important for surfaces that are prone to messes like kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When choosing a color for your kitchen, remember the style you want to achieve. What color will make you feel motivated and comfortable to be productive? Finding inspiration and using samples before making a final decision is best. Remember that it should blend or flow with the rest of your house. Having a bright-colored kitchen with a home <strong>paint</strong>ed in neutrals or earth colors won’t match very well either. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cabinets for a 10-by 12-foot kitchen can easily top $5,000—and your new <strong>cabinets</strong> may actually be of lower quality than the ones you&rsquo;re replacing. On the other hand, a few fresh coats of <strong>paint</strong> can go a long way toward transforming your existing <strong>cabinets</strong> for a fraction of that price. In fact, the cost of <strong>paint</strong>ing should be no more than about $200, plus a weekend or two of your time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For DIYers, I personally recommend brushing or rolling your <strong>cabinets</strong>. There is definitely a learning curve with a <strong>paint</strong> sprayer and while it can be easy to use at first, it can be hard to troubleshoot problems unless you have some experience. Not only does it take time to learn to use a <strong>paint</strong> sprayer, prepping the space to spray the cabinet boxes can be daunting. If you are going to use a <strong>paint</strong> sprayer, I recommend just spraying the cabinet doors and drawer fronts and rolling the boxes. Here is an easy-to-use spray for spray <strong>paint</strong>ing cabinet doors: HomeRight Max Paint Sprayer - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When paired with SW High Reflectance White or BM Decorator’s White – you can observe the ultimate notable undertone in this cool white cabinet <strong>paint</strong> color. I highly recommend that you pair it with cool blues, greens, and grays on the lower kitchen cabinet. On the countertop and backsplash, you have the opportunity to style with cooler whites and grays. Try to avoid beige with this Benjamin Moore white cabinet <strong>paint</strong> color! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sherwin Williams High Reflective White is the whitest white <strong>paint</strong> color with almost no undertones. It’s bright, refreshing, and extremely crisp – hence, can beautifully pair with warmer as well as cooler-toned palettes. If you compare SW High Reflective White with SW Pure White, you’d observe how much brighter this popular white <strong>paint</strong> color for kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> is. This color has a very clean look, so ensure that there’s considerable natural light entering the kitchen else, it may feel too crisp! With little or no light, this color may feel quite cool and crisp, which may not align with the existing warner woods or traditional elements. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Somewhere between the shabby chic finish of upcycler’s favourite chalk <strong>paint</strong>, and the traditional finish of white gloss, there’s this not-quite-matt Johnstone&rsquo;s One Coat Quick Dry Satin Paint. Reviewers were impressed with its performance, saying that it covers evenly in just one coat, is touch-dry in two hours, and feels like silk. As luck would have it, it looks a little like silk too, with what DIYers said was a beautiful sheen and a great finish. Longer term users commended the wash-clean, non-smudging finish, too. If you&rsquo;re after a satin finish, this is the best kitchen cabinet <strong>paint</strong> that you can buy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Benjamin Moore&rsquo;s Swiss Coffee (OC-45) is our top pick for warm white walls. Swiss Coffee makes the perfect backdrop for all-white <strong>cabinets</strong> and trim in an eggshell finish for medium-to-large spaces or a satin finish in a super-small kitchen. A favorite among designers for its versatility and depth, Swiss Coffee is a creamy, sophisticated white—it will complement and enhance other shades of white in the room without appearing cold or stark, especially in kitchens that get a lot of natural light. Tip: Extend this color to coat your ceilings, as well, for a uniform look and a warm, friendly glow in the evenings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For this post, I tested <strong>paint</strong>s from Sherwin Williams, Benjamin Moore, the big box stores, and also specialty <strong>paint</strong>s like chalk <strong>paint</strong>. While there are some great professional catalyzed coatings out there, I’m not reviewing those because the scope of this post is what the average DIYer can get their hands on and ease of use at a low cost. Also, for each of the <strong>paint</strong>s evaluated, you can use a <strong>paint</strong> roller and brush or a <strong>paint</strong> sprayer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>All of the above information about <strong>paint</strong>s for kitchen cupboards also applies to bathroom <strong>cabinets</strong>. Since bathroom <strong>cabinets</strong> experience more moisture and condensation on a regular basis, I would always use a satin or even a semi-gloss sheen to better protect them. However, all of the cabinet <strong>paint</strong>s I tested did really well when it came to holding up to moisture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although several prefer a foam roller, my favorite roller for <strong>paint</strong>ing <strong>cabinets</strong> is this 3/8″ microfiber roller from Home Depot. It gives you an incredibly smooth finish without roller marks and is very forgiving when <strong>paint</strong>ing over defects in the <strong>paint</strong>ed surface. I absolutely love this roller and used it on my own <strong>cabinets</strong> and on every furniture project. You can see the current price here: Home Depot Best Roller - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Benjamin Moore Decorator’s White is a clean and bright cool white <strong>paint</strong> color with a slightly gray undertone. It feels fresh, rejuvenating, and extremely smooth when used on the kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. In the north-facing rooms, this color can exhibit a deep cool gray undertone that can be slightly difficult to pair with other complementary hues, countertop materials, fabrics, and textures. In the south-facing rooms, this color may feel like a “true white” <strong>paint</strong> which is rather soft and subtle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Designer Suzanne Kasler updated what was an overly dark Atlanta kitchen with the creamy white <strong>cabinets</strong> and walls pictured here. For a seamless look, she chose to <strong>paint</strong> the walls, trim, cabinetry, and ceiling all with Benjamin Moore&rsquo;s Linen White (OC-146) in the same eggshell finish. To keep the monochromatic space from becoming too stark, she added contrasting metal pendant lights, bright fabrics, and a dark stain on the refinished wood floors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It has yellow and green undertones making it a warm white. This is one of my absolute favorite white <strong>paint</strong> colors. We actually used this color to <strong>paint</strong> the exterior of our home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are a DIYer, you are in the right place! People have strong opinions when it comes to cabinet <strong>paint</strong>. For this post, my goal was to find the best <strong>paint</strong> for the average DIY homeowner. Some professional <strong>paint</strong>ers might have access to specialty brands of <strong>paint</strong> that you have to spray on or buy in bulk. But my goal with this post was to find the <strong>paint</strong> that makes the most sense for the average Joe (or Jolean). There are several amazing cabinet <strong>paint</strong>s but if they are cost-prohibitive or they have to be sprayed on our bought in bulk, that’s not the right <strong>paint</strong> for DIYers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Behr’s Interior Satin Cabinet and Trim Enamel is an unbelievable <strong>paint</strong> for the price. It has incredible coverage, and durability and dries fast. It wasn’t quite as “scrubbable” as numbers 1 and 2 but I don’t want that to minimize how well it performed in all categories at such a low price point of $0.36 an ounce! That’s why I chose Behr’s Satin Cabinet and Trim enamel as the Best Budget Option! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Benjamin Moore Chantilly Lace is one of the brightest white <strong>paint</strong> colors for the kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>. It’s refreshing, and cool, and can feel extra bright and crisp in a kitchen with tons and tons of natural light. This best white for <strong>cabinets</strong> feels true to the hue, but in the north-facing rooms, it may slightly outcast a blue undertone. However, that’s not very dominant though! On the other hand, in the south-facing rooms, this true white cabinet color will feel crisp and extra bright. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>From sticky fingers to spills and incidents with kitchen appliances—the ability to remove tough stains and spills is key when choosing kitchen <strong>paint</strong>. Flat or matte <strong>paint</strong>s won&rsquo;t hold up to the wear and tear that <strong>cabinets</strong> take in your day-to-day kitchen activities. “You’ll want <strong>paint</strong>s that are designed for <strong>cabinets</strong>. They provide excellent flow and leveling characteristics for a smooth and durable finish. They should be washable, as well as stain and scratch-resistant,&rdquo; Watson shares. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is one of the best white <strong>paint</strong>s for kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong>, especially north-facing ones. The incoming cool gray and blue light neutralizes the warmth of the off-white on the <strong>cabinets</strong> to create a sense of harmony and balance indoors. In the south-facing rooms, the warm white cabinet color may come out a little yellow! So, don’t forget to try a sample in various directions to know the true hue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Behr Marque has been my go-to <strong>paint</strong> for trim as its coverage is great and it will not show brush strokes. Although it does show some roller marks, they are minimal. You can also find Behr Marque at any Home Depot store and it comes in unlimited color options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Also, you’ll notice Annie Sloan chalk <strong>paint</strong> is listed. Most people wouldn’t consider chalk <strong>paint</strong> to be cabinet <strong>paint</strong> but because so many are using it on <strong>cabinets</strong>, I decided to include it. Also, all of the specialty <strong>paint</strong>s had tutorials on their homepages with instructions on how to use their products to <strong>paint</strong> <strong>cabinets</strong>. Also, the chalk <strong>paint</strong> was waxed for the water and scrub tests. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The shinier or glossier a <strong>paint</strong> is the more durable it is. However, glossier finishes show defects and surface imperfections more easily. For that reason, it’s unconventional to use glossy finishes for <strong>cabinets</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to a smooth finish, I’m such a stickler! Unfortunately, one of the downsides to <strong>paint</strong>ing honey oak kitchen <strong>cabinets</strong> is that they have a very open grain. In other words, you can see lots of small indentions on the entire wood surface. To specifically test which <strong>paint</strong> finishes would settle into the wood grain to make smooth surfaces, I <strong>paint</strong>ed a sample of each on the back of one of my own cabinet doors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As you can see in the video, this <strong>paint</strong> also levels out well on open wood grains and has outstanding coverage even on dark <strong>cabinets</strong>. It’s available in almost an unlimited number of colors and is Low VOC. You also don’t have to worry about shipping prices because you can find Advance at a Benjamin Moore <strong>paint</strong> store near you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So, if you’re looking for bright white <strong>paint</strong> with just a tinge of coolness, BM Chantilly Lace is definitely something to have an eye on! It can pair beautifully with wooden textures and darker colors on the lower <strong>cabinets</strong>. Also, in the smaller kitchens, you can use this color to make the space feel further larger and airier. For the hardware, feel free to style it with polished chrome, matte black, nickel, or antique brass. For the countertop, choose classic whites, grays, or blue grays! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&ldquo;Be sure you choose a color you’ll love,&rdquo; advises Gibbons. &ldquo;Painting your <strong>cabinets</strong> requires so much time and effort, you don’t want to have to repeat the process! Don’t be afraid to go bolder with color on your <strong>cabinets</strong>. I love the moody green of Current Mood for a kitchen.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>SW Pure White is classic, versatile, and can work for one and all kinds of palettes. It’s definitely one of my favorites since it’s clean and crisp enough to appear like a cool white but with a touch of warmth – this color can pair with warmer colors as well. You must pair this white kitchen cabinet <strong>paint</strong> with taupe, beige, tan, blue, gray, and green on the lower <strong>cabinets</strong>. In terms of hardware, feel free to choose from nickel, matte black, satin brass, polished chrome, and oil-rubbed bronze. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>No matter your kitchen layout, you don’t have to <strong>paint</strong> the walls, ceiling and <strong>cabinets</strong> white to have a bright and beautiful cooking space. Instead, balance lighter colors with a neutral green, blue or gray. For instance, with off-white marble countertops, go for a soft sage wall color and gray cabinetry or add contrast with a deep blue cabinet color and neutral walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Transform your kitchen cupboards with help from Wilko&rsquo;s furniture and cupboard <strong>paint</strong>. For use on interior wood, melamine, MDF cupboards and furniture, a little goes a long way, and because of its thick consistency you&rsquo;ll only need one coat for good coverage. Reviewers rave about the quality and the smooth satin finish, as well as the fact it&rsquo;s hard wearing. Use a gloss roller (opens in new tab) to get the best results, and be sure to open all windows as it does have a strong smell to it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Painting your <strong>cabinets</strong> yourself is so worthwhile and it’s a cost-effective way to increase the ROI of your home. There are few projects that have such a significant impact on one room and the kitchen is one of the most important rooms of your home. While <strong>paint</strong>ing <strong>cabinets</strong> is a lot of work, picking the right <strong>paint</strong> makes all the difference in the results. After several rounds of testing, you can be confident this post on the best <strong>paint</strong> for <strong>cabinets</strong> will give you all the information you need to ensure that your cabinet project turns out better than you could have imagined.

It’s WARM but definitely not YELLOW – so, you always get the benefit of the warmth, welcomeness, and softness of the <strong>paint</strong> color. Also, this white <strong>paint</strong> for the kitchen cabinet can be used in the smaller spaces as well! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=http://images.traditionalhome.mdpcdn.com/sites/traditionalhome.com/files/slide/101658226_p_1.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Best Finish For Kitchen Cabinets Paint - Sherwin Williams Dark Kitchen Cabinets"><p>Here are a few tips to help you find information about best paint finish for kitchen cabinets sherwin williams:</p><ul><li>Look for good places to get information about Sherwin-Williams Kitchen Cabinet Paint Colors 2022.
