You can put some grass there or add a chaise lounge to get a tan during hot summer days. ðŸ˜‰ - Source: Internet Made of two shipping containers and other materials, this house covers 1,517 sq. ft. of Nederland, Colorado. The main living space is inside the containers where you will find two bedrooms, a kitchen and a bathroom, an office, and a laundry room. - Source: Internet Remember that itâ€™s not just a container, but itâ€™s a home dwelling thatâ€™s supposed to abide by local building code regulations.

The design seems a bit closed-off, but you can open it up a bit by adding larger windows. - Source: Internet This is a big house of 2,200 sq. ft. located in Lille, France.
