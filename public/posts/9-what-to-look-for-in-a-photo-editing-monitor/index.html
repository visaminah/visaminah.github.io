Popular sizes include 19, 21.5, 24, 27, and 32\" screens, with ultra-wide models also available. Larger, 40\"+ monitors are an option if you have the room to accommodate their suitable viewing distances. If you plan on doing any work on set, a 19\" monitor offers a good compromise between screen size and portability with plenty of travel cases to choose from. - Source: Internet HDR technology ups the color intensity and contrast of your images to a brilliant degree. Monitor brightness levels, expressed in cd/m2 (candelas per meter squared or nits), play a key role in HDR display; look for 1000 cd/m2 or higher for optimal HDR editing. HDR10 is the more common HDR standard with Dolby Vision or HDR10+ available in some monitors, look for the standard supported by your editing system. - Source: Internet Although it may seem that monitor features are being continually updated, we hope the above tips form a basis for choosing your video editing monitor.

OLED monitors offer wide viewing angles, high contrast ratios and brightness levels, and true blacks; they tend to be higher-priced than same-size LCDs. - Source: Internet LUT (lookup table) support enables you to view your log recordings without their characteristic flat look; select monitors can display side-by-side views of HDR and SDR (standard dynamic range) for comparison. Popular LUTs are come pre-loaded in some monitors and/or can be loaded in via an USB port or SD card slot. Standard display tools on many monitors include a vectorscope, histogram, exposure zebra, and frame markers. - Source: Internet Most production monitors support a variety of input resolutions; it’s when you’re using formats on the higher or lower ends of the spectrum or less common frame rates that it’s important to confirm compatibility. Resolutions like DCI 4K (4096 x 2160), standard-def NTSC or PAL for legacy projects, and frame rates like 1080PsF 23.98/24 fall into this category. - Source: Internet If you’re editing in 4K and you can swing the cost of a 4K or higher monitor, go for the higher resolution. On the other hand, if your existing editing system is 1080p-compatible and you’re not ready to upgrade to the greater processing and storage requirements of 4K, you can edit your 4K footage using proxies while viewing on a 1080p monitor. Lower-res footage can be displayed on a higher-res monitor (although it will be in a smaller, “windowed” form) so if you want to upgrade your monitor to 4K first, you can. Of course, if you’re color-grading in any significant way, you’ll be better off opting for the 4K+ resolution. - Source: Internet Last, but absolutely not least, create a routine for calibrating your monitor. This aligns it to an established standard and is essential for maintaining a consistent look in your project. Some monitors come with calibration software or can be adjusted by loading a calibration LUT.

Monitor input ports include HDMI, 12G/6G/3G-SDI (BNC), Thunderbolt™, DisplayPort, USB and optical variations; make sure your display is compatible with your system’s video output. A loop-out port is a handy feature for feeding your signal to a larger monitor for director or client viewing during post-production. Select monitors offer audio I/O options that enable you to split out embedded audio to external speakers. - Source: Internet Here are a few tips to help you find information about Acer Monitor For Photo Editing:\nLook for good places to get information about Best Monitor For Photo Editing.
