However, be careful to add the white paint in small amounts each time. When you are blending colors, always start with the lighter color and then add the darker color in small amounts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As we’ve seen so far, <strong>blue</strong> almost always looks good with various shades of brown. And mahogany is a highly dignified shade of brown. The easiest way to integrate it with <strong>blue</strong> is to incorporate mahogany-stained wood furniture (or even darker-stained wood flooring). Most designers recommend using bolder <strong>blue</strong>s in this context, so navy, marine <strong>blue</strong>, or even slate <strong>blue</strong> are all great options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re a fan of rich, jewel-tone shades, golden yellow is one that looks great with <strong>blue</strong>. The shade of <strong>blue</strong> you choose will make a dramatic difference in any room.

If you have a gray coat on, you could go monochromatic and select elegant gray cashmere-lined peccary gloves to match tones. Alternatively, go with a contrast and choose a pair of bold petrol <strong>blue</strong> leather gloves in lamb nappa leather. With a scarf, you may be able to “kill two birds with one stone” by purchasing a double-sided version, like this dark <strong>blue</strong> and gray one in alpaca from Fort Belvedere, which lets you contrast or blend with a flip of the cloth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re looking for a way to revitalize a living room, a <strong>blue</strong> and soft orange color scheme is a great way to do so. And just like most color combinations on the list, you can create a variety of moods with this one depending on the exact shades you use. For an airy, coastal feel, combine sherbet orange with pastel <strong>blue</strong>. Either one makes a great wall color, and you can even incorporate <strong>blue</strong> and orange patterned rugs or throws for some high-energy contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The opposite move–a gray sports coat with navy trousers–is rarer, maybe because it is generally more difficult to pull off a lighter jacket with darker pants. However, there’s no reason to be dissuaded, as long as your <strong>blue</strong> pants don’t look like the bottom half of a suit. Here, a pattern can be your friend and using a gray sports coat that contains a pattern, again the classic glen check or Prince of Wales, will enhance your chances of success. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The lavender shade is a symbol of love and devotion.

These <strong>colours</strong> work beautifully for a living room that seeks to give off a tropical island vibe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A mid-width, solid pink tie in silk will look great at any gathering.

In my opinion, the color works better in summer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you like the combination of <strong>blue</strong> and red but want a stately palette, try combining burgundy with <strong>blue</strong>. In particular, navy and burgundy look great together. Generally, designers suggest using the 60-30-10 rule. That means to choose a neutral (white, gray, and soft beige are all good choices) and make that neutral take up 60% of the room. Choose either burgundy or navy and make that color take up about 30%, and then take the remaining color and make that one take up about 10%. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But <strong>blue</strong> projects confidence and daring. And I’m not talking about navy here. I’m talking about true <strong>blue</strong> as a clear sky. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>blue</strong> you choose is up to you. Since burnt orange is a lot more muted than bright shades of <strong>blue</strong>, brighter <strong>blue</strong>s are an option here. Navy or slate <strong>blue</strong>s are also a way to use this combination while still maintaining a relatively calm atmosphere. Burnt orange walls and dark <strong>blue</strong> appliances can create the perfect balance of creative energy and grounded calm in a kitchen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is another great option for those who love jewel tones. And burnt orange is ideal for creating an autumn-inspired palette. Adding a little burnt orange is a great quick fix if you feel like a mostly-<strong>blue</strong> room has become too cold and unwelcoming. Throw pillows or wall hangings that are mostly burnt orange are easy and inexpensive options for evening out a room. If you want to capitalize on this autumnal aesthetic, add in some golden yellow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue color mixes well with other colors to add a perfect touch to your bedroom walls.

To create light cyan, artists include additional white in the image. The white helps to subdue some of the liveliness of the brighter color, while still maintaining many of the eye-catching elements of cyan itself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Beyond avoiding sharp contrast, try adding complexity and interest to your <strong>blue</strong> and gray combinations by introducing textures and patterns. Sure, you can start simply with a white shirt, solid tie, and a plain worsted wool suit, but this gets boring fast. An easy way to add a pattern while remaining classic is to use a gray glen check tie in silk (or wool for winter) with a navy suit. For a gray suit, get a navy grenadine tie in either a large or fine weave (garza grossa or garza fina) to inject texture. In the reverse scenario, pick up a silver grenadine for a <strong>blue</strong> suit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some people might consider turquoise to be a shade of <strong>blue</strong>, but many actual turquoise stones are closer to being green.

This is also a combination that works well in bathrooms: try soft <strong>blue</strong> walls (or tile floors) with champagne-colored hardware. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This rich, vibrant red can add some real color. But since the red and <strong>blue</strong> combination can become overwhelming if you aren’t careful, this combination is a prime candidate for the 60-30-10 rule. In a dining room, try mostly-cream walls, a red accent wall, and a <strong>blue</strong> table runner or <strong>blue</strong> upholstered chairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Take your palette or paper plate and squeeze out some <strong>blue</strong> paint, and then squeeze out some purple paint next to the <strong>blue</strong> paint.

Sometimes, artists and companies will darken or lighten their electric <strong>blue</strong> to shade to give it additional depth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Printed silk ties with <strong>blue</strong> and gray geometric patterns or knit ties with both colors in them are likewise excellent options. I especially like the versatility of striped ties with either a repp pattern or large block stripes for this purpose. If you get a tie with stripes of both colors you can wear them easily with either gray or <strong>blue</strong> suits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another understated way to harness this combination is to hang photos or art pieces in silver frames on <strong>blue</strong> walls. Just about any <strong>blue</strong> shade will work here, but if you’re going for higher contrast, choose darker shades. You can also go bold with this look! For a modern and memorable bathroom, combine a steel sink and bathtub with <strong>blue</strong> tiled walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gold makes an especially bold statement against a deep <strong>blue</strong> somewhere between royal <strong>blue</strong> and navy. For best results, use this combination sparingly. A gold accent on an otherwise-bare <strong>blue</strong> wall creates a memorable focal point in any room!

Or you can create a more dramatic look with marine <strong>blue</strong> walls and sand-colored couches.

If you have a kitchen with a good bit of navy (or really any shade of <strong>blue</strong>), even a red teakettle and a couple of other red appliances can add some brightness. This combination also lends itself to patterns. Try a <strong>blue</strong> and white rug and a few largely-red wall hangings in a largely-white room to add a dynamic burst of color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A light gray shirt works well with navy <strong>blue</strong> pants as it creates a simple outfit that is elegant.

This essentially makes the <strong>blue</strong> less <strong>blue</strong>, giving you a rich muted <strong>blue</strong> color. However, be very careful not to overdo the orange, as you will then end up with a color leaning towards green. When mixing burnt umber with ultramarine <strong>blue</strong> or cobalt <strong>blue</strong>, you will create a brownish tint of <strong>blue</strong>, which will help you when you want to use a more muted brownish form. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The color <strong>blue</strong> is a primary color and is a dominant color.

When it comes to making muted colors, then complementary colors play a vital role. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The second suit a man should own when starting a business wardrobe is a gray one, but here the recommendations vary between a mid-gray and a charcoal. In either case, you simply take the opposite approach as your first suit and coordinate with a <strong>blue</strong> tie.

The jacket is a bit lighter than a standard navy, probably in something more like a medium to even a royal <strong>blue</strong>. It’s plain in color to ground the trousers which have a bit more texture in their weave. As mentioned previously, my shirt features a micro check pattern in light <strong>blue</strong> and dark gray, perhaps even almost black, but everything is working harmoniously within the color pairing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You will soon learn that learning how to make <strong>blue</strong> can only be perfected by practicing and experimenting.

Seeing that <strong>blue</strong> is regarded as a cool color, it is, therefore, possible for us to mix warm shades with <strong>blue</strong> colors.

This is where you can mix ultramarine with alizarin crimson, creating a much warmer <strong>blue</strong> color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>CMYK 100, 0, 0, 50 An interesting mixture of cyan and green, teal is an eye-catching shade ideal for a range of design and branding compositions.

The region was known for using a deep <strong>blue</strong> color for the uniforms of their Prussian army in the 17th and 18th century. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Like mahogany, forest green pairs well with deep <strong>blue</strong>. Try a deep navy or slate <strong>blue</strong> rug in a room with green velour couches and chairs. This combination also looks very nice with light sand or very light tan walls. Alternatively, light pink, peach, or cream pillows and throws can be a great way to lighten up this look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you prefer a look of quiet elegance in a room, cool grays and various shades of <strong>blue</strong> go quite well with one another. For a living room, soft gray walls (or even just an accent wall) pair well with <strong>blue</strong> furniture. Or in a bedroom, try a cool gray bedspread with a few <strong>blue</strong> accent pillows or a <strong>blue</strong> rug. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Mustard is a strong color, so one option is to place a mustard yellow couch or chair in a room with soft <strong>blue</strong> walls.

Even a simple mustard-yellow lampshade or two can add some subtle warm energy to a room with a lot of <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Take your palette or a paper plate and place an ample amount of <strong>blue</strong> paint onto the surface, enough to finish your project. You need to make sure that the amount of <strong>blue</strong> paint will be enough to cover what you need because it is difficult to try and match the same shade of dark <strong>blue</strong> paint a second time.

Take a sponge or paper towel, wet it, and place it under your palette or paper plate to prevent your paint from drying out while you are busy painting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To be clear, I’m not condoning wild, free-for-all color choices here. True, the real beauty of a <strong>blue</strong> suit is that it’s so darn versatile. But that doesn’t mean you can throw everything together in a haphazard frenzy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For a lighter look, even a few lavender accents will add some character to a soft <strong>blue</strong> room. Start with a lavender-patterned accent pillow or two and then add more lavender accents if needed. One good example is adding soft, sheer lavender curtains to a room with gray walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>CMYK 100, 74, 0, 47 Sophisticated and elegant, Resolution <strong>blue</strong> is brimming with a sense of deep heritage. This shade has a mature element to it which could make it a good pick for a branding strategy for a company hoping to portray a worldly and cultured image. The color is also excellent for all kinds of interior design and product options, as it’s still bright enough to catch the eye. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Even the color <strong>blue</strong> is very popular, it is also the least enticing or appealing color. This is why many of the plans for weight loss encourage you to eat from a <strong>blue</strong> plate, as it only occurs in nature in the form of berries and plums. We are all encouraged to avoid any foods that are regarded as poisonous, and food that has <strong>blue</strong> coloring in it is a sure sign of spoilt or poisonous food - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The same techniques mentioned above can be used when wearing sports coat and trouser combinations, though some men may be put off by the perceived difficulties of coordinating an additional article of clothing: pants in a different shade. If you begin with <strong>blue</strong> and gray, this is actually a piece of cake. Like the navy suit, the navy blazer is a staple, foundational item of menswear. Technically, a solid blazer has to be <strong>blue</strong>, so begin there and add gray pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The color <strong>blue</strong> can make excellent dark colors. Ultramarine, for example, is already a dark <strong>blue</strong> color, and by using it, you can create outstanding shades of dark <strong>blue</strong>. By mixing dioxazine purple with ultramarine <strong>blue</strong>, you create a brilliant dark <strong>blue</strong>. The dioxazine purple tends to make the ultramarine <strong>blue</strong> much darker, and also adds a slight purple shade to it. When taking the dark <strong>blue</strong>, you created with the dioxazine purple and the ultramarine <strong>blue</strong>, and you add phthalo green, you make the color even darker, with a slight green tint to it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>CMYK 50, 25, 0, 20 Blue-gray, or <strong>blue</strong>-grey, is a medium <strong>blue</strong> color mixed with elements of grey. The hue is quite dull, making it less aggressive for the eyes, and quite relaxing to look at. While this color is quite cold, it can also appear very mature and professional, ideal for various kinds of branding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pink and <strong>blue</strong> might evoke memories of baby showers. But when combined carefully, they can make a lovely palette in any room. Try cornflower-<strong>blue</strong> couches with a few pink vases, bowls, or accent pillows in a living room. A bedroom with soft <strong>blue</strong> walls can also look nice with a soft pink bedspread. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>CMYK 100, 20, 0, 0 Similar to many shades of <strong>blue</strong>, vivid <strong>blue</strong> sky is named for its close connection to one of the many colors of our natural sky. This is the kind of color you might spot above you when taking a stroll on a spring day. It’s also a popular color for interior décor, particularly in bathrooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>CMYK 85, 70, 0, 27 A restorative and reviving shade, Persian <strong>blue</strong> has roots extending all the way to Persia. This is one of the most common shades of <strong>blue</strong> associated with a sense of richness and luxury. The Persian <strong>blue</strong> color is extremely refined and elegant, perhaps in part due to its slight purple hue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When using this lively color, it’s a good idea to temper its energy with cooler <strong>blue</strong>s. Slate <strong>blue</strong> and cornflower are two examples. While both are definitely more <strong>blue</strong> than gray, they have enough gray to exert a calming influence on a mostly-turquoise room or a room with turquoise accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For those seeking a sleek, modern appeal, incorporating metal into a room is a must. And the combination of <strong>blue</strong> and silver is a popular one for a reason. If you want to try just a touch of this palette, add silver hanging lamps to a room with a <strong>blue</strong> or mostly-<strong>blue</strong> wall or ceiling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Take your palette or paper plate and squeeze out just enough <strong>blue</strong> paint required to complete the dark shade of <strong>blue</strong>. Now add some of the orange next to and not on top of the <strong>blue</strong> paint, you will only need a small amount of the orange paint so add it carefully. Drag a very small amount of the orange into the <strong>blue</strong> paint making sure it is not too much, and then keep adding a small amount each time until you are satisfied with the color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As seen from the first step above, mixing <strong>blue</strong> with green will give you a light form of cyan. This light cyan color is acceptable on your color printer. However, when using paint, it needs to be made darker as it is a cool color, and the whole effect will only be appreciated in its darkened form. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can also take cadmium green and mix it with cobalt <strong>blue</strong>, creating a warm <strong>blue</strong> shade. This warm color may not be as warm as when mixed with alizarin crimson, but it does give you a <strong>blue</strong> shade that is warmer. Now, if you use cobalt <strong>blue</strong> which is regarded as cooler than ultramarine <strong>blue</strong>, with the same combinations as seen above, your <strong>blue</strong> created will not be as warm as when you use ultramarine <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>By adding black paint to your <strong>blue</strong> paint, you will create a dark <strong>blue</strong> color. However, you can also blend orange, or purple to give you the same result. So, you can try following both methods to see which one works best for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>CMYK 23, 3, 0, 10 Powder <strong>blue</strong> is one of the paler shades of <strong>blue</strong> in the spectrum. This color is similar to a lot of grey-<strong>blue</strong>s, as it has a colder tone to it. The color, like sky <strong>blue</strong>, is frequently associated with calmness and serenity, and it can be very relaxing, as it’s not as vibrant as other <strong>blue</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can find this color in many Persian-style rugs. Even something as simple as adding one of these rugs to a room with <strong>blue</strong> couches can do wonders. Or if you want something more subtle, go for an eclectic mix of cranberry red and <strong>blue</strong> vases and/or bowls in a largely neutral space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pastel yellow is a beautifully light, springlike touch in any room. It’s the color of baby chicks and daffodil petals. It makes a great color for a breakfast nook or sunroom, and it’s a nice lightening touch in a room with navy furniture. For a dining room, try pastel yellow walls with a <strong>blue</strong> table runner. Just about any <strong>blue</strong> shade will look nice here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For most people, the <strong>blue</strong> and orange combination is quite tricky and scary to try. Not all are willing to take the risk for that fashion statement. However, gurus can say that it is possible to pull this color combination off as long as it is done correctly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want a rustic, Southwest-inspired aesthetic, try a palette of warm terra-cotta and cool <strong>blue</strong>. Some designers recommend pairing dusk <strong>blue</strong>, a pale near-neutral <strong>blue</strong>, with terra cotta. But almost any shade of <strong>blue</strong> will do! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>White is the color of innocence that works wonders when paired with a slightly darker shade.

It can serve as a backdrop for a <strong>blue</strong> bedspread, tablecloth, chair, or couch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Speaking of bronze, this is another color that goes quite well with various <strong>blue</strong> shades. If you like the look of gold wall accents (mirrors, wall hangings, etc.) but feel the need to tone it down a bit, simply substitute bronze for gold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the powerful color schemes is pairing a darker <strong>blue</strong> shade with a brighter color like yellow.

You can rock these two colors by mixing and matching them with prints and patterns or some layers.
