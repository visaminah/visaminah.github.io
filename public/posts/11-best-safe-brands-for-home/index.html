It has a 30-minute fireproof rating, and over years of testing this category, we’ve been impressed with First Alert’s safes due to their reliably solid build quality and affordable prices for the level of protection they offer. Unfortunately, many of them have been discontinued, so be sure to grab the 2037F if it interests you. - Source: Internet It’s important to note that although there are safes that offer a greater degree of fire protection, they aren’t designed specifically for documents as our picks are, and they have other disadvantages.

Plus, according to a fire expert we spoke to, their two-hour-plus protection ratings offer diminishing returns since most house fires are out within about an hour. - Source: Internet A fireproof safe is the kind of thing you buy hoping its capabilities are never put to the test. But if the time comes, chances are, the safe will be worth far more than you paid. We’ve tested more than a dozen safes over the years, even burning five of them in a controlled fire, and we’re sure Honeywell’s 1114 Lightweight Fire and Waterproof Chest is the best document safe you can get for your home or office. It’s independently rated to last longer in higher-temperature fires than other safes of its size, and it will keep its contents dry longer when submerged in water. That means it has the greatest potential among document safes we’ve seen to keep your stuff—including irreplaceable documents, photos, and essentials like passports and birth certificates—secure. - Source: Internet A safe should give you security and comfort when away from your home. You should read the buying guide before deciding on any safe from any of these brands. These brands mentioned above are worldwide recognized safe manufacturers and guaranteed to keep your things safe from unauthorized access. - Source: Internet Modern home safes are durable and robust and offer many useful and advanced security features.
