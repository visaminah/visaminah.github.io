I’d use a strong black, too, to give a solidly masculine mid-century modern scheme. It’s calming because it’s strong and looks very put together.&rsquo; says Annie Sloan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Those who enjoy the color <strong>green</strong> are more likely to enjoy it in various shades and hues. But those who dislike it may find themselves more at ease with a less vibrant shade. Some people prefer earthier tones like beige or brown, whereas others find this shade too drab and prefer something brighter and light-hearted, like blue or orange. On average, gents prefer lighter shades when pairing shoes with their <strong>clothes</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As mentioned, you can team olive pants up with <strong>clothes</strong> that have yellow hues in them. Browns and tans, for example, accentuate olive <strong>green</strong>’s earth tone. This is great for professorial outfits and outdoorsy styles. Think <strong>green</strong> trousers with a tan button-down and tweed jacket, or olive jeans with a brown flannel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A light, almost silver-gold will look fab. Rose gold shoes with a <strong>green</strong> dress is also a great pairing. Especially when pairing it with a lighter <strong>green</strong> dress like the one pictured above right. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When selecting a dress color to go with <strong>green</strong> shoes, match the shade of your shoes to the color of your dress and vice versa.

For example, if you’re wearing a darker shade of <strong>green</strong>, try on dark brown or black shoes.

As an example - combining verdigris <strong>green</strong> with a chalky, blue-toned grey will create a cool, calm scheme, whereas pairing it with a warmer, yellow-toned beige will create an earthy, outdoorsy feel.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you like colorful dress shoes, just follow the color wheel rule and avoid red shades. Crimson suede monks pair well with gray trousers and a red tie, but would be too loud when worn with <strong>green</strong> pants. Whereas tan Norwegian shoes work perfectly well as pictured below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Red and <strong>green</strong> are colors that combine well when matching the shoes with your dress. This is because red and <strong>green</strong> form a complementary color scheme. A <strong>green</strong> dress will appear more vibrant if you wear lighter-colored outfits for shoes in dark shades. However, you can experiment with lighter-colored shoes to see which works better for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can mix beige with several shades of <strong>green</strong> without being too overwhelming.

This shoe will work for small, medium, or large frames and can be worn with skirts and dress alike. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>White high-knee boots are another choice for women looking for great matching shoes for their <strong>green</strong> dress.

The solid colors or any color when it comes to white are in vogue these days. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Green is a symbol of wisdom, thinking, fertility and wise peace. This color, because it is a combination of blue and yellow, has inherited characteristics from its parents. Calmness from blue and intelligence and wisdom from yellow. In fact, the more <strong>green</strong> goes to blue, the more introverted it becomes. And the more it goes to yellow, the more exciting it is. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Green and pink are complementary colors, sitting opposite each other on the wheel. This means that the scheme is high impact,&rsquo; explains Sarah.

You can also wear them with your favorite jacket or coat when heading out shopping. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can match gold shoes with any <strong>green</strong> dress in your closet.

This shade can look best with darker fabrics, so you may want to try wearing gold heels with a dark <strong>green</strong> suit or skirt.

These are exceedingly common in men’s basics: Brown shoes, navy suits, camel jackets, blue and yellow club ties, to name a few.

Likewise, the beige pumps with a <strong>green</strong> dress will look good in any venue where you can wear this combination of shades together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Again, never wear <strong>green</strong> pants with red or anything in the red family. This includes pink, magenta, and salmon. You’ll also want to steer clear of colors that are too close to red on the color wheel. True orange with <strong>green</strong> is only appropriate on St. Patrick’s Day, just as primary red with <strong>green</strong> is only appropriate on a holiday sweater. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Strappy sandals go well with <strong>green</strong> dresses as they give a special touch to any outfit. They with both formal and casual outfits. These days, they are in vogue so that you would find them at any shoe store. You can try brown strappy sandals for the best effect on your dress.

We knew that our best approach to using these bold colors was in knowing they will stand out but also keeping in mind that they need to feel like they belong.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Green is the color of nature.

Being the neutral color that it is, it easily matches the <strong>green</strong> outfits giving it a look of effortless styling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You don’t have to look like a Christmas tree to pull off <strong>green</strong> and red. Velvet, corduroy, and georgette are interesting choices of fabrics to bring red and <strong>green</strong> together. The materials have an inherent undertone that works well with this color combination. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Any shade will do. I love pale yellow with all shades of <strong>green</strong>, while vibrant sunshine yellows hues are fab with emerald <strong>green</strong> and & lime <strong>green</strong>s. Love this color shoes with emerald <strong>green</strong> dresses especially! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple and <strong>green</strong> may sound like a bold look but as Sarah says, it&rsquo;s one that &lsquo;can be very charming, particularly in a smaller room where you want to make an impact and embrace coziness.
