Wooden end tables and accents are an outstanding balance to the cooler gray of your couch. - Source: Internet Statement Oriental Area Rug. Rugs tie your living room together and help define the space. Your gray couch is just the right shade of neutral to compliment that bold area rug you’ve had your eye on. - Source: Internet Worried grey alone might seem a bit dull? Then choose your accessories carefully. A blue sofa, yellow chair and tomato red lamp really sing out against a mid-grey backdrop. Pull everything together with a rug that features all the different shades that you are using, and voilà – decorating perfection! - Source: Internet If your style borders between modern and boho, this is the perfect coffee table for you. This table comes in two colors: natural wood and black. The black works perfectly with gray couches, especially if you have multiple pieces of gray furniture in your room. - Source: Internet ‘Due to its incredibly versatile nature as a color, we love to think of a gray sofa as a blank canvas for the rest of the room.

Here, the patterns on the rug, pillows and wall art play to the softness of the velvet couch and add interest to the white living room. - Source: Internet Modern Monochrome Design.

Instead of being the base, the different shades of gray, from the light gray couch to the darker pillows and rug, play the first fiddle. - Source: Internet Allow the colour of natural stone to inspire your grey colour choices. Use your paint samples on a piece of card to hold against the original walls to determine the perfect pairing to complement the natural warmth on the walls. Offset the light grey decorating with darker accents on the furniture to add depth, as shown in this rustic living room. - Source: Internet Floral Rug.

White or light grey walls, brown wood floors, and cream throw pillows will all pair nicely with your grey couch and keep the space light and airy. Darker neutrals create a modern, sophisticated twist on that effect. Want a more vibrant aesthetic? Use your grey sofa to anchor brighter colors and funkier design elements. If a boho interior feels too chaotic for you — with its emphasis on maximalism and texture — opting for a grey sectional sofa instead of a velvety aquamarine chaise lounge might be just the thing to tone it down. - Source: Internet White Curtains and Plaid Pillows. This living space is a great example of mixing decor styles seamlessly. The matching light gray colors of the couch and the walls and clean contemporary lines create a perfect backdrop for the rustic accent pieces. - Source: Internet Our top choice for making your grey sofa feel at home in the living room is adding a textured, cosy rug underfoot.
