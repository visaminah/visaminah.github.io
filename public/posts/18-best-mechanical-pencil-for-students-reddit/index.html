The following links will give newcomers a rough overview of the hobby. Best way for you to learn more is to combine these guides with all the knowledge that you can read and see on r/mechanical****pencils. - Source: Internet Kerry Sharp 0.5mm: Where to begin, this is a fan favorite and I understand why, it is perfectly balanced it has a sleek design(I would be a millionaire if I got a dollar for every person thinking it’s a pen). The mechanism is very nice and the pencil it’s relatively cheap compared to others. This is the pencil I have carried for 2 years throughout classes and it is probably my favorite. An overall good pencil and well worth the money. - Source: Internet When Uni introduced the Kuru Toga , it was a revolution—literally. With a conventional mechanical pencil, the tip of the lead gets worn down into a broad wedge shape as you write, making your writing look uneven. The Kuru Toga solves this problem with its built-in ratchet mechanism that rotates the lead slightly every time you lift the lead off the page. This causes the lead to be worn down into a sharp, consistent conical point. - Source: Internet I’ve been looking to buy a new mechanical pencil recently. I have been looking at the rOtring 600 and 800, but many reviews say that they are small and not suitable for people with large hands, which I have. Do you guys have any recommendations for mechanical pencils which would be good for people with larger than normal hands? - Source: Internet KURU TOGA 0.7mm: The pencil that started it all, I found one of these on the ground in high school, and then the mechanical pencil obsession started. This pencil is very light the mechanism is very interesting and like it’s designed for it does keep the lead at a point. I have had some issues with lead getting stuck in the point but overall a good pencil. Overall a good pencil and an interesting mechanism, worth the price. - Source: Internet I can’t believe there is a subreddit for pencils.. But moving straight into it. I am looking for a couple wooden pencils and one good mechanical pencil for school next fall. - Source: Internet I mostly use my pencils and pens for long form writing (essays and academic papers) and annotating books, and it seems like many mechanical pencils featured in this sub are meant for drafting. What are the features that make a mechanical pencil good for writing vs. drafting, and what are the best nice mechanical pencils for writing? - Source: Internet The Kuru Toga Roulette takes this auto lead rotation mechanism and puts it into a luxuriously sleek, high-quality body. It features a metal grip section that’s comfortable to hold and gives the Roulette a low center of gravity—a characteristic that makes the pencil feel more nimble and easy to control in the hand. Three rows of gentle knurling on the grip provide extra purchase for your fingers as well as added visual appeal. - Source: Internet Rotring 600 0.5mm: This pencil is almost perfect, It is heavy and well balanced the machining is top-notch and the internal mechanism works wonderfully it feels premium. While it does have these advantages I now only use this pencil for drafting and drawing as the weight gets fatiguing on the hand after about 40 minutes of writing. Overall amazing pencil and worth the money. - Source: Internet My dad is an engineer and does a lot of sketches of mechanical drawings when he’s working something out. His birthday is coming up and I want to get him something he can use. Right now he just has some flimsy plastic thing. - Source: Internet I’m a student who’s about to join high school who is also into drawing. So please recommend me a pencil that is good for both things. Writing and Drawing. And please make sure I can buy it online in stores like amazon - Source: Internet I’ve been using gel roll pens for the past couple of months for my note-taking and daily tasks. I use to use the Pental 0.5 HB and it was just ok. I used a bic mechanical pencil for it, but I’m not sure if the pencil makes a difference. I wanted to get a darker and smoother lead to use instead, - Source: Internet This discussion appears very regularly. If you are wondering if you are the only one to use the eraser in your pencil: No you are not the only one. If you are wondering if you are the only one who never uses the eraser in your pencils: No you are not the only one. The basic answer is: you are not alone. The only right way to do this is to do it the way that makes you the happiest. - Source: Internet Title says all. I am looking for a sub $30 pencil that will hopefully last me until I finish off University. I know nothing about pencils, I’ve read the posts here and I just have no idea what to buy - Source: Internet I wonder what everyone thinks about the best pencil. Best can mean many things such as build quality or features or writing experience. For me I like the Rotring 800, Spoke 4, and Staedlter All Black. I am curious to here what your picks are. - Source: Internet Well, when it finally broke, I decided to invest in a little more expensive pencil and got a Rotring 0.5mm ( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AZWYUA4/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_DGrvzbD98J6YA ). Sadly the pencil hasn’t even lasted 3 months and the eraser holder has completely caved in and the barrel is totally bent. - Source: Internet There are only two things that kept the Roulette from sharing the top spot with the Pentel Sharp Kerry. First, the fixed lead sleeve makes it less portable and pocket-friendly than it would be if it had a retractable lead sleeve. Second, the Kuru Toga mechanism can cause a slightly squishy feeling when you press the lead down on the paper and the tip retracts a fraction of a millimeter.
