The sensor then sends the results to the Color Muse app via Bluetooth, where you can see the closest matches from brands including Sherwin-Williams, Behr, Benjamin Moore and Valspar. The Color Muse does take a little more effort on your part, since you’ll need to calibrate the device to make the most of its features. - Source: Internet Light is one of the biggest factors affecting how color translates on your wall. In a home improvement store, you’re likely looking at a paint chip under a display lit by a strong fluorescent light – very different from the light in your home. Take that same paint chip home and it could look totally different. - Source: Internet The undertones of paint will peek through depending on the other colors in the room. If you have blue trim and decide on a gray with a blue undertone for your walls, you can expect more of that blue to show through in the gray paint. Sheen : Some finishes absorb light more than others, such as mattes, and look similar in most lighting. High glosses are very reflective, and their color will depend mainly on how much light is hitting them. - Source: Internet Picking paint colors and matching old paint isn’t as hard as it used to be with apps and devices like these. You can browse through thousands of paints from the comfort of your couch and throw them on your wall with the tap of a finger. Still, if you’re wondering how a color is going to look on your wall, the time-tested approach of a paint sample is a surefire way to find out. - Source: Internet Color translates to computer via a series of values. Knowing those values for the shade you need can help you navigate sensors and apps, and match color accurately across brands. The most common values for color are HEX, CMYK and RGB. - Source: Internet All this color picking is manageable if you’re painting a brand new or well-primed wall. Things get trickier when paint matching is your goal. Like clothes, car colors and photos hung in sunlight, paint colors also fade over time. Even if you know a wall’s original paint color, a new coat of paint might look off either because of color fading or loss of sheen. - Source: Internet Picking the right paint can transform your space. Staring at rows of colors in your local home improvement store, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed with choices. It’s also easy to love a color in the store, but hate the way it turns out once it’s on your wall. If you’re trying to match an old color, it can get even more complicated. - Source: Internet Unlike the branded apps from paint manufacturers, third-party apps sense color without trying to sell you a specific paint. The downside is that there aren’t any branded paint colors to choose from as results. You’ll simply be able to identify the color value of the object or wall you’re scanning. Once you’ve got a color value, you can use that to find a matching paint color, likely by using the RGB value, as it is the most commonly used value in the paint industry. There are even online converters that will match color values to multiple paint brands. - Source: Internet Black : Black is created by mixing blue and brown together. Depending on the concentration of each color, black tones can be warm or cool. You can use black to add sophistication to any room or as a beautiful accent that will ground the rest of the color scheme. - Source: Internet Paint My Wall is simplistic and easy to use. The app allows you to use their image to explore color options or upload your own image to test. Paint with your finger or use the smart fill to fill a wall completely. Download For: iOS - Source: Internet “Paint on walls fade over time and the sheen changes,” Angela Kirkpatrick, a residential designer, notes. “Even if you get a chunk of wall beside an outlet, it may not match the color and sheen in the middle of the wall where the TV was mounted. A difference in wall sheen can cause a color to look very different.” - Source: Internet Light colors are great to utilize in a room with little natural light. Light paint colors for small dark rooms are a quick and straightforward way to make a space feel airy. If your goal is to make your low-light room feel brighter, light colors are a great way to go. Light colors are some of the best colors for a dark bedroom, but you can utilize them in many spaces. - Source: Internet Dark colors can make the corners in a room seem to blend together and open up a room. If you want to embrace the coziness of a dark room while expanding its look, dark colors may be the way to go. The best paint for dark rooms will make spaces feel cozy without feeling cramped, such as: - Source: Internet Typically electronic screens and monitors that emit light use RGB (red, green, blue) color values, while CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow and black) values are the standard for printed materials like newspapers and magazines, which absorb light. The hex method of valuing color is used to communicate RGB values in computer programming, such as HTML. Once you know you desired color’s value, you’ll be able to find it in nearly every medium out there. - Source: Internet Choosing a paint color used to mean spending an afternoon wandering the aisles of paint chip samples. The thousands of options in the rainbow-colored rows can be a bit overwhelming, though, so we’re happy to try anything that simplifies the color selection process. Thanks to a handful of smart designers and paint companies, there’s now a better way to shop for paint. Take a look below at a few of our favorite tools and decide which is best for you and your next paint project. - Source: Internet McCormick Paints lets you choose a standard generic interior home image of a bedroom, hallway, kitchen or dining room and then change the color around on the walls. You can also upload your own photo to its Color Visualizer, which we suggest as that’s ideally what you want to see, how paint looks in your own space. You can even add paint to trim, like window frames and doors. - Source: Internet Meanwhile, using a high gloss paint for an accent wall creates a reflective surface that will allow the light your room receives to bounce around. Light-reflecting paint for dark rooms can make a space feel more breathable. Painting your trim in a high gloss that coordinates with the rest of your room can brighten it up and give an elegant sheen to any space. - Source: Internet Pastels and muted tones are always a good idea for brightening up a room in a colorful way. Sea foam and mint green are proof of this. They’re gentle tones that can contribute to a stylish and relaxed atmosphere but feel far more refreshing than a dark forest or olive green. Craft a faux headboard, paint the entirety of the wall, or create a patterned mural. - Source: Internet This app works on smartphones, both iOS and Android devices, and can help you virtually add paint to almost anything from a wall, to a piece of furniture. You start by taking a photo of the thing you hope to paint, and from there you can pick colors from 25 different brands from Benjamin Moore to Farrow and Ball. (A personal favorite.) - Source: Internet Sherwin-Williams offers an app called ColorSnap Match, that allows you to upload an existing photo or take a new photo to find paint colors that match it. There’s also a virtual painting tool, and multiple ways to explore all the Sherwin-Williams paint collections. The app includes RGB color values for Sherwin-Williams paints, lists of coordinating colors for each paint, as well as the color strip you’d find them on in a hardware store. The app is free and works on iOS and Android devices. - Source: Internet This app is actually computer based, meaning you’re not going to download it to your smartphone. Instead, you start by using one of their sample photos, or uploading your own. Sherwin-Williams suggests you take one with good lighting so you can get the best sense of how color will look on the walls. - Source: Internet Your paint’s finish or sheen also makes a difference in how color is perceived. A flat paint finish (like what you’ll find on most paint chips) won’t reflect as much light as a high-gloss sheen, so a flat finish tends to look a bit darker. Often, higher gloss finishes are good for bathrooms, kitchens and rooms that see more moisture. Flatter finishes work well in spaces like bedrooms and living rooms. - Source: Internet If you’ve ever been out and about and spotted color inspiration for your next project, this is the app for you; Color Capture puts the power of color matching in your pocket. Point and tap to take a picture of the color and Color Capture will match it. If you really want to try the color out on your own image before you use it, Benjamin Moore offers another app, called Color Portfolio designed to allow you to virtually try colors on your space before you buy them.

You can also view selected colors in generic scenes like kitchens or bathrooms. The free app works with both iOS and Android devices. - Source: Internet Just take a picture of a room or choose “live view,” and then search from the thousands of paint and stain options. Find a color you want to try and tap a surface in the image to apply the color. Project Color automatically adjusts for any shadows, angles or lighting variances so you can see how the color would look in that particular space. - Source: Internet Unless your walls are being painted for the first time, a primer coat will be the first layer before the new color is applied in multiple coats. Otherwise, the first color may show through and impact the tone of the new paint. Undertones : The undertones of paint will peek through depending on the other colors in the room. If you have blue trim and decide on a gray with a blue undertone for your walls, you can expect more of that blue to show through in the gray paint. - Source: Internet If you need more help, you can always work with a color consultant to help you find the perfect shade for your space. Paintzen offers free, remote color consultations with our trained team of Project Advisors. Just a quick phone call can help you get some incredible ideas for your next interior or exterior painting project. They can also share some insights from our interior designer partners, and can offer guidance for specific rooms in your home, like bathrooms or kitchens. - Source: Internet What we liked about this site’s app was the fact that the actual paint swatches gave us the chip, color and number so we could order the exact color of paint if we chose. We also had options to look at all colors available, pick from a select palette, or even match colors from an existing photo. You can order your paint directly from the app too. - Source: Internet The best neutral paint for a dark room is one that will reflect light to brighten your space. Neutrals can be perfect accents for other colors, making them very versatile and able to fit into any room seamlessly. They can add warmth, and you can incorporate undertones and accents to create the mood and look that you want. - Source: Internet Finally, you can also purchase paint from The Home Depot directly in the app and never have to leave the house at all. (Not a bad option in today’s environment.) - Source: Internet Many major paint manufacturers have websites and apps designed to help you choose a paint color. Sherwin-Williams, Valspar and Behr all have websites with virtual design studios where you can try paint on in an uploaded photo of your space. It’s not a perfect system by any means, and the color and light settings on your computer monitor or mobile device will affect how you see the color. Still, virtual painting is a good way to narrow down your choices and help you decide between different looks. - Source: Internet Some finishes absorb light more than others, such as mattes, and look similar in most lighting. High glosses are very reflective, and their color will depend mainly on how much light is hitting them. Porosity : Painting over porous surfaces can cause light colors to look streaky and allow dark colors to bleed through, but a quality primer can avoid this. - Source: Internet White can be the best paint for indirect lighting because it is the most reflective. Every other color will absorb at least some of the spectrum, but neutrals will absorb the least amount of light. Some of our favorite colors for rooms with little natural light are: - Source: Internet Painting over porous surfaces can cause light colors to look streaky and allow dark colors to bleed through, but a quality primer can avoid this. Adjacent shades : Colors that are right next to each other on the wheel are adjacent. They can have a calming effect, especially compared to colors on the opposite sides of the wheel, which make colors appear more intense. - Source: Internet Morning sunlight in these rooms can produce subtle shadows, but evening light tends to make any color look warm and pleasant. North-facing rooms: Light in these spaces is bluish and cool. Bold colors are best used in north-facing rooms, as they usually show up more clearly than muted colors. On the other side of the spectrum, lighter colors in such a space tend to look subdued. - Source: Internet These apps simplify that entire process by using digital technology, to virtually apply paint to whatever surface you choose: a wall or even the exterior of your home — all without cracking open a can of paint. While there are apps and devices that can help you match a color to a can of paint, these apps actually let you apply the paint directly to your wall. Some of these are from major paint companies, and clearly make use of their line of paint. Other are single apps you can download to your smartphone that can give you more of a sense of color. All, however, are free. - Source: Internet 05 of 06 Shying Away From Bold Hues According to Woelfel, one of the biggest mistakes people make when choosing paint is simply being afraid to decorate with color. Especially when you’re selecting paint samples, don’t shy away from a bolder hue. After all, Pantone’s 2022 Color of the Year is a “courageous” shade of blue. - Source: Internet Finding the right paint colors for low-light rooms can be a challenge. Every color will say something about your home and lifestyle, and you want to make sure the colors you choose will accomplish the look and feel you want. Some colors make spaces appear larger by making them brighter, and others will embrace the coziness and tranquility of a dark room. - Source: Internet At $100, this color sensor isn’t exactly cheap, but it could make life a lot easier for anyone matching multiple paint colors. The pre-calibrated Nix Color Sensor Mini blocks out ambient light and uses a calibrated light source to read a surface’s color. The sensor then sends that reading to your phone via Bluetooth and the Nix Paints or Nix Digital app, where you can match colors to a dozen different paint brands in the US and Canada. - Source: Internet Color Grab is a third-party app that identifies color in real time using your camera’s viewfinder. Once you’ve saved the color, you can view its profile, including the hex code, CMYK and RGB values. Color Grab can also match colors from photos in your phone’s library. The app is free and works with Android devices. - Source: Internet Pro tip: Colors vary by undertones. So, if you’re looking for teal, for example, check the blue and green paint families. Neutrals are especially tricky, so look for your perfect color in the white, gray, brown and even red paint families. - Source: Internet Light reflectance value (LRV) measures a color’s ability to reflect or absorb light. Black is the most absorbent color and so it is a zero on the LRV scale. Pure white, being the most reflective color, is at the other end of the scale at 100 because it doesn’t absorb light or warmth. Colors that fall below 50 on the LRV scale will absorb more light than they reflect. Shades above 50 help create a daytime look and add a feeling of expansion to a space. - Source: Internet Have you ever tried to pick a paint color online? Most of us find it a big enough challenge to do it with paint swatches in hand. But adding the online factor can make what should be a fun task seem darn near impossible. Thank goodness for technology, which has already figured this out for us. Here are some life-simplifying tools that’ll have you picking the right paint colors online, without the decorating drama. - Source: Internet If you’re ready to see exactly what a paint color will look like on your walls, the ColorSnap® Visualizer makes it…well, a snap with Instant Paint! Using augmented reality (AR) technology, you can upload your pictures and see how paint colors will look in your space.

They can have a calming effect, especially compared to colors on the opposite sides of the wheel, which make colors appear more intense. Placement: Colors can make a room feel small and cozy or large and open. Some colors can make an already large room feel vast, or a cozy room feel cramped. - Source: Internet There are limitations on the number of areas you can try the virtual paint process on in a room. In one kitchen, for example, we could paint some cabinets, not all. But the app is certainly fun to play with, and a decent starting point if you’re a Sherwin-Williams fan. - Source: Internet Australian company Palette released Pico in 2018. The $80 paint-matching device sequentially bursts red, green and blue light onto the surface you scan. It then shares those results via Bluetooth in your smartphone’s Pico app. Pico reports the RGB values and matching branded paint colors. - Source: Internet Light blues : Light blues are very serene colors that create a relaxing feeling. They can open up a room beautifully and are great for pairing with undertones in colors such as beige. Blues are beautiful in spaces where you want to promote relaxation, such as bedrooms and bathrooms. Blue colors for a dark living room can also be welcoming and relaxing for guests. - Source: Internet Home Harmony is the perfect all-in-one tool for designing a room or exterior. Choose a new paint color and test it or choose new flooring to try. The app is easy to use and makes switching between paint brands such as Behr a breeze. Download For: iOS - Source: Internet Gray should be in every minimalist’s back pocket. This color is grounding and takes the edge off an all-white space. Lighter than related shades on the color wheel (like charcoal), it won’t completely darken a room. It’s a great cooler neutral that toes the line between cozy and airy. Darker decor items will also pop against the shade, making it seem brighter. - Source: Internet In this way, you’ll quickly sort out the colors that don’t fit your criteria. And once you’ve found your color, the color visualizer will email you your color choice and the colorized room image. Then, you can share it with family and friends to get kudos for your excellent design taste. - Source: Internet Painting a home is a lengthy job. Aside from the work of actually putting paint on the walls, you have to test out which color feels right to you. That often means heading down to a store, getting samples, painting those on to a surface and waiting to see if the drying color suits you or not. - Source: Internet Using a matte color for an accent wall will create a stable focal point that looks similar in most forms of lighting. Matte colors make a flat, even surface of color that attracts the eye when you walk into the room. In a living room, walls with a fireplace are excellent for matte walls. If you have a dining room or other space with columns or other eye-catching structural pieces, that would be a great place for a matte finish. - Source: Internet With more than 3,500 paint colors to choose from, having the opportunity visualize them in your space before you paint is a good idea. You can explore paint color combinations with the sample room designs provided or upload your own photo to use as a canvas. With the upload option, you can define up to five surfaces to paint. - Source: Internet Light in these spaces is bluish and cool. Bold colors are best used in north-facing rooms, as they usually show up more clearly than muted colors. On the other side of the spectrum, lighter colors in such a space tend to look subdued. South-facing rooms: Since the sun pours into these rooms from a high position in the sky, lighter colors will glow while darker hues appear brighter. - Source: Internet This app not only allows you to explore all of Sherwin Williams’ paint colors, ColorSnap also gives you the ability to create your own color palette. Choose a color you like and see coordinating colors and similar colors to take it to the next level.

Soft white fluorescent: These bulbs generate a warm, yellow light that can have a fading effect on all paint colors. - Source: Internet These rooms are great for yellows, oranges and reds. East light is warm and yellow-hued before noon and turns bluer later. West-facing rooms: Morning sunlight in these rooms can produce subtle shadows, but evening light tends to make any color look warm and pleasant. - Source: Internet Taupe acts similarly to light gray. It’s not as in-your-face as an icy white, but it’s not a dim color either. You can completely coat walls in the shade of your choice, or take a page out of this home’s book and create a half-and-half look with white. The proportions seen here not only make the space look bright, but taller, too. - Source: Internet Although this shares the same name as the tool from McCormick Paints, we found this Color Visualizer one much more simple to use. You select from a number of standard images, a bedroom, kitchen or even the exterior or your home, for example, and then start applying color swatches. You can, here, also upload your own image to get a sense of how paint will play in your home. - Source: Internet It would be wrong to not include this classic in the list. While it’s an obvious pick, there’s a reason why it’s such a popular color for rooms of every purpose. White is inherently bright and reflects light like no other. It might seem basic, but there are numerous hues with different undertones that’ll give you different results. A warmer white can feel welcoming, and something with blue or green undertones could appeal to your hope for something more refreshing. - Source: Internet 02 of 06 Not Considering the Furniture \u0026 Decor Avoid testing swatches in a completely empty room. Even if you just moved in or want to empty the room before you start painting, keeping some furniture and decor in the room as you select a paint color will ensure the hue works with the other colors in the space. “We always recommend painting a small board or piece of foam core and evaluating the color in different parts of the room and throughout the day,” says Andrea Magno, Director of Color Marketing and Development for Benjamin Moore. “This will enable you to see how the color looks with consideration of the light (both natural and artificial) and other surroundings (such as artwork, furniture, etc.), ensuring that you’ll love the color in all scenarios,” she explains. - Source: Internet Call her a revolutionary with a roller. Interior designer Nicole Gibbons has started Clare, a paint company that simplifies the often overwhelming process of choosing a color. “Decorators don’t have 3,000 favorite colors. They have a short list they know and love and could recommend for any space,” she says. Pulling from that knowledge, Gibbons assembled a collection of 55 colors on a user-friendly website that includes images of each color in different lighting conditions and detailed descriptions that note undertones. - Source: Internet Windows aren’t required for a little dose of sunshine. Soft yellow is the perfect color for gently brightening a room as it’s eternally cheerful and vibrant. Guest bedrooms and even basement areas are ideal spaces for trying it out. A hue like this also means any room can really be a sun room. - Source: Internet So, you must be very particular when it comes to choosing the colour combination of your dream house especially the bedroom, the most personal space in your house. The colour combination in your bedroom walls are a direct reflection of your family’s personality, choosing and creating the right colour combination is one of the difficult processes for beginners. Wall paint colours come in different shades, and confusion is inevitable while deciding on the numerous shades available for a single colour. So, we suggest you some of the best two colour combination ideas for your bedroom walls and the exact paint colours to recreate it. - Source: Internet 03 of 06 Placing Samples Right Next to Each Other While you should definitely sample multiple color options, avoid painting the samples right next to each other on the same wall, advises Patrick O’Donnell, International Brand Ambassador at Farrow \u0026 Ball. “They will distract each other (and you!) and make it harder to make a clear choice,” he says. “If you don’t want to paint the area directly, paint the length of a large sheet of lining paper, and it becomes a movable feast that you can see on different walls in the same room and at different times of the day!” - Source: Internet Both natural and artificial lighting can affect the way paint colors look on your walls. As the sun makes its way across the sky from dawn until dusk, it changes the amount of natural light streaming through the rooms in your house. For this reason, it’s essential to consider natural light when you’re selecting a color for your space. Changing seasons can also cause alterations to the amount of natural light in a room. - Source: Internet Artificial lighting can also play a role in how paint colors look in both commercial and residential spaces. Artificial lighting like light bulbs can be used to supplement natural light or replace it entirely. Types of artificial lighting are: - Source: Internet Have you ever decided on a paint color, only to have it show up differently on the wall in your home? This phenomenon is a common one when it comes to painting interior walls with varying degrees of natural or artificial light.

The sensor then sends the results to the Color Muse app via Bluetooth, where you can see the closest matches from brands including Sherwin-Williams, Behr, Benjamin Moore and Valspar. The Color Muse does take a little more effort on your part, since you&rsquo;ll need to calibrate the device to make the most of its features. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Light is one of the biggest factors affecting how <strong>color</strong> translates on your wall. In a home improvement store, you&rsquo;re likely looking at a <strong>paint</strong> chip under a display lit by a strong fluorescent light &ndash; very different from the light in your home. Take that same <strong>paint</strong> chip home and it could look totally different. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The undertones of <strong>paint</strong> will peek through depending on the other <strong>color</strong>s in the room. If you have blue trim and decide on a gray with a blue undertone for your walls, you can expect more of that blue to show through in the gray <strong>paint</strong>. Sheen : Some finishes absorb light more than others, such as mattes, and look similar in most lighting. High glosses are very reflective, and their <strong>color</strong> will depend mainly on how much light is hitting them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Picking <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s and matching old <strong>paint</strong> isn&rsquo;t as hard as it used to be with apps and devices like these. You can browse through thousands of <strong>paint</strong>s from the comfort of your couch and throw them on your wall with the tap of a finger. Still, if you&rsquo;re wondering how a <strong>color</strong> is going to look on your wall, the time-tested approach of a <strong>paint</strong> sample is a surefire way to find out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Color translates to computer via a series of values. Knowing those values for the shade you need can help you navigate sensors and apps, and match <strong>color</strong> accurately across brands. The most common values for <strong>color</strong> are HEX, CMYK and RGB. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>All this <strong>color</strong> picking is manageable if you&rsquo;re <strong>paint</strong>ing a brand new or well-primed wall. Things get trickier when <strong>paint</strong> matching is your goal. Like clothes, car <strong>color</strong>s and photos hung in sunlight, <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s also fade over time. Even if you know a wall&rsquo;s original <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>, a new coat of <strong>paint</strong> might look off either because of <strong>color</strong> fading or loss of sheen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Picking the right <strong>paint</strong> can transform your space. Staring at rows of <strong>color</strong>s in your local home improvement store, it&rsquo;s easy to feel overwhelmed with choices. It&rsquo;s also easy to love a <strong>color</strong> in the store, but hate the way it turns out once it&rsquo;s on your wall. If you&rsquo;re trying to match an old <strong>color</strong>, it can get even more complicated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Unlike the branded apps from <strong>paint</strong> manufacturers, third-party apps sense <strong>color</strong> without trying to sell you a specific <strong>paint</strong>. The downside is that there aren&rsquo;t any branded <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s to choose from as results. You&rsquo;ll simply be able to identify the <strong>color</strong> value of the object or wall you&rsquo;re scanning. Once you&rsquo;ve got a <strong>color</strong> value, you can use that to find a matching <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>, likely by using the RGB value, as it is the most commonly used value in the <strong>paint</strong> industry. There are even online converters that will match <strong>color</strong> values to multiple <strong>paint</strong> brands. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Black : Black is created by mixing blue and brown together. Depending on the concentration of each <strong>color</strong>, black tones can be warm or cool. You can use black to add sophistication to any room or as a beautiful accent that will ground the rest of the <strong>color</strong> scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Paint My Wall is simplistic and easy to use. The app allows you to use their image to explore <strong>color</strong> options or upload your own image to test. Paint with your finger or use the smart fill to fill a wall completely. Download For: iOS - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&ldquo;Paint on walls fade over time and the sheen changes,&rdquo; Angela Kirkpatrick, a residential designer, notes. &ldquo;Even if you get a chunk of wall beside an outlet, it may not match the <strong>color</strong> and sheen in the middle of the wall where the TV was mounted. A difference in wall sheen can cause a <strong>color</strong> to look very different.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Light <strong>color</strong>s are great to utilize in a room with little natural light. Light <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s for small dark rooms are a quick and straightforward way to make a space feel airy. If your goal is to make your low-light room feel brighter, light <strong>color</strong>s are a great way to go. Light <strong>color</strong>s are some of the best <strong>color</strong>s for a dark bedroom, but you can utilize them in many spaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dark <strong>color</strong>s can make the corners in a room seem to blend together and open up a room. If you want to embrace the coziness of a dark room while expanding its look, dark <strong>color</strong>s may be the way to go. The best <strong>paint</strong> for dark rooms will make spaces feel cozy without feeling cramped, such as: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Typically electronic screens and monitors that emit light use RGB (red, green, blue) <strong>color</strong> values, while CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow and black) values are the standard for printed materials like newspapers and magazines, which absorb light. The hex method of valuing <strong>color</strong> is used to communicate RGB values in computer programming, such as HTML. Once you know you desired <strong>color</strong>&rsquo;s value, you&rsquo;ll be able to find it in nearly every medium out there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Choosing a <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong> used to mean spending an afternoon wandering the aisles of <strong>paint</strong> chip samples. The thousands of options in the rainbow-<strong>color</strong>ed rows can be a bit overwhelming, though, so we&rsquo;re happy to try anything that simplifies the <strong>color</strong> selection process. Thanks to a handful of smart designers and <strong>paint</strong> companies, there&rsquo;s now a better way to shop for <strong>paint</strong>. Take a look below at a few of our favorite tools and decide which is best for you and your next <strong>paint</strong> project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>McCormick Paints lets you choose a standard generic interior home image of a bedroom, hallway, kitchen or dining room and then change the <strong>color</strong> around on the walls. You can also upload your own photo to its Color Visualizer, which we suggest as that&rsquo;s ideally what you want to see, how <strong>paint</strong> looks in your own space. You can even add <strong>paint</strong> to trim, like window frames and doors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Meanwhile, using a high gloss <strong>paint</strong> for an accent wall creates a reflective surface that will allow the light your room receives to bounce around. Light-reflecting <strong>paint</strong> for dark rooms can make a space feel more breathable. Painting your trim in a high gloss that coordinates with the rest of your room can brighten it up and give an elegant sheen to any space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pastels and muted tones are always a good idea for brightening up a room in a <strong>color</strong>ful way. Sea foam and mint green are proof of this. They’re gentle tones that can contribute to a stylish and relaxed atmosphere but feel far more refreshing than a dark forest or olive green. Craft a faux headboard, <strong>paint</strong> the entirety of the wall, or create a patterned mural. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This app works on smartphones, both iOS and Android devices, and can help you virtually add <strong>paint</strong> to almost anything from a wall, to a piece of furniture. You start by taking a photo of the thing you hope to <strong>paint</strong>, and from there you can pick <strong>color</strong>s from 25 different brands from Benjamin Moore to Farrow and Ball. (A personal favorite.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sherwin-Williams offers an app called ColorSnap Match, that allows you to upload an existing photo or take a new photo to find <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s that match it. There&rsquo;s also a virtual <strong>paint</strong>ing tool, and multiple ways to explore all the Sherwin-Williams <strong>paint</strong> collections. The app includes RGB <strong>color</strong> values for Sherwin-Williams <strong>paint</strong>s, lists of coordinating <strong>color</strong>s for each <strong>paint</strong>, as well as the <strong>color</strong> strip you&rsquo;d find them on in a hardware store. The app is free and works on iOS and Android devices. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This app is actually computer based, meaning you&rsquo;re not going to download it to your smartphone. Instead, you start by using one of their sample photos, or uploading your own. Sherwin-Williams suggests you take one with good lighting so you can get the best sense of how <strong>color</strong> will look on the walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Your <strong>paint</strong>&rsquo;s finish or sheen also makes a difference in how <strong>color</strong> is perceived. A flat <strong>paint</strong> finish (like what you&rsquo;ll find on most <strong>paint</strong> chips) won&rsquo;t reflect as much light as a high-gloss sheen, so a flat finish tends to look a bit darker. Often, higher gloss finishes are good for bathrooms, kitchens and rooms that see more moisture. Flatter finishes work well in spaces like bedrooms and living rooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;ve ever been out and about and spotted <strong>color</strong> inspiration for your next project, this is the app for you; Color Capture puts the power of <strong>color</strong> matching in your pocket. Point and tap to take a picture of the <strong>color</strong> and Color Capture will match it. If you really want to try the <strong>color</strong> out on your own image before you use it, Benjamin Moore offers another app, called Color Portfolio designed to allow you to virtually try <strong>color</strong>s on your space before you buy them. Download For: iOS - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Shoreline Painting is a fully bonded, licensed and insured Fine Paints of Europe Master Certified Painter, which means we use only the finest <strong>paint</strong>ing tools and products available on the market today. For more than 35 years, Shoreline has provided both interior and exterior <strong>paint</strong>ing services for homes throughout Westchester County, NY, New York City and cities throughout Fairfield County, including Westport, Darien, Greenwich and New Canaan. Browse our portfolio of completed projects for examples of our superior artistry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Behr&rsquo;s ColorSmart app works much the same as the Sherwin-Williams app, with options to take new photos or upload existing ones. You can also view selected <strong>color</strong>s in generic scenes like kitchens or bathrooms. The free app works with both iOS and Android devices. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Just take a picture of a room or choose “live view,” and then search from the thousands of <strong>paint</strong> and stain options. Find a <strong>color</strong> you want to try and tap a surface in the image to apply the <strong>color</strong>. Project Color automatically adjusts for any shadows, angles or lighting variances so you can see how the <strong>color</strong> would look in that particular space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Unless your walls are being <strong>paint</strong>ed for the first time, a primer coat will be the first layer before the new <strong>color</strong> is applied in multiple coats. Otherwise, the first <strong>color</strong> may show through and impact the tone of the new <strong>paint</strong>. Undertones : The undertones of <strong>paint</strong> will peek through depending on the other <strong>color</strong>s in the room. If you have blue trim and decide on a gray with a blue undertone for your walls, you can expect more of that blue to show through in the gray <strong>paint</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you need more help, you can always work with a <strong>color</strong> consultant to help you find the perfect shade for your space. Paintzen offers free, remote <strong>color</strong> consultations with our trained team of Project Advisors. Just a quick phone call can help you get some incredible ideas for your next interior or exterior <strong>paint</strong>ing project. They can also share some insights from our interior designer partners, and can offer guidance for specific rooms in your home, like bathrooms or kitchens. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What we liked about this site&rsquo;s app was the fact that the actual <strong>paint</strong> swatches gave us the chip, <strong>color</strong> and number so we could order the exact <strong>color</strong> of <strong>paint</strong> if we chose. We also had options to look at all <strong>color</strong>s available, pick from a select palette, or even match <strong>color</strong>s from an existing photo. You can order your <strong>paint</strong> directly from the app too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best neutral <strong>paint</strong> for a dark room is one that will reflect light to brighten your space. Neutrals can be perfect accents for other <strong>color</strong>s, making them very versatile and able to fit into any room seamlessly. They can add warmth, and you can incorporate undertones and accents to create the mood and look that you want. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Finally, you can also purchase <strong>paint</strong> from The Home Depot directly in the app and never have to leave the house at all. (Not a bad option in today&rsquo;s environment.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Many major <strong>paint</strong> manufacturers have websites and apps designed to help you choose a <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>. Sherwin-Williams, Valspar and Behr all have websites with virtual design studios where you can try <strong>paint</strong> on in an uploaded photo of your space. It&rsquo;s not a perfect system by any means, and the <strong>color</strong> and light settings on your computer monitor or mobile device will affect how you see the <strong>color</strong>. Still, virtual <strong>paint</strong>ing is a good way to narrow down your choices and help you decide between different looks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some finishes absorb light more than others, such as mattes, and look similar in most lighting. High glosses are very reflective, and their <strong>color</strong> will depend mainly on how much light is hitting them. Porosity : Painting over porous surfaces can cause light <strong>color</strong>s to look streaky and allow dark <strong>color</strong>s to bleed through, but a quality primer can avoid this. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>White can be the best <strong>paint</strong> for indirect lighting because it is the most reflective. Every other <strong>color</strong> will absorb at least some of the spectrum, but neutrals will absorb the least amount of light. Some of our favorite <strong>color</strong>s for rooms with little natural light are: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Painting over porous surfaces can cause light <strong>color</strong>s to look streaky and allow dark <strong>color</strong>s to bleed through, but a quality primer can avoid this. Adjacent shades : Colors that are right next to each other on the wheel are adjacent. They can have a calming effect, especially compared to <strong>color</strong>s on the opposite sides of the wheel, which make <strong>color</strong>s appear more intense. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Morning sunlight in these rooms can produce subtle shadows, but evening light tends to make any <strong>color</strong> look warm and pleasant. North-facing rooms: Light in these spaces is bluish and cool. Bold <strong>color</strong>s are best used in north-facing rooms, as they usually show up more clearly than muted <strong>color</strong>s. On the other side of the spectrum, lighter <strong>color</strong>s in such a space tend to look subdued. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>These apps simplify that entire process by using digital technology, to virtually apply <strong>paint</strong> to whatever surface you choose: a wall or even the exterior of your home — all without cracking open a can of <strong>paint</strong>. While there are apps and devices that can help you match a <strong>color</strong> to a can of <strong>paint</strong>, these apps actually let you apply the <strong>paint</strong> directly to your wall. Some of these are from major <strong>paint</strong> companies, and clearly make use of their line of <strong>paint</strong>. Other are single apps you can download to your smartphone that can give you more of a sense of <strong>color</strong>. All, however, are free. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>05 of 06 Shying Away From Bold Hues According to Woelfel, one of the biggest mistakes people make when choosing <strong>paint</strong> is simply being afraid to decorate with <strong>color</strong>. Especially when you&rsquo;re selecting <strong>paint</strong> samples, don&rsquo;t shy away from a bolder hue. After all, Pantone&rsquo;s 2022 Color of the Year is a &ldquo;courageous&rdquo; shade of blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Finding the right <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s for low-light rooms can be a challenge. Every <strong>color</strong> will say something about your home and lifestyle, and you want to make sure the <strong>color</strong>s you choose will accomplish the look and feel you want. Some <strong>color</strong>s make spaces appear larger by making them brighter, and others will embrace the coziness and tranquility of a dark room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At $100, this <strong>color</strong> sensor isn&rsquo;t exactly cheap, but it could make life a lot easier for anyone matching multiple <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s. The pre-calibrated Nix Color Sensor Mini blocks out ambient light and uses a calibrated light source to read a surface&rsquo;s <strong>color</strong>. The sensor then sends that reading to your phone via Bluetooth and the Nix Paints or Nix Digital app, where you can match <strong>color</strong>s to a dozen different <strong>paint</strong> brands in the US and Canada. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Color Grab is a third-party app that identifies <strong>color</strong> in real time using your camera&rsquo;s viewfinder. Once you&rsquo;ve saved the <strong>color</strong>, you can view its profile, including the hex code, CMYK and RGB values. Color Grab can also match <strong>color</strong>s from photos in your phone&rsquo;s library. The app is free and works with Android devices. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pro tip: Colors vary by undertones. So, if you’re looking for teal, for example, check the blue and green <strong>paint</strong> families. Neutrals are especially tricky, so look for your perfect <strong>color</strong> in the white, gray, brown and even red <strong>paint</strong> families. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Light reflectance value (LRV) measures a <strong>color</strong>’s ability to reflect or absorb light. Black is the most absorbent <strong>color</strong> and so it is a zero on the LRV scale. Pure white, being the most reflective <strong>color</strong>, is at the other end of the scale at 100 because it doesn’t absorb light or warmth. Colors that fall below 50 on the LRV scale will absorb more light than they reflect. Shades above 50 help create a daytime look and add a feeling of expansion to a space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Have you ever tried to pick a <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong> online? Most of us find it a big enough challenge to do it with <strong>paint</strong> swatches in hand. But adding the online factor can make what should be a fun task seem darn near impossible. Thank goodness for technology, which has already figured this out for us. Here are some life-simplifying tools that’ll have you picking the right <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s online, without the decorating drama. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re ready to see exactly what a <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong> will look like on your walls, the ColorSnap® Visualizer makes it…well, a snap with Instant Paint! Using augmented reality (AR) technology, you can upload your pictures and see how <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s will look in your space. You can save these pictures to create your own custom palettes, save your favorite <strong>color</strong>s, mix and match, and even share your pictures on social media. Facebook poll, anyone? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re on your laptop or computer and see the perfect inspiration for your <strong>paint</strong>, the ColorSnap® App has a plugin for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari called the Snap It Button. Just choose an image and immediately see the Sherwin Williams <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s that match the <strong>color</strong> in the picture. Just go to www.snapyour<strong>color</strong>s.com and install the button to your browser’s toolbar. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Colors that are right next to each other on the wheel are adjacent. They can have a calming effect, especially compared to <strong>color</strong>s on the opposite sides of the wheel, which make <strong>color</strong>s appear more intense. Placement: Colors can make a room feel small and cozy or large and open. Some <strong>color</strong>s can make an already large room feel vast, or a cozy room feel cramped. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are limitations on the number of areas you can try the virtual <strong>paint</strong> process on in a room. In one kitchen, for example, we could <strong>paint</strong> some cabinets, not all. But the app is certainly fun to play with, and a decent starting point if you&rsquo;re a Sherwin-Williams fan. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Australian company Palette released Pico in 2018. The $80 <strong>paint</strong>-matching device sequentially bursts red, green and blue light onto the surface you scan. It then shares those results via Bluetooth in your smartphone&rsquo;s Pico app. Pico reports the RGB values and matching branded <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Light blues : Light blues are very serene <strong>color</strong>s that create a relaxing feeling. They can open up a room beautifully and are great for pairing with undertones in <strong>color</strong>s such as beige. Blues are beautiful in spaces where you want to promote relaxation, such as bedrooms and bathrooms. Blue <strong>color</strong>s for a dark living room can also be welcoming and relaxing for guests. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Home Harmony is the perfect all-in-one tool for designing a room or exterior. Choose a new <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong> and test it or choose new flooring to try. The app is easy to use and makes switching between <strong>paint</strong> brands such as Behr a breeze. Download For: iOS - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gray should be in every minimalist’s back pocket. This <strong>color</strong> is grounding and takes the edge off an all-white space. Lighter than related shades on the <strong>color</strong> wheel (like charcoal), it won’t completely darken a room. It’s a great cooler neutral that toes the line between cozy and airy. Darker decor items will also pop against the shade, making it seem brighter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In this way, you’ll quickly sort out the <strong>color</strong>s that don’t fit your criteria. And once you’ve found your <strong>color</strong>, the <strong>color</strong> visualizer will email you your <strong>color</strong> choice and the <strong>color</strong>ized room image. Then, you can share it with family and friends to get kudos for your excellent design taste. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Painting a home is a lengthy job. Aside from the work of actually putting <strong>paint</strong> on the walls, you have to test out which <strong>color</strong> feels right to you. That often means heading down to a store, getting samples, <strong>paint</strong>ing those on to a surface and waiting to see if the drying <strong>color</strong> suits you or not. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Using a matte <strong>color</strong> for an accent wall will create a stable focal point that looks similar in most forms of lighting. Matte <strong>color</strong>s make a flat, even surface of <strong>color</strong> that attracts the eye when you walk into the room. In a living room, walls with a fireplace are excellent for matte walls. If you have a dining room or other space with columns or other eye-catching structural pieces, that would be a great place for a matte finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With more than 3,500 <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s to choose from, having the opportunity visualize them in your space before you <strong>paint</strong> is a good idea. You can explore <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong> combinations with the sample room designs provided or upload your own photo to use as a canvas. With the upload option, you can define up to five surfaces to <strong>paint</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Light in these spaces is bluish and cool. Bold <strong>color</strong>s are best used in north-facing rooms, as they usually show up more clearly than muted <strong>color</strong>s. On the other side of the spectrum, lighter <strong>color</strong>s in such a space tend to look subdued. South-facing rooms: Since the sun pours into these rooms from a high position in the sky, lighter <strong>color</strong>s will glow while darker hues appear brighter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This app not only allows you to explore all of Sherwin Williams&rsquo; <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s, ColorSnap also gives you the ability to create your own <strong>color</strong> palette. Choose a <strong>color</strong> you like and see coordinating <strong>color</strong>s and similar <strong>color</strong>s to take it to the next level. See the <strong>color</strong> you chose in living rooms, kitchens, and more, then take your app with you to a store to pick up your <strong>paint</strong>. Download For: iOS Android - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>These bulbs amplify blues and greens by generating cool, blue light. They also tend to mute warmer <strong>color</strong>s. Soft white fluorescent: These bulbs generate a warm, yellow light that can have a fading effect on all <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>These rooms are great for yellows, oranges and reds. East light is warm and yellow-hued before noon and turns bluer later. West-facing rooms: Morning sunlight in these rooms can produce subtle shadows, but evening light tends to make any <strong>color</strong> look warm and pleasant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Taupe acts similarly to light gray. It’s not as in-your-face as an icy white, but it’s not a dim <strong>color</strong> either. You can completely coat walls in the shade of your choice, or take a page out of this home’s book and create a half-and-half look with white. The proportions seen here not only make the space look bright, but taller, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although this shares the same name as the tool from McCormick Paints, we found this Color Visualizer one much more simple to use. You select from a number of standard images, a bedroom, kitchen or even the exterior or your home, for example, and then start applying <strong>color</strong> swatches. You can, here, also upload your own image to get a sense of how <strong>paint</strong> will play in your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It would be wrong to not include this classic in the list. While it’s an obvious pick, there’s a reason why it’s such a popular <strong>color</strong> for rooms of every purpose. White is inherently bright and reflects light like no other. It might seem basic, but there are numerous hues with different undertones that’ll give you different results. A warmer white can feel welcoming, and something with blue or green undertones could appeal to your hope for something more refreshing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>02 of 06 Not Considering the Furniture & Decor Avoid testing swatches in a completely empty room. Even if you just moved in or want to empty the room before you start <strong>paint</strong>ing, keeping some furniture and decor in the room as you select a <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong> will ensure the hue works with the other <strong>color</strong>s in the space. &ldquo;We always recommend <strong>paint</strong>ing a small board or piece of foam core and evaluating the <strong>color</strong> in different parts of the room and throughout the day,&rdquo; says Andrea Magno, Director of Color Marketing and Development for Benjamin Moore. &ldquo;This will enable you to see how the <strong>color</strong> looks with consideration of the light (both natural and artificial) and other surroundings (such as artwork, furniture, etc.), ensuring that you&rsquo;ll love the <strong>color</strong> in all scenarios,&rdquo; she explains. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Call her a revolutionary with a roller. Interior designer Nicole Gibbons has started Clare, a <strong>paint</strong> company that simplifies the often overwhelming process of choosing a <strong>color</strong>. &ldquo;Decorators don&rsquo;t have 3,000 favorite <strong>color</strong>s. They have a short list they know and love and could recommend for any space,&rdquo; she says. Pulling from that knowledge, Gibbons assembled a collection of 55 <strong>color</strong>s on a user-friendly website that includes images of each <strong>color</strong> in different lighting conditions and detailed descriptions that note undertones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Windows aren’t required for a little dose of sunshine. Soft yellow is the perfect <strong>color</strong> for gently brightening a room as it’s eternally cheerful and vibrant. Guest bedrooms and even basement areas are ideal spaces for trying it out. A hue like this also means any room can really be a sun room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So, you must be very particular when it comes to choosing the colour combination of your dream house especially the bedroom, the most personal space in your house. The colour combination in your bedroom walls are a direct reflection of your family’s personality, choosing and creating the right colour combination is one of the difficult processes for beginners. Wall <strong>paint</strong> colours come in different shades, and confusion is inevitable while deciding on the numerous shades available for a single colour. So, we suggest you some of the best two colour combination ideas for your bedroom walls and the exact <strong>paint</strong> colours to recreate it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>03 of 06 Placing Samples Right Next to Each Other While you should definitely sample multiple <strong>color</strong> options, avoid <strong>paint</strong>ing the samples right next to each other on the same wall, advises Patrick O&rsquo;Donnell, International Brand Ambassador at Farrow & Ball. &ldquo;They will distract each other (and you!) and make it harder to make a clear choice,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to <strong>paint</strong> the area directly, <strong>paint</strong> the length of a large sheet of lining paper, and it becomes a movable feast that you can see on different walls in the same room and at different times of the day!&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Both natural and artificial lighting can affect the way <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s look on your walls. As the sun makes its way across the sky from dawn until dusk, it changes the amount of natural light streaming through the rooms in your house. For this reason, it’s essential to consider natural light when you’re selecting a <strong>color</strong> for your space. Changing seasons can also cause alterations to the amount of natural light in a room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Artificial lighting can also play a role in how <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>s look in both commercial and residential spaces. Artificial lighting like light bulbs can be used to supplement natural light or replace it entirely. Types of artificial lighting are: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Have you ever decided on a <strong>paint</strong> <strong>color</strong>, only to have it show up differently on the wall in your home? This phenomenon is a common one when it comes to <strong>paint</strong>ing interior walls with varying degrees of natural or artificial light. Some rooms in our homes get less natural light than others due to their positioning, the number of windows and doors and the tone of the artificial lights. Powder rooms, hallways and basements, for instance, usually have less natural light than other parts of a house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://theinspiredroom.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/curtains-and-nail-hangers.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="See Paint Color In A Room - Color Visualizer">
