Add a few drops of water to your baking soda to create a paste, then apply that paste to your showerhead and let sit for at least an hour. Rinse thoroughly with hot water for at least 5 minutes to remove the baking soda and any stubborn deposits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most manufacturers list the <strong>cleaning</strong> instructions and recommended timeline in the manual.

Next, slowly add your cup of white <strong>vinegar</strong> to the bag and watch this mixture fizz. Please be sure to do this step over the sink to avoid unnecessary splatter. You may also want to have a few clean towels nearby. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://www.newlifeonahomestead.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shower_cleaner_recipes_pinterest-683x1024.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Cleaning Shower Heads With Vinegar And Baking Soda - Clean Shower Head Baking Soda">
