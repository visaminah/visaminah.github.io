So we’re going to share some of the top exterior color trends for 2021 to give you a little bit of inspiration and design ideas to get you the home of your dreams. - Source: Internet As far as exterior siding options go, these are all great options depending on your specific needs.

Thinking of painting your red bricks on your house? Why not try black? Black brick is so timeless and won’t wear and get dirty like a white brick wall. And it can work with your pale blue siding, dark blue siding, and even beige. Black accents are one of the hottest trends we’ve seen in the last few years and it isn’t going anywhere. - Source: Internet Before we talk about real wood siding, we would be remiss not to mention engineered wood siding. Engineered wood is made up of a little bit of real wood, wood scraps, sawdust, and other wood-like materials to build a solid and durable material that looks and feels like the real thing. Engineered wood is very easy to install; it’s also a lot more cost-effective and is an incredible alternative to real wood, which requires quite a bit of maintenance and upkeep. So for an easier option, engineered wood is great. It is susceptible to moisture seepage and water damage, but the proper installation and keeping a close eye on it can help prevent any catastrophic damage. - Source: Internet Brick, beautiful brick. Did you know that a brick house can actually cool a home better and faster than its framed and siding counterparts? It’s an amazing insulator and can drastically improve a home’s energy efficiency. Not only that, but the aesthetic of a brick or brick veneer house is timeless as can be. It will always be in style and always have that sense of longevity and strength. - Source: Internet Board and batten is often used as an accent piece but can also work great as full siding if you want to take the time and effort to do so. It’s unique that it is installed vertically (the boards) with smaller pieces of wood or boards to cover each seam (the batten). You may have seen board and batten used for half walls on home interiors, but it’s definitely also used for exterior siding. - Source: Internet Steel siding won’t fade like vinyl, and you also have more colors to choose from. You can now get dark greys or greens without worrying about it losing color as the siding ages. Steel is also very energy efficient as it actually reflects radiant heat, and it can be recycled, making it a very environmentally friendly option. - Source: Internet Composite siding is manufactured using plastic and other recyclable materials and is designed to look like regular vinyl or wood siding but with added benefits. Composite siding is an effective alternative to standard vinyl siding and is also more eco-friendly. It’s safely treated to resist mold, fire, and insects and will biodegrade in landfills. Composite siding is also very low maintenance but does require occasional cleaning: a soft wash of gentle soap and water can bring your composite siding back to looking as good as new. - Source: Internet Board and batten can be much more expensive than other siding options such as vinyl. Because it requires quite a bit of wood pieces and is a much more complex installation process, both material and labor costs can go up if you choose to do your whole home. However, depending on the type of wood used and if it is treated, your siding could last 25+ years which pays off in the long run. - Source: Internet On the complete opposite side of dark blue, is pale blue. Pale blue works beautifully with green or white accents. It can even be paired with black or dark blue trims and soffit to give a bold look but maintaining a less risky color on your exterior siding. If you want a color that isn’t white or beige but still has a pop of color, pale blue is an ideal choice. - Source: Internet Cedar siding is a beautiful way to use wood that has a unique look with benefits to match. Cedar is super lightweight, and this makes for easy installation as well as insulation. Cedar does a great job at naturally keeping cool air inside during the warm months and cold air outside in the cold months. It is highly durable and can be customized with exterior paint, and can be treated or untreated: both work well. - Source: Internet Yes, brown, is trending. Some people’s first reaction to brown siding might be “gross”, but leaning more towards a bronze color can lighten up that brown and give it a gorgeous woodsy look, without completely going to the dark side. Bronze gives almost a slight gold tint to your home and works great for homes surrounded by a lot of shrubbery and landscaping. Pair it with black and white accents, and you have a very modern look. - Source: Internet Fiber cement siding is quite common and is actually manufactured using many of the same materials as stone veneer: Portland cement, sand, and cellulose. It comes in many different colors and can even be manufactured to imitate real wood. Some of the biggest benefits of fiber cement siding are that it won’t rot, it won’t fade from the sun’s UV rays, and it’s impervious to those pesky termites or other insects that can penetrate and affect real wood siding. Plus, if you need a refresh over time, it can be easily refinished or painted over. That’s about the only maintenance required to keep fiber cement siding in tip-top shape. - Source: Internet Advantages of clapboard siding include its sustainability, natural weathered look, and the customizations available. Clapboard can be made of most woods including pine, cedar, oak, and spruce, and can be painted or stained any way you like. Some people also choose to do the charred method of burning wood called Shou Sugi Ban, which gives the boards a beautiful black color that helps wood last for upwards of 80 years. - Source: Internet Corrugated metals are sheets of metal that have gone through a roll former that creates those shapes or corrugated lines giving the sheets both texture and dimension. The benefits of corrugated metals for siding include its extreme durability that can withstand the elements from severe storms. It’s also resistant to fire, water, and pests such as termites. Metal siding is also very low maintenance but can last up to 50 years or more! - Source: Internet Seamless steel siding is a very cool choice if you want a literally seamless look to your home’s new siding. Seamless steel siding is designed and cut to fit the exact length you need. There won’t ever be a break where two pieces meet, except for the corners of your home. Seamless steel siding is designed to have a wood grain look but with the added benefits of steel. - Source: Internet As we shift onto darker colors on this list, dark gray is one that we absolutely love to see trending. Modern home builds are popping up everywhere in darker shades of gray that give it such a robust, elegant appeal. Dark gray is perfect if you want to combine it with other lighter colors to create dimension. It works with almost any color of door, trim, and deck. A natural wooden porch with dark gray siding is absolutely gorgeous. - Source: Internet The one downfall of a brick house is that the mortar, as with any mortared material, may deteriorate over time. But it will almost always be at the joint, and it’s nothing a mason can’t mortar and fix in no time. On the other hand, Brick veneer is a much less costly material but gives the same aesthetic as the real thing. But similar to stone veneer, it can never truly meet the expectations of real brick but can work great as an accent to other types of siding. - Source: Internet Aluminum siding is not as common as some of these other types of siding, but it is a great option if you want something affordable and different from what you’re used to seeing. Its rust resistance has made it a choice option for homeowners living in coastal regions, but it can be used just about anywhere. It’s very low maintenance and can get a new coat of paint if you ever want to give it a boost. But otherwise, it does come with a few offsets, such as being susceptible to dents and dings, and it can be a little noisy as it expands and contracts or especially during a rain or hail storm. - Source: Internet Once you have your home siding choices locked in, now it’s time to choose a contractor to install it! While picking your house siding options might have seemed like an important decision, choosing a contractor is arguably more important. The reason for this is because the installation will determine the longevity and effectiveness of your siding. This is why we always encourage homeowners to do plenty of research to ensure they are picking a quality contractor to trust with their home. - Source: Internet To begin started, here are some tips for finding information about 13 House Siding Options Compared | Materials, Colors \u0026 More:\r- Research Types Of House Siding And Cost-related information from credible sources.

A natural wooden porch with dark gray <strong>siding</strong> is absolutely gorgeous. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The one downfall of a brick house is that the mortar, as with any mortared material, may deteriorate over time. But it will almost always be at the joint, and it’s nothing a mason can’t mortar and fix in no time. On the other hand, Brick veneer is a much less costly material but gives the same aesthetic as the real thing. But similar to stone veneer, it can never truly meet the expectations of real brick but can work great as an accent to other <strong>types</strong> of <strong>siding</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Aluminum <strong>siding</strong> is not as common as some of these other <strong>types</strong> of <strong>siding</strong>, but it is a great option if you want something affordable and different from what you’re used to seeing. Its rust resistance has made it a choice option for homeowners living in coastal regions, but it can be used just about anywhere. It’s very low maintenance and can get a new coat of paint if you ever want to give it a boost. But otherwise, it does come with a few offsets, such as being susceptible to dents and dings, and it can be a little noisy as it expands and contracts or especially during a rain or hail storm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once you have your home <strong>siding</strong> choices locked in, now it’s time to choose a contractor to install it! While picking your house <strong>siding</strong> options might have seemed like an important decision, choosing a contractor is arguably more important. The reason for this is because the installation will determine the longevity and effectiveness of your <strong>siding</strong>. This is why we always encourage homeowners to do plenty of research to ensure they are picking a quality contractor to trust with their home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ac/11/33/ac1133f3d3233b18aeede0407596131e.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Types Of Siding Styles For Homes - Old House Siding Types">
