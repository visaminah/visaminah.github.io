Start by filling a gallon-size plastic bag with <strong>vinegar</strong>. Place your <strong>shower</strong> head in the bag and secure the bag to the <strong>shower</strong> arm with a sturdy rubber band or some heavy-duty tape or string. Make sure that the entire <strong>shower</strong> head is submerged in <strong>vinegar</strong>, adding more if necessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Don’t wait until your <strong>shower</strong> head is completely clogged. Clean the fitting regularly with just a little soap and a moist cloth, then rinse off and wipe dry. As you rinse the <strong>shower</strong> head, Choh-Lee recommends to “sweep the nozzles using your fingers, applying light pressure. Always speed clean while the water is running so that limescale is rinsed directly out of the nozzles.” This method works particularly well for plumbing fixtures made of brass and nickel, which are sensitive to acids and harsh cleaners. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Scrubbing a <strong>shower</strong> head is a relatively quick step in a deep bathroom cleaning routine, and you don’t need to do it daily or even weekly. If a <strong>shower</strong> head is scrubbed every month or so, it is unlikely to develop heavy deposit buildup in the first place. This method is suitable for cleaning stationary heads that attach to a <strong>shower</strong> arm as well as handheld <strong>shower</strong> heads. It does require removing the head itself, which is simple to do. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As we recently learned from the editors at PureWow, there&rsquo;s actually a very straightforward way to clean your <strong>shower</strong>head: baking soda and <strong>vinegar</strong>. As the article explains (and you perhaps recall from high school chemistry class), combining baking soda—a base—with white <strong>vinegar</strong>—an acid—creates a chemical reaction. In this instance of chemical magic, the combination helps to dissolve calcium deposits that build up from hard water in a process known as &ldquo;descaling.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The amount of time to soak a <strong>shower</strong> head in <strong>vinegar</strong> will depend on how clogged it is. Laugen says if it’s only slightly clogged, you can soak it for about 1-2 hours. If your <strong>shower</strong>head is dirtier or you haven’t cleaned it in a while, you’ll want to soak it in <strong>vinegar</strong> for about 3-4 hours. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;To clean a <strong>shower</strong>head without <strong>vinegar</strong>, simply mix baking soda with warm water to create a thick paste,&rsquo; says Karl Huckerby, CEO, Spare and Square (opens in new tab). &lsquo;Specific measurements aren’t necessary, but ensure that the paste is thick enough and not watery. If it’s too watery, add more baking soda, and if it’s too dry, add more water.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Untie the bag and remove it from the <strong>shower</strong>head. Pour the <strong>vinegar</strong> down the drain. Turn on the <strong>shower</strong>head and run hot water for a couple of minutes to rinse off the <strong>vinegar</strong> and loosened grime. Then wipe clean with a damp rag or paper towel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Vinegar allows you to remove mineral deposits and hard water stains without having to disconnect the whole system. Instead of going for harsh and expensive chemicals that may damage your <strong>shower</strong> head and endanger your health, use <strong>vinegar</strong>. Here are ways of cleaning it: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s common for gunk and grime to build up in the nozzles and block the flow of water making this a good place to start the cleaning process. Start by mixing baking-soda and water to form a thick paste. Apply the paste across the surface of the <strong>shower</strong> head, covering each nozzle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If the limescale buildup is really bad, you may want to go the extra mile (with minimal effort). To tackle stubborn deposits, simply add a few tablespoons of baking soda to the <strong>vinegar</strong> before soaking your <strong>shower</strong> head. The natural abrasive will help open clogged passages. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Use your white <strong>vinegar</strong> cleaning solution to break down soap scum, mold, and dirt in your bathtub. Spray it liberally around your bathtub and <strong>shower</strong> walls, let it sit for several minutes, and wipe it down with a sponge or soft cloth. For more cleaning power, add a tablespoon of dish soap to your <strong>vinegar</strong> solution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It&rsquo;s easy to see how cleaning your <strong>shower</strong> head can become an afterthought. Mostly because, unlike dirty bathtubs, <strong>shower</strong> heads do not readily show you just how filthy they are on the inside. Mineral deposits and organic matter build up over time and can clog the holes preventing an even flow of water. If you are noticing a sudden decrease in water pressure or irregular spray patterns, then it is likely your <strong>shower</strong> head could use a good soak. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Think back to the last time that you cleaned your bathroom. You probably scrubbed the toilet, wiped down the tile, mopped the floors, and cleaned the sinks. Did you touch your <strong>shower</strong> head? For the majority of us, that answer is no. But here&rsquo;s why that needs to change. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Tie the bag around the neck of the <strong>shower</strong>head with a hair tie, rubber band, or string. Slowly let go and make sure the bag is secured in place so it doesn’t fall or leak <strong>vinegar</strong> all over. Double-check that the <strong>shower</strong>head is still fully submerged in the <strong>vinegar</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>White <strong>vinegar</strong> is one of the most effective cleaning agents you can use for cleaning your <strong>shower</strong> head. The acids in <strong>vinegar</strong> naturally break down limescale, rust, and other mineral deposits that have accumulated over time. Vinegar, therefore, should be your number one friend when it comes to cleaning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A study by the University of Colorado Boulder discovered that an alarming 30% of <strong>shower</strong> heads showed significant levels of Mycobacterium Avium, a pathogen linked with pulmonary disease. It was also found that Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia favors the black gunk that can gather around <strong>shower</strong> heads and taps, a bacillus causing infections in growing frequency. Turning on your hot <strong>shower</strong> disperses these microbes into the air and makes them more easily inhaled. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Leave the <strong>shower</strong>head to soak in the <strong>vinegar</strong> for an hour. This is the best way to clean a <strong>shower</strong>head because the <strong>vinegar</strong> can work to break down any limescale that has built up. You can leave the <strong>shower</strong>head to soak for up to two hours if you feel your <strong>shower</strong>head is in need of a more thorough clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Polish the <strong>shower</strong>head with a soft microfiber cloth. Buff and dry the <strong>shower</strong>head to remove any water spots and your <strong>shower</strong>head will be sparkly clean again. Even if you thought it was fairly clean before, you’ll be shocked at how much better it looks after a quick cleaning and polishing! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you have a <strong>shower</strong> head with flexible rubber holes, you can take a shortcut and simply massage each of those nozzles with your finger. This will dislodge the debris sufficiently enough to give you good stream flow. You can also try using an old toothbrush on the holes if massaging them doesn&rsquo;t do enough to remedy the problem. This, however, is just a short-term solution. To clean it more thoroughly, you will need to use something a bit more heavy duty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Shower doors get super-gunky, but they’re also one bathroom glass surface you can rinse without making a mess. Add a few drops of dish soap to your <strong>vinegar</strong> and water spray for testy <strong>shower</strong> door grunge. Although soap can leave residue, you can rinse it with the <strong>shower</strong> head after cleaning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Soaking a <strong>shower</strong> head involves submerging it in an acidic solution—often, white <strong>vinegar</strong> is used, as it’s inexpensive and nontoxic. Vinegar, a natural cleaner, will dissolve the hard water stains and deposits that can collect on <strong>shower</strong> heads and in their spray nozzles. However, it can take a day or longer to dissolve the deposits with <strong>vinegar</strong>, so if you’re in a hurry, try using a cleaner specifically for removing hard water stains, such as Bring It On Hard Water Removing Cleaner (available from Amazon), to speed up the process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bleach can be a harsh substance (especially on your eyes/nose/throat via fumes and clothes if you have a spill), and chlorine can potentially stain stainless steel. But if you want to clean your <strong>shower</strong> head with bleach, Laugen recommends choosing a diluted household bleach. And because it contains strong chemicals, she says to consider wearing gloves when handling bleach and to be cautious of touching your face, hair, or clothes when using it. You should also try to keep the door and any windows open to maintain good ventilation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Soak several paper towels in <strong>vinegar</strong> to clean the nasty buildup around the toilet bowl edge. Stuff them around the edges so that they stick in place. Let them sit for a few hours before scrubbing down the toilet bowl. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Here’s the quick step-by-step process for cleaning your <strong>shower</strong>head without harsh chemicals. There are tips out there that say to remove your <strong>shower</strong>head from the pipe, but that’s completely unnecessary. This is the BEST way to clean your <strong>shower</strong>head without removing it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The common factor in all of these are the water. Unfortunately, there is no getting around it. Whether you are using city water or well water, there are going to be small things on the microscopic level that get through. And for the most part it is harmless, as long as we are making sure that we regularly clean our <strong>shower</strong> heads. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This whole process is pretty simple and—dare we admit it—a little fun. Hoorah, your <strong>shower</strong>head looks like a million bucks. But what if it still isn&rsquo;t spraying like it used to? See our tips on how to do a deep clean of your <strong>shower</strong>head. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The nice thing about using the soaking method to clean a <strong>shower</strong> head is that you can remove the <strong>shower</strong> head and submerge it in the <strong>vinegar</strong> or cleaner and then go about your other daily tasks as the liquid works to dissolve the deposits. Avoid using harsh cleaners that are not suitable for use on chrome, however. Some types of rust and lime deposit-removing cleaners (and toilet-bowl cleaners) will permanently mar chrome. So, check the product to see if it’s suitable for use on chrome before soaking the <strong>shower</strong> head. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bonus: use a mixture of baking soda and white <strong>vinegar</strong>: You can step up the above method by mixing the <strong>vinegar</strong> with baking soda. This creates a reaction that causes the <strong>vinegar</strong> to rapidly bubble up and form carbonic acid, an excellent natural cleaning agent that will get the debris right off the <strong>shower</strong> head. To use, add baking soda to either method mentioned above. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The period you’ll soak depends on how bad the blockage appears. The more damage it has, the longer it should stay in the <strong>vinegar</strong>. If you don’t have enough time to wait or if the <strong>shower</strong>head is metallic, you can put the pot on heat and mix the <strong>vinegar</strong> for about fifteen minutes. If the <strong>shower</strong>head is brassy or has a gold or nickel finishing, take it out after only thirty minutes. You are allowed to clean it again with the <strong>vinegar</strong> after rinsing it off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Note though that the need to soak the <strong>shower</strong>head in <strong>vinegar</strong> will be less frequent if you keep on top of cleaning the <strong>shower</strong>head regularly when cleaning the bathroom. ‘Deep cleaning should be seen as the last option, and you should start with less aggressive methods first,&rsquo; says Paul. &lsquo;Start off by absorbing as much contaminate as possible with kitchen roll, then rinse with lots of hot water.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you notice clogged holes or a strange spray pattern, the time to clean your <strong>shower</strong>head is now.

And in between, you can sanitize your <strong>shower</strong>head during your weekly bathroom cleaning with a spritz of <strong>vinegar</strong>-based cleaner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>White <strong>vinegar</strong> won’t stain surfaces like balsamic or red wine <strong>vinegar</strong>.

Cleaning <strong>vinegar</strong> is a potent white <strong>vinegar</strong> you can dilute to your preference, but you’ll most likely have your standard distilled white <strong>vinegar</strong> on hand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After an hour, untie the plastic bag and remove the <strong>shower</strong>head. Turn the <strong>shower</strong> on to flush out any remaining <strong>vinegar</strong> and residue. If there&rsquo;s a lot of residue left sitting on the head, wipe away with a microfibre cloth or go back in with the toothbrush. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pour the <strong>vinegar</strong> into a plastic bag and tie it to the <strong>shower</strong> head: This method is relatively simple and used for when you don’t want to remove your <strong>shower</strong> head completely. Slip a rubber band around your <strong>shower</strong> head and then fill a plastic bag with enough white <strong>vinegar</strong> to fully submerge it.

If you’re not fond of the <strong>vinegar</strong> smell, spray the <strong>shower</strong> head (and the <strong>shower</strong> walls) with a daily <strong>shower</strong> spray, such as Scrub Free Clean Shower Daily (available from Amazon). This type of cleaner creates a protective film that repels hard water deposits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Have drips fixed. A drippy <strong>shower</strong> head is much more likely to develop hard water deposits where the water is leaking out. If it’s an old <strong>shower</strong> head that is cracked and won’t stop dripping, it’s time to replace the <strong>shower</strong> head. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A drippy <strong>shower</strong> head is much more likely to develop hard water deposits where the water is leaking out. If it’s an old <strong>shower</strong> head that is cracked and won’t stop dripping, it’s time to replace the <strong>shower</strong> head. Install a water softener.

Rinse the <strong>shower</strong>head well afterward. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Mix an equal amount of water and <strong>vinegar</strong> and put in a plastic bag.

Just pour distilled white <strong>vinegar</strong> inside (I keep a big jug of cleaning <strong>vinegar</strong> around because it can be used for so many things!). Be careful not to overfill the bag, or it could overflow when you submerge the <strong>shower</strong>head. Just make sure you have enough <strong>vinegar</strong> in the bag to completely cover the <strong>shower</strong>head. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you have dish soap handy, Laugen says you can DIY a cleaning solution that will eliminate soap scum on your <strong>shower</strong> head. Combine ½ cup of dish soap and 1 ½ cups of distilled white <strong>vinegar</strong> and mix it well in a spray bottle. Spray the solution onto the <strong>shower</strong>head and let it sit for about an hour, and then use a small toothbrush to scrub the <strong>shower</strong>head. If there’s still residue, repeat the process. Laugen notes this process is best for lighter jobs; if your <strong>shower</strong>head is really clogged, you might want to soak it instead of spraying and scrubbing over and over. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you mix equal parts <strong>vinegar</strong> and warm water in an empty spray bottle, you have an all-purpose solution for nearly every bathroom surface. Add a few drops of essential oil for a fragrant boost to cover the <strong>vinegar</strong> smell. Some oils, like tea tree oil, also offer antimicrobial qualities. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Showering should be more of an “ahhh” than an “ugh” experience. That’s why you should know how to clean a <strong>shower</strong> head, as a dirty, clogged-up fixture can make what is supposed to be a relaxing experience the exact opposite. The telltale sign of a <strong>shower</strong> head gone AWOL is sputtering water. “Limescale buildup in your <strong>shower</strong> head can reduce the water flow in your <strong>shower</strong> and even block the nozzles completely,” says Theresa Choh-Lee, brand leader of GROHE, which manufactures complete bathroom solutions and kitchen fittings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A filter screen is important to a <strong>shower</strong> head as it catches large pieces of residue from reaching the <strong>shower</strong> nozzles. However, it can become clogged up the longer it’s left uncleaned. It can be accessed by unscrewing the <strong>shower</strong> head from the hose and then removed carefully using a pair of pliers or tweezers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cleaning with <strong>vinegar</strong> in the bathroom makes an overwhelming chore as easy as possible. With these <strong>vinegar</strong> cleaning tips, you’ll have no problem enjoying better results with less work and fewer chemical fumes. And for those times when you need a little extra help, you can lean on Anita’s! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Taking a nice, hot <strong>shower</strong> is one of the great simple joys in life. But if your water stops flowing freely, the mere idea of <strong>shower</strong>ing might stop you cold! Luckily, there&rsquo;s a quick and easy fix for improving your water flow and pressure: All you have to do is clean your <strong>shower</strong> head! If you&rsquo;ve never done this before, it may seem like a daunting task. But we can tell you how to clean a <strong>shower</strong> head in just a few easy steps. It really is so simple—we promise! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The simplest method for removing mild scale buildup from a <strong>shower</strong> head is to scrub it. This works well for <strong>shower</strong> heads that are slightly dirty or those that have hard water stains starting to form on the face where the water holes are located. Scrubbing is just like it sounds—it involves using a cleaner that helps dissolve deposits and a small scrubber with nylon bristles that can get at the tiny nooks and crannies on the face of the <strong>shower</strong> head. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Soaking can be used by itself or in conjunction with the previous scrubbing method. In addition, the soaking process can be used without removing the <strong>shower</strong> head from the <strong>shower</strong> arm, if desired. Soaking a head in place is best suited for removing only mild deposits. For heavier deposits, it’s best to remove the <strong>shower</strong> head, soak it, and then follow up using the scrubbing method. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fortunately, cleaning a <strong>shower</strong>head is relatively easy and doesn’t require any complicated products — you probably have several of them at home already.

Whether you prefer <strong>vinegar</strong>, baking soda, soap, cola, or bleach, get ready to have a bright and shiny <strong>shower</strong> head. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Of all the things you clean in your bathroom, your <strong>shower</strong>head may not automatically be at the top of the list — after all, you never touch it, and it’s supposed to clean you. But it’s important to regularly clean your <strong>shower</strong> head because the constant warm, moist environment can lead to mildew or bacteria growth. If you live in a place with hard water, you can also get mineral build-up that clogs up your <strong>shower</strong> head, which can affect your water pressure, and no one enjoys <strong>shower</strong>ing when the water is barely trickling out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To clean your <strong>shower</strong> head with bleach, combine one cup of bleach with two cups of water into a spray bottle. Tightly secure the cap and shake the bottle to combine the two ingredients. Spray your <strong>shower</strong> head with the solution and let it sit for about 30 minutes. Then use a small toothbrush or microfiber cloth to wipe down the <strong>shower</strong>head, and if there’s still limescale or mineral residue on the <strong>shower</strong>head, repeat until it’s clean. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Installing a water softener is an excellent idea if your home has naturally hard water. Not only will it help keep <strong>shower</strong> heads clear, but it will also prolong the useful life of your dishwasher and clothes washer. Plus, sinks, tubs, and <strong>shower</strong>s will all need less cleaning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>PureWow recommends combining 1/3 cup of baking soda with 1 cup of white <strong>vinegar</strong> in a gallon-sized Ziploc-style plastic bag (You&rsquo;ll probably want to do this in the bathroom). The mixture will start bubbling, and then you can place your <strong>shower</strong>head in the bag, completely submerging the head. (You can choose to leave the <strong>shower</strong>head in place or remove it first). Secure the bag in place by wrapping it with a rubber band around the neck of the <strong>shower</strong>head. Keep the <strong>shower</strong>head in the baking soda and <strong>vinegar</strong> mixture overnight, and then remove it before <strong>shower</strong>ing, first taking care to run the hot water to get any leftover solution off of your <strong>shower</strong>head. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Spray your <strong>vinegar</strong> cleaning solution on mildewy plastic liners, and allow it to work for 10–15 minutes. Wipe it down with a sponge. In the laundry room, you can treat washable fabric liners and curtains by adding 2–3 tablespoons of white <strong>vinegar</strong> to the wash cycle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Here you can use any soft cloth. Wipe the <strong>shower</strong>head with the fabric until it dries completely. Make sure there are no drips of water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Kristiana Laugen, a Home Expert at Handy, says you can simply remove the <strong>shower</strong>head and soak it in equal parts water and distilled white <strong>vinegar</strong>. Let the <strong>shower</strong>head sit for a few hours to give the <strong>vinegar</strong> a chance to break down any dirt or grime. If you have a <strong>shower</strong>head that can’t be detached, fill a bag with equal parts water and distilled <strong>vinegar</strong> and tie it tight around the <strong>shower</strong>head with a rubber band or string. Once you remove it from the <strong>vinegar</strong>, Laugen recommends using a small brush or microfiber cloth to wipe away any residue and let the water run for a few minutes to flush out any remaining <strong>vinegar</strong> or debris. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>An easy fix is adding an inline <strong>shower</strong> head filter. These filters are designed to reduce the number of mineral deposits, scale, and chlorine in your water. Not only will they make your <strong>shower</strong> head last longer but the filtered water will leave you with healthier skin and hair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>vinegar</strong> <strong>shower</strong> head soak needs to sit for several hours, but at least 4 hours is optimal and 12 hours is even better. That’s why it’s good practice to start this cleaning project either in the morning (right after you <strong>shower</strong>) or in the evening (that way it has all night). One caveat: Tread carefully with this cleaning hack if your <strong>shower</strong> head is made from brass. The material shouldn’t be submerged in white <strong>vinegar</strong> for more than 30 minutes. Skip this cleaning method completely for nickel-coated <strong>shower</strong> heads, as the shiny finish can get damaged by the acid. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The length of time you should soak your <strong>shower</strong>head in <strong>vinegar</strong> depends on the amount of limescale that has built up. If you can only see small traces of limescale, soak the <strong>shower</strong>head for 30 minutes to an hour. If there&rsquo;s a lot, leave it for longer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Then you can clean the <strong>shower</strong>head with hot soapy water and a soft cloth. Do this weekly, and there shouldn&rsquo;t be a lot of limescale build-up on the <strong>shower</strong>head. Reserve the <strong>vinegar</strong> soaking method for those deep, every once in a while cleans. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>is one of the best natural cleaners out there. This nontoxic cleaning marvel kills some household bacteria, dissolves hard-water deposits, and cuts through grime. It&rsquo;s also colorless so it won&rsquo;t stain surfaces. Plus, it&rsquo;s affordable, and you&rsquo;re likely to have it on hand in your pantry whenever you feel the need to clean your <strong>shower</strong> head. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fill a small plastic bag with white <strong>vinegar</strong> and wrap it over your <strong>shower</strong> head using a rubber band.

If your <strong>shower</strong>head does not gain a new look after doing this process, you failed to do your part correctly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If that’s not enough reason for you, then consider the health factors. Being in a hot, humid environment, <strong>shower</strong> heads are the perfect breeding ground for bacteria, mold, and other germs. Slime from an uncleaned <strong>shower</strong> head protects irritants from getting flushed out by the chlorine in the water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you have extra tough stains, rings, and stuck-on gunk, sprinkle baking soda over them. Use it as a gentle scrub with a damp cloth or spray it with <strong>vinegar</strong> to create the gunk-busting fizzing reaction. If you do the latter, let it bubble for a couple of minutes and wipe it down. Rinse with hot water to finish up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;An area of the <strong>shower</strong> that is often forgotten in the cleaning process is the <strong>shower</strong>head&rsquo;, says Rikki Fothergill, Bathroom Style Expert, Big Bathroom Shop (opens in new tab). &lsquo;Holes in the <strong>shower</strong> get clogged, and this can affect the water flow and effectiveness of the <strong>shower</strong> in general.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=http://farm1.static.flickr.com/166/412203245_bbacec1c38_m.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Clean Shower Head With White Vinegar - Cleaning Shower Head With Baking Soda">
