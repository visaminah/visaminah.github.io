Wearing gloves and safety glasses can help protect you from an injury that could result. - Source: Internet The box cutter, or utility knife, is an excellent tool found in almost every warehouse. Designed with a small blade, these knives have the ability to quickly cut cardboard boxes open, remove packing tape and other wrappings used in freight transit. Due to the abuse box cutters take, they are often made from very hard plastic or metal. - Source: Internet Safety Class 2 is the AutoSlide safety cutter.

The spring tension in these cutters ensures that the blade is pulled in as soon as the user releases their finger or thumb finger from the slider. This type of safety knife provides increased protection for both the user and the material. - Source: Internet A cutter should always be retracted when not in use.

Repair or replace the box cutter if it is malfunctioning in any way. - Source: Internet If the box cutters break or otherwise stop working, dispose of them in a sharps container, homemade plastic container, or in the garbage or recycling bin?. Make sure to retract the blade so no one can get cut by reaching for them. Do not keep broken box cutters because you or the next person could attempt to use them and this could result in an injury. - Source: Internet Hold box cutters with one hand. Use the other hand to stabilize the material. Use your thumb to adjust the blade extension slider. Have a firm grip on the handle and do not let it slip from your grasp. - Source: Internet We are using a standard metal box cutter in our example but many blades work in the same or a very similar fashion. Utilizing these blades will end up saving your company a fortune in the long run. Make sure you educate employees on the extra blades (if available) or have an employee who can change them readily available to change blades out for the other employees. The type of box cutter we used, after spending about five minutes on it the first time, we were able to change a blade in about two minutes. Making it significantly cheaper to have someone change the blades than to just buy more. - Source: Internet Though it seems simple and not nearly as dangerous as many other tools you may encounter, improper use of box cutters can still result in injury. We often overlook this risk. A little education can go a long way to stopping these preventable injuries at home and in the workplace. - Source: Internet At this point, we will want to start reassembling the box cutter.

Blades like Easy-Cut and many other Safety Cutters can all lock their blades. The Easy-Cut series incorporates the flexibility and length of your blade to the thickness of the cardboard. - Source: Internet Often employees injure themselves when they try to quickly open the box by cutting in a straight line with force towards themselves. To prevent such accidents, employees should make a mental note of the cutting line. The user should keep their body and hands away from the cutting line. Another way to prevent this is to use an automatic retractable blade cutter. Such cutters are safer for the user as once the user lets go of the mechanism, it will retract the blade, thus preventing any significant injuries to the user. - Source: Internet Wearing cut-resistant gloves when using a cutter will significantly minimise the chances of getting injured. High-quality cut-resistant gloves can prevent harm to your hands. With safety gloves, the user will feel more at ease when using their safety cutters as well! - Source: Internet This seems really stupid, but I see people open boxes wrong all the time.

Have a firm grip on the handle and do not let it slip from your grasp. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We are using a standard metal <strong>box</strong> <strong>cutter</strong> in our example but many blades work in the same or a very similar fashion. Utilizing these blades will end up saving your company a fortune in the long run. Make sure you educate employees on the extra blades (if available) or have an employee who can change them readily available to change blades out for the other employees. The type of <strong>box</strong> <strong>cutter</strong> we used, after spending about five minutes on it the first time, we were able to change a blade in about two minutes. Making it significantly cheaper to have someone change the blades than to just buy more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Though it seems simple and not nearly as dangerous as many other tools you may encounter, improper use of <strong>box</strong> <strong>cutter</strong>s can still result in injury. We often overlook this risk. A little education can go a long way to stopping these preventable injuries at home and in the workplace. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At this point, we will want to start reassembling the <strong>box</strong> <strong>cutter</strong>. Place the blade and housing back into the handle, ensure that the extra blades are seated properly and then place the top of the handle back onto the bottom. Then fasten the screw back into place and your utility knife is as good as new. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another feature a good <strong>cutter</strong> should have is the ability to lock its blade in place. Blades like Easy-Cut and many other Safety Cutters can all lock their blades. The Easy-Cut series incorporates the flexibility and length of your blade to the thickness of the cardboard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Often employees injure themselves when they try to quickly open the <strong>box</strong> by cutting in a straight line with force towards themselves. To prevent such accidents, employees should make a mental note of the cutting line. The user should keep their body and hands away from the cutting line. Another way to prevent this is to use an automatic retractable blade <strong>cutter</strong>. Such <strong>cutter</strong>s are safer for the user as once the user lets go of the mechanism, it will retract the blade, thus preventing any significant injuries to the user. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wearing cut-resistant gloves when using a <strong>cutter</strong> will significantly minimise the chances of getting injured. High-quality cut-resistant gloves can prevent harm to your hands. With safety gloves, the user will feel more at ease when using their safety <strong>cutter</strong>s as well! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This seems really stupid, but I see people open <strong>box</strong>es wrong all the time. If you are not careful you will either cut yourself or cut the items in the <strong>box</strong>. It is easy to do correctly, but for some reason everyone does it ass backwards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-95618982,imgsize-45234/pic.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="How To Use A Box Cutter - Box Cutter Safety"><p>Here are a few tips to help you find information about how to work a box cutter:</p><ul><li>Look for good places to get information about how to use a box cutter.
