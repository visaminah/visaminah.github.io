However, if you have a tank-style water heater, then the water inside the tank may still flow out of the water heater. Open a faucet on the lowest level of the home to drain any water remaining in the line. If the hot water continues to flow, locate the isolation valve above the hot water heater and turn it <strong>off</strong> to stop the flow of hot water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Turn on the water, and wait a few minutes. Watch the old and replacement supply lines for any signs of leaking especially around the coupling connectors. Check the shut-<strong>off</strong> and intake valves one last time, make sure you’re not standing in any water, and plug in the refrigerator. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Are you getting a new <strong>fridge</strong>?

They can help you find and shut <strong>off</strong> the correct valves with ease, ensuring that your <strong>fridge</strong> has a steady water supply at all times.​ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>: Not all refrigerators have a water line, but for those that do, the shut<strong>off</strong> valve is typically located behind the refrigerator. Simply pull the <strong>fridge</strong> out from the wall to access the shut<strong>off</strong> valve before you move, disconnect, or replace the refrigerator. Washing machine : In most cases, you can find the shut<strong>off</strong> valve behind the washing machine, though it can also be installed <strong>off</strong> to one side or even above the machine so that it’s easier to access. If you are working on the washing machine or replacing it, then you need to pull it out from the wall anyway. Take this opportunity to turn <strong>off</strong> the shut<strong>off</strong> valve before continuing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It costs between $200 and $400 to move a <strong>fridge</strong> outlet.

But for this step, you’ll need to be more heedful. Go after the steps attentively. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After turning <strong>off</strong> the water to the house, you should open a faucet on the lowest level of the home to allow the water left in the pipes to drain.

Let the water run for about five to 10 minutes, then close the faucet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Despite the ease of disconnecting a water line from a <strong>fridge</strong>, it’s important to remember a few key steps in order to avoid potential flooding or other damage. By following these simple instructions, you can quickly and easily disconnect your water line without any trouble. Have you ever had to disconnect a water line from your <strong>fridge</strong>? What was your experience like? Let us know in the comments below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When the water is <strong>off</strong> to the home, it cannot refill the toilet tank. So, if you flush the toilet when the water is <strong>off</strong>, the water from the tank will empty into the toilet bowl, leaving the tank empty until the water is turned back on. This means that the toilet can be flushed one time, even with the water <strong>off</strong>, but will not be able to be flushed again until the tank is refilled. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To turn the water supply <strong>off</strong>, give a gate valve a few turns clockwise until you can’t turn it any longer. For ball valves, turn the lever clockwise 90 degrees. In most cases, you won’t need any additional tools to turn <strong>off</strong> the main water shut <strong>off</strong> valve. These valves are designed for simple manual hand turning, but if you are having trouble turning it or if the valve is completely seized, you may need to use a channel lock wrench or pipe wrench. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Then, use a wrench to loosen the compression fitting that connects the water line to the refrigerator. Once the fitting is loose, you can pull the water line <strong>off</strong> the refrigerator.

If you are working on the washing machine or replacing it, then you need to pull it out from the wall anyway. Take this opportunity to turn <strong>off</strong> the shut<strong>off</strong> valve before continuing. Sink : Faucet repair and replacement is one of the most common DIY plumbing jobs, so it’s important to know that the isolation valve for these fixtures can generally be found under the sink. In some instances, the hot and cold water lines may have independent valves that need to both be turned <strong>off</strong> to stop the flow of water through the faucet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If the main shut<strong>off</strong> valve is stuck or seized, you can attempt to loosen it with a set of channel locks or a pipe wrench. Just keep in mind that if you apply too much pressure to the valve, you can break the handle or the stem. In some cases, even if you use a wrench or pliers you will not be able to get the valve moving again. At this point, it’s recommended to call a plumber to replace the valve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The main water shut<strong>off</strong> valve is usually located on the main water line, where it enters the home. In most cases, this will be in a basement, cellar, or crawlspace because the water line extends from the neighborhood water main and enters the home from under the ground. In warmer areas where freezing pipes isn’t a concern, the main water shut<strong>off</strong> might also be found outdoors on an exterior wall, or buried near the street. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, Samsung <strong>fridge</strong>s with external filters almost always have to have the water shut <strong>off</strong> before the filters are swapped out or changed over. This is generally because they will be an inline filter with no auto shut <strong>off</strong> valve – just tubing at either end connected directly to the water mains. If this is the filter you require, shutting <strong>off</strong> the water supply is a very important step when changing your filter to ensure you don&rsquo;t have a flood of water from this connection. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=4><li>If you need to turn <strong>off</strong> your <strong>fridge</strong>’s water line, use a knife or pliers (if necessary) to do so. Be sure to exercise caution when working with any tools near the water supply lines in your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>For this reason, it’s recommended to locate and test your main shut<strong>off</strong> valve now, instead of scrabbling to try to find it when water is pouring into your home from a broken water line. The valve should work properly without relying on any tools. If you find that it is seized or that the valve doesn’t completely shut <strong>off</strong> the water to the home, then you should contact a plumber to replace the valve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The water valve is usually at the top of your water heater on the right-hand side. Turn the valve clockwise. The appliance will remain on unless you shut it <strong>off</strong> entirely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re looking to connect a copper water line to your refrigerator, there are a few things you’ll need to do. First, you’ll need to shut <strong>off</strong> the water to your home. Next, you’ll need to cut the copper pipe to the appropriate length. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Turn <strong>off</strong> the water supply valve on the line behind the refrigerator.
