(There’s a long list and I will be revealing that later) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For <strong>red</strong> brick houses, go for a deck with neutral, earthy, or warm tones. Or, you can use muted shades of green like olive or sage. And of course, a white or cream deck also complements a <strong>red</strong> brick house. The following are some good choices for you to consider: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once done, use a roller to prime the rest of the brick surfaces. You might need additional coats of primer to prevent any remaining amount of soot or residue from leaching through your paint, especially if you’re planning to use a light colo<strong>red</strong> one. Allow the primer to dry overnight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the timeless and classic paint <strong>colors</strong> that will never go out of style with your <strong>red</strong> brick house is Sherwin Williams Iron Ore. This deep and dark charcoal paint color has gray undertones to define the utmost soothe and serenity. Yes, it’s a great EARTHY paint color that coordinates with the rustic <strong>red</strong> brick to provide a great backdrop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To go with the white on a <strong>red</strong> brick house, I always want to see some black. In fact, it can be very sharp to only do black accents with the <strong>red</strong> brick. However, we have other buildings to consider. So, I think it would be terrific to do a dark cool gray with the black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sherwin Williams Functional Gray is a great paint color for the <strong>red</strong> brick house due to its base paint color which is muddy gray and brown. This is a subtle and serene form of WARM GREIGE paint that beautifully creates a backdrop and lets the brick play the focal! It may be ideal to choose this color on the sidings with a brick accent. On the other hand, you can also blend this paint with SW Tricorn Black for the shutters and entryway door. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Moving into more modern design territory is the new exterior design of this split-level home. The <strong>red</strong> brick is more of an accent on this façade because the siding on the upper level is dominant. We recommended replacing the old siding with Hardie® Panel vertical siding and painting it — and the chimney — in Benjamin Moore’s Graphite. The trim and eaves are rende<strong>red</strong> in Sherwin Williams’ Tricorn Black, which plays well with the black lighting family, garage doors, windows, and new chimney cap. Wood and copper accents bring in natural elements that pull out the warmth of the brick. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This modern home had a darker <strong>red</strong> brick that lends itself nicely to pairing with wood siding. We recommended using a composite wood grain siding option from Woodtone under the front gable. Black and charcoal gray comes in on the new roof, modern garage door, exterior lighting family, and the trim, rende<strong>red</strong> in Benjamin Moore’s Onyx. Finally, we recommended new James Hardie standard vertical siding on the upper level, painted in Benjamin Moore’s Rockport Gray. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hands down, the best shades to complement a <strong>red</strong> brick house are in the cool-toned family. This is because of the design concept known as the color wheel. Red falls on the opposite side of the color wheel from greens and blues, making the contrast distinctive and visually appealing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bricks are naturally toned down but that doesn’t mean neutrals are your only option as the main color. For example, gold with a dollop of gray mixed in is beautiful with warm <strong>red</strong> bricks. Other muted <strong>colors</strong> can work equally well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Please Note – Any color brick is quite likely to be muted, subdued, and subtle. They definitely have a mix of gray in them – which makes them even more of a pastel shade. Well, when I say ‘<strong>red</strong> brick’, it’s not actually <strong>red</strong>! But rather, a form of ‘rust’ or ‘maroon’ that tones down the bold and bright <strong>red</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you don’t like the vibe of black paint color for your house with <strong>red</strong> brick, this charcoal gray must be next in line! The overall combination would feel more modern, sleek, and classic with a touch of versatility to it. For a daring look, you must choose the same charcoal gray for trims and shutters or even pick this color only for the entryway door and shutters. Yes, everything works. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A classic <strong>red</strong> brick house needs a deck that complements its style. With so many options, what color deck should you choose? In this post, we compiled some ideas to make your decision easier. If you were at a loss about what color deck matches your <strong>red</strong> brick house, keep reading! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So, are you particularly intrigued by any of the above-mentioned paint <strong>colors</strong> that compliment <strong>red</strong> brick? Well, it all boils down to the kind of vibe you’re aiming to create and your ultimate color preference and choice. All that you have to remember is to not choose a color that contradicts the warmth of the brick, but rather, it must blend! Talk creamy whites, warmer greiges, taupes, browns, bronze, sage greens, navy blues, darker teals, and darker grays. Just a recap of 11 paint <strong>colors</strong> that go with <strong>red</strong> brick are – - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your <strong>red</strong> brick home needs the royal treatment, emerald will be an inc<strong>red</strong>ible statement of indulgence and celebration. The impact of shades and paint finish really matter here. Softer shades with texture will downplay the brilliance of this color, while a thick, shiny coat against rich <strong>red</strong> brick will dazzle guests. Brass and gold knobs will really pop against an emerald front door. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://www.elegantweddinginvites.com/wedding-blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blue-pink-and-red-wedding-reception-ideas.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Colors That Go With Red Brick - Red Brick House Trim Colors">
