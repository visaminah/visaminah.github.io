A properly maintained granite surface can last up to 100 years. - Source: Internet A plethora of granite care products are available in today’s market.

This effective formula has a water-based formula that is easy to apply and cures in just an hour. Alternatively, the Black Diamond spray is a budget-friendly option that is environmentally friendly and comes with enough quantity to last through multiple applications. - Source: Internet Penetrating, or impregnating, sealers protect granite surfaces by plugging the porous surface with resins. Solvent- and water-based penetrating sealers are available, both of which help the resins soak into the pores. Once the water or solvent dries, it leaves the resins behind to protect the surface from stains. - Source: Internet To get the most value out of such a large purchase, take care of your granite.

The rugged texture of these materials gives these types of sealers a “tooth” onto which they can grip to create long-lasting protection. - Source: Internet If it’s a solvent-based sealer, pay attention to the directions on the bottle. Many manufacturers suggest using these chemicals in a well-ventilated room, which can pose a challenge during colder months. However, once the solvent dissipates, which is rather quickly, the surfaces are safe. - Source: Internet Experts vary in their recommendations as to how often to seal granite, but most say it should be sealed every 3 months to once a year.

That means keeping it clean and regularly maintaining it with a sealer. Not only should granite be sealed, but it also must be cleaned.

These top picks come with enough quantity for multiple uses, many ranging from 18 ounces to 1 whole gallon. While some of these picks are made with chemical compounds, some picks are natural, water-based, and/or biodegradable making them safe for use near food, children, or pets. - Source: Internet Experts disagree as to how often granite should be sealed. A good rule of thumb is to test the surface every 3 to 6 months to determine if it needs sealing. To test it, simply drip a bit of water onto the granite and wait half an hour.

They enrich the look of the countertop by soaking deeply into the surface to create a shiny, wet look. They often can reinvigorate older, dull surfaces. - Source: Internet Topical sealers aren’t always ideal for countertops.
