The bed is made up with slouchy, comfortable <strong>gray</strong> blankets. The open shelf next to the bed is great for adding an assortment of stylish, decorative pieces. The open bookshelf makes it possible for natural light to still enter the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Among other reasons why designs love it, grey has the amazing quality of being able to open a space up just like it adds a whole new level of depth when it’s used in this modern industrial studio suite. From the boho animal skin rug to the candle arrangement, this grey bedroom combines a number of styles within its concrete grey walls, meshing together multiple themes to create a truly one-of-a-kind room where the colors steal the show. If it weren’t for the consistent <strong>gray</strong> across the room, the bright blue art wouldn’t stand out half as much as it does! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Forget white and beige. When it comes to neutrals, <strong>gray</strong> has been the hot shade for the past several years and its popularity has yet to wane. Once associated with sadness and dreariness, the color has gained in popularity among top designers, who appreciate its versatility and sophistication. With more depth than white, the shade serves as a sophisticated backdrop to any space. It’s no wonder that celebrities such as Ellen Degeneres, Adam Levine, Brooke Shields and director Tate Taylor all showcase <strong>gray</strong> in their homes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We actually did had a recent debate over is grey still in style? And the overwhelming majority said yes. Thank god, because it&rsquo;s our personal fave color to <strong>decorate</strong> with and we think it works in every room of the home. There is however a trend towards much warmer greigey greys recently, so consider choosing a grey that has a more earthy undertone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A very common and well-known place for <strong>gray</strong> to hang out is in the coveted modern farmhouse styled spaces. It brings a new, fresh take on rustic styles, begging designers to switch out their burlap for clean-cut matte <strong>gray</strong> accents for a more updated look. Both the stripes on the bedspread and the linen bed skirt, <strong>gray</strong> brings this farm-style grey bedroom a softer, more gentle feel. However, in the name of the style, the wooden headboards and animal horn trophies must stay. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With these ten helpful tips, you&rsquo;ll be able to turn your boring grey walls into a beautiful and stylish space in no time. However, we first need to understand your room&rsquo;s <strong>gray</strong> before giving away the secrets. Let&rsquo;s get started. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Less is more in this gorgeous contemporary minimalistic room design. The <strong>gray</strong> stone, tile-paneled walls highlight the features of the room such as the white bed and beige accent chair. The large tiles even help the room look larger! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Creating an accent wall will make your <strong>gray</strong> walls the star of the show. If you want to get even more creative, paint some of your walls white or another contrasting color - this will make it easy for you to create a fun and innovative design on one (or more) of your walls. You can use almost anything as inspiration: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pay attention to sheen when choosing paints and colors for your <strong>gray</strong> bedroom idea. Glossier finishes make <strong>gray</strong>s appear stark and cold; flat or matte finishes cause <strong>gray</strong>s to appear lush and warm. Instead of trimming <strong>gray</strong> walls with bright-white moldings, which can create an unsettling contrast, paint woodwork cream, off-white, or barely-there <strong>gray</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Stone blue pairs wonderfully with <strong>gray</strong> tones. Cool color complements are just enough to differentiate the color palette without overwhelming the room. Find subtle ways to insert the color such as accents in the area rug, as a throw blanket, or even as an armchair in the corner. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gray can go gloomy if there&rsquo;s not enough light in a room. Banish potential shadows by dressing windows in sheer white curtains or loosely woven linen panels that filter without blocking light. Introduce elements such as mirrors, crystal chandeliers, silver frames, glossy white furniture, clear-glass accessories, and polished-steel tables that intensify natural light. Finally, install layers of lighting, from ceiling fixtures and recessed lights to table and standing lamps, to make a <strong>gray</strong> bedroom function at its best and brightest. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wallpaper is making its way back into homes and it&rsquo;s better than ever. The <strong>gray</strong> and black pattern is eye-catching and really spruces up the room. The colors coordinate with the vertically-striped curtains for a cohesive look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This grey bedroom combines metallics, fur, candles and florals for a lush, chic hideaway that is simply unforgettable. From the variety of <strong>gray</strong> pillows to the sleek lanterns and candle stands, every corner of this grey bedroom was carefully crafted with neutral shades to create the perfect lavish experience. All that’s missing from this dreamy spot is a bowl of chocolate covered strawberries and a robe softer that the plush accessories that saturate this space! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Avoid using accessories and accents with dark colors. Darker-colored items don&rsquo;t always match well with <strong>gray</strong>. Instead, opt for lighter colors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There&rsquo;s no shortage of the color <strong>gray</strong> in this cool, calming room. The monochromatic color scheme of this room includes varying shades of the smokey hue. From the nightstand to the throw blanket covering the bed, <strong>gray</strong> seeps into everything. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Or maybe a flat painted wall just isn’t doing it for you. In that case, <strong>gray</strong> wallpaper can be just the thing to give your living room the vibe you’re looking for. This charming <strong>gray</strong> living room wall has a wavy pattern that looks almost iridescent, and the touches of silver in the decor tie the area together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The mid-century modern style design has regained popularity in recent years. And dark <strong>gray</strong> can also be easily used in this style that has been known for decades ago. As you can see, this accent wall provides a blend of an elegant yet glamorous look that is typical of a mid-century modern design style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When decorating a room with <strong>gray</strong> walls, making a warm and inviting space is often tricky. Even worse is the feeling of trying to paint the room only to lose the excellent <strong>gray</strong> color that you love so much. So, here are ten tips that will make your living space irresistible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If the <strong>gray</strong> walls in your space are reasonably neutral and don&rsquo;t lean too much to a specific tone, you can add some paneling to make it more interesting. You can use a contrasting color in your paneling or a shade of <strong>gray</strong> that is similar in tone to the wall itself. Either way, this will create interest and diversity without overwhelming the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Tie the look of your bed into your <strong>gray</strong> room design with the help of a color-coordinated throw blanket. It&rsquo;s a great way to soften the features of the room, too. If you love geometric patterns, you can find numerous ways to include them in the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A bonus of using canvas prints is that they are easy to exchange, and there are many options to choose from. At Stunning Canvas Prints, we have only the best quality. Here are a few options that will work great with your <strong>gray</strong> room: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gray is a go-to color for farmhouse design . Whether a light <strong>gray</strong>, <strong>gray</strong>-blue, or greige (a <strong>gray</strong>-beige mix) , you can’t go wrong with adding farmhouse elements like distressed furnishings and sliding barn doors. This room brings the aesthetic to life not only with its <strong>gray</strong> walls, but with its natural color palette and simple patterns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Generally, the dark <strong>gray</strong> accent wall in the living room is similar to the bedroom ones. One little difference is that in the living room, you can be more flexible to place the wall area that will become the accent wall, even though, most will choose the wall behind the sofa. You can also use the wall where you mount the tv as an accent wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There&rsquo;s something so sophisticated about a white and <strong>gray</strong> bedroom color scheme. The tones are very complementary to each other, creating balance in the room. The intricate white crown molding looks elegant and instantly upgrades the room. Green foliage adds a nice pop of color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This vibrant yellow room becomes an entirely different space once mixed with <strong>gray</strong> accents. There is already an understood contrast because of how bright of a color yellow is, but as different shades of grey are used throughout the room to lessen the intensity of the contrast, the theme begins to flow and come alive. The abstract art paired with the geometric designs on the rug brings movement and vibration to what would have normally been a dull, stagnant space. So just as <strong>gray</strong> can complement other colors in unique ways, sometimes it’s the other colors themselves that bring grey to another level! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>True <strong>gray</strong>s are generally considered cool neutrals, but each hue can shift in temperature depending on its undertones. Flushed with red or yellow, <strong>gray</strong> appears warm. Blue and silver tones give <strong>gray</strong> a chilly undercurrent. Identify the undertones in the <strong>gray</strong> you choose to generate your desired atmosphere; knowing the undertones will also help you select accent colors and accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The industrial <strong>gray</strong> walls in this room are partnered with bright white accents and furniture, creating a balanced aesthetic. In order to prevent the room from looking too ordinary, splashes of color and patterns are incorporated into the room. Even a hint of color goes a long way in a neutral room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Elevate a <strong>gray</strong> bedroom&rsquo;s appeal by displaying <strong>gray</strong>s in a diverse array of textures. Consider introducing plush textiles, such as chenille, velvet, and corduroy, that show off the richness of deep and light <strong>gray</strong>s. A good <strong>gray</strong> bedroom idea is to counter its cooling properties by incorporating quilted duvets, woven blinds, colorful area rugs, distressed finishes, and throw pillows in vivaciously colored and patterned fabrics. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Warm-toned <strong>gray</strong>s have a yellow, orange, or red undertone, making them seem cozier. They, at times, even look like beige. Cooler-toned <strong>gray</strong>s have a blue, green, or purple undertone. Many <strong>gray</strong> shades come off one tone or the other, so it&rsquo;s essential to look at both tones side by side to know what effect each will have on the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As with any color combination, the higher the contrast, the more energetic the result. If you&rsquo;re looking for peace and quiet, combine hues of a similar intensity to create a calming composition. Blend light and dark <strong>gray</strong>s with vivid and muted colors to fashion a <strong>gray</strong> bedroom that lives lively. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This bedroom oozes chic, modern, industrial vibes. The concrete <strong>gray</strong> wall adds incredible texture to the room and serves as a backdrop for the rest of the room. The low-sitting wooden platform bed is warm and inviting. The exposed clothing rack gives off a laidback feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There is something about using horses within grey design that introduces a luxurious effect. As many already know, taking a picture and viewing it in black and white automatically gives a new intensity to the photo. That concept still rings true as <strong>gray</strong>scale stallions are frozen in time tearing through the land, bringing a majestic feel to this horse inspired grey and white bedroom, while still keeping the softness of the light shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Obsidian black is dark and demanding in any room. Pair it with smokey <strong>gray</strong> walls and you get a visual wonder. All the furniture in the room is crafted from the same dark color and material, giving the room the perfect &ldquo;put together&rdquo; appeal. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>From a tranquil country bathroom to an art-filled modern living area, these spaces from the AD archives showcase stylish and easy ways to use <strong>gray</strong> in your home. We’ve gathered spaces that use paint to dazzling effect, as well as some rooms that take the look a step further with marble, fabric or rugged concrete. As these rooms prove, a chic new look is just a few coats of paint away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dress up your <strong>gray</strong> walls with an interesting natural wood accent wall. The expansive piece of wood differentiates the space and welcomes diversity in the design. Luscious, live plants provide organic beauty in the room, perfect color complements to the <strong>gray</strong> walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The mainstream style behind using <strong>gray</strong> in modern bedroom design ideas is to bring back the feeling of simplicity and minimalism. Using <strong>gray</strong> in your room is a very simple way to attain an atmosphere of ease. The grey bedroom above uses calm and unobtrusive patterns for the wall art and rug while using otherwise matte shades of <strong>gray</strong> for the wall color and bedspread. This design provides a classic, modern space that gives just as much notice and attention to the plant decor and lamps as it does to the bedspread and wall decor, creating a harmonious space that wouldn’t be possible without the stylist’s use of grey! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re worried a monochrome room might be a little dull, try adding an accent wall . You don’t need to go crazy with a bright color or patterned wallpaper to make the space pop (and this <strong>gray</strong> living room proves it!). When choosing your colors, pick two shades of <strong>gray</strong>—one for the accent and one for your other walls. This subtle difference is enough to add a lot of visual interest. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Silvery <strong>gray</strong> and purple make for a striking color combination. With the two colors together, you get a fun, elegant look. The heel-shaped accent chair in the corner of the room is the icing on the cake for an unforgettable room design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When redesigning your living space, you don’t have to research the trending colors (though Veri Peri is quite gorgeous). In fact, the perfect hue might be one you wouldn’t think of right away. Like … <strong>gray</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This stylist of this feminine grey bedroom intertwined lighter shades of <strong>gray</strong> in with the floral decor to make a unique, soft space. Lining the outer borders of the room, the pink detail on the ceiling and baseboards tie everything together. The advantage of using mostly lighter shades of <strong>gray</strong> in this room is that when the designer chose to hang the dark wall art above the bed, it becomes the most eye-catching element! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gray is a neutral color, and so it plays nice with most other colors. However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean <strong>gray</strong> didn&rsquo;t choose favorites. To match with another color, you need to know whether it is warm-toned or cold-toned <strong>gray</strong>. Once you have gained this knowledge, it is simple, warm likes warm, and cold likes cold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Whether <strong>gray</strong> is the primary color in a room, an accent hue, or added as a decorative touch, you&rsquo;ll find that <strong>gray</strong> plays nicely with color shades ranging from bright to pastel. Can&rsquo;t-miss color companions for most shades of <strong>gray</strong> include red, gold, black, white, cream, and silver. Navy blue works with pale blue-shaded <strong>gray</strong>s; silvery blues beautifully team with deep <strong>gray</strong>s. But <strong>gray</strong> also partners well with vibrant turquoise, citron yellow, bright orange, and hot pink to create personality-plus bedrooms. Like a thoroughly modern look? Use mid-tone <strong>gray</strong> walls to spotlight black furniture finishes, deep purple bedding, and khaki and chrome accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s very common to see <strong>gray</strong> and blue used together and even mixed to attain a cool-toned shade of <strong>gray</strong>. We love how in these two grey bedroom ideas, it’s easy to see the difference between light <strong>gray</strong> and dark <strong>gray</strong>. Both look amazing when used with blue shades, but each influences the room in a completely different way. The same color combination is used to create both a traditional, light and airy room and a funky and colorful music lover’s paradise. The possibilities are endless! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gray paint against brick walls? Yes, please. This <strong>gray</strong> living room has a neutral light <strong>gray</strong> wall complemented by darker <strong>gray</strong> furniture, decor, and blankets. It’s a simple approach, but eye-catching and contemporary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Eggshell <strong>gray</strong> is the perfect neutral backdrop for any bedroom. Its cool colors spotlight the features in the room such as the natural wood bed frame, red brick herringbone floors, and live plants. The light <strong>gray</strong> hue does a wonderful job of covering the whole room in elegance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gray walls become warmer with the help of golden accents strewn throughout the room. The metallic hues ooze elegance and sophistication. Other <strong>gray</strong> accent pieces are used throughout the room to create a look of cohesion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ironically, the numerous decorating options with <strong>gray</strong> walls can actually make it difficult to decide on a decorative scheme. Options are always great when it comes to decorating, but too many options can often prove overwhelming. But with that said, with the right guidance and inspiration, you can create an amazing aesthetic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Because of it’s increasing popularity in the world of interior design, <strong>gray</strong> has become a staple color for decor. It has even made an appearance in the majority of the room styles featured in Elle’s Color Trends 2019! It’s a classic neutral shade that can bring personality to your room through countless different elements. Whether you’re looking for a way to elevate your elephant themed nursery or you’re trying to incorporate a modern theme in your master bedroom, grey decor is the way to go. Here are some bedroom decorating ideas to style a grey room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While we could go on for days about how sleek the grey bedspread looks when combined with the brown hues in this second room, another important point to note is the variety of textures. For an extra layer of dimension, the soft, sweater grey blanket is contrasted with the brown wooden bedroom walls and floor to give the room an industrial, but still comfortable cabin-style feel. Using these darker textures with <strong>gray</strong> is also one of the best ways to give a room a more masculine vibe. When taking into account how well light grey works with other colors, don’t forget to also try it out with other textures to really create a unique space! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Always consider color theory when decorating any room. Here, the purple couch goes oh-so-gorgeously with the gold table and ottoman accents (purple and yellow are complementary colors, after all!). The colors stand out even more against the neutral <strong>gray</strong> backdrop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The reddish-orange bedding really pops against the neutral <strong>gray</strong> background. The side table shares the same hue. A small accent chair with natural wood and neutral tones sits in the corner which adds balance to the space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In this bedroom, wood is a decorative focal point. The bed frame, shelves, and side table are all made of nice polished wood that looks amazing against the neutral <strong>gray</strong> wall. Even the area rug underfoot has a slight woodgrain aesthetic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Industrial design is known for simple color palettes, metal and brick highlights, and open floor plan. Another hallmark of the style? Concrete (or concrete-esque) walls and floors. This space’s <strong>gray</strong> walls are modern and minimalist—the perfect fit for an industrial living room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you think of shag, you might picture your grandmother’s old 1970s carpet. But it’s time to forget that. Shag carpets, rugs, and even these adorable pillows add lots of texture (and coziness!) to any space. This <strong>gray</strong>scale living room is a testament to how cute and contemporary shag can look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This room is full of all kinds of <strong>gray</strong> hues, each one with a different texture. The diversity of textures offers immense depth to the room design. Incorporating small pops of green or other accent colors provides the room with just enough bright color. Leave the floor-to-ceiling window exposed to receive a wealth of natural light. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When used inside a bedroom, dark <strong>gray</strong> can produce effects that make the room look more elegant and luxurious. However, avoid using this color too much because it will be resulting in a bad result. It is highly recommended that you do not use dark <strong>gray</strong> on more than one side of the wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Scandinavian design is well-known for its clean lines, natural light, and minimalist approach. This space, with its extra-large windows and simplistic (but oh-so-stylish) furnishings, is everything we love about this interior design movement. And while Scandi usually features muted, neutral colors, this dark <strong>gray</strong> living room wall isn’t overpowering against the decor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Muted <strong>gray</strong> and light pink is a sweet color combination. The colors look soft against each other and give the room a comforting appeal. Keep a bouquet of fresh pink flowers in the room for a sweet fragrance and gorgeous color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“Pay attention to whether your <strong>gray</strong> is on the cooler end of the spectrum, or if it’s closer to the greige. If it is a cooler <strong>gray</strong> it will pair best with white or blue furniture and decor, while greige looks best with warmer woods, brown or taupe.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/b4/c4/f6/b4c4f61825c9d1953550215076cfc8c1.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="How To Decorate Dark Gray Walls - Dark Gray Master Bedroom">
