These window covering options are non-slated, so air cannot pass through as easily, creating an effective seal. - Source: Internet There are various types of insulated curtains, each with a different degree of protection against warm or cool air loss. However, most include several layers meant to help regulate the temperature of your home. There is an outer decorative layer to match the décor in your room, an inner lining, a layer of high-density foam that blocks sound and heat exchange, a reflective vapor barrier that prevents moisture build-up, and another reflective layer that holds air in the room. - Source: Internet To hang thermal curtains so they are effective, it’s important to use the right size. Make sure the curtains extend beyond the window casing on all sides to provide enough coverage to block the air that passes through the window from entering the room. It’s crucial to make sure the curtains hang close enough to the wall so that there is no gap between the curtains that would allow air to pass between the two. This may require you to mount the curtain rod closer to the wall. - Source: Internet Each thermal curtain panel is made of 3 or 4 layers of materials. These thick, extra layers of fabric against your window create a thermal boundary between the outdoor air coming in through and the room itself.

However, you do have to keep them closed for thermal curtains to be effective. - Source: Internet For this scenario, the air between the curtain and the window will get cold during cooler weather since some heat will escape through the glass. The cold air will flow under the curtain, creating a chilly draft, and the warm air will flow down from the ceiling into the space between the curtain and the window. Air behaves this way because it wants to have a uniform temperature, so the presence of cold air makes the warm air flow behind the curtain and, in turn, becomes cooled. - Source: Internet To keep your house warm throughout the night, good insulation is key. ‘Insulation is a big one’, says Rebecca from Lacey Plumbing and Heating. ‘You can have the best boiler and most economical heating system in the world, but if your house isn’t properly insulated you’ll end up feeling the cold again, almost as soon as your heating goes off at night.’ - Source: Internet First, the classic: window insulation kits.

Consider hanging a second pair of <strong>curtains</strong> behind the first pair, which are specifically designed for this purpose. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Winter is officially here, and those cold temperatures can mean a significant spike in energy bills. The colder it is, the harder your heating system must work to maintain a <strong>warm</strong> temperature indoors. And unfortunately, many homes are not well insulated. Window treatments are a great solution to keep your home <strong>warm</strong> during the winter months. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Thermal <strong>curtains</strong> can work as a short-term solution to help keep cold air from leaking through air leaks around your windows in winter. They help trap cold air drafts behind multiple layers of fabric to keep it from moving around the room. However, you do have to keep them closed for thermal <strong>curtains</strong> to be effective. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For this scenario, the air between the curtain and the window will get cold during cooler weather since some heat will escape through the glass. The cold air will flow under the curtain, creating a chilly draft, and the <strong>warm</strong> air will flow down from the ceiling into the space between the curtain and the window. Air behaves this way because it wants to have a uniform temperature, so the presence of cold air makes the <strong>warm</strong> air flow behind the curtain and, in turn, becomes cooled. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To keep your house <strong>warm</strong> throughout the night, good insulation is key. &lsquo;Insulation is a big one&rsquo;, says Rebecca from Lacey Plumbing and Heating. &lsquo;You can have the best boiler and most economical heating system in the world, but if your house isn’t properly insulated you’ll end up feeling the cold again, almost as soon as your heating goes off at night.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>First, the classic: window insulation kits. These include a clear plastic film to go over your existing single-glazed windows and some kind of adhesive to keep it in place. They work on the same principles as double glazing, creating an extra barrier between your <strong>warm</strong> home and the cold outside - but they’re much cheaper and only stick around for about one season. You can buy enough for five medium sized windows for under $30 at either Bunnings, Mitre 10 or most other hardware stores. Energywise has a great guide to installing window insulation effectively too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blackout <strong>curtains</strong>, to block out as much sunlight as possible, are often made from a very thick, heavy fabric. While it is not going to be as insulating as some types of thermal <strong>curtains</strong>, it is going to be much better than most traditional <strong>curtains</strong> at keeping your room <strong>warm</strong>er than it would otherwise be. Blackout <strong>curtains</strong> tend to fall on the more expensive end of things, especially for the high-quality ones, as they also have reflective linings that are meant to keep the light out of your room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The short answer is yes, just about all <strong>curtains</strong> will keep heat in a room to some extent. Because of the way that <strong>curtains</strong> work, they create a barrier between your room and the window that traps the heat. It traps heat between the window and the curtain, as well as between the curtain and the rest of the room. Of course, the efficacy of this barrier depends entirely on the curtain’s material. The heavier, thicker, and more insulating the fabric is, the better job it is going to do at creating a secure air barrier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Thermal <strong>curtains</strong> also do a great job of filtering out light. Darker-color <strong>curtains</strong> will actually block all sunlight, allowing you to sleep in on those sunny Sunday mornings. This dense material also provides maximum privacy for bedrooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can also buy a floor-length curtain that prevents cold air from escaping under the bottom. Be sure to purchase enough fabric to allow substantial overlap in the middle of the window since this will prevent <strong>warm</strong> air from escaping there as well. Finally, let your <strong>curtains</strong> hang close to and wider than the window frame so they cover the edges. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Depending on the number of windows and window sizes in your home, this short-term solution can get really pricey. They can cramp your style. While there are plenty of styles to choose from, insulated <strong>curtains</strong> come in heavy fabrics and may not complement your taste in home decor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Obviously, open them again in the morning. Opening your <strong>curtains</strong>/blinds in the day lets in <strong>warm</strong>ing sunlight. This helps to heat your home passively. Even on dull winter days, it’s still better to keep your <strong>curtains</strong> open to let in as much light as possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Insulated <strong>curtains</strong> are a temporary solution. They mask the problem of open air leaks around your windows, rather solving it through professional air sealing. Learn more about house sealing and why it works in our Guide to Air Sealing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are a couple of drawbacks to the RHF <strong>curtains</strong>, however. They need to be washed to get rid of their wrinkles if you buy them brand-new, so it’s a good thing they’re machine-washable and machine-dryable. They also aren’t as good at soundproofing a room as other <strong>curtains</strong> are. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Keeping heat inside your house is essential, especially in the fall and winter months. It&rsquo;s common to find as many ways as possible to inexpensively regulate the temperature in your home. Many homeowners often wonder if <strong>curtains</strong> provide any insulation. We&rsquo;ve done the research to bring the answer to you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, it’s also important to know when to open and close these <strong>curtains</strong> to get maximum effectiveness out of them. Generally, when the sun is up, keep the <strong>curtains</strong> open to let the sunlight and <strong>warm</strong>th in. As soon as the sun goes down, close them to trap that heat in overnight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Curtains and blinds together make a powerful combination to winter-proof your windows. Curtains look stylish for your home. Choose <strong>curtains</strong> that complement your furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Got a really chilly living room? Or does your upstairs bedroom feel like a sauna in the summer? Closing the blinds and adding closed thermal <strong>curtains</strong> can reduce some of those uneven temperatures. You can learn more about fixing drafty windows in this article. Installing insulated <strong>curtains</strong> is something you can do yourself. Most of the time, you just need a few simple tools to install curtain rods: a drill, screwdriver, stud-finder, and a level. Enlist a buddy to help, and this is a project you can do yourself on a day off work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some <strong>curtains</strong> are machine washable, making them easy to maintain. Many thermal <strong>curtains</strong> are even safe to dry in the dryer. Others require the trip to and expense of a dry cleaner. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning to avoid damaging your <strong>curtains</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are two types of <strong>curtains</strong> that you are going to want to look for if you want to keep as much heat in as possible. You are going to want to keep your eyes on blackout <strong>curtains</strong> and thermal <strong>curtains</strong>. As the name might suggest, thermal <strong>curtains</strong> are going to be the better curtain for this purpose, but if blackout <strong>curtains</strong> are the only alternative that you can obtain, then they will get the job done just fine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Total estimated cost for <strong>curtains</strong> and rods Cost per window: $55-$90 Cost per 1,700 sq. ft. house: $935-$1,530 Cost per 2,600 sq. ft. house: $1,430-$2,340 - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A good set of thermal <strong>curtains</strong> is notably less expensive than some sets of blackout <strong>curtains</strong>, although you are going to need to pay close attention to the material of the curtain. Many people will market blackout and thermal <strong>curtains</strong> as the same thing, when they are two very different types of <strong>curtains</strong>. While they share the same thick and heavy fabric, you are going to want to search for <strong>curtains</strong> with a foam lining. If you can’t find any, you can always add a foam liner to a set of blackout <strong>curtains</strong>, although this is the most expensive option when it comes to <strong>curtains</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blackout fabric is available as woven or knit in a wide variety of prints and solid colors. The material, which drapes well, is not especially dark in appearance, but it&rsquo;s lined with lightweight foam or contains a &ldquo;core&rdquo; of black sunblock fiber. Whether premade or home-crafted, your blackout <strong>curtains</strong> will be washable (double-check care instructions first!). For extra-easy care, hang them back up while still wet so they won&rsquo;t wrinkle. You&rsquo;ll also save electricity by not putting them in the dryer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Start by measuring the height and width of the window you’re making the <strong>curtains</strong> for. Then, measure and cut all four of the fabric layers that will make up the curtain. Cut your <strong>curtains</strong> at least 10 inches wider and 6 inches taller than the window so that when the <strong>curtains</strong> are closed, they overlap each other. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>According to University of Salford researchers, drawing the <strong>curtains</strong> at dusk will minimize heat loss by 15-17 per cent. The number for blinds is a little lower, at 13-14 per cent, but the gap is significant enough to justify closing them. These results have been confirmed in laboratories all over the world, with the US Department of Energy estimating a 10% reduction. If you choose to use electrical tape to secure your <strong>curtains</strong> to the wall on both sides, this will increase to 25%. Although this may seem to be a drastic measure, it should be considered in places where the back of the <strong>curtains</strong> is unlikely to be seen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Thermal <strong>curtains</strong> Cost per set: $40-$50 Cost for a 1,700 sq. ft. house: $680-$850 Cost for a 2,600 sq. ft. house: $1,040-$1,300 - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another benefit of insulated <strong>curtains</strong> is that they provide soundproofing for your home. Outside noises stay out, and inside noises stay in. Though they probably won’t prevent the neighbor’s blasting stereo noise from entering your home, for annoying ambient sounds like lawn mowers, barking dogs and loud passing vehicles they do make a great addition. You’ll find insulated <strong>curtains</strong> especially useful in bedrooms or kids’ rooms where a little less noise tens to come in handy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Using energy efficient shades, shutters and <strong>curtains</strong> can help you save energy this winter. These inexpensive options help regulate the temperature in your home. The result? Lower bills and a <strong>warm</strong>er, cozier, and more stylish home. Energy efficient window coverings can even help keep your home cooler during the summer! Here’s how: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>During the colder months, <strong>curtains</strong> play a very important role: protecting the inside of the house against gusts of cold outside air. This is very useful, especially if your home is not well insulated. By protecting it, you&rsquo;re helping keep the heat inside the room, so you don&rsquo;t have to use a lot of energy to keep it <strong>warm</strong> — an improvement that both your pocket and the planet will thank you for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Again, insulated <strong>curtains</strong> should be closed completely for them to be the most effective. That means those lovely trees or that city skyline out your window will be covered up year-round for you to resolve any uneven temperatures and energy waste. Insulated <strong>curtains</strong> don’t solve poor insulation and airflow problems. If you have uneven temperatures between rooms in your home, thermal <strong>curtains</strong> won’t help here. They’ll temporarily assist in blocking window drafts that come into your home through air leaks, but that’s about it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It is necessary to make your windows winter-proof with blinds. Blinds have proven to keep your homes <strong>warm</strong> by letting sunlight in during the daytime. Blinds act as a layer before the glass that do not let the trapped heat escape. Open your blinds during the day, let the interior of your house soak in the sunlight and close the blinds as evening sets in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Thermal <strong>curtains</strong> go a long way toward improving your windows’ energy efficiency. They can reduce heat loss by 25% in the winter and reduce solar gain by 33% in the summer. If your windows don’t gain and lose heat so easily, you’ll use your thermostat less often, which will save you some money on utility bills. As a side benefit, thermal <strong>curtains</strong> also dampen sound in the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re not handy with a needle or sewing machine and don’t want to pay to have them lined then don’t worry. Here’s a handy guide on how to line your <strong>curtains</strong> without having to sew. Lining your <strong>curtains</strong> could save 10% on your bills, helping to offset that pesky energy price hike. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>By extension, heavier <strong>curtains</strong> are better at preventing heat exchange between the cold air around the window and the <strong>warm</strong> air in the rest of the room. The thicker the <strong>curtains</strong>, generally speaking, the more effective they are as an insulator. The best insulating <strong>curtains</strong> come with a lining attached to the rear, which is designed to increase insulation as well as limit airflow and noise transfer. You might even consider a second pair of <strong>curtains</strong>, designed for exactly this purpose, which hang just behind the first pair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It goes without saying that the more layers your home has, the <strong>warm</strong>er it will be. Keeping extra soft furnishings to hand can make all the difference in saving money on your heating. Think best throws, bedspreads, and even weighted blankets, and you&rsquo;ll be able to stay <strong>warm</strong> on cold nights without totting up your energy bills. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While you won’t see a huge improvement in your heating or cooling bills, you might be less inclined to adjusting the thermostat back and forth once you install <strong>curtains</strong> to stop drafts and outdoor air intake. When shut, thermal <strong>curtains</strong> can add an R-value of R-3 or R-5. This R-value is estimated, but it does improve upon a window’s average R-value of 2. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The thick layers of material in an insulating curtain not only prevent heat loss in your home, but they also absorb sound waves. This works both ways, muting the sound of your neighbor’s barking dog or screaming children while also muffling your own loud music. Thermal <strong>curtains</strong> can reduce the noise in your home by as much as 10 decibels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Curtains or Drapes are another great way to insulate your home by providing a great insulation barrier against the cold winter air. On average, drapes and heavy <strong>curtains</strong> can prevent up to 10% of the heating loss. Insulated drapes, however, have been shown to prevent up to 33% of heat loss, according to Consumer Reports. There are also endless options for fabrics, textures, colors and styles. Of course, it’s easy to change your drapes or <strong>curtains</strong> by season, as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are looking for ways to keep heat out of your home throughout the summer season, you may want to consider investing in insulated <strong>curtains</strong>. By reducing heat exchange, insulated <strong>curtains</strong> help keep the temperature inside your home constant without taxing your air conditioning system. You’ll save money on electricity usage and monthly utility costs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The simple fact is closing your <strong>curtains</strong> at dusk helps stop cold draughts from penetrating. And it helps keep the heat in your home. Even if you have double or triple glazing in your home and they are draught-proofed you can still lose heat through your windows. Therefore it’s a good habit to fall into doing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hanging blackout <strong>curtains</strong> is one of the cheapest, easiest solutions imaginable. Blackout <strong>curtains</strong> are also known as &ldquo;thermal drapes&rdquo; for a reason. They&rsquo;re ideal for blocking light and heat from windows that get strong sun. And the best part is that contrary to popular belief, blackout <strong>curtains</strong> do not have to be black. They don&rsquo;t even have to be <strong>curtains</strong>! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A benefit of using insulated or heat blocking <strong>curtains</strong> during the day includes keeping excess heat energy from the sun out of your home. You will use your air conditioning system less because you will be letting less heat into the house. In winter, keeping the <strong>curtains</strong> open during the day will let in heat from the sun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most can be hung from any standard curtain rod, though heavier <strong>curtains</strong> may call for a sturdier hanging device. Taking care of insulated <strong>curtains</strong> is no more difficult than caring for regular window treatments. Regular light vacuuming will keep them free of dust and looking like new. Tough stains wear may require occasional dry cleaning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some insulated <strong>curtains</strong> even have a magnetic strip along their edges which is attracted to its counterpart in the window frame or the nearby walls. The magnets help the <strong>curtains</strong> stick closer to the wall. Hooks or Velcro are also great options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Thermal <strong>curtains</strong> can reduce as much as 25% of the heat loss from your windows, as well as block out any drafts and wind chills that come from the hectic weather that winter brings. This will help keep your room at a stable, <strong>warm</strong>er temperature, no matter if it is night or day. Compared to other <strong>curtains</strong>, thermal <strong>curtains</strong> can make a whole world of difference and are one of the best choices that you can make. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Beyond that, the size you want depends on the look you’re trying to achieve. For a traditional look, mount the curtain rod so that the curtain hangs from 6 inches above the top of the window frame to about 3 inches below the bottom of the frame. The <strong>curtains</strong> should also extend beyond either side of the window by 3 inches. For modern style, mount the rod as close to the ceiling as possible and allow the <strong>curtains</strong> to extend to about 1 inch above the floor, or allow them to rest on the floor to create a puddled effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most thermal <strong>curtains</strong> are machine washable, using cold water and a gentle cycle. Some can even handle a trip through the dryer. Just make sure to read the manufacturer’s instructions regarding care before attempting to machine wash your <strong>curtains</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Candles instantly make a room feel cosier, and though they aren&rsquo;t powerful enough to heat a room alone, they certainly can make their surrounding areas a little <strong>warm</strong>er. You can style candles by grouping them together on your coffee table ideas or alongside your living room fireplace ideas, so that they give off extra heat when burning. You&rsquo;ll feel much cosier snuggling up on the sofa when some candles are lit nearby. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We tested all the <strong>curtains</strong> on our list and evaluated each of them by an established set of guidelines. All were installed in bedrooms. Their light-blocking abilities, thermal control, and quality were evaluated over several days of use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although investing in insulated <strong>curtains</strong> is an excellent way to improve the comfort of your living space, the best way to maintain a pleasant temperature in your home is to upgrade your HVAC system. Our team of licensed technicians offer exceptional HVAC services for homes in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. We offer various types of HVAC services such as air conditioning replacement, furnace repair, heat pump installation, and air conditioning repair. Give our team of technicians a call at 1-800-642-4419 to receive assistance with a malfunctioning air conditioner or inefficient furnace. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some materials, such as sheer fabrics, are going to be downright terrible at creating a stable barrier and will only change the temperature of your room by a single degree, if that. Other materials, such as the materials used in thermal <strong>curtains</strong>, can easily change the temperature of your room by several degrees. If you want to keep as much heat in as possible, you will want to look for the most insulating <strong>curtains</strong> that there are. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Tip: No matter which shades you choose, on sunny winter days, open your shades to let the sunshine into your home. This can help heat the inside of your home by using the <strong>warm</strong>th of the sun. Before the sun sets, close your shades to keep the <strong>warm</strong> air from the sun trapped inside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This one may seem a little too obvious, but that&rsquo;s also why it&rsquo;s easy to overlook. Leaving doors open is a fast way to let heat escape a room, and will mean you&rsquo;re more likely to turn the central heating up in the evening. Simply closing the doors will make your space feel a lot <strong>warm</strong>er. And of course, the same applies to windows too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>According to researchers from the University of Salford, drawing your <strong>curtains</strong> at dusk can reduce heat loss by around 15-17%. With blinds, the figure is a little lower at 13-14%, but the difference is enough to make closing them worth it. These findings have been echoed in laboratories across the world, with the US department of energy putting the figure at around 10%. This can go up to 25% if you’d like to seal your <strong>curtains</strong> to your wall on either side with electrical tape. While this might seem like an extreme measure, it’s one that might be worth considering in areas where the rear of the <strong>curtains</strong> is unlikely to be visible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, upgrades to new insulating windows will greatly increase the <strong>warm</strong>th and energy efficiency of your home if you happen to have old or drafty windows. And on the other hand, if you lose a lot of heat through your windows, blinds can be a great way to save money on electricity. To ensure that no heat escapes from the sides or top, have your blinds measured and installed by a professional such as Reynolds Blinds, get in touch today or book a home visit. You can also visit our showrooms in Oxford, Birmingham, Sutton Coldfield, Banbury, Newbury and Worcester - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Heavyweight, tightly-woven fabrics are far better than light- or medium-weight fabrics at keeping cold air out of a room. Look for options like velvet, tapestry, tweed, denim, or suede. You can combine a simple, solid-color curtain with a more elaborate patterned option so your drapes look stylish while keeping your living room <strong>warm</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The purpose of this foam lining can be compared to the way that a winter jacket helps to keep the cold out, while keeping the <strong>warm</strong>th of your body in with you. It traps any cold air trying to come into your room, while preventing the <strong>warm</strong>ed air in your room from escaping out into the cold. This is part of the barrier that was mentioned earlier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Thermal-lined <strong>curtains</strong> can help you keep the cold out more effectively, especially if you have single-glazed windows. If thermal <strong>curtains</strong> aren&rsquo;t within your budget, at the very least make sure your <strong>curtains</strong> are lined. The thicker the better, generally, and blackout <strong>curtains</strong> always do a great job of concealing heat. This curtain idea is genius and should really make a difference on cold mornings when your heating might have been switched off overnight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Keep your home <strong>warm</strong> without increasing bills by switching to thermal <strong>curtains</strong> in the home. Helping to reduce heat loss by 25 percent, Amazon shoppers are obsessed with this pair that come in 20 sizes and 26 colours to suit any home. On sale for now 34 percent off. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This R-value is estimated, but it does improve upon a window’s average R-value of 2. Thermal <strong>curtains</strong> can reduce some of the drafts or hot air you feel (when they’re closed). Got a really chilly living room? Or does your upstairs bedroom feel like a sauna in the summer? Closing the blinds and adding closed thermal <strong>curtains</strong> can reduce some of those uneven temperatures. You can learn more about fixing drafty windows in this article. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, what this means is that you won’t have any ambient lighting heating up your room either. Depending on where you live and just how much sunlight you get, this ambient lighting might end up heating your room up slightly. By blocking it out with blackout <strong>curtains</strong>, you might be able to further increase just how much heat gets into your room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Thankfully, there are some simple fixes to prevent <strong>warm</strong> air from escaping so easily. You can begin by installing a pelmet, which is a cornice or valance that covers the top of the curtain rail and stops <strong>warm</strong> air from being pulled down behind the curtain. Make sure your pelmet covers the top 2 inches of the curtain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Unlike blackout <strong>curtains</strong>, thermal <strong>curtains</strong> are specifically designed to keep as much heat in a room as possible during the colder months of the year. This means that you are likely going to get better results from them, although because of the materials, they also perform much the same way as blackout <strong>curtains</strong>. The main difference between blackout <strong>curtains</strong> and thermal <strong>curtains</strong> is that instead of a reflective lining to keep the sun out, most thermal <strong>curtains</strong> have foam lining to keep the heat in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With so many brands and styles to choose from, selecting a set of thermal <strong>curtains</strong> that will add efficiency to your home’s heating and air conditioning system while meshing with its aesthetics can be a challenge. This guide will review the features you should consider in a set of thermal <strong>curtains</strong> and includes a list of some of the best products available. We tested each of the <strong>curtains</strong> on our list, noting their ability to insulate and block light.
