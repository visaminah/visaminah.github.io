They allow you to mix and match samples, compare them to furniture and décor, and take the time to choose carefully. With the addition of a flooring expert to give you professional advice, your floor coverings will make a world of difference to your home and your lifestyle! - Source: Internet This year, some carpet trends include natural fibre carpets made from materials like wool, jute, sisal and seagrass. They offer a similar organic look and feel to hardwood, without the price tag! Stripes are also trending and are a great way to make a small room appear wider or longer. Designs range from big, bold patterns to thinner stripes for a more subtle statement. - Source: Internet When choosing a suitable carpet for your home, it’s essential to rely on the advice of professionals. There are so many flooring options available, and the choice can be overwhelming! Flooring focussed companies employ staff that are fully trained to help bring your interior decorating ideas to life. They also have showrooms filled with rugs and carpet tiles that offer a realistic opportunity for you to get a feel for the perfect style, texture and colour of the floor covering for your home. This gives you a chance to relax, de-stress and enjoy the whole buying experience! - Source: Internet Conversely, if your home has fewer occupants or you are carpeting a room that’s not always in use (like a bedroom), lighter and/or plush carpets may be the way to go. Bear in mind that in both instances, carpets will appear lighter once installed and will fade over time, so it might be worth choosing a colour that is a shade or two deeper than you initially had planned. Once you’ve decided on the carpets, you can then decide how best to complete the room’s design by choosing the colour of the walls. - Source: Internet These types of carpets feature yarn that is … yes, you guessed it, formed into loops.

For example, suppose you have a large family or entertain regularly — lighter carpets may not be ideal in often-used rooms, as they will suffer wear and discolouration over time. This is also the case if you have little ones and/or pets that tend to leave mess wherever they go! Colour-blended, patterned and accented neutral carpets can obscure stains and dirt and also add a little personality to a busy household. - Source: Internet Neutral carpets are a safe choice, but the word “neutral” certainly doesn’t have to mean “boring”! Neutrals can include colours like off whites, taupes, greys, oatmeal, beige and stone, and are a great base palette for the addition of accent colours. If you decide on a vibrant wall colour, a neutral carpet colour can subdue and balance out your room’s interior. And if you decide on a bolder colour in your carpets, you can introduce more neutral tones via the walls and other furnishings. - Source: Internet When it comes to interior design, trends come and go, and what might be “in fashion” today may not be in years to come.
