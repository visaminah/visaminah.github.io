Cation-exchange-capacity (CEC) refers to the negative charge of the soil, which allows it to hold onto positively-charged nutrients. (source) - Source: Internet It is best to till and amend bare soil late in the fall before the ground freezes. This will prevent weeds from germinating on bare soil, and it allows organic matter to begin to break down. The soil will be loose from tilling, and it is important to keep it from getting compacted. Don’t allow people to walk or drive on the tilled area, or else you will need to till again before planting, which can destroy the structure. - Source: Internet Peat moss is very difficult to break down, and the effects it has on porosity last much longer than compost. However, because it is difficult to break down, it doesn’t release nutrients into the soil. This is why you need to add peat moss and compost together to increase porosity and add nutrition. - Source: Internet For example, if your lawn and garden space is 35’ x 25’, you need to amend 875sq’. Each large bale of peat moss contains 3.8 cubic feet of material, which is enough to cover 90sq’ at a 1” depth. - Source: Internet Sphagnum moss grows in bogs. As the moss matures, old, dead plant material forms layers underneath the living moss. These deposits can grow to over 20’ in-depth, and form the material we call peat. - Source: Internet Peat moss can be a useful amendment in clay soils IF you plan on doing regular soil tests. Peat moss can help with drainage by providing stable organic matter in the soil. However, it also increases the amount of water and nutrients clay will hold, which can cause root rots and nutrient toxicities. - Source: Internet This is where peat moss truly shines. Clay soil is made up of tiny particles that pack together and form impenetrable layers. This makes it incredibly difficult for water to penetrate, and if it succeeds, it is just as hard to drain. - Source: Internet How can I improve my pH? Clay soils are naturally alkaline, but plants prefer acidic environments. Organic matter generally lowers pH, so consistent compost and peat moss amendments can lower pH gradually over time. However, for more reliable results, it is better to use sulfur to lower pH and rely on organic matter to help maintain lower pH values. Learn more about soil alkalinity here. - Source: Internet Soak the moss in a large bin or tub of water for 24 hours. Peat is difficult to saturate, especially in the soil. Soaking it first helps it incorporate into the soil instead of creating dry patches. - Source: Internet How much compost should I add to my clay soil? Compost is the best soil amendment and should be the primary focus in improving clay soil. Add up to 3” to existing lawns and landscapes, and use compost as a topdressing around the drip ring of established plants. After each major addition of organic matter, the nitrogen in the soil will drop, so you may need to supplement with fertilizer on established lawns. Read our article on compost for more information. - Source: Internet This is good news for homeowners with sandy soils. Sand is generally acidic and suffers from poor water holding capacity. Peat moss would help soils retain water, but has not been recommended for sandy soils because they are already acidic. - Source: Internet Blueberries are a popular acid-loving plant, and most growers swear by peat moss. However, the addition of peat moss has less to do with pH and more to do with how blueberry roots access nutrients. Peat moss helps encourage fungi on the roots that enable the plants to grow. - Source: Internet Clay textures can improve, but it takes time and sweat. The best thing you can add to a clay soil is organic matter. Compost is the best general-purpose soil amendment, but there are specific soil conditions where other organic materials would be beneficial. - Source: Internet Clay soil is difficult to manage. When it’s wet, it’s a slippery, sticky mess. When it’s dry, you need a jackhammer to till a vegetable patch. - Source: Internet Sphagnum moss is used to line baskets, for arts \u0026 crafts, and as a soil amendment. Sphagnum moss can be milled and baled, or sold in loose in bags. Sphagnum moss has a neutral pH and helps with aeration. - Source: Internet Incorporating large amounts of organic matter into your soil can cause a temporary loss in nitrogen. As the material decomposes, it draws nitrogen from the soil to support the process. Once decomposition is complete, nitrogen is released back to the soil and is available for plants. - Source: Internet Here are a few tips to help you find information about How Much Peat Moss To Add To Soil:\r- Look for good places to get information about Peat Moss For Clay Soil.
