As for other things that need to be looked up, they are about Easy Minecraft Builds and have something to do with Minecraft House Ideas. 111 Things About How To Build A Good House In Minecraft Easy | Dualshockers Obsidian Obsidian is an extremely strong material and takes a long time to break. Its breaking time can be a pain when building but is great for protection against other players on multiplayer PVP servers but some players may not like the look. Invincible to vanilla explosions with a blast resistance of 1,200. - Source: Internet You just have to love this cool hobbit hole. It’s so simple, yet truly amazing. Watch the tutorial for building this cozy little house. - Source: Internet The cool thing about castles is that there are so many designs for them. Players can make gargantuan fantasy-style fortresses, realistic bits of gothic architecture, or really anything in between. Castles can feature any number of architectural quirks — balconies, traps, secret passages, and so on. Every castle is a unique testament to the building skills of its creator. - Source: Internet One last one by RainbowGamerPE, this build is left purposefully incomplete, allowing for players to take it in whatever direction they may wish. Still, though, this serves as a useful foundation, allowing for easy expansion. The use of glass is also a nice touch, lending it a more futuristic look than other builds. - Source: Internet The creative possibilities have no bounds. We encourage you to use your imagination and building skills to construct a house anywhere in the Minecraft world. To bring everything to life you can imagine in Minecraft, learn Minecraft coding in our fun online classes led live by experts. There’s no risk in trying with our free Minecraft class intro session. - Source: Internet A greenhouse is a great option for those looking to incorporate lots of plants, even farmable crops into their house build. With glass blocks, it’s pretty easy to set up a convincing roof (especially if light green or white glass is used). The rest of the structure can be a simple frame made out of wood, stone, or possibly iron blocks. - Source: Internet A modern house in Minecraft would look like houses you generally see in the real world. You can make a great house that looks like a mansion using the right materials. Materials like stone, wood, clay, and glass can be used to construct different structures in the house. Created by GoodTimesWithScar, the modern house can require a lot of time and planning to build. You can also create a landscaped garden surrounding the house to make it look even better. - Source: Internet There are no fancy building techniques for constructing this house. However, it still manages to look fairly interesting, which is mostly thanks to its shape. It’s rectangular, but the way it dips inwards and outwards gives the impression of several rectangles stuck together, making for a great house idea in Minecraft when combined with the solid roof design. - Source: Internet Dirt Dirt is very weak and isn’t the most beautiful material to build with either. However, it is found on the surface of nearly all biomes and can be mined up very quickly, even with a player’s hand, meaning that it is suitable for beginners on their first night but is easier to make a hole in the ground. It is generally not a good idea to use dirt as part of a permanent structure, unless you are explicitly aiming for an “earthen” look, complete with Grass Blocks for extra decor. Alternatively, dirt can be used to “camouflage” a structure made from other materials, either to make it blend in more with the surroundings or make it look less valuable than it actually is. Very common and easy to obtain. - Source: Internet Creating a shelter in your Minecraft world is one of the first important tasks you’ll face. After all, you need a base to rest your weary feet when the sun starts setting and the mobs begin spawning at night. Even if you’re not looking for a starter house and just want to try something new (but achievable) in terms of building challenges, we’re here to help you make the right choice so you don’t find yourself stuck with a structure you can’t finish. - Source: Internet Building most of your home into a mountain is smart when making an underwater house so that you won’t have to deal with the complexities of Minecraft’s water mechanics as much while building. This little underwater home is a perfect example of this. It’s built into a mountain and features a massive window with a perfect ocean view. - Source: Internet BlueBits’ Japanese Minecraft house (opens in new tab) is one of the most elegant builds on this list. What makes this build stand out is the blue roof blocks that really make the whole project pop. If you want a delicate Japanese garden to match, you can check out the second part of the tutorial on how to build just that. - Source: Internet Stone and brick are a good next step, especially once you have a foothold in the game and want a more durable build. Wood may be an adequate place to start, but it doesn’t have quite the same protective edge as non-flammable materials like stone and brick. Accessing stone and materials for bricks requires some extra steps, but they’re widely available. - Source: Internet For those who have ever dreamed of life in the Shire, a hobbit hole is the perfect cozy getaway. Even without a decent hill, it’s possible to build a small sloped house to then cover with dirt. Like a cliff side house, a hobbit hole provides easy access to mines. It also looks like a natural part of the environment. From the back, one can’t even tell it’s a house. - Source: Internet For players who enjoy mountain biomes, a cliff side house is a perfect option. The pictured house, which looks like an old, broken bridge, might be a good fit for those who like fantasy-style builds. Another option for a cliff side house could be a huge tower of stone brick, or maybe a skull-shaped fortress with flaming eyes. - Source: Internet It’s risky to look for caves outside your house. Instead, make this room with staircases lead straight to the mining zone. Animal and Crops Farm Room: Most people build these types of farms outside, but realistically, animals in Minecraft don’t stink so keeping every single farm inside your house is the best option! You can farm trees, wheat, carrots, potatoes, melons, pumpkins, sugarcane, cows, sheep, pigs, chickens, and more! - Source: Internet If you would like a more traditional farmhouse then TheMythicalSausage’s farm build (opens in new tab) is just for you. The allotment for farming is placed right next to the home and has an interesting round shape instead of a square. The wooden bench on the front porch is also a lovely touch. - Source: Internet Once more by Rizzial, this modern house design is perhaps the smallest of the bunch. Still, though, despite its small size, Rizzial manages to fit two different floors, as well as a small porch area leading up to the entrance pathway. It might be small, but its compact size may be a boon if you’re building it in the early game. - Source: Internet contain an enchanting table, bookshelves, lapis lazuli, and books to use to enchant in Minecraft. Portal Room: You can put the Nether portal here. If you’re playing any mod packs, you can build a lot of other portals like the aether, deep dark, mining dimension, and the moon. - Source: Internet You can build a self-sufficient farmhouse in Minecraft that not only looks fantastic but also lets you grow a large amount of food. You can create small square farms divided by fences for different types of plants. Created by Juns Mab, this farmhouse design will allow you to expand your farm around the house quite easily. Building a farmhouse may seem like a lot of work, but it would spare you the time and effort needed to scavenge for food in Minecraft. - Source: Internet Of course, there are tons of architectural styles in the real world for builders to draw inspiration from. Minecraft players have had lots of success with Japanese-style homes, for example. There’s also the ubiquitous European Tudor style, which is very easy to mimic in Minecraft using simple sandstone and shaved wood blocks. - Source: Internet Bricks Bricks have a very pleasant look to them and a high blast resistance. However, they are also rather expensive, even though they are renewable. They are good for buildings with a neutral yet pleasant look, looking similar to Stone Bricks but without the belligerent feel. Bricks also convey and express an image of sturdiness more readily than blocks like Concrete. Has a high blast resistance of 6. - Source: Internet A lot of builds will use materials from the surrounding area to make things easier. But few look as good as this Spruce cabin in the midst of an old-growth biome. The mossy cobblestone makes this build look as ancient as the forest it inhabits. - Source: Internet Modern house ideas are often quite easy to build in Minecraft as they have square designs. Compared to medieval houses, which have a lot of complexity, modern houses just have weaved rectangles. This is an example with a few less complicated weaving to get players familiar with the style. - Source: Internet Easily the longest video on this list, Akila Gaming shows off a massive modern house/villa. While the entire tutorial is more than an hour long, it makes up for this by being one of the most in-depth tutorials out there. It also helps that the build itself is great, complete with a storage room and multiple sleeping areas. - Source: Internet The biggest one on this list so far, designed by RainbowGamerPE. This build takes a lot from the other ones on this list. It makes use of levels and a room-divided layout, while building itself around one centerpoint. Different from the oak planks of previous builds, this one makes use of birch planks, blending in better with the color scheme. - Source: Internet Artists rarely work without a reference. By the same token, using real-world architecture as a jumping-off point for Minecraft builds can have amazing results. Such is the case with the absolutely gorgeous Mediterranean House pictured above. The build is beautiful, with a warm feeling, like a tropical vacation home. - Source: Internet If you liked the underground Minecraft house idea, you can try building an underwater house too. The underwater house was created by Random Steve Guy and has a modern aesthetic. The top floor of the house can be seen above water, while the bottom two floors are submerged underwater. Since the house is covered in transparent glass, you can observe marine life in Minecraft while relaxing in your house. You can also use Minecraft shaders to improve the texture quality of water and make it look even more realistic. - Source: Internet Minecraft is a popular game with colourful blocks that can be used to build whatever you can imagine. Since it is a survival game, building shelter is a necessity to protect yourself from Creepers, Zombies, and other mobs that generally come out at night to attack you. Minecraft offers an overwhelming number of choices when it comes to building your house. You can either create a small hut for survival or build a massive mansion to store your Minecraft diamonds and other resources. If you are running out of design ideas, here are some of the best and cool Minecraft house designs that you must try: - Source: Internet You just started your Minecraft world and are stuck inside a dark, disgusting, and minimal dirt hut with skeletons, zombies, and creepers surrounding you. You think, “Wow! I wish I had a house right about now”. Guess what? You can build Minecraft houses with just a bit of elbow grease and some starter items! - Source: Internet This house is a part of a Tudor house series. This particular build is number 5 in the series. This house was modeled after a real home, and you can see the reference photo via Claire on Instagram. - Source: Internet A beach house is an ideal option in Minecraft if your starting location is near the coast. Designed by Keralis, the beach house has a clean and modern aesthetic with a swimming pool right outside the house. The beach house offers a relaxing abode after a day full of Minecraft adventures. The building process of a beach house can be quite tedious as you need to find a lot of materials. Once you have gathered all the materials, it becomes easier to build the house. - Source: Internet For this house, build 2 blocks up(using spruce logs) in each corner. Then, fill the first layer with stone brick and the second layer with sideways logs. Also, don’t forget the stairs! - Source: Internet If you need to smelt a lot of ores and food, it’s a good idea to build a smelting room that contains a lot of furnaces, smokers, and blast furnaces. You can also build a Redstone railway system here to automatically smelt your items. Storage Room: Chests, barrels, and shulker boxes can be placed here. - Source: Internet When it comes to simple building, Minecraft Villagers have the style mastered. So why not move in? In this extension to a naturally spawning Villager house, we’ve added an extra story and a basement. We’re sure the original owner doesn’t mind! - Source: Internet If you want to build this hill base, here is some of the information you’ll need: Shaders : BSL v8 | Minecraft Version : 1.18.1 | Jerm’s Better Leaves ‏| Henry Pots and Plants. - Source: Internet The wooden house in Minecraft will remind you of an old wooden cabin inside a forest. Created by Greg Builds, the wooden house has symmetrical design and a lot of interior space for furniture. The spacious house can be useful when you are playing with a lot of friends as they can easily hang out in your house. Finally, you can add some plants around the house to complete the building process. - Source: Internet This building has a smaller circle on top of a bigger one to add some layers and variation to the interior design. The open feel this design gives the interior is perfect for people who like everything they need in one centralized location. If more space is needed, it would be effortless to build another layer underground or make the existing layers bigger and go further upwards. - Source: Internet More specifically, this build has two stories, each with several different highly decorated rooms. It also even includes an outdoor farm, which can be used to grow stacks of crops at a time. All in all, this build is absolutely stunning while remaining highly practical for a survival use case. - Source: Internet Living underwater sounds tricky, but in Minecraft, it is easy as pie(or Minecraft cake). Put on your water breathing helmet and start building. This house will keep you safe from every mob in existence. - Source: Internet Finally, let’s decorate the other three sides of your house with plants, slabs, and lighting. For the right side, use 3 composters, 3 leaves, and 6 cobblestone slabs to build the bottom trim. Then use 2 oak fences and 2 lanterns and hang down from the second floor. - Source: Internet Setting up base in a cool castle is one of the most common desires of any Minecraft player. But when you think of building one, elaborate and complicated structures come to mind, and that desire is quickly snuffed out. Here’s where you’re mistaken; a castle doesn’t have to be huge and difficult to create. Watch this castle design video by YouTuber A1MOSTADDICTED MINECRAFT. - Source: Internet While it’s not quite the same as living in a complicated weave of rooms and corridors, there are plenty of ways for simple buildings to still feel like a castle. This design has the essential turrets, which give way to a big entranceway to an open middle room. If this feels too simple for players, then it’s simple to add more turrets or extend the gaps between the existing ones for a more interesting shape. - Source: Internet Wood and cobblestone are two of the most common materials in Minecraft that can be used in building houses. To get some wood, you need to find a tree and chop it down with an axe. Meanwhile, you can get cobblestone by mining a block of stone using a pickaxe. - Source: Internet This design can be quite a modular one, as whenever players need more space, they can build off what they’ve already created. In the image, there is the main house, a smithing area, and a farm, but so much more could be built on top of that. It could be layered outwards and upwards infinitely, creating a towering raft with lots of intricacies. - Source: Internet If you’re a fan of MumboJumbo, you know that Redstone can be complicated and may require testing multiple times. That’s why this room exists! Villager Trading Hall Room: This room becomes an important room to build in Minecraft after the 1.14 update. Why gather the materials manually when you can trade them directly with the villagers? - Source: Internet You won’t get anywhere if you do not have the blocks in place to build your new home. So gather them up and you do not need to stick to one type as Dirt, Wood, or Cobblestone all work. As does sand and gravel - although those last two will not do the job when you get to building the roof. Also, avoid wood where possible as it burns easily. - Source: Internet This room becomes an important room to build in Minecraft after the 1.14 update. Why gather the materials manually when you can trade them directly with the villagers? Hidden Vault: Usually is a part of a bedroom or deep underground, this room contains valuable stuff like diamonds, netherite, beacon, trophies, and more! - Source: Internet Choosing the perfect build site can become an obsession, and there are good reasons to thoroughly consider your choice. For one, some biomes simply don’t offer the same advantages as others. And as you think about the resources and conditions of each biome, be sure to factor in proximity to food and reliable construction materials. - Source: Internet I love the look of this three-story wooden house by YalChu’s Home. You can really see that a lot of time has been put into this build. There is also a tutorial showing you how to build this unique three-story wooden house. - Source: Internet From there, we’ve collected a wide-ranging catalogue of house build blueprints, from quaint and simple to sprawling and palatial. Each has a wealth of worthy additions for your homebuilding bag of tricks. Let’s tour our gallery of Minecraft house ideas, and kick off your newest project. - Source: Internet Don’t let the bright colors of this build fool you because this haunted mansion hides many spooky secrets. It also showcases that spooky doesn’t necessarily mean dark and broody. It can also mean colorful and playful. - Source: Internet TheMythicalSasuage (opens in new tab) has designed the perfect Minecraft survival house. This 8x8 cabin not only looks great, but it’s also easy to build and takes no time at all, making it the perfect place for when you first start a survival map. Just because you’re starting out doesn’t mean your base needs to look basic. - Source: Internet A rather singular Minecraft house idea comes from YouTuber JUNS MAB Architecture tutorial’s Mountain build video. This unique design idea will probably seem unreal and refreshing to you. Yet you can learn to create it in under 10 minutes. - Source: Internet If building a regular house in Minecraft doesn’t excite you as much, you can build an underground house. Designed and created by Spudetti, the underground house has a unique design that looks great from an aerial view. The house is divided into four sections that can be used for storing different types of items or for placing furniture. The house has a wide-open transparent roof, which would be great to look at stars or sunny blue sky. - Source: Internet Sometimes one needs to get away from everything and everyone. If you feel the same way and want to build something unique, check out this video tutorial of an underground house by YouTuber Folli. This simple yet brilliant design only requires some cobblestone, spruce wood, and oak planks. - Source: Internet It is appealing, and yet simple to build. It will definitely count among your favorite easy Minecraft house ideas. With a minimalistic interior design making the most of the limited space, you’ll have a functional and singular dwelling ready in no time. - Source: Internet Stone Bricks Stone Bricks grant a very medieval and in some ways, militaristic feel to structures made out of it and is in many ways the ideal building material for structures meant to look medieval, militaristic and/or fortified in general, like forts and castles. Stone Bricks are style-wise fitting for structures meant to harken back to the High- and Late Middle Ages and later. (Compare with Cobblestone, which looks more fitting for structures aiming look in line with the Early Middle Ages) Obtained by crafting it from Stone (which in turn is obtained by smelting Cobblestone), making it renewable. - Source: Internet It has some other uses, too, and you can make it the focus of a dedicated build if you like its appearance or characteristics. HeySofia addresses the challenges of designing a netherrack home in the seventh episode of her Ugly Block-ing tutorial series. The outcome for her is a versatile, modern space. It’s cozy, but it has a more distinctive feel than brick or other materials. - Source: Internet To kick off the list is Zaypixel’s Autumn cabin (opens in new tab), a home complete with a thatched roof, cushy fireplace, and plenty of pumpkins. This cabin is on the snug side and I love the brick accents throughout the exterior of the cabin. Zaypixel’s tutorial is super easy to follow and together with its soft piano score makes for a relaxing watch even if you’re not planning on building. - Source: Internet Our first tutorial to share has minimal material requirements and a small footprint. The simple design makes it more versatile than a rough starter cabin, too. In other words, it’s a quick build that you may want to use for a while. - Source: Internet To make a lake house a bit more believable, players can build stilts or docks on the water. This can make the build process considerably more difficult, as building underwater is known to be a bit of a pain. However, the results are more than worth it. - Source: Internet I’m loving this Pinkwood Palace. The colors go so well together, and this is such a unique build. Not only that, but there is so much detail that’s been put into this awesome piece. - Source: Internet Turn left, you can build more storage here with some chests and an anvil for smithing purposes. Then add some plants for the green color. Remember to put some carpets on the floor and lanterns on the ceiling for lighting purposes. - Source: Internet One of the most open-ended ways to develop your eye for home building is to bring some nature into it. You can do this however you want, too. Maybe you could use more natural materials in your build, or you can embellish your layout with a garden or agricultural space. Minecraft farm houses are one popular approach, and they require easy-to-find materials while mixing plants into your design. - Source: Internet While the level of difficulty will depend on your final layout, modern homes are one of the game’s more challenging build ideas. They become even more difficult if you want to involve materials like quartz blocks. But if you’re ready for it, you’ll find this is one of the most interesting designs to experiment with. - Source: Internet Sandstone Sandstone looks great for certain style of homes, especially a desert-style home or if one wishes to emulate Ancient Egyptian architecture. It’s strongly recommended to have a desert biome nearby if you want to make a building out of sandstone. It has a low blast resistance, however. Red Sandstone, a variant for normal Sandstone, behaves identically, but has a reddish color, making for a similar style to Red Sand. Fairly easy to decorate with and has several variants for different textures. - Source: Internet Who wouldn’t want to live under the sea in Minecraft? Underwater homes are very cool but notoriously difficult to build and get to. They’re like lake homes turned up to eleven. Still, looking out the window to see dolphins swimming by never quite gets old. - Source: Internet This stylish farmhouse from ZayPixel looks amazing. You can tell that so much time and care was put into creating this beautiful work of art. Thanksfully, there’s a tutorial showing you how to build this awesome farmhouse. - Source: Internet It’s not too difficult to harvest netherrack, but it does require a nether portal for access. You can then use it for building and you may love its unique feature: it burns indefinitely when you ignite the top of the netherrack block. It’s a fun option to play around with when decorating, especially for the medieval houses and underground base in our list. - Source: Internet It’s unfortunate that the game doesn’t (yet) allow you to construct a fully functioning ship or boathouse. But if you want a house on water instead of land anyway, there are plenty of options available to satiate your appetite. Watch this build by YouTuber Nexy come to life. - Source: Internet Quartz blocks are a durable and popular Minecraft building material. While quartz crystals are often clear, these resemble marble. It’s a great element in a modern Minecraft house or even as a primary building material. To acquire it, mine from nether quartz produced from nether quartz ore. - Source: Internet There are tons of different kinds of wood to use as well as many variations of stone and a lot more. Any log cabin or dank dungeon can be transformed with the right building block choice. The possibilities are numerous when it comes to choosing a building material, so, for a unique house design, be sure to think outside the box! - Source: Internet This striking design features smooth quartz, gray concrete, and glass, and will take you no time to build. You can be done with the tutorial itself in 4 minutes. Now that is something we call a quick affair. - Source: Internet The combination of water and an underground house in this build delivers a home that is equally impressive and interesting no matter where you look at it from. Outside, it has a stunning coral reef surrounded by lush greenery. Inside, it has a colorful interior and glass panes with beautiful views of the surrounding water. - Source: Internet Put your beds here to sleep overnight. Some people put their secret chests in this room too! S melting Room: If you need to smelt a lot of ores and food, it’s a good idea to build a smelting room that contains a lot of furnaces, smokers, and blast furnaces. You can also build a Redstone railway system here to automatically smelt your items. - Source: Internet For a more cozy vibe, players can potentially build bunk beds if they have a lot of friends staying in a single house. To do so, simply use fenceposts and wooden slabs to craft a small structure above a bed in order to place another bed on top. Just be sure to leave enough room for the bottom bed so that the player sleeping there won’t get trapped. - Source: Internet This house has off-center windows that compliment the overall nature of the build. We love the realism of this house and how underwater supports were added to hold up the building. The blend of, oak planks, stripped oak, stripped spruce and spruce planks make for an exciting contrast that you cannot find elsewhere. - Source: Internet Another design by WiederDude, this build focuses on making use of the different levels found in a lot of modern builds. While it may be three stories high, each level is split into different areas, allowing for it to be built one room at a time. It also has a pool area, and makes use of wooden accents to really give it that modern look. - Source: Internet Hobbit holes are cozy to some, but cramped to others. The house’s beauty and novelty makes up for its small size. The circular door is tough, but a facsimile can be made using stairs. Complete the build by decorating with barrels, lanterns, a garden, a small chimney, or whatever else feels appropriate. - Source: Internet Obsidian is one of the strongest materials in Minecraft, and you can find it where water encounters lava. Building a house out of obsidian means greater strength and protection. When you’re building, you can use obsidian like any block, and you can use it for a full or partial build. It does require some sophisticated tools, like a diamond pickaxe, to acquire it, otherwise you need to hunt for it in the wild. - Source: Internet The trick when building an underwater house, especially in survival mode, is to find a good location. It’s important to build in an area that’s deep enough to fully submerge a small house, but not so deep that it’s hard to get to. At the bottom of a deep ocean, it’s unlikely that anyone will even find the house (though maybe that’s the intended result). Like a lake house, using warp commands can really improve the viability of the underwater lair. - Source: Internet Thankfully, since Minecraft’s community is so huge and imaginative in its own right, there’s no need for players to hem and haw over their next construction. The world is full of ideas, and it’s beyond simple for players to put their own spin on things. Don’t settle for another mediocre cobblestone house. Take inspiration from these unique Minecraft homes, and get building! - Source: Internet It’s possible you might not have gathered enough materials to start creating complicated houses. A treehouse comes in handy for exactly such situations. Apart from serving as a fun project, you could easily build it and it can offer a nice view. - Source: Internet It’s time to build the interior! Open the front door and go to the first floor. You need to build another staircase leading to the second floor from the inside. Remember to place oak staircases upside down in the back to create depth for your staircases. - Source: Internet The Wild Update is expected to add mangrove swamps and some unique building materials, including mangrove wood. In addition to harvesting the new mangrove variant, you can create mud blocks by adding water to a dirt block. You can easily find mud blocks, too; they appear below the water in mangrove and swamp biomes. - Source: Internet Pink lovers gather around! This house is perfect for anyone who loves fun and likes to take Minecraft less seriously. The details throughout the entire build are unmatched. It reminds me of pop-style interior design that includes saturated, bright colors, with a fun youthful environment. - Source: Internet Building doesn’t always have to be a complicated thing. Sometimes you just want something that simply looks good, but also isn’t ridiculously complicated to make. Like the one above, there are tonnes of wooden designs that are beautiful, and not too hard to put into practice, no matter your experience level with building. - Source: Internet The castle is the ultimate Minecraft build, and something many people aspire to. It’s easy to go overboard with this design, and there are a few absolutely monolithic fortresses out there. However, castles can also be relatively small and functional, like the one pictured above. Players who want to build castles might have more luck starting small with something like this, which would be appropriate even in survival mode. - Source: Internet Twin Saw embraces that sentiment in their prismarine mansion build. The final look is baroque and medieval, with a fantastical flourish thanks to the addition of prismarine and a steep, windowed roof. It’s a great direction if you want that Lord of the Rings feel mixed with a more elaborate look. - Source: Internet Interesting enough, this build by JUNS MAB is designed by a real architect. It’s also massive, featuring three different floors, each one divided into separate rooms. Interesting enough, this build also makes use of pure black, as well as the staple gray concrete present in previous builds. There’s also a controlled waterfall running over the front of the build, which is a nice touch. - Source: Internet Brewing is a big system and you should build a separate room for it if possible. Smithing Room: Besides displaying your armors in the smithing room, you may want to put anvils and smithing tables here as well. The anvil is used to repair items, while the smither table can be used to upgrade your diamond gears to netherite. - Source: Internet With BlueNerd’s tutorial, you can find a manageable design that combines the advantages of a wooden house with a few more complicated materials. As the description points out, his build features bone blocks, which are a little difficult to find. You can use birch for a similar appearance instead. - Source: Internet Minecraft can feel medieval at times, with its swords, armor, and magic tomes. However, with Redstone, players can build mechanical marvels. Things like switched lights, automatic doors, and even elevators can make a player’s home life just that much easier. A well-made “smart house” can be a very impressive thing. - Source: Internet Planks Planks have a rather nice, somewhat rustic look and are inexpensive to make. Their blast resistance is lower than stone but higher than dirt. One of the main disadvantages of wood planks is that they are flammable, so don’t build near lava or any other source of fire. Do not use them in the Nether under any circumstances, due to the flammability issue. Inexpensive and renewable via replanting trees. - Source: Internet OalTee demonstrates a slick way to build modern looking obsidian modules in their short tutorial. The exterior is minimal, but it’s a high impact and simple-to-replicate look. Plus, it’s a great introduction to obsidian, which you’ll find in our more challenging ideas. - Source: Internet Minecraft lets you build amazing treehouses with various designs. You can easily build a small treehouse with just a couple of rooms or a massive one with a balcony, different rooms, and more. The treehouse created by Shock Frost is quite impressive when it comes to its size and overall structure. The treehouse is also pretty spacious, allowing you to add a lot of furniture to decorate the interior of the house. - Source: Internet This pastel pink house is so soft and beautiful by YalChu’s Home. You don’t often come across houses like this, so I was happy I found it. Below, you’ll also find the fun video tutorial showing you how to build this soft pastel pink house. - Source: Internet A lake house can be great for builders who want to make big farms without going through the trouble of irrigating them. The lake water takes care of that job naturally. In addition to being unique and often beautiful, lake houses are difficult to get to and easy to defend. Players may need to rely on boats. Or, on a server, warp commands can be used to complement a truly isolated home base. - Source: Internet You can put the Nether portal here. If you’re playing any mod packs, you can build a lot of other portals like the aether, deep dark, mining dimension, and the moon. Entrance to The Mine: It’s risky to look for caves outside your house. Instead, make this room with staircases lead straight to the mining zone. - Source: Internet Designed and created by SheepGG, the aquarium house is a creative house design for Minecraft. The house has an aquarium that is two storeys big and is filled with plants, fish, and other marine life. Additionally, the Minecraft house has a modern aesthetic and is surrounded by different types of plants. You will need a lot of glass to build the aquarium and other parts of the house. The aquarium house is fairly easy to build once you have all the required materials. - Source: Internet If you’re looking for easy Minecraft house ideas, you’re probably starting off in a new seed or have just begun trying out the game. That’s precisely why we’ve come up with this handy guide to help you wisely choose your project. The limitless freedom of creation Minecraft offers you brings with it endless choices when it comes to building a house. - Source: Internet For the players who didn’t build a wooden box on their first night, it’s likely because they dug into the side of a mountain instead. Hollowing out a few rooms in a mountain is a fairly easy task, and the interior can be designed pretty much any way the player likes. However, the exterior can be so much more than a door on a mountainside. - Source: Internet Everyone begins somewhere, and Minecraft starter houses offer easy-to-build templates based upon procurable materials. But that doesn’t mean Minecraft starter houses are dull. On the contrary, it’s amazing what’s made with minimal, elegant architecture, and some floral decoration. - Source: Internet Mimic houses generally aren’t useful or practical, especially in survival mode, but they’re some of the most fun houses to build. The theme can get really in-depth. A creeper house could be filled with TNT, to surprise unwitting guests. Or, a furnace house could have a floor of burning Netherack, to keep its inhabitants toasty! - Source: Internet Minecraft lets players build absolutely anything they want. That freedom can be scary! It’s not always easy to decide what to build. From titanic castles to underwater hideaways to simple cabins in the woods, the possibilities are literally endless. - Source: Internet JUN MAB’s is back on the list again with their farmhouse build (opens in new tab), which is simply stunning. Instead of having the farm allotment and house separated, they have cleverly tied the two areas together in a staggered structure creating one complete build. Super easy tutorial to follow, and I highly suggest you take a look at their other videos for more beautiful builds. - Source: Internet The beauty of building underground is space, which you can expand by excavating. You can also restrict access and improve protection by building underground, protecting the environment around your HQ and making it less conspicuous. Spudetti’s guide to an easy underground house offers a straightforward design and manageable ingredient list, with big multipurpose spaces. - Source: Internet Standing out from the rest of the crowd, ManDooMin’s “modern” build takes a vastly different approach than the rest. Composed of multiple container-like cells, this build focuses more on expandability than anything else. The simple composition of these cells allows for them to be built at a moment’s notice, and given their size, it’s easy enough to repurpose them should the need arise. - Source: Internet Have you considered building a house on the side of a mountain? If so, you’ll probably love this Acacia Mountain House. I love the use of acacia wood with this mountain house. Image from Reddit. - Source: Internet This beautiful home sits on a stone foundation and features an above-ground basement and a garage. Keep in mind that you’ll need lots of stone, wood and concrete, and some glass. But the final build result will be well worth it. - Source: Internet Here are a few tips to help you find information about Easy Minecraft Builds:\nLook for good places to get information about How to build a Minecraft House - how good can you make yours look?.

Its breaking time can be a pain when <strong>build</strong>ing but is great for protection against other players on multiplayer PVP servers but some players may not like the look. Invincible to vanilla explosions with a blast resistance of 1,200. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You just have to love this cool hobbit hole. It’s so simple, yet truly amazing. Watch the tutorial for <strong>build</strong>ing this cozy little house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The cool thing about castles is that there are so many designs for them. Players can make gargantuan fantasy-style fortresses, realistic bits of gothic architecture, or really anything in between. Castles can feature any number of architectural quirks — balconies, traps, secret passages, and so on. Every castle is a unique testament to the <strong>build</strong>ing skills of its creator. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One last one by RainbowGamerPE, this <strong>build</strong> is left purposefully incomplete, allowing for players to take it in whatever direction they may wish. Still, though, this serves as a useful foundation, allowing for easy expansion. The use of glass is also a nice touch, lending it a more futuristic look than other <strong>build</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The creative possibilities have no bounds. We encourage you to use your imagination and <strong>build</strong>ing skills to construct a house anywhere in the Minecraft world. To bring everything to life you can imagine in Minecraft, learn Minecraft coding in our fun online classes led live by experts. There&rsquo;s no risk in trying with our free Minecraft class intro session. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A greenhouse is a great option for those looking to incorporate lots of plants, even farmable crops into their house <strong>build</strong>. With glass blocks, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to set up a convincing roof (especially if light green or white glass is used). The rest of the structure can be a simple frame made out of wood, stone, or possibly iron blocks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A modern house in Minecraft would look like houses you generally see in the real world. You can make a great house that looks like a mansion using the right materials. Materials like stone, wood, clay, and glass can be used to construct different structures in the house. Created by GoodTimesWithScar, the modern house can require a lot of time and planning to <strong>build</strong>. You can also create a landscaped garden surrounding the house to make it look even better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are no fancy <strong>build</strong>ing techniques for constructing this house. However, it still manages to look fairly interesting, which is mostly thanks to its shape. It&rsquo;s rectangular, but the way it dips inwards and outwards gives the impression of several rectangles stuck together, making for a great house idea in Minecraft when combined with the solid roof design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dirt Dirt is very weak and isn&rsquo;t the most beautiful material to <strong>build</strong> with either. However, it is found on the surface of nearly all biomes and can be mined up very quickly, even with a player&rsquo;s hand, meaning that it is suitable for beginners on their first night but is easier to make a hole in the ground. It is generally not a good idea to use dirt as part of a permanent structure, unless you are explicitly aiming for an &ldquo;earthen&rdquo; look, complete with Grass Blocks for extra decor. Alternatively, dirt can be used to &ldquo;camouflage&rdquo; a structure made from other materials, either to make it blend in more with the surroundings or make it look less valuable than it actually is. Very common and easy to obtain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Creating a shelter in your Minecraft world is one of the first important tasks you’ll face. After all, you need a base to rest your weary feet when the sun starts setting and the mobs begin spawning at night. Even if you’re not looking for a starter house and just want to try something new (but achievable) in terms of <strong>build</strong>ing challenges, we’re here to help you make the right choice so you don’t find yourself stuck with a structure you can’t finish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Building most of your home into a mountain is smart when making an underwater house so that you won’t have to deal with the complexities of Minecraft’s water mechanics as much while <strong>build</strong>ing. This little underwater home is a perfect example of this. It’s built into a mountain and features a massive window with a perfect ocean view. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>BlueBits&rsquo; Japanese Minecraft house (opens in new tab) is one of the most elegant <strong>build</strong>s on this list. What makes this <strong>build</strong> stand out is the blue roof blocks that really make the whole project pop. If you want a delicate Japanese garden to match, you can check out the second part of the tutorial on how to <strong>build</strong> just that. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Stone and brick are a good next step, especially once you have a foothold in the game and want a more durable <strong>build</strong>. Wood may be an adequate place to start, but it doesn’t have quite the same protective edge as non-flammable materials like stone and brick. Accessing stone and materials for bricks requires some extra steps, but they’re widely available. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For those who have ever dreamed of life in the Shire, a hobbit hole is the perfect cozy getaway. Even without a decent hill, it&rsquo;s possible to <strong>build</strong> a small sloped house to then cover with dirt. Like a cliff side house, a hobbit hole provides easy access to mines. It also looks like a natural part of the environment. From the back, one can&rsquo;t even tell it&rsquo;s a house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For players who enjoy mountain biomes, a cliff side house is a perfect option. The pictured house, which looks like an old, broken bridge, might be a good fit for those who like fantasy-style <strong>build</strong>s. Another option for a cliff side house could be a huge tower of stone brick, or maybe a skull-shaped fortress with flaming eyes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s risky to look for caves outside your house. Instead, make this room with staircases lead straight to the mining zone. Animal and Crops Farm Room: Most people <strong>build</strong> these types of farms outside, but realistically, animals in Minecraft don’t stink so keeping every single farm inside your house is the best option! You can farm trees, wheat, carrots, potatoes, melons, pumpkins, sugarcane, cows, sheep, pigs, chickens, and more! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you would like a more traditional farmhouse then TheMythicalSausage&rsquo;s farm <strong>build</strong> (opens in new tab) is just for you. The allotment for farming is placed right next to the home and has an interesting round shape instead of a square. The wooden bench on the front porch is also a lovely touch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Once more by Rizzial, this modern house design is perhaps the smallest of the bunch. Still, though, despite its small size, Rizzial manages to fit two different floors, as well as a small porch area leading up to the entrance pathway. It might be small, but its compact size may be a boon if you’re <strong>build</strong>ing it in the early game. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>contain an enchanting table, bookshelves, lapis lazuli, and books to use to enchant in Minecraft. Portal Room: You can put the Nether portal here. If you’re playing any mod packs, you can <strong>build</strong> a lot of other portals like the aether, deep dark, mining dimension, and the moon. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can <strong>build</strong> a self-sufficient farmhouse in Minecraft that not only looks fantastic but also lets you grow a large amount of food. You can create small square farms divided by fences for different types of plants. Created by Juns Mab, this farmhouse design will allow you to expand your farm around the house quite easily. Building a farmhouse may seem like a lot of work, but it would spare you the time and effort needed to scavenge for food in Minecraft. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Of course, there are tons of architectural styles in the real world for <strong>build</strong>ers to draw inspiration from. Minecraft players have had lots of success with Japanese-style homes, for example. There&rsquo;s also the ubiquitous European Tudor style, which is very easy to mimic in Minecraft using simple sandstone and shaved wood blocks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bricks Bricks have a very pleasant look to them and a high blast resistance. However, they are also rather expensive, even though they are renewable. They are good for <strong>build</strong>ings with a neutral yet pleasant look, looking similar to Stone Bricks but without the belligerent feel. Bricks also convey and express an image of sturdiness more readily than blocks like Concrete. Has a high blast resistance of 6. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A lot of <strong>build</strong>s will use materials from the surrounding area to make things easier. But few look as good as this Spruce cabin in the midst of an old-growth biome. The mossy cobblestone makes this <strong>build</strong> look as ancient as the forest it inhabits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Modern house ideas are often quite easy to <strong>build</strong> in Minecraft as they have square designs. Compared to medieval houses, which have a lot of complexity, modern houses just have weaved rectangles. This is an example with a few less complicated weaving to get players familiar with the style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Easily the longest video on this list, Akila Gaming shows off a massive modern house/villa. While the entire tutorial is more than an hour long, it makes up for this by being one of the most in-depth tutorials out there. It also helps that the <strong>build</strong> itself is great, complete with a storage room and multiple sleeping areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The biggest one on this list so far, designed by RainbowGamerPE. This <strong>build</strong> takes a lot from the other ones on this list. It makes use of levels and a room-divided layout, while <strong>build</strong>ing itself around one centerpoint. Different from the oak planks of previous <strong>build</strong>s, this one makes use of birch planks, blending in better with the color scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Artists rarely work without a reference. By the same token, using real-world architecture as a jumping-off point for Minecraft <strong>build</strong>s can have amazing results. Such is the case with the absolutely gorgeous Mediterranean House pictured above. The <strong>build</strong> is beautiful, with a warm feeling, like a tropical vacation home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you liked the underground Minecraft house idea, you can try <strong>build</strong>ing an underwater house too. The underwater house was created by Random Steve Guy and has a modern aesthetic. The top floor of the house can be seen above water, while the bottom two floors are submerged underwater. Since the house is covered in transparent glass, you can observe marine life in Minecraft while relaxing in your house. You can also use Minecraft shaders to improve the texture quality of water and make it look even more realistic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Minecraft is a popular game with colourful blocks that can be used to <strong>build</strong> whatever you can imagine. Since it is a survival game, <strong>build</strong>ing shelter is a necessity to protect yourself from Creepers, Zombies, and other mobs that generally come out at night to attack you. Minecraft offers an overwhelming number of choices when it comes to <strong>build</strong>ing your house. You can either create a small hut for survival or <strong>build</strong> a massive mansion to store your Minecraft diamonds and other resources. If you are running out of design ideas, here are some of the best and cool Minecraft house designs that you must try: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You just started your Minecraft world and are stuck inside a dark, disgusting, and minimal dirt hut with skeletons, zombies, and creepers surrounding you. You think, “Wow! I wish I had a house right about now”. Guess what? You can <strong>build</strong> Minecraft houses with just a bit of elbow grease and some starter items! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This house is a part of a Tudor house series. This particular <strong>build</strong> is number 5 in the series. This house was modeled after a real home, and you can see the reference photo via Claire on Instagram. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A beach house is an ideal option in Minecraft if your starting location is near the coast. Designed by Keralis, the beach house has a clean and modern aesthetic with a swimming pool right outside the house. The beach house offers a relaxing abode after a day full of Minecraft adventures. The <strong>build</strong>ing process of a beach house can be quite tedious as you need to find a lot of materials. Once you have gathered all the materials, it becomes easier to <strong>build</strong> the house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For this house, <strong>build</strong> 2 blocks up(using spruce logs) in each corner. Then, fill the first layer with stone brick and the second layer with sideways logs. Also, don’t forget the stairs! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you need to smelt a lot of ores and food, it’s a good idea to <strong>build</strong> a smelting room that contains a lot of furnaces, smokers, and blast furnaces. You can also <strong>build</strong> a Redstone railway system here to automatically smelt your items. Storage Room: Chests, barrels, and shulker boxes can be placed here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to simple <strong>build</strong>ing, Minecraft Villagers have the style mastered. So why not move in? In this extension to a naturally spawning Villager house, we&rsquo;ve added an extra story and a basement. We&rsquo;re sure the original owner doesn&rsquo;t mind! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to <strong>build</strong> this hill base, here is some of the information you’ll need: Shaders : BSL v8 | Minecraft Version : 1.18.1 | Jerm’s Better Leaves ‏| Henry Pots and Plants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The wooden house in Minecraft will remind you of an old wooden cabin inside a forest. Created by Greg Builds, the wooden house has symmetrical design and a lot of interior space for furniture. The spacious house can be useful when you are playing with a lot of friends as they can easily hang out in your house. Finally, you can add some plants around the house to complete the <strong>build</strong>ing process. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>build</strong>ing has a smaller circle on top of a bigger one to add some layers and variation to the interior design. The open feel this design gives the interior is perfect for people who like everything they need in one centralized location. If more space is needed, it would be effortless to <strong>build</strong> another layer underground or make the existing layers bigger and go further upwards. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>More specifically, this <strong>build</strong> has two stories, each with several different highly decorated rooms. It also even includes an outdoor farm, which can be used to grow stacks of crops at a time. All in all, this <strong>build</strong> is absolutely stunning while remaining highly practical for a survival use case. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Living underwater sounds tricky, but in Minecraft, it is easy as pie(or Minecraft cake). Put on your water breathing helmet and start <strong>build</strong>ing. This house will keep you safe from every mob in existence. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Finally, let’s decorate the other three sides of your house with plants, slabs, and lighting. For the right side, use 3 composters, 3 leaves, and 6 cobblestone slabs to <strong>build</strong> the bottom trim. Then use 2 oak fences and 2 lanterns and hang down from the second floor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Setting up base in a cool castle is one of the most common desires of any Minecraft player. But when you think of <strong>build</strong>ing one, elaborate and complicated structures come to mind, and that desire is quickly snuffed out. Here’s where you’re mistaken; a castle doesn’t have to be huge and difficult to create. Watch this castle design video by YouTuber A1MOSTADDICTED MINECRAFT. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While it&rsquo;s not quite the same as living in a complicated weave of rooms and corridors, there are plenty of ways for simple <strong>build</strong>ings to still feel like a castle. This design has the essential turrets, which give way to a big entranceway to an open middle room. If this feels too simple for players, then it&rsquo;s simple to add more turrets or extend the gaps between the existing ones for a more interesting shape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wood and cobblestone are two of the most common materials in Minecraft that can be used in <strong>build</strong>ing houses. To get some wood, you need to find a tree and chop it down with an axe. Meanwhile, you can get cobblestone by mining a block of stone using a pickaxe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This design can be quite a modular one, as whenever players need more space, they can <strong>build</strong> off what they&rsquo;ve already created. In the image, there is the main house, a smithing area, and a farm, but so much more could be built on top of that. It could be layered outwards and upwards infinitely, creating a towering raft with lots of intricacies. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re a fan of MumboJumbo, you know that Redstone can be complicated and may require testing multiple times. That’s why this room exists! Villager Trading Hall Room: This room becomes an important room to <strong>build</strong> in Minecraft after the 1.14 update. Why gather the materials manually when you can trade them directly with the villagers? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You won&rsquo;t get anywhere if you do not have the blocks in place to <strong>build</strong> your new home. So gather them up and you do not need to stick to one type as Dirt, Wood, or Cobblestone all work. As does sand and gravel - although those last two will not do the job when you get to <strong>build</strong>ing the roof. Also, avoid wood where possible as it burns easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This room becomes an important room to <strong>build</strong> in Minecraft after the 1.14 update. Why gather the materials manually when you can trade them directly with the villagers? Hidden Vault: Usually is a part of a bedroom or deep underground, this room contains valuable stuff like diamonds, netherite, beacon, trophies, and more! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Choosing the perfect <strong>build</strong> site can become an obsession, and there are good reasons to thoroughly consider your choice. For one, some biomes simply don’t offer the same advantages as others. And as you think about the resources and conditions of each biome, be sure to factor in proximity to food and reliable construction materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I love the look of this three-story wooden house by YalChu’s Home. You can really see that a lot of time has been put into this <strong>build</strong>. There is also a tutorial showing you how to <strong>build</strong> this unique three-story wooden house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>From there, we’ve collected a wide-ranging catalogue of house <strong>build</strong> blueprints, from quaint and simple to sprawling and palatial. Each has a wealth of worthy additions for your home<strong>build</strong>ing bag of tricks. Let’s tour our gallery of Minecraft house ideas, and kick off your newest project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Don’t let the bright colors of this <strong>build</strong> fool you because this haunted mansion hides many spooky secrets. It also showcases that spooky doesn’t necessarily mean dark and broody. It can also mean colorful and playful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>TheMythicalSasuage (opens in new tab) has designed the perfect Minecraft survival house. This 8x8 cabin not only looks great, but it&rsquo;s also easy to <strong>build</strong> and takes no time at all, making it the perfect place for when you first start a survival map. Just because you&rsquo;re starting out doesn&rsquo;t mean your base needs to look basic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A rather singular Minecraft house idea comes from YouTuber JUNS MAB Architecture tutorial’s Mountain <strong>build</strong> video. This unique design idea will probably seem unreal and refreshing to you. Yet you can learn to create it in under 10 minutes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If <strong>build</strong>ing a regular house in Minecraft doesn’t excite you as much, you can <strong>build</strong> an underground house. Designed and created by Spudetti, the underground house has a unique design that looks great from an aerial view. The house is divided into four sections that can be used for storing different types of items or for placing furniture. The house has a wide-open transparent roof, which would be great to look at stars or sunny blue sky. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sometimes one needs to get away from everything and everyone. If you feel the same way and want to <strong>build</strong> something unique, check out this video tutorial of an underground house by YouTuber Folli. This simple yet brilliant design only requires some cobblestone, spruce wood, and oak planks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It is appealing, and yet simple to <strong>build</strong>. It will definitely count among your favorite easy Minecraft house ideas. With a minimalistic interior design making the most of the limited space, you’ll have a functional and singular dwelling ready in no time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Stone Bricks Stone Bricks grant a very medieval and in some ways, militaristic feel to structures made out of it and is in many ways the ideal <strong>build</strong>ing material for structures meant to look medieval, militaristic and/or fortified in general, like forts and castles. Stone Bricks are style-wise fitting for structures meant to harken back to the High- and Late Middle Ages and later. (Compare with Cobblestone, which looks more fitting for structures aiming look in line with the Early Middle Ages) Obtained by crafting it from Stone (which in turn is obtained by smelting Cobblestone), making it renewable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It has some other uses, too, and you can make it the focus of a dedicated <strong>build</strong> if you like its appearance or characteristics. HeySofia addresses the challenges of designing a netherrack home in the seventh episode of her Ugly Block-ing tutorial series. The outcome for her is a versatile, modern space. It’s cozy, but it has a more distinctive feel than brick or other materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To kick off the list is Zaypixel&rsquo;s Autumn cabin (opens in new tab), a home complete with a thatched roof, cushy fireplace, and plenty of pumpkins. This cabin is on the snug side and I love the brick accents throughout the exterior of the cabin. Zaypixel&rsquo;s tutorial is super easy to follow and together with its soft piano score makes for a relaxing watch even if you&rsquo;re not planning on <strong>build</strong>ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Our first tutorial to share has minimal material requirements and a small footprint. The simple design makes it more versatile than a rough starter cabin, too. In other words, it’s a quick <strong>build</strong> that you may want to use for a while. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To make a lake house a bit more believable, players can <strong>build</strong> stilts or docks on the water. This can make the <strong>build</strong> process considerably more difficult, as <strong>build</strong>ing underwater is known to be a bit of a pain. However, the results are more than worth it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I’m loving this Pinkwood Palace. The colors go so well together, and this is such a unique <strong>build</strong>. Not only that, but there is so much detail that’s been put into this awesome piece. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Turn left, you can <strong>build</strong> more storage here with some chests and an anvil for smithing purposes. Then add some plants for the green color. Remember to put some carpets on the floor and lanterns on the ceiling for lighting purposes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the most open-ended ways to develop your eye for home <strong>build</strong>ing is to bring some nature into it. You can do this however you want, too. Maybe you could use more natural materials in your <strong>build</strong>, or you can embellish your layout with a garden or agricultural space. Minecraft farm houses are one popular approach, and they require easy-to-find materials while mixing plants into your design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While the level of difficulty will depend on your final layout, modern homes are one of the game’s more challenging <strong>build</strong> ideas. They become even more difficult if you want to involve materials like quartz blocks. But if you’re ready for it, you’ll find this is one of the most interesting designs to experiment with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sandstone Sandstone looks great for certain style of homes, especially a desert-style home or if one wishes to emulate Ancient Egyptian architecture. It&rsquo;s strongly recommended to have a desert biome nearby if you want to make a <strong>build</strong>ing out of sandstone. It has a low blast resistance, however. Red Sandstone, a variant for normal Sandstone, behaves identically, but has a reddish color, making for a similar style to Red Sand. Fairly easy to decorate with and has several variants for different textures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to live under the sea in Minecraft? Underwater homes are very cool but notoriously difficult to <strong>build</strong> and get to. They&rsquo;re like lake homes turned up to eleven. Still, looking out the window to see dolphins swimming by never quite gets old. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This stylish farmhouse from ZayPixel looks amazing. You can tell that so much time and care was put into creating this beautiful work of art. Thanksfully, there’s a tutorial showing you how to <strong>build</strong> this awesome farmhouse. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s not too difficult to harvest netherrack, but it does require a nether portal for access. You can then use it for <strong>build</strong>ing and you may love its unique feature: it burns indefinitely when you ignite the top of the netherrack block. It’s a fun option to play around with when decorating, especially for the medieval houses and underground base in our list. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s unfortunate that the game doesn’t (yet) allow you to construct a fully functioning ship or boathouse. But if you want a house on water instead of land anyway, there are plenty of options available to satiate your appetite. Watch this <strong>build</strong> by YouTuber Nexy come to life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Quartz blocks are a durable and popular Minecraft <strong>build</strong>ing material. While quartz crystals are often clear, these resemble marble. It’s a great element in a modern Minecraft house or even as a primary <strong>build</strong>ing material. To acquire it, mine from nether quartz produced from nether quartz ore. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are tons of different kinds of wood to use as well as many variations of stone and a lot more. Any log cabin or dank dungeon can be transformed with the right <strong>build</strong>ing block choice. The possibilities are numerous when it comes to choosing a <strong>build</strong>ing material, so, for a unique house design, be sure to think outside the box! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This striking design features smooth quartz, gray concrete, and glass, and will take you no time to <strong>build</strong>. You can be done with the tutorial itself in 4 minutes. Now that is something we call a quick affair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The combination of water and an underground house in this <strong>build</strong> delivers a home that is equally impressive and interesting no matter where you look at it from. Outside, it has a stunning coral reef surrounded by lush greenery. Inside, it has a colorful interior and glass panes with beautiful views of the surrounding water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Put your beds here to sleep overnight. Some people put their secret chests in this room too! S melting Room: If you need to smelt a lot of ores and food, it’s a good idea to <strong>build</strong> a smelting room that contains a lot of furnaces, smokers, and blast furnaces. You can also <strong>build</strong> a Redstone railway system here to automatically smelt your items. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For a more cozy vibe, players can potentially <strong>build</strong> bunk beds if they have a lot of friends staying in a single house. To do so, simply use fenceposts and wooden slabs to craft a small structure above a bed in order to place another bed on top. Just be sure to leave enough room for the bottom bed so that the player sleeping there won&rsquo;t get trapped. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This house has off-center windows that compliment the overall nature of the <strong>build</strong>. We love the realism of this house and how underwater supports were added to hold up the <strong>build</strong>ing. The blend of, oak planks, stripped oak, stripped spruce and spruce planks make for an exciting contrast that you cannot find elsewhere. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another design by WiederDude, this <strong>build</strong> focuses on making use of the different levels found in a lot of modern <strong>build</strong>s. While it may be three stories high, each level is split into different areas, allowing for it to be built one room at a time. It also has a pool area, and makes use of wooden accents to really give it that modern look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hobbit holes are cozy to some, but cramped to others. The house&rsquo;s beauty and novelty makes up for its small size. The circular door is tough, but a facsimile can be made using stairs. Complete the <strong>build</strong> by decorating with barrels, lanterns, a garden, a small chimney, or whatever else feels appropriate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Obsidian is one of the strongest materials in Minecraft, and you can find it where water encounters lava. Building a house out of obsidian means greater strength and protection. When you’re <strong>build</strong>ing, you can use obsidian like any block, and you can use it for a full or partial <strong>build</strong>. It does require some sophisticated tools, like a diamond pickaxe, to acquire it, otherwise you need to hunt for it in the wild. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The trick when <strong>build</strong>ing an underwater house, especially in survival mode, is to find a good location. It&rsquo;s important to <strong>build</strong> in an area that&rsquo;s deep enough to fully submerge a small house, but not so deep that it&rsquo;s hard to get to. At the bottom of a deep ocean, it&rsquo;s unlikely that anyone will even find the house (though maybe that&rsquo;s the intended result). Like a lake house, using warp commands can really improve the viability of the underwater lair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Thankfully, since Minecraft&rsquo;s community is so huge and imaginative in its own right, there&rsquo;s no need for players to hem and haw over their next construction. The world is full of ideas, and it&rsquo;s beyond simple for players to put their own spin on things. Don&rsquo;t settle for another mediocre cobblestone house. Take inspiration from these unique Minecraft homes, and get <strong>build</strong>ing! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s possible you might not have gathered enough materials to start creating complicated houses. A treehouse comes in handy for exactly such situations. Apart from serving as a fun project, you could easily <strong>build</strong> it and it can offer a nice view. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s time to <strong>build</strong> the interior! Open the front door and go to the first floor. You need to <strong>build</strong> another staircase leading to the second floor from the inside. Remember to place oak staircases upside down in the back to create depth for your staircases. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Wild Update is expected to add mangrove swamps and some unique <strong>build</strong>ing materials, including mangrove wood. In addition to harvesting the new mangrove variant, you can create mud blocks by adding water to a dirt block. You can easily find mud blocks, too; they appear below the water in mangrove and swamp biomes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pink lovers gather around! This house is perfect for anyone who loves fun and likes to take Minecraft less seriously. The details throughout the entire <strong>build</strong> are unmatched. It reminds me of pop-style interior design that includes saturated, bright colors, with a fun youthful environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Building doesn’t always have to be a complicated thing. Sometimes you just want something that simply looks good, but also isn’t ridiculously complicated to make. Like the one above, there are tonnes of wooden designs that are beautiful, and not too hard to put into practice, no matter your experience level with <strong>build</strong>ing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The castle is the ultimate Minecraft <strong>build</strong>, and something many people aspire to. It&rsquo;s easy to go overboard with this design, and there are a few absolutely monolithic fortresses out there. However, castles can also be relatively small and functional, like the one pictured above. Players who want to <strong>build</strong> castles might have more luck starting small with something like this, which would be appropriate even in survival mode. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Twin Saw embraces that sentiment in their prismarine mansion <strong>build</strong>. The final look is baroque and medieval, with a fantastical flourish thanks to the addition of prismarine and a steep, windowed roof. It’s a great direction if you want that Lord of the Rings feel mixed with a more elaborate look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Interesting enough, this <strong>build</strong> by JUNS MAB is designed by a real architect. It’s also massive, featuring three different floors, each one divided into separate rooms. Interesting enough, this <strong>build</strong> also makes use of pure black, as well as the staple gray concrete present in previous <strong>build</strong>s. There’s also a controlled waterfall running over the front of the <strong>build</strong>, which is a nice touch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Brewing is a big system and you should <strong>build</strong> a separate room for it if possible. Smithing Room: Besides displaying your armors in the smithing room, you may want to put anvils and smithing tables here as well. The anvil is used to repair items, while the smither table can be used to upgrade your diamond gears to netherite. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With BlueNerd’s tutorial, you can find a manageable design that combines the advantages of a wooden house with a few more complicated materials. As the description points out, his <strong>build</strong> features bone blocks, which are a little difficult to find. You can use birch for a similar appearance instead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Minecraft can feel medieval at times, with its swords, armor, and magic tomes. However, with Redstone, players can <strong>build</strong> mechanical marvels. Things like switched lights, automatic doors, and even elevators can make a player&rsquo;s home life just that much easier. A well-made &ldquo;smart house&rdquo; can be a very impressive thing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Planks Planks have a rather nice, somewhat rustic look and are inexpensive to make. Their blast resistance is lower than stone but higher than dirt. One of the main disadvantages of wood planks is that they are flammable, so don&rsquo;t <strong>build</strong> near lava or any other source of fire. Do not use them in the Nether under any circumstances, due to the flammability issue. Inexpensive and renewable via replanting trees. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>OalTee demonstrates a slick way to <strong>build</strong> modern looking obsidian modules in their short tutorial. The exterior is minimal, but it’s a high impact and simple-to-replicate look. Plus, it’s a great introduction to obsidian, which you’ll find in our more challenging ideas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Minecraft lets you <strong>build</strong> amazing treehouses with various designs. You can easily <strong>build</strong> a small treehouse with just a couple of rooms or a massive one with a balcony, different rooms, and more. The treehouse created by Shock Frost is quite impressive when it comes to its size and overall structure. The treehouse is also pretty spacious, allowing you to add a lot of furniture to decorate the interior of the house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This pastel pink house is so soft and beautiful by YalChu’s Home. You don’t often come across houses like this, so I was happy I found it. Below, you’ll also find the fun video tutorial showing you how to <strong>build</strong> this soft pastel pink house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A lake house can be great for <strong>build</strong>ers who want to make big farms without going through the trouble of irrigating them. The lake water takes care of that job naturally. In addition to being unique and often beautiful, lake houses are difficult to get to and easy to defend. Players may need to rely on boats. Or, on a server, warp commands can be used to complement a truly isolated home base. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can put the Nether portal here. If you’re playing any mod packs, you can <strong>build</strong> a lot of other portals like the aether, deep dark, mining dimension, and the moon. Entrance to The Mine: It’s risky to look for caves outside your house. Instead, make this room with staircases lead straight to the mining zone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Designed and created by SheepGG, the aquarium house is a creative house design for Minecraft. The house has an aquarium that is two storeys big and is filled with plants, fish, and other marine life. Additionally, the Minecraft house has a modern aesthetic and is surrounded by different types of plants. You will need a lot of glass to <strong>build</strong> the aquarium and other parts of the house. The aquarium house is fairly easy to <strong>build</strong> once you have all the required materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re looking for easy Minecraft house ideas, you’re probably starting off in a new seed or have just begun trying out the game. That’s precisely why we’ve come up with this handy guide to help you wisely choose your project. The limitless freedom of creation Minecraft offers you brings with it endless choices when it comes to <strong>build</strong>ing a house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For the players who didn&rsquo;t <strong>build</strong> a wooden box on their first night, it&rsquo;s likely because they dug into the side of a mountain instead. Hollowing out a few rooms in a mountain is a fairly easy task, and the interior can be designed pretty much any way the player likes. However, the exterior can be so much more than a door on a mountainside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Everyone begins somewhere, and Minecraft starter houses offer easy-to-<strong>build</strong> templates based upon procurable materials. But that doesn’t mean Minecraft starter houses are dull. On the contrary, it’s amazing what’s made with minimal, elegant architecture, and some floral decoration. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Mimic houses generally aren&rsquo;t useful or practical, especially in survival mode, but they&rsquo;re some of the most fun houses to <strong>build</strong>. The theme can get really in-depth. A creeper house could be filled with TNT, to surprise unwitting guests. Or, a furnace house could have a floor of burning Netherack, to keep its inhabitants toasty! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Minecraft lets players <strong>build</strong> absolutely anything they want. That freedom can be scary! It&rsquo;s not always easy to decide what to <strong>build</strong>. From titanic castles to underwater hideaways to simple cabins in the woods, the possibilities are literally endless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>JUN MAB&rsquo;s is back on the list again with their farmhouse <strong>build</strong> (opens in new tab), which is simply stunning. Instead of having the farm allotment and house separated, they have cleverly tied the two areas together in a staggered structure creating one complete <strong>build</strong>. Super easy tutorial to follow, and I highly suggest you take a look at their other videos for more beautiful <strong>build</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The beauty of <strong>build</strong>ing underground is space, which you can expand by excavating. You can also restrict access and improve protection by <strong>build</strong>ing underground, protecting the environment around your HQ and making it less conspicuous. Spudetti’s guide to an easy underground house offers a straightforward design and manageable ingredient list, with big multipurpose spaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Standing out from the rest of the crowd, ManDooMin’s “modern” <strong>build</strong> takes a vastly different approach than the rest. Composed of multiple container-like cells, this <strong>build</strong> focuses more on expandability than anything else. The simple composition of these cells allows for them to be built at a moment’s notice, and given their size, it’s easy enough to repurpose them should the need arise. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Have you considered <strong>build</strong>ing a house on the side of a mountain? If so, you’ll probably love this Acacia Mountain House. I love the use of acacia wood with this mountain house. Image from Reddit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This beautiful home sits on a stone foundation and features an above-ground basement and a garage. Keep in mind that you’ll need lots of stone, wood and concrete, and some glass. But the final <strong>build</strong> result will be well worth it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c5/e9/df/c5e9df773ba68784cf601710a707ebe0--minecraft-tips-minecraft-creations.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="How To Build A Good House In Minecraft Easy - Before you go..."><p>Here are a few tips to help you find information about Easy Minecraft Builds:</p><ul><li>Look for good places to get information about How to build a Minecraft House - how good can you make yours look?.
