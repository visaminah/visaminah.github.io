Cosmetic car repairs are those for which there’s no engine damage or structural damage. We’re talking fender-benders, bent hoods, and so forth. - Source: Internet At Gordon’s, the staff strips off the car’s original paint and the doors and moldings are removed before painting. After painting, a car will sit one week to allow the paint to cure, said owner George Squyres, who bought the shop from the founder in 1984. The car is then lightly sanded and buffed. - Source: Internet First of all, Maaco primarily does quick, one-coat paint application jobs. Instead of removing the body panels from a vehicle, and painting each of them separately, Maaco preps, masks, and paints the entire vehicle. This allows them to save time per vehicle. In the service industry, time is money. - Source: Internet Before you get started, you’ll need two things above all else: time and space. Give yourself enough time to sand, repair, paint, and dry your vehicle. This is a crucial step that can save you big headaches with smeared or damaged paint. Space is vital, because unless you’re a machine (you’re probably not), painting a car will take time. You’ll need a safe space to store the car where the paint job can be done without damaging the paint or annoying your neighbors. - Source: Internet remember, you do get what you pay for, but more importantly, you also get out of it what you put into it… actually, i had the bug painted twice by scheib. the first time, i skimped on the prep and was unhappy as the paint highlighted my crappy prep-job… the next time, i spent a week of sumer vacation sanding and smoothing the whole thing… both jobs (maaco and scheib) lasted until i soild the cars – about 3 years later (and likely a lot longer). - Source: Internet Most trucks have a similar amount of paintable surface area to an SUV. Again, several factors will go into your estimate, including prep work, repairs, and truck size. Overall, the average price for a paint job for a truck at Maaco is $700-$1,000. - Source: Internet Maaco has four paint packages to choose from, including Basic (1 year warranty), Preferred (3 year warranty), Premium (5 year warranty) and Platinum (5 year warranty). The different packages are designed to meet the needs of any customer’s financial situation, but each package has a different durability and appearance grade. This means that a Basic tier paint job will not look nearly as good and will not last nearly as long as a Premium tier paint job. If you wish to change the color of your car, there is an additional cost. - Source: Internet Some people may turn up their noses at a Maaco paint job. There are entire online forums dedicated to the question of Maaco’s reputation. I checked two reliable sources: the Better Business Bureau, and Consumer Affairs. - Source: Internet As a consumer, I have the option to choose. That’s why I chose to get another painter to do my buggy, including all labor. It cost much more than I paid Maaco for the previous job, but was worth every penny, and I suspect the paint will look as good 5 years from now, unlike the Faded, cracking, flaking Maaco job that is only 2 years old. - Source: Internet Yankee, Have you had a car painted by Maaco? How did it turn out for you? I didn’t expect a show-winning paint job for $600, but I also didn’t expect Maaco to paint over dirt. You REALLY needed to see this in person to believe it. It was absolutely disgraceful. 2 hours worth of sanding/cleaning would have made a world of difference in the paint. It is totally obvious Maaco put it in the booth, blew it off, taped it up, and started spraying. - Source: Internet good luck. play hardball, be up-front and honest (its a bug, not a mercedes) and don’t let them talk you into more stuff – a $50 under-the-table tip will buy you a better paint job than a $100 “paint-upgrade”. find a few maaco’s in adjacent towns. if one gets cranky, walk out and go to the other. - Source: Internet Here, autos follow a procedure mimicked at the 32 other 1 Day shops from Los Angeles to Albuquerque. First any dents are fixed, the car’s surface is sanded, primer is applied and windows and moldings masked with tape and paper. (Like most paint shops, most of the cars that come into 1 Day need body work as well.) - Source: Internet On 4/5/22 I arrived at the office to pick-up the vehicle with my wife and was handed a piece of paper and asked to sign it. I asked if we should go and inspect the vehicle first and he agreed and we walked out to inspect it together. Upon inspection I noticed numerous areas where the paint ran, numerous areas where paint appears to have “Globbed-up” especially bad around the roof antenna and damage on the front passenger fender and rear bumper that wasn’t there before and had been painted over. I inquired about the damage and was offered no apology or explanation. - Source: Internet Maaco operates its stores as franchises. The franchise owner sets the tone for the store, not Maaco. As a result, there may be different standards and procedures at different Maaco locations. Research locations in your area before taking your car in to be painted. - Source: Internet They did a very good job and for $350 its well worth it. My car’s paint was peeling and fading and a friend of mine scraped my fender/bumper. So he gave me someoney to paint the Bumper but i thought if i put in some more money i can get the whole car painted. I have read about Maaco and alot of people said they sucked and dont go for it. I just wanted the car painted just for the hell of it and look how they turned out!BTW: This is a 1992 Lexus SC400 All-Stock - Source: Internet The first thing you’ll need is a polyurethane auto body paint, similar to the paint used by Maaco’s professional and premier tiers. This paint is a single-stage acrylic paint that would deliver similar results. You will probably need about three quarts for the average paint job. - Source: Internet This step should eliminate any surface scratches or dings. Sealer: Maaco offers three levels of sealer. This step is designed to create a fresh foundation for the new paint. - Source: Internet Maaco was founded in 1972 by Tony Martino in Delaware under the company name “Driven Brands”. In just five years, his one store grew to 200 paint and auto centers in North America. The 1980’s brought a huge advertising campaign, including their famous slogan, “Uh-oh! Better get Maaco!” - Source: Internet Spot painting is a small, localized paint job to repair damage, usually due to a minor bump or accident. The areas in need of repair are sanded, then painted to blend in with the rest of the vehicle. Once the paint is touched up, the car is sealed and buffed. - Source: Internet There was the young man who wanted his 1964 Impala painted Day-Glo Green. The middle-aged woman who wanted the color of her aging Thunderbird to match her favorite lavender belt. Then, there was the young woman who wanted her Volkswagen painted pink–not any pink, bubble-gum pink–and she brought in a piece of gum to show the painter. - Source: Internet According to Consumer Affairs, Maaco currently has 3.8 stars out of 5, based on 57 ratings in the last year. Common complaints include color errors, or rough finishes. Many customers were pleased with the paint job and customer service at their local franchise. - Source: Internet 73resto, no way in HELL would I pay them 3,795 for a paintjob! Like bob said, nobody can give you a quote like that over the phone. If you even considered paying that, I would spend the money to do it yourself and buy the equipment. If you have any doubts about the gun, I’d get a new one, but thats just me. - Source: Internet Panel replacement or repairs have a one-year warranty against cracking, shrinking, or rust. Surface or rust repairs only have a 90-day warranty. Paint jobs have a one to five-year warranty against delamination, cracking, and peeling. The warranty length depends on whether you purchase the basic, preferred, or premium paint job. - Source: Internet In car crazy Southern California, such requests no longer faze many of the more than 4,000 auto paint shops owners. The region embraced the idea of giving a paint jobs to old cars long ago, giving rise to the nation’s first auto painting chains. Now, the rest of the nation is rapidly following suit. - Source: Internet One of the things that’s all the rage in some enthusiast circles these days is heavy patina on classic cars. This 1953 Pontiac Chieftain has plenty of it after years of sitting, but the owner decided to correct that problem with a $2,500 Maaco paint job. The move is proving to be fairly controversial as everyone has different opinions of not only whether he should have done this but also what would’ve been a better alternative. - Source: Internet Don’t immediately start spraying your vehicle! Practice with the spray gun first. If you have running paint, or the paint applies unevenly, adjust the nozzle and try again. Don’t start painting your car until you are satisfied with the spray pattern and your skill with the paint gun. - Source: Internet Most of us have considered changing our vehicle’s color, but very few actually go through with it. That’s for a few reasons, mainly related to cost and time because changing a car’s color is a lot more involved than just painting in the same shade. Before changing your car’s color, here are some things to keep in mind: - Source: Internet After a while, that shiny new car you were so proud of starts to look dingy and faded. The paint has taken a beating over the years and all you’re left with is a car in a different color (or colors) than the one you started with. You could throw in the towel and just buy a new car, but those are the words of a quitter. Your other, much braver choice is to have the car painted by a pro, or yourself, to restore its former glory. - Source: Internet “This is kind of middle of the road auto painting,” said Uribe, whose father founded the chain in 1967. “This isn’t the place for a new Rolls-Royce.” - Source: Internet It is difficult to see any uneven or wavy patterns on a dull car. After you have sanded down the primer, apply a very light coat of wax and grease remover down the side of the car. This will replicate the shine of your final paint job. Sight down the shiny surface of the car to look for any unevenness. - Source: Internet The paint the Pontiac is wearing when the video begins is some sort of pastel green. If it’s not the factory color, it’s probably something that was used in the factory or it’s at least period correct. Some people think he should’ve stuck with that color or at least another pastel. The Plum Crazy he did go with looks nice, especially for $2,500, but you have to wonder how it’ll hold up over time. Plus it’s not a Pontiac color at all, a fact which makes some people, well… crazy. - Source: Internet If you’re looking to advertise your business on a commercial vehicle, you’re probably looking for a custom paint job. These can be pricey, ranging from $1,000-$5,000. Vinyl vehicle wraps are a more cost-effective alternative to a custom paint job. - Source: Internet Now, after weeks of prep, Emilio’s car is ready to be repainted. After we talked with the MAACO body shop owner, he agreed to meet with Emilio once the car is done to try to come to some sort of agreement. We will follow-up. - Source: Internet There are several reputable places in the U.S. where you can have your car painted, including auto shops like MAACO or Service King, dealerships like Ford or Toyota, and local paint shops. - Source: Internet Whether you’ve been in a collision and your vehicle has sustained paint damage, or you just want a new color on an old classic, getting the paint job right is extremely important. After all, it’s the first thing people see! Without the proper prep work or the right technicians, you can end up with a vehicle that looks even worse than it did before it got painted! Today, we’re taking a close look at Maaco paint job, the auto painting, and collision repair shop you know from its infamous “uh oh, better get Maaco!” ads that ran in the 1980s and 1990s. Maaco specializes in providing cheap, fast bodywork and paint jobs, but if you take a look online, you’ll see some pretty mixed reviews. - Source: Internet Posted: Sun Nov 30, 2003 9:50 pm Post subject: I considered Maaco for painting a bus not too long ago, even went so far as to take it in for a quote. I just got the feeling the were going to do a shitty job of it, putting in an absolute bare minimum of effort, so I wound up doing it myself. It cost twice as much, because I decided I might as well get a better quality of paint while I was at it, but I was happy with the result. I found a local shop that rented me the booth, and stored the van in between coats for me too! Jeremy - Source: Internet If an auto painter wants to establish a lucrative business, it seems Southern California is the place to be. More cars are concentrated in Southern California than in any other part of the country. More households have second and third cars–the cars most likely to be repainted. Californians paint their cars more often than car owners nationwide, some industry experts say. - Source: Internet This is one of the points of service that may affect your end cost. Maaco can repair your car’s dents and blemishes in their shop before they paint. Surface smoothing: This step should eliminate any surface scratches or dings. - Source: Internet Posted: Mon Dec 01, 2003 3:20 pm Post subject: Yank, I see your point. I have heard from a couple of people that were satisfied with the paint they received from Maaco after THEY did their own prep work. But, the prep is over 75% of the work, if you’ve gone that far, may as well spray it yourself, if money’s that tight. Plus, you can rent the equipment. Still, I give Maaco the bird whenever I drive by there, which is EVERYDAY. - Source: Internet “In many parts of the country there is a stigma to getting a car repainted,” Martino said. “However, in California, there’s no stigma–it’s a positive thing to do.” - Source: Internet We’ve all heard the saying, “You get what you pay for.” Sometimes, that really is the truth! Some people have been satisfied with a basic Maaco paint job. If you’re trying to shine up an older car to sell it, Maaco may be just what you need. However, if you are particular about the finish on your vehicle, it may be worth it to explore other options. - Source: Internet Most of us have the ability to prep but don’t have the means to spray ourselves. Like hlwimmer said, it helps a lot to prep it yourself. If you expected maaco to do a good prep job, or hell, any prep job for $600, you thought wrong. - Source: Internet Squyres, like other paint shop owners, says a new coat of paint improves not only a car’s value, but also changes its personality. A conservative looking, ivory-colored Jaguar XJS that has been repainted black “looks aggressive,” he said. “It looks sinister, almost.” - Source: Internet Posted: Sat Nov 29, 2003 7:22 pm Post subject: Earl Sheib used to paint any car for $49.95. About the same quality. - Source: Internet “It’s a dirty job,” said Juan Gudino, a 37-year-old auto painter spotted with fire engine red paint. But with 15 years of experience, Gudino says he has no trouble finding a job. “Anytime I look for a job,” he said, “I can find it on the same day, maybe within one week.” - Source: Internet If you feel that you’re skilled enough to do the job at home, and keep in mind that this is a big if, you can get a similar result for much less money. Supplies can run anywhere from $100 to $1,500, depending on what you already have at home. Also, keep in mind that if you don’t have a well-ventilated area where dust and debris can’t get to your new paint job, it’s probably best to let a pro do the work. - Source: Internet Every shop is a little bit different on pricing because of variations in quality, skill level, and the type of paint job being done. It’s probably obvious that painting a Ford Econoline van is going to cost more than painting a Volkswagen Golf, but there are plenty of other factors that play into the costs of painting a car. As does doing it yourself, though we caution anyone who thinks it’ll be a simple job. - Source: Internet The preferred paint service uses a single-stage application of urethane paint. Urethane paint is resistant to chipping and fading, plus it is more durable than enamel paint. This level of paint service includes a three-year warranty. - Source: Internet The costs to paint a car vary depending on where the work is done, the size and complexity of the vehicle to be painted, and the quality of the paint job itself. In general, expect to pay anywhere from $300 to upwards of $10,000 for a professional paint job. The upper end of that price is where we find metal flake, multi-colored, and custom paint jobs, so unless you’re prepping your car for a show there’s really no need to spend that much. - Source: Internet Any of the paints listed above will work to repaint your vehicle. A urethane or acrylic urethane paint will have a glossy, durable finish. These kinds of paint can be tricky to apply. Find some videos, and have a practice run before you apply the paint to your car! - Source: Internet Email changed to Most of us have the ability to prep but don’t have the means to spray ourselves. Like hlwimmer said, it helps a lot to prep it yourself. If you expected maaco to do a good prep job, or hell,prep job for $600, you thought wrong.Yeah, spraying it yourself is the way to go but not many of us have the means unless you rent everything and get lucky and were born with the ability to paint properly._________________Email changed to [email protected] - Source: Internet Maaco offers three levels of sealer. This step is designed to create a fresh foundation for the new paint. Paint: See below to learn more about the levels of paint services offered. - Source: Internet The painting itself–completed in an enclosed booth under lights designed to simulate sunlight–takes only half an hour. The painted car is driven into a gas-heated oven and then sits overnight before being returned to the customer. The average bill for paint and body work is $300. - Source: Internet A lot of automotive paint companies disassemble vehicles before painting, then paint each panel separately, then reassemble the vehicle. Maaco’s paint process is a little more streamlined. They tape off trim, then spray the entire vehicle with paint. The result can be less uniform than a traditional panel by panel paint job. - Source: Internet What we look for are trends. Are seven out of eight negative reviews all complaining about the same thing? It’s also important to pay close attention to expectations. From the getgo, we’ll tell you honestly this isn’t a dealership or custom paint job! This is an affordable paint job; keep your expectations adjusted accordingly, and you’ll be in good shape. - Source: Internet Again, this may depend on the location and the technician, but a common complaint about Maaco is that they rush the prep work. Preparing a car for paint can be very time-intensive. It involves surface preparation, masking, and taping. A busy Maaco franchise may not have the time or manpower to effectively prep every car that comes through their business. - Source: Internet Most of us have the ability to prep but dont have the means to spray ourselves. Like hlwimmer said, it helps a lot to prep it yourself. If you expected maaco to do a good prep job, or hell, any prep job for $600, you thought wrong. - Source: Internet Choosing a mainstream color like black, white, or gray is the cheapest way to go. If you want a specialty color, especially one used by a premium automaker, you’ll pay more. Also, keep in mind that changing your vehicle’s color will cost more because of the work it will take to paint the engine bay, door jambs, and more. - Source: Internet The owner of a four-door sedan can expect to wait up to six weeks and pay $4,500 or more for a new coat of paint at Gordon’s, which paints only two whole cars a month. “There are people around who will pay $5,000 for a paint job,” said Squyres, who has been working on cars since age 14. “That’s why shops like mine survive.” - Source: Internet 5 more days passed without a word so on the morning of 4/25/22 I called and was told that the car should be ready for pick-up that evening. I picked the car up on the morning of 4/26/22 and as the employee drove it around, it could be seen to have blue painters tape holding the hybrid emblem on the repaired fender. The employee explained that they had just applied the emblem and that it would be dry by the time I got it home and I could remove the tape then. The employee got out of the car, said “Thank you for your patience”, while handing me my key, then left me with my car without an offer to inspect anything. - Source: Internet When I first started painting my projects I used a cheaper base, but it was hard to spray and required more coats, so now I use a glasurit base…..more expensive, but worth it. As far as the difference in lasting between the two…they stay garaged most of the time, so I don’t really have any feedback on that. - Source: Internet A paint suit will also protect your brand new paint job. Most of our clothes contain bits of dust and lint. Any tiny speck of dust or hair will adhere to wet paint and can mar the vehicle’s finish. If you keep your paint suit sealed before and after painting, it should be free of dust. - Source: Internet Think about this: part of the reason your car looked so great when you drove it off the lot for the first time is that the paint had been applied to a perfect car. No dings. No chips. No scratches. And the paint was beautiful. - Source: Internet Ultimately, if you want a pristine paint job, you’re going to have to pay more for it, or you’re going to have to put in a little elbow work. Pull out your electric sander and get to work. You should also use putty to fill in dents and scratches that don’t sand away. - Source: Internet Maaco is also a one stop shop. They will repair, prep, and paint your vehicle. They are usually capable of custom paint jobs in a wide variety of colors and finishes. - Source: Internet I bought my car keyed (thats how i could afford this car at the age of 15) i took the car to maaco and got there top of the line paint job, it cost me about 950 dollars. I think the car looks good not amazing, heres a link to the thread i posted when i got the car back from the paint shop, since then ive taken it back to get wetsanded so it shines a little better but its still not perfect but for the price, so far im happy https://acurazine.com/forums/3g-tl-photograph-gallery-96/car-fresh-paint-shop-771741/ - Source: Internet Like many things in life, you’ll absolutely get what you pay for when it comes to professional paint jobs. You can swing into a budget shop and be out the door for $500, but don’t expect it to be a top-notch job. A solid, high-quality paint job averages around $5,000. In general, you can count on paint job prices to vary based on: - Source: Internet A Maaco paint job can cost as little as $300, and as much as $1,000 or more, according to the most recent estimates. Why is there such a wide price range? There are a variety of factors that go into a new paint job. The price is based on any body work needed beforehand, the size of the vehicle, and which tier of service you choose. - Source: Internet Sealer may seem like an unnecessary step since you just paint over it in the end.

Cosmetic car repairs are those for which there’s no engine damage or structural damage. We’re talking fender-benders, bent hoods, and so forth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At Gordon’s, the staff strips off the car’s original <strong>paint</strong> and the doors and moldings are removed before <strong>paint</strong>ing. After <strong>paint</strong>ing, a car will sit one week to allow the <strong>paint</strong> to cure, said owner George Squyres, who bought the shop from the founder in 1984. The car is then lightly sanded and buffed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>First of all, Maaco primarily does quick, one-coat <strong>paint</strong> application jobs. Instead of removing the body panels from a vehicle, and <strong>paint</strong>ing each of them separately, Maaco preps, masks, and <strong>paint</strong>s the entire vehicle. This allows them to save time per vehicle. In the service industry, time is money. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before you get started, you’ll need two things above all else: time and space. Give yourself enough time to sand, repair, <strong>paint</strong>, and dry your vehicle. This is a crucial step that can save you big headaches with smeared or damaged <strong>paint</strong>. Space is vital, because unless you’re a machine (you’re probably not), <strong>paint</strong>ing a car will take time. You’ll need a safe space to store the car where the <strong>paint</strong> job can be done without damaging the <strong>paint</strong> or annoying your neighbors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>remember, you do get what you pay for, but more importantly, you also get out of it what you put into it&mldr; actually, i had the bug <strong>paint</strong>ed twice by scheib. the first time, i skimped on the prep and was unhappy as the <strong>paint</strong> highlighted my crappy prep-job&mldr; the next time, i spent a week of sumer vacation sanding and smoothing the whole thing&mldr; both jobs (<strong>maaco</strong> and scheib) lasted until i soild the cars &ndash; about 3 years later (and likely a lot longer). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most trucks have a similar amount of <strong>paint</strong>able surface area to an SUV. Again, several factors will go into your estimate, including prep work, repairs, and truck size. Overall, the average price for a <strong>paint</strong> job for a truck at Maaco is $700-$1,000. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Maaco has four <strong>paint</strong> packages to choose from, including Basic (1 year warranty), Preferred (3 year warranty), Premium (5 year warranty) and Platinum (5 year warranty). The different packages are designed to meet the needs of any customer’s financial situation, but each package has a different durability and appearance grade. This means that a Basic tier <strong>paint</strong> job will not look nearly as good and will not last nearly as long as a Premium tier <strong>paint</strong> job. If you wish to change the color of your car, there is an additional cost. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some people may turn up their noses at a Maaco <strong>paint</strong> job. There are entire online forums dedicated to the question of Maaco’s reputation. I checked two reliable sources: the Better Business Bureau, and Consumer Affairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As a consumer, I have the option to choose. That&rsquo;s why I chose to get another <strong>paint</strong>er to do my buggy, including all labor. It cost much more than I paid Maaco for the previous job, but was worth every penny, and I suspect the <strong>paint</strong> will look as good 5 years from now, unlike the Faded, cracking, flaking Maaco job that is only 2 years old. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yankee, Have you had a car <strong>paint</strong>ed by Maaco? How did it turn out for you? I didn&rsquo;t expect a show-winning <strong>paint</strong> job for $600, but I also didn&rsquo;t expect Maaco to <strong>paint</strong> over dirt. You REALLY needed to see this in person to believe it. It was absolutely disgraceful. 2 hours worth of sanding/cleaning would have made a world of difference in the <strong>paint</strong>. It is totally obvious Maaco put it in the booth, blew it off, taped it up, and started spraying. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>good luck. play hardball, be up-front and honest (its a bug, not a mercedes) and don&rsquo;t let them talk you into more stuff &ndash; a $50 under-the-table tip will buy you a better <strong>paint</strong> job than a $100 &ldquo;<strong>paint</strong>-upgrade&rdquo;. find a few <strong>maaco</strong>&rsquo;s in adjacent towns. if one gets cranky, walk out and go to the other. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Here, autos follow a procedure mimicked at the 32 other 1 Day shops from Los Angeles to Albuquerque. First any dents are fixed, the car’s surface is sanded, primer is applied and windows and moldings masked with tape and paper. (Like most <strong>paint</strong> shops, most of the cars that come into 1 Day need body work as well.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>On 4/5/22 I arrived at the office to pick-up the vehicle with my wife and was handed a piece of paper and asked to sign it. I asked if we should go and inspect the vehicle first and he agreed and we walked out to inspect it together. Upon inspection I noticed numerous areas where the <strong>paint</strong> ran, numerous areas where <strong>paint</strong> appears to have &ldquo;Globbed-up&rdquo; especially bad around the roof antenna and damage on the front passenger fender and rear bumper that wasn&rsquo;t there before and had been <strong>paint</strong>ed over. I inquired about the damage and was offered no apology or explanation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Maaco operates its stores as franchises. The franchise owner sets the tone for the store, not Maaco. As a result, there may be different standards and procedures at different Maaco locations. Research locations in your area before taking your car in to be <strong>paint</strong>ed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>They did a very good job and for $350 its well worth it. My car&rsquo;s <strong>paint</strong> was peeling and fading and a friend of mine scraped my fender/bumper. So he gave me someoney to <strong>paint</strong> the Bumper but i thought if i put in some more money i can get the whole car <strong>paint</strong>ed. I have read about Maaco and alot of people said they sucked and dont go for it. I just wanted the car <strong>paint</strong>ed just for the hell of it and look how they turned out!BTW: This is a 1992 Lexus SC400 All-Stock - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The first thing you’ll need is a polyurethane auto body <strong>paint</strong>, similar to the <strong>paint</strong> used by Maaco’s professional and premier tiers. This <strong>paint</strong> is a single-stage acrylic <strong>paint</strong> that would deliver similar results. You will probably need about three quarts for the average <strong>paint</strong> job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This step should eliminate any surface scratches or dings. Sealer: Maaco offers three levels of sealer. This step is designed to create a fresh foundation for the new <strong>paint</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Maaco was founded in 1972 by Tony Martino in Delaware under the company name “Driven Brands”. In just five years, his one store grew to 200 <strong>paint</strong> and auto centers in North America. The 1980’s brought a huge advertising campaign, including their famous slogan, “Uh-oh! Better get Maaco!” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Spot <strong>paint</strong>ing is a small, localized <strong>paint</strong> job to repair damage, usually due to a minor bump or accident. The areas in need of repair are sanded, then <strong>paint</strong>ed to blend in with the rest of the vehicle. Once the <strong>paint</strong> is touched up, the car is sealed and buffed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There was the young man who wanted his 1964 Impala <strong>paint</strong>ed Day-Glo Green. The middle-aged woman who wanted the color of her aging Thunderbird to match her favorite lavender belt. Then, there was the young woman who wanted her Volkswagen <strong>paint</strong>ed pink&ndash;not any pink, bubble-gum pink&ndash;and she brought in a piece of gum to show the <strong>paint</strong>er. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>According to Consumer Affairs, Maaco currently has 3.8 stars out of 5, based on 57 ratings in the last year. Common complaints include color errors, or rough finishes. Many customers were pleased with the <strong>paint</strong> job and customer service at their local franchise. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>73resto, no way in HELL would I pay them 3,795 for a <strong>paint</strong>job! Like bob said, nobody can give you a quote like that over the phone. If you even considered paying that, I would spend the money to do it yourself and buy the equipment. If you have any doubts about the gun, I&rsquo;d get a new one, but thats just me. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Panel replacement or repairs have a one-year warranty against cracking, shrinking, or rust. Surface or rust repairs only have a 90-day warranty. Paint jobs have a one to five-year warranty against delamination, cracking, and peeling. The warranty length depends on whether you purchase the basic, preferred, or premium <strong>paint</strong> job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In car crazy Southern California, such requests no longer faze many of the more than 4,000 auto <strong>paint</strong> shops owners. The region embraced the idea of giving a <strong>paint</strong> jobs to old cars long ago, giving rise to the nation’s first auto <strong>paint</strong>ing chains. Now, the rest of the nation is rapidly following suit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the things that’s all the rage in some enthusiast circles these days is heavy patina on classic cars. This 1953 Pontiac Chieftain has plenty of it after years of sitting, but the owner decided to correct that problem with a $2,500 Maaco <strong>paint</strong> job. The move is proving to be fairly controversial as everyone has different opinions of not only whether he should have done this but also what would’ve been a better alternative. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Don’t immediately start spraying your vehicle! Practice with the spray gun first. If you have running <strong>paint</strong>, or the <strong>paint</strong> applies unevenly, adjust the nozzle and try again. Don’t start <strong>paint</strong>ing your car until you are satisfied with the spray pattern and your skill with the <strong>paint</strong> gun. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most of us have considered changing our vehicle’s color, but very few actually go through with it. That’s for a few reasons, mainly related to cost and time because changing a car’s color is a lot more involved than just <strong>paint</strong>ing in the same shade. Before changing your car’s color, here are some things to keep in mind: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>After a while, that shiny new car you were so proud of starts to look dingy and faded. The <strong>paint</strong> has taken a beating over the years and all you’re left with is a car in a different color (or colors) than the one you started with. You could throw in the towel and just buy a new car, but those are the words of a quitter. Your other, much braver choice is to have the car <strong>paint</strong>ed by a pro, or yourself, to restore its former glory. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“This is kind of middle of the road auto <strong>paint</strong>ing,” said Uribe, whose father founded the chain in 1967. “This isn’t the place for a new Rolls-Royce.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It is difficult to see any uneven or wavy patterns on a dull car. After you have sanded down the primer, apply a very light coat of wax and grease remover down the side of the car. This will replicate the shine of your final <strong>paint</strong> job. Sight down the shiny surface of the car to look for any unevenness. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>paint</strong> the Pontiac is wearing when the video begins is some sort of pastel green. If it’s not the factory color, it’s probably something that was used in the factory or it’s at least period correct. Some people think he should’ve stuck with that color or at least another pastel. The Plum Crazy he did go with looks nice, especially for $2,500, but you have to wonder how it’ll hold up over time. Plus it’s not a Pontiac color at all, a fact which makes some people, well… crazy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re looking to advertise your business on a commercial vehicle, you’re probably looking for a custom <strong>paint</strong> job. These can be pricey, ranging from $1,000-$5,000. Vinyl vehicle wraps are a more cost-effective alternative to a custom <strong>paint</strong> job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now, after weeks of prep, Emilio’s car is ready to be re<strong>paint</strong>ed. After we talked with the MAACO body shop owner, he agreed to meet with Emilio once the car is done to try to come to some sort of agreement. We will follow-up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are several reputable places in the U.S. where you can have your car <strong>paint</strong>ed, including auto shops like MAACO or Service King, dealerships like Ford or Toyota, and local <strong>paint</strong> shops. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Whether you’ve been in a collision and your vehicle has sustained <strong>paint</strong> damage, or you just want a new color on an old classic, getting the <strong>paint</strong> job right is extremely important. After all, it’s the first thing people see! Without the proper prep work or the right technicians, you can end up with a vehicle that looks even worse than it did before it got <strong>paint</strong>ed! Today, we’re taking a close look at Maaco <strong>paint</strong> job, the auto <strong>paint</strong>ing, and collision repair shop you know from its infamous “uh oh, better get Maaco!” ads that ran in the 1980s and 1990s. Maaco specializes in providing cheap, fast bodywork and <strong>paint</strong> jobs, but if you take a look online, you’ll see some pretty mixed reviews. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Posted: Sun Nov 30, 2003 9:50 pm Post subject: I considered Maaco for <strong>paint</strong>ing a bus not too long ago, even went so far as to take it in for a quote. I just got the feeling the were going to do a shitty job of it, putting in an absolute bare minimum of effort, so I wound up doing it myself. It cost twice as much, because I decided I might as well get a better quality of <strong>paint</strong> while I was at it, but I was happy with the result. I found a local shop that rented me the booth, and stored the van in between coats for me too! Jeremy - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If an auto <strong>paint</strong>er wants to establish a lucrative business, it seems Southern California is the place to be. More cars are concentrated in Southern California than in any other part of the country. More households have second and third cars&ndash;the cars most likely to be re<strong>paint</strong>ed. Californians <strong>paint</strong> their cars more often than car owners nationwide, some industry experts say. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is one of the points of service that may affect your end cost. Maaco can repair your car’s dents and blemishes in their shop before they <strong>paint</strong>. Surface smoothing: This step should eliminate any surface scratches or dings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Posted: Mon Dec 01, 2003 3:20 pm Post subject: Yank, I see your point. I have heard from a couple of people that were satisfied with the <strong>paint</strong> they received from Maaco after THEY did their own prep work. But, the prep is over 75% of the work, if you&rsquo;ve gone that far, may as well spray it yourself, if money&rsquo;s that tight. Plus, you can rent the equipment. Still, I give Maaco the bird whenever I drive by there, which is EVERYDAY. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“In many parts of the country there is a stigma to getting a car re<strong>paint</strong>ed,” Martino said. “However, in California, there’s no stigma&ndash;it’s a positive thing to do.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We’ve all heard the saying, “You get what you pay for.” Sometimes, that really is the truth! Some people have been satisfied with a basic Maaco <strong>paint</strong> job. If you’re trying to shine up an older car to sell it, Maaco may be just what you need. However, if you are particular about the finish on your vehicle, it may be worth it to explore other options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most of us have the ability to prep but don’t have the means to spray ourselves. Like hlwimmer said, it helps a lot to prep it yourself. If you expected <strong>maaco</strong> to do a good prep job, or hell, any prep job for $600, you thought wrong. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Squyres, like other <strong>paint</strong> shop owners, says a new coat of <strong>paint</strong> improves not only a car’s value, but also changes its personality. A conservative looking, ivory-colored Jaguar XJS that has been re<strong>paint</strong>ed black “looks aggressive,” he said. “It looks sinister, almost.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Posted: Sat Nov 29, 2003 7:22 pm Post subject: Earl Sheib used to <strong>paint</strong> any car for $49.95. About the same quality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>“It’s a dirty job,” said Juan Gudino, a 37-year-old auto <strong>paint</strong>er spotted with fire engine red <strong>paint</strong>. But with 15 years of experience, Gudino says he has no trouble finding a job. “Anytime I look for a job,” he said, “I can find it on the same day, maybe within one week.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you feel that you’re skilled enough to do the job at home, and keep in mind that this is a big if, you can get a similar result for much less money. Supplies can run anywhere from $100 to $1,500, depending on what you already have at home. Also, keep in mind that if you don’t have a well-ventilated area where dust and debris can’t get to your new <strong>paint</strong> job, it’s probably best to let a pro do the work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Every shop is a little bit different on pricing because of variations in quality, skill level, and the type of <strong>paint</strong> job being done. It’s probably obvious that <strong>paint</strong>ing a Ford Econoline van is going to cost more than <strong>paint</strong>ing a Volkswagen Golf, but there are plenty of other factors that play into the costs of <strong>paint</strong>ing a car. As does doing it yourself, though we caution anyone who thinks it’ll be a simple job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The preferred <strong>paint</strong> service uses a single-stage application of urethane <strong>paint</strong>. Urethane <strong>paint</strong> is resistant to chipping and fading, plus it is more durable than enamel <strong>paint</strong>. This level of <strong>paint</strong> service includes a three-year warranty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The costs to <strong>paint</strong> a car vary depending on where the work is done, the size and complexity of the vehicle to be <strong>paint</strong>ed, and the quality of the <strong>paint</strong> job itself. In general, expect to pay anywhere from $300 to upwards of $10,000 for a professional <strong>paint</strong> job. The upper end of that price is where we find metal flake, multi-colored, and custom <strong>paint</strong> jobs, so unless you’re prepping your car for a show there’s really no need to spend that much. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Any of the <strong>paint</strong>s listed above will work to re<strong>paint</strong> your vehicle. A urethane or acrylic urethane <strong>paint</strong> will have a glossy, durable finish. These kinds of <strong>paint</strong> can be tricky to apply. Find some videos, and have a practice run before you apply the <strong>paint</strong> to your car! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Email changed to Most of us have the ability to prep but don’t have the means to spray ourselves.

If you expected <strong>maaco</strong> to do a good prep job, or hell,prep job for $600, you thought wrong.Yeah, spraying it yourself is the way to go but not many of us have the means unless you rent everything and get lucky and were born with the ability to <strong>paint</strong> properly._________________Email changed to [email protected] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Maaco offers three levels of sealer. This step is designed to create a fresh foundation for the new <strong>paint</strong>. Paint: See below to learn more about the levels of <strong>paint</strong> services offered. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>paint</strong>ing itself&ndash;completed in an enclosed booth under lights designed to simulate sunlight&ndash;takes only half an hour. The <strong>paint</strong>ed car is driven into a gas-heated oven and then sits overnight before being returned to the customer. The average bill for <strong>paint</strong> and body work is $300. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A lot of automotive <strong>paint</strong> companies disassemble vehicles before <strong>paint</strong>ing, then <strong>paint</strong> each panel separately, then reassemble the vehicle. Maaco’s <strong>paint</strong> process is a little more streamlined. They tape off trim, then spray the entire vehicle with <strong>paint</strong>. The result can be less uniform than a traditional panel by panel <strong>paint</strong> job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What we look for are trends. Are seven out of eight negative reviews all complaining about the same thing? It’s also important to pay close attention to expectations. From the getgo, we’ll tell you honestly this isn’t a dealership or custom <strong>paint</strong> job! This is an affordable <strong>paint</strong> job; keep your expectations adjusted accordingly, and you’ll be in good shape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Again, this may depend on the location and the technician, but a common complaint about Maaco is that they rush the prep work. Preparing a car for <strong>paint</strong> can be very time-intensive. It involves surface preparation, masking, and taping. A busy Maaco franchise may not have the time or manpower to effectively prep every car that comes through their business. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Most of us have the ability to prep but dont have the means to spray ourselves.

If you expected <strong>maaco</strong> to do a good prep job, or hell, any prep job for $600, you thought wrong. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Choosing a mainstream color like black, white, or gray is the cheapest way to go. If you want a specialty color, especially one used by a premium automaker, you’ll pay more. Also, keep in mind that changing your vehicle’s color will cost more because of the work it will take to <strong>paint</strong> the engine bay, door jambs, and more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The owner of a four-door sedan can expect to wait up to six weeks and pay $4,500 or more for a new coat of <strong>paint</strong> at Gordon’s, which <strong>paint</strong>s only two whole cars a month. “There are people around who will pay $5,000 for a <strong>paint</strong> job,” said Squyres, who has been working on cars since age 14. “That’s why shops like mine survive.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>5 more days passed without a word so on the morning of 4/25/22 I called and was told that the car should be ready for pick-up that evening. I picked the car up on the morning of 4/26/22 and as the employee drove it around, it could be seen to have blue <strong>paint</strong>ers tape holding the hybrid emblem on the repaired fender. The employee explained that they had just applied the emblem and that it would be dry by the time I got it home and I could remove the tape then. The employee got out of the car, said &ldquo;Thank you for your patience&rdquo;, while handing me my key, then left me with my car without an offer to inspect anything. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When I first started <strong>paint</strong>ing my projects I used a cheaper base, but it was hard to spray and required more coats, so now I use a glasurit base&mldr;..more expensive, but worth it. As far as the difference in lasting between the two&mldr;they stay garaged most of the time, so I don&rsquo;t really have any feedback on that. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A <strong>paint</strong> suit will also protect your brand new <strong>paint</strong> job. Most of our clothes contain bits of dust and lint. Any tiny speck of dust or hair will adhere to wet <strong>paint</strong> and can mar the vehicle’s finish. If you keep your <strong>paint</strong> suit sealed before and after <strong>paint</strong>ing, it should be free of dust. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Think about this: part of the reason your car looked so great when you drove it off the lot for the first time is that the <strong>paint</strong> had been applied to a perfect car. No dings. No chips. No scratches. And the <strong>paint</strong> was beautiful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ultimately, if you want a pristine <strong>paint</strong> job, you’re going to have to pay more for it, or you’re going to have to put in a little elbow work. Pull out your electric sander and get to work. You should also use putty to fill in dents and scratches that don’t sand away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Maaco is also a one stop shop. They will repair, prep, and <strong>paint</strong> your vehicle. They are usually capable of custom <strong>paint</strong> jobs in a wide variety of colors and finishes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I bought my car keyed (thats how i could afford this car at the age of 15) i took the car to <strong>maaco</strong> and got there top of the line <strong>paint</strong> job, it cost me about 950 dollars.
