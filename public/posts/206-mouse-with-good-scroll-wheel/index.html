But if you are more of a MOBA, MMO or RPG gamer then you might like to consider a mouse with more buttons. That’ll make life easier to carry out actions, combine in-game abilities and generally win. - Source: Internet We combed the Internet for information on the different mice while also reading customer reviews from real users; we sought advice from experts; and, of course, we relied on our accumulated experts. We considered specific features that are essential for gaming mice. We looked for lightweight, strong, and comfortable gaming mice, keeping in mind that a great gaming mouse needs to be very comfortable when held by the user. This will improve point precision and speed when playing games that require high speed when played. - Source: Internet Like other Kone mice, the Pro Air is quite large, with a long, wide body and a round palm rest. It’s asymmetrical and therefore built with right-handers in mind, but the design is supremely comfortable; the thumb rest is deep and we particularly like that the rear of the mouse flares outwards on the right-hand side, lifting your pinky finger off the body of the mouse a bit. It’s a lovely thing to use day-to-day. - Source: Internet There’s a very good reason why this mouse is one of the most popular gaming mice right now. Announced all the way back in 2014, it’s still selling strong, a testament to its capabilities and prowess. Of course, Logitech has made gradual changes over the years to keep it fresh. - Source: Internet Your pinky finger shouldn’t have to stretch to reach the side of the mouse opposite to your thumb. Palm: The front of your palm should be supported by the mouse itself. The back of the palm and the upper wrist should be able to rest on the table comfortably. - Source: Internet Google around for “the best PC mouse” and you’ll find one answer: Logitech’s MX Master 3. You might see a few mentions of others — like the Razer Pro Click and Microsoft’s Surface Precision mouse — but the reviews are clear that the MX 3 Master is the one. Since we first published this guide, Logitech has released the MX Master 3S which improves on the already popular device with a sharper sensor and quieter buttons. We’ve updated this guide accordingly. - Source: Internet Look, feel and connectivity aside, the main things that distinguish different wireless mice are their sensitivity and selection of wheels and buttons. All wireless mice will feature the two buttons plus scroll-wheel layout that’s been standard since the mid-1990s, but some go further with a two-axis wheel that shifts left or right to scroll horizontally as well as vertically, or additional wheels or buttons on the top surface or side of the mouse. These may be supported directly in certain applications, but in most cases, you can configure what the buttons do using the software provided. You might use them to activate specific functions or controls in a design application, for example, or to minimise, maximise and switch between open windows. Once you get used to it, this can be a real time and effort-saver. - Source: Internet While Logitech G Pro is rather compact by definition, it’s by no means cramped or uncomfortable. Quite the opposite, in fact. Most gamers with big hands find the mouse extremely comfortable to handle. Having said that, people who use the claw grip method may find it a bit cramped. - Source: Internet The G502 Hero can easily last 5 years or more if handled and maintained well. The mouse was released all the way back in 2014, and there are still plenty of people out there who still have the original models. While the mouse is on the heavier side, it’s due to its build quality, which is superb. The G502 Hero means business with its nice, thick plastic shell and premium rubber grips which are built to last. - Source: Internet Besides, the Viper has a much more tasteful design than the Pugio, and its two main clicker buttons feel more responsive, too. Plus, the Viper is nicely light, coming in at just 69g. This means it’s super easy to swish around your mouse mat, and never becomes a drag when you’re playing games for long periods of time. Razer’s Synapse 3 software gives you loads of customisation options, too. Anyone disappointed by the Viper V2 Pro adopting a purely right-handed design can take solace in the fact that it’s most ostensibly basic predecessor remains a brilliant ambidextrous gaming mouse. - Source: Internet The mouse’s scroll wheel has a rubber track and works excellently, although our review unit did squeak occasionally (hey, it’s a mouse). Impressively, you also get a button to adjust tracking sensitivity, with four choices: 600dpi, 1,000dpi, 1,600dpi and 3,200dpi. The mouse’s sensor is accurate and responsive on every setting and a small blue LED helpfully flashes to indicate which resolution is selected (from one for 600dpi up to four times for 3,200dpi). - Source: Internet Let’s get the basic specs out of the way first: SteelSeries Rival 3 has an optical sensor with a DPI of 8,000, a 1,000Hz polling rate, 6 programmable buttons, and lastly, a non-braided rubber cable. Nothing groundbreaking compared to what we have already seen. Surprisingly enough, the mouse has an RGB logo, as well as a light strip at the bottom. Something we didn’t expect to find on a budget mouse! - Source: Internet For seamless connectivity, there’s a switch located at the bottom of the mouse, which you can use to select up to three different devices. The mouse can be easily connected with Windows or Mac laptops—as well as iPads—via Bluetooth. You can connect two devices right off the bat with Bluetooth, as well as the included USB dongle. An additional device can be connected via Logitech Bolt Receiver (not included with the mouse). - Source: Internet That’s going to be of more use to you playing Apex Legends or Overwatch than making selections in Photoshop, but if precision matters you’ll struggle to find anything to match this mouse. Nor does it overload you with unnecessary buttons: just the normal two plus one beneath the scroll wheel and two more underneath the thumb. If you don’t game at all, this mighty mouse will be wasted, but if you do it’ll also handle any work you need to do – and more. - Source: Internet I’d have very much liked to update this guide to the best gaming mice with the Logitech G502 X, a mouthwateringly extensive (that’s hyperbole) overhaul of possibly the greatest and most beloved PC peripheral on the market (that’s not hyperbole). Sadly, thanks to an excessively scratchy scroll wheel, it hasn’t made the cut, leaving its predecessor (and RPS reader favourite) the Logitech G502 Hero in the top spot. Oh well. At least that’s still good. - Source: Internet These days, the best mice are primarily wireless and it’s really not hard to understand why. Cables are messy and a real hassle if you’re using a convertible tablet-style PC or laptop, there’s a huge choice of wireless and Bluetooth mice available, and the price premium is virtually non-existent. What’s more, battery life is now so good and connectivity so reliable that the old objections to going wireless have pretty much dropped away. While some hardcore gamers still believe wireless mouse performance is inferior to that of their cabled rivals, a decent wireless mouse with a stable connection generally provides an identical experience. - Source: Internet In a gaming mouse, not all components are alike between models and brands. This is even more noticeable in a scroll wheel encoder. A great encoder, like a TTC Gold, provides clear tactile steps and is designed with gamers in mind. - Source: Internet The brand might not be as well known as Logitech or Microsoft, but the Rapoo MT-550 gives you the same comfort and features for less. It’s light and very solid-feeling, with a lovely soft-touch finish, and shaped so that it feels just right under the palm and fingers. The thumb can rest easy on the left-side of the mouse, and the extra backwards/forwards buttons and scroll wheel sit exactly where most of us would want them. The scroll wheel is a little light, but it’s still precise, and the same goes for movement, thanks to the switchable 600dpi to 1,600dpi sensor. - Source: Internet Razer Basilisk V3 The best gaming mouse overall Specifications Connection: Wired Shape: Right-handed Buttons: 10 +1 DPI: 26,000 IPS: Up to 650 Switches: Razer 2nd Gen Optical Mechanical Weight: 3.67oz (104g) Today’s Best Deals View at Sports Direct (opens in new tab) View at Razer (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Thoughtful additional features + Super fast 26K DPI sensor + Comfortable ergonomic design + Cheaper than the V2 Reasons to avoid - Not light enough for competitive players - Source: Internet Where the wired Basilisk V3 really comes into its own, however, is with the new scroll wheel. The Basilisk V3 is the first gaming mouse outside of Logitech’s own factories with a free-wheeling scroller and what this means is that you not only get a normal “notched” scrolling mode, but there’s also a “free-spin” mode – enabled with a simple button press – which lets loose the scroll wheel for high-speed scrolling. It also increases momentum the faster you spin the wheel. - Source: Internet Looking for a Logitech G502 Hero, albeit with wireless connectivity? Logitech has the answer in the guise of G502 Lightspeed. Everything’s here: The remarkable Hero 25K sensor, the iconic G502 look, 11 programmable buttons with the familiar tactile spring switches, infinite scroll-wheel, RGB lights, and above all, full customizability via Logitech G Hub. However, G502 Lightspeed is more than just a rehashed G502 Hero with wireless circuitry stuffed inside. - Source: Internet As the name suggests, the MX Anywhere 3 is the mobile version of the MX Master 3S. Unlike its bigger brother, the Anywhere has a semi-ambidextrous design. It’s perhaps a shade too small to cut it as desktop replacement, but in the mobile realm it feels premium, complete with the auto-switching between ratchet and free-flowing scroll wheel — which at $80, it should. - Source: Internet The answer, unfortunately for left-handers, is that in most other ways the Viper V2 Pro is a big improvement. Most noticeably, it’s even lighter than the Viper Ultimate, shedding down to just 58g – which combined with the impeccably smooth feet makes it a real pleasure to slide around. As does the comfortable shape, and while the Viper V2 Pro also gets rid of the Viper Ultimate’s built-in textured grips, it replaces them with stick-on rubber strips you can apply yourself. If you eventually wear one down, you can replace the strip alone, not the entire mouse. - Source: Internet The mouse sits nicely in the hand and is just heavy enough to feel precise. The see-through top cover has a texture I can only describe as smooth without being slippy. The resistance of the left and right mouse buttons is minimal thanks to Roccat’s own Titan optical switches, which makes clicking feel uniquely fast and responsive. It’s also surprisingly quiet, so you won’t have to worry about plaguing your roommates with your clicking around on a sleepy Sunday morning. - Source: Internet If done well, the Naga V2 Pro could have one of the most personal scroll wheel experiences available. But we’ll hold off on any applause until we see this working without annoying rattling noises or inconsistent behavior. Software dependence can also be a turn-off to some users, from those using multiple devices to those not wanting to dedicate computing resources to a mouse app. You can toggle between scroll wheel feels on Logitech’s MX Master 3S and 3 out of the box by simply pushing a button on the mouse; no software is necessary. - Source: Internet There are a lot of wireless mice to choose from, with the biggest players – Microsoft and Logitech – responsible for several bewildering lines. Which you go for will depend on your budget, the laptop or PC that you’re using, the features you want and the kind of shape and feel you prefer. The last of these is important. Some people love a big, chunky mouse that fills their hand; others a slimline mouse they can move with their fingertips and stow in a laptop case without adding weight or bulk. - Source: Internet The first thing you’ll notice when comparing it to other mice is the button below the thumb grip with a little [+] on it. This may be familiar to you if you’ve already got other Roccat products, and indicates their trademark EasyShift technology. Hold down the + button and it changes the normal function of your buttons into whatever you like. For instance, by default, holding down the EasyShift button and flicking the mousewheel to the right lets you skip tracks on Spotify. With four more thumb buttons, including two at the front for changing DPI and one on top for switching profiles, this mouse can do a lot. - Source: Internet Size is also a consideration, although this is strictly a matter of personal preference. Mice like the Microsoft Classic Intellimouse are long-bodied, and appeal to users who hold mice with their entire palms. Smaller mice lend themselves to a “claw” grip, meaning you can comfortably hold it with three fingertips. - Source: Internet Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite The best gaming mouse for MMOs and MOBAs Specifications Connection: Wired Shape: Right-handed Buttons: 17 DPI: 18,000 IPS: Up to 400 Switches: Omron Weight: 4.3oz (122g) Today’s Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Scan (opens in new tab) View at CORSAIR (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Tonnes of programmable buttons + Exceptional build quality + Great sensitivity Reasons to avoid - Small side buttons - Source: Internet To add to this growing pile of positives, the Viper Ultimate will last 70 hours on a single charge and includes a nifty magnetic charging dock with braided cable. You can customise lighting and button functions within Razer Synapse, where you’ll also find the option to switch between right- and left-handed modes. Put simply, this mouse does it all – which explains the high price. - Source: Internet The Logitech G502 Hero, and its wireless variant, G502 Lightspeed, are two of the biggest gaming mice available in the market right now. They both are measured at 132 x 75 x 40mm. As a consequence, these mouses are also quite heavy at 121g and 114g, respectively. However, they offer fantastic gaming performance, thanks to the Hero 25K optical sensor. - Source: Internet ECx-B: This is the new and upgraded version of the A. It features the flawless 3360 sensor, with the other most notable change found on the bottom, where Zowie swapped the 2 large mouse feet on the A for four smaller feet. Minor changes were also made to the side buttons and the coating. - Source: Internet Thanks to a durable 2.4 GHz wireless dongle, you can use the mouse wirelessly anywhere — and with up to 18 months of battery life, you’ll rarely have to replace the peripheral’s single AA battery. Another cool thing about the M325 is that, unlike many other productivity mice, it comes in a variety of colors: red, blue, purple and pink. Logitech also produces extremely similar mice under its Party and Doodle collections, which adorn their mice with floral and cartoon patterns. - Source: Internet Black Friday deal: SAVE on this excellent Logitech gaming mouse The Logitech G703 Lightspeed is a talented multipurpose mouse that features on several of our mouse roundups. Right now at Amazon, it’s going for £38, which is substantially lower than normal. If you work and play at the same PC, the G703 is the mouse you need. Amazon Average £55 Now £38 Buy Now - Source: Internet The Krystal 4D mousewheel is prominent and lets you assign a function to its right and left ‘click’ function. Something to be aware of if you’re planning on using the mouse for work as well as play is that the scroll wheel offers quite a tactile feel. Good for choosing weapons in-game, but perhaps not ideal for scrolling through PDFs. - Source: Internet It’s no slouch when it comes to features, either. It offers an enviable 18,000 DPI sensor with a tolerance of 400 IPS, meaning it’ll still be able to track your movements when the mouse is hurtling across your mat. Additionally, the click action of each button is tactile and satisfying. That makes the Ironclaw RGB a real contender for the prize of best gaming mouse. - Source: Internet Razer itself claims that DeathAdder V2 possesses “best-in-class ergonomics”. Whatever your grip style may be, this mouse fits big hands like a glove. Unfortunately, the mouse isn’t ambidextrous, which is about the only gripe about its design. - Source: Internet For gamers primarily looking for comfort, it doesn’t get much better than Razer DeathAdder V2. For starters, DeathAdder V2 has the Razer Focus+ 20K optical sensor, good for 20,000 DPI and 650 IPS tracking. It’s also the third lightest mouse in our test, weighing in at just 82g, i.e., just 2g heavier than the Logitech G Pro. - Source: Internet The streamlined sidekick: Microsoft Surface Mobile Mouse (£30) A mouse might be nothing without a surface, but you don’t need a Surface to enjoy the subtle charms of Microsoft’s Mobile Mouse. Pocket-friendly and powered by a trio of triple-As, this Bluetooth buddy gets the basics just right: compact, attractive and immeasurably more reliable than Windows 8. Where to buy Buy the Microsoft Surface Mobile Mouse here from Argos - Source: Internet The scroll wheel on Razer’s new mouse appears to take customization to a new level. Razer says it has six different modes. Those modes, Razer’s announcement said, include: Standard “for more typical in-game selections”; Distinct “for easy, definitive scrolling”; Ultrafine “for the highest number of inputs”; Adaptive Scrolling “to give less resistance the faster the wheel is scrolled”; and Free Scrolling “for always-on accelerated scrolling.” - Source: Internet We at GamesRadar+ play a massive range of genres, which means we often have to compromise somewhere when finding hardware that fits them all. It’s hard to find a mouse that serves each game’s needs without it becoming an overstuffed monstrosity. That’s where the Razer Naga Pro comes in. - Source: Internet Microsoft’s Surface Precision is listed as “up to 3 months” which I somehow read with an implied shrug on their part. It’s hard to know whether those are active use or “the mouse is on and it’s on your desk.” The better news is that all of them can be charged while you use them. In practice, I found the MX Master 3S to last the longest, but also needing a charge way sooner than its 70 days claim, in my experience it’s more like every 5-6 weeks. - Source: Internet Ergonomic mice don’t have to come with a higher price tag. The Microsoft Bluetooth Ergonomic Mouse is proof of this. It’s also a terrific value, offering more than just a comfortable grip, natural hand position, and light weight that this Bluetooth mouse offers. - Source: Internet Is a gaming mouse really better? If you’re new to PC gaming you may be wondering whether the often higher prices of gaming mice will actually enhance your game. While even the most expensive gaming mouse won’t turn you into a pro player overnight, there are features included as standard on these devices that you won’t find in regular pointers. A precise sensor, better acceleration, extra programmable buttons, and a form factor designed for longer sessions all make gaming mice far more suited to play than regular productivity mice. You’ll likely find these specs on more premium non-gaming products, but you’ll be spending a lot more to get them. - Source: Internet The M720 doesn’t have the laser sensor of the MX Master 2S, but it’s nonetheless a feature-rich mouse for its price point. It connects via Bluetooth or a USB nano receiver that fits neatly into a slot inside the battery compartment. It will pair with up to three PCs or other devices, which you can switch between using the rear-most of three buttons on the side. The other two are user-configurable, while the wheel tilts for horizontal scrolling. As with the more expensive Logitech 2S, you can switch between smooth and clicky scrolling modes. - Source: Internet The differences are small but significant. The MX Master 3 still has the extra programmable buttons of the 2S, with an extra thumbwheel for zooming or horizontal scrolling and a hidden button where your thumb rests on the left-hand side. The scroll wheel still switches between clicky and superfast smooth scrolling at the press of a button, but it’s even lighter, quieter and more pixel-level responsive than the wheel on last year’s model. Meanwhile, the two slightly awkward buttons tucked behind the thumbwheel have been dropped in favour of two slim, more conventional buttons just below, where they’re more ergonomic – and the design on the left-hand side is just that little bit smoother. - Source: Internet – A highly customizable wired mouse for people with big hands, featuring Hero 25K optical sensor, 11 programmable buttons, an infinite scroll-wheel, LightSync compatible RGB lights, 400 IPS tracking, and customizable weights. Logitech G502 Lightspeed – Wireless variant of the G502 Hero with lighter weight, stiffened chassis, long battery life, cutting-edge endoskeleton design, good side grips, and excellent build quality, and the same Hero 25K optical sensor as the G502 Hero with 400 IPS tracking. Best wireless gaming mouse for big hands on the market! - Source: Internet Grip aside, the controls are fairly conventional, with the scroll wheel and two buttons on what’s now the right-hand surface of the mouse, and two additional buttons – next and previous by default – near the top of the thumb grip. You can switch between three sensitivity settings with a button on the top edge of the mouse, and while it’s not quite as pinpoint-accurate as the high-end Microsoft and Logitech mice, it never feels laggy, vague or unresponsive. The only minor grumbles are that it uses two AAA batteries (not included) and that it needs to be woken up with a left or right-click if left unattended for eight minutes or more; a sensible battery-saving measure, but an annoyance when other mice wake on movement. - Source: Internet The winner of the most forgettable-looking option in this nest of mice goes to the Orochi V2. Or maybe it’s just understated? Especially for a Razer product. Looks aside, the Orochi V2 is a very capable mobile mouse with six buttons, Bluetooth or dongle connectivity and it works with Razer’s Synapse software, so any macros you might already have can be assigned here (or make your own!). - Source: Internet Small, narrow and not particularly tall, the Pulsefire Haste is made for claw grippers. But like many of the mice on this list, these characteristics make it a fine choice for anyone who needs as much control and dexterity as a gaming mouse can offer. In fact, the Pulsefire Haste sailed through our accuracy test: we produced a perfect 100% score, hitting every target we aimed at over the course of a 30-second period. - Source: Internet At 425 (2.4Ghz) or 950 hours (BLE) you get a decent amount of time out of each battery and you can use either a single AA or AAA. It weighs just 60g, so it’s also pretty nimble. At $70, it’s edging into full-desktop mouse territory, but given that it’s big enough to actually use this full time, that seems less surprising. Especially given that you can stow the dongle under the top cover, which is more than can be said for the MX Anywhere 3 (or even the MX Master 3S). - Source: Internet The Corsair Sabre RGB Pro Wireless is a supremely comfortable gaming mouse that connects to your PC/laptop via either Bluetooth or a Corsair Slipstream wireless dongle. It has a tall, round profile with a splayed front that best suits gamers who cling to their pointer for dear life. At 79g it’s surprisingly light but the bulky frame helps prevent it from feeling insubstantial. - Source: Internet For our tests, we paired the mouse simultaneously with our Windows PC via USB receiver and a MacBook Air M1 via Bluetooth. Overall, the mouse performed admirably. However, our testers were unimpressed by its gaming performance. As it turns out, the mouse has a very limited polling rate of just 125 Hz, along with a tracking rate of just 30 IPS. Good enough for casual gaming but unsuitable for competitive esports shooters. - Source: Internet Ergonomic ambidextrous design: Tournament ready mouse developed with Esports pros for maximum comfort, control and 50 million click durability. Four removable side buttons for supreme customization. Cable length: 1.80 meters Check Price - Source: Internet In many ways, the type of sensor used by the mouse is more important. Cheaper mice still use a combination of an infrared or red LED light beam and an optical sensor, which is both effective on most surfaces and extremely accurate. However, the more advanced optical sensors, like Microsoft’s Bluetrack, and laser sensors, which switch LED for laser, tend to be more accurate across a wider range of surfaces. This isn’t a massive issue if you only use your mouse with a mouse pad, but if you want to use it directly on a desk or glass or coffee-shop table, premium mice with premium sensors can be more reliable. - Source: Internet We’re recommending the Kone XP as the best gaming mouse for RGB lovers, but it’s important to note that this is from a brute force angle, rather than in terms of customization. It still feels like the Swarm software is catching up, which means we were a little disappointed to realise that you can’t actually change the colors of these RGB strips. However, there are plenty of cycles to choose from, and the overall effect may be too good to turn down. - Source: Internet The hyper-responsive optical switches also have the clicky, tactile bite of mechanical switches, so while you do have slightly fewer buttons to configure overall, they feel as snappy as ever. And honestly, the dock isn’t a massive loss. The Viper V2 Pro still comes with a cable and USB-A-to-USB-C coupler, which can close the wireless dongle’s distance to the mouse just as the dock could, and personally I’d rather charge the mouse directly over a wired connection than leave it on a stand. A stand that won’t, y’know, let me keep using the mouse. - Source: Internet Black Friday: Get our favourite gaming mouse for its lowest-ever price The Razer Basilisk V3 is the reigning champion on this roundup, and right now at Amazon, it’s going for an all-time-low price. Find out more about this impeccable gaming pointer below. Amazon Avg £60 Now £38 Buy Now - Source: Internet The Roccat Kone XP beats a lot of wired gaming mouse in terms of performance and versatility. Thanks to its heat-treated pure PTFE feet, 19K DPI optical sensor, and Titan optical switches, it can keep up with the fastest and most action packed games. Not only is it super fast and responsive, but we also found that it feels more lightweight than it is, thanks to those feet, as well as comfortable to button-mash with. - Source: Internet You’ll find all gaming mice have a number of specs worth paying attention to. These include max acceleration and max speed numbers. Usually the higher these numbers the better. Along with a good sensor, these specs ensure good tracking and accurate representation of your mouse movements and the ability to keep up with your quick flicks. - Source: Internet The first thing we noticed right off the bat is its weight, or the lack of it. It’s extremely lightweight at just 80g. While the Razer Viper Mini in our test is even lighter than the G Pro, that mouse is wired with no internal battery or other wireless components. It’s amazing just how much performance Logitech has managed to cram in this compact, featherweight mouse. - Source: Internet On the other hand, an excellent mouse is designed with accuracy, speed, and your comfort in mind, making sure that it does more than the bare minimum in terms of performance and preventing long-term pain and injury during long sessions of PC use. So, whether you’re a creative professional, gamer, business owner, student, office worker, or even a casual PC user, you absolutely need to invest in the best mouse for you. If you’ve already invested in the best keyboard and the best laptop, you will want to get the best mouse as well. - Source: Internet Finding a suitable, comfortable gaming mouse can often take gamers a long time. This is especially true for gamers with big hands who may find regular gaming mice cramped and uncomfortable to use. For prolonged gaming sessions, the mouse’s dimensions need to match the player’s hand and their particular grip style to have the best gaming experience. - Source: Internet Mice for MMO games have a special appeal. These button-laden peripherals are intended to make laying down combos in games a breeze. But their high programmability gives them great potential for much more, including heavy-duty productivity. One of the most popular MMO mice, the Razer Naga series, received an update on Thursday. Offering up to 20 customizable buttons is still the Naga’s main prize, but Razer has also made the scroll wheel much more interesting. - Source: Internet Razer is well known for its comfortable, ergonomic mice – and Basilisk V3 is no exception. For people with either fingertip or palm grip styles, this mouse is a no-brainer. However, it hasn’t got the most ambidextrous design and is only suitable for right-handers. - Source: Internet Yes. The mouse is lightweight at just 77g and also ergonomic friendly. While the overall design is ambidextrous, it’s best suited for right-handers with side buttons located at the left. People who use the palm grip style may find it unsuitable, though. - Source: Internet Then we test its performance, including speed, accuracy, and reliability, by using it in our day to day workloads and in gaming, especially if it’s a gaming mouse . We also check its buttons and scroll wheels to see how easy and comfortable they are to use. If you’ve been using a cheap mouse your whole life, you’ll certainly notice the difference between that and a great mouse. And, that’s what we look for here, regardless of whether it’s a productivity mouse or a gaming one, a wired mouse or a wireless one. If it’s wireless, however, we also test its connectivity, range and battery life. - Source: Internet There are other factors to consider, such as whether the computer mouse has a rechargeable battery or uses replaceable batteries, the number of buttons (some people need the extra buttons!), its ergonomic design, RGB lighting, the type of mouse grip and its size. Good software for programming the mouse matters, too. The list below takes all of these into consideration and, while the mice here use wireless technology, several can be used as traditional wired mice with a USB cable if you’re worried about battery life. - Source: Internet Let’s be clear, there’s almost no chance any of the mobile mice on offer would make a great full-time desktop replacement. That said, it’s also one of the more interesting categories thanks to being free from the burden of having to do everything. A mobile mouse can get a little wackier and do one or two things really well. - Source: Internet In terms of features, the Kone Pro Air errs on the side of minimalist. It has a total of seven programmable buttons plus a switch on the underside to alternate between 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connectivity. There’s also a slot for the USB receiver, which is always appreciated. Bafflingly, the Kone Pro Air doesn’t have a DPI adjuster button - instead, you can create up to six unique profiles via the Swarm application that include lighting settings, button functions and sensitivities, and switch between them via a button on the bottom of the mouse. - Source: Internet Our Fantech Aria was designed with gamers in mind, to not only allow them to kick ass in their favorite games, but also to allow them to do it anywhere. Aria is designed with tri-mode Bluetooth 5.0 + Wired + 2.4GHz connectivity, as well as a TTC Gold Encoder, actual Kailh \u0026 Huano mouse button switches, and features a Pixart 3395 with 1000hz polling rate. - Source: Internet This concludes our review of the top 9 best gaming mice suitable for people with large hands. All the mice in this test not only excel at competitive eSports gaming but will also serve you well in normal day-to-day and casual gaming. None of the mice we tested in this review are particularly bad at anything. Having said that, the best of the bunch is, without a doubt, the Logitech G Pro, a great all-rounder mouse that has gained somewhat cult status in recent years. - Source: Internet Generally speaking, wireless mice tend to suffer from latency issues. Yet somehow, the G Pro’s input latency is comparable to a wired mouse. We compared the G Pro with the wired Logitech G502 Hero—another mouse with the same Hero 25K sensor—back-to-back in CS: GO and literally couldn’t notice any discernible input delay. Overall, very impressive. - Source: Internet Wireless gaming mice are gathering steam these days, as models hit the market that can overcome the traditional latency that used to come with untethering. However, it’s still worth noting that you’ll be paying a lot more for a wireless mouse that functions like a wired one. These superfast connections still come at a premium, especially when placed on devices with high CPI rates and other fancier features. A 2.4GHz connection is a must if you’re looking to spend a little more on a wireless device, though, as this is the only way you’ll pick up competitive response times without a cable. - Source: Internet – The lightest mouse in our test at just 61g, 8,500 DPI sensor, SpeedFlex cable, 6 programmable buttons, optical switches, an RGB light strip at the back, and a semi-ambidextrous design.

Within this testing, however, we’re always keeping our assessments inline with value. That means we’re making sure that a $150 gaming mouse offers just as much value for money as a $30 model, and measuring our results in accordance. - Source: Internet The sculpted taskmaster: Logitech MX Master 3 (£100) Mastering a skill takes 10,000 hours. On a tight deadline? Spin up the machined steel Magspeed wheel on the moulded MX Master 3 and it’ll scroll through 1000 lines in a single second. Much too fast to digest any information, sure, but at least you’ll know the scale of your ignorance. Logitech’s productivity powerhouse also packs a secondary thumb wheel for horizontal scrolling, while quick-charging smarts can deliver three hours of juice from just a minute at the plug – so you won’t be kept from your treasured spreadsheets for long. Where to buy Buy the Logitech MX Master 3 here from Amazon - Source: Internet Of this trio, the Pro Click offers the most configurable buttons (8). The MX Master 3S is a close second (7) but has the advantage of a second scroll wheel near the thumb. In reality, two of Razer’s “buttons” are side-clicks on the scroll wheel — typically these default to sideways scroll, the same as Logi’s thumb dial does. The net result is that I found the MX Master 3S slightly more configurable for my use cases. The thumbwheel is perfect for switching between desktops — something I do a lot, which would occupy two slots on the Razer meaning, effectively, the MX Master 3S has one more spare button in this setup. - Source: Internet Place your hand on your mouse. If your entire hand (palm and fingers) is resting on the surface of the mouse, you have a palm grip. If your palm is elevated, and only your fingertips touch the mouse, you have a fingertip grip. If the rear of your palm touches the mouse surface, and your fingers are visibly arched rather than flat against the mouse, you have a claw grip. - Source: Internet This is a lot to pay even for a high-end, premium mouse, but it’s hard to complain when you experience the Microsoft Surface Precision and its luxury feel. Neither as big nor as heavy as the Logitech MX Master 2S, it combines a matt plastic shell with rubberised side panels to superb effect, so the shape fits perfectly inside the hand. Using the three aluminium buttons on the side soon becomes second nature. The “Precision” in its name is justified; when you’re trying to crop images to exact pixel dimensions, or notch up the colour levels on a video, this is exactly the kind of mouse you want to use. - Source: Internet Roccat Burst Pro The best lightweight gaming mouse Specifications Connection: Wired Shape: Right-handed Buttons: 6 DPI: 16,000 IPS: Up to 400 Switches: Titan optical Weight: 2.4oz (68g) Today’s Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Studio (opens in new tab) View at Scan (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Easy to manoeuvre + Titan optical switches + Stunning RGB Reasons to avoid - Scroll wheel feels grindy - Source: Internet But despite the aggressive weight shedding, the mouse is still fairly heavy at 114g. Frankly, we could barely notice the reduced weight as most of our testers were skeptical about its weight savings compared to its wired sibling, the G502 Hero. Having said that, it’s every bit as good as the G502 Hero in terms of gaming performance, despite the wireless connectivity. - Source: Internet At its core, though, the latest Razer Basilisk is the same versatile pointer that we’ve always come to love from one of the best Razer mouse lines. With upgraded second generation switches in each main button, an additional trigger button on the left hand side, and a brand new smart scroll wheel, though, there are plenty of new features to celebrate here. We found those new switches to be a little lighter to the touch than previous iterations, but were impressed that they still managed to keep a satisfying response and snapped back quickly. - Source: Internet It’s a smaller, lighter mouse than the MX Master 2S, which might suit those with smaller hands or who prefer fingertip control, and it’s powered by a single AA battery, which Logitech claims will last for up to two years. While the 1,000dpi resolution optical sensor doesn’t sound so impressive, this mouse coped well on a range of surfaces and in more precision-orientated graphics tasks. If you want a mouse that can switch from desktop to laptop to convertible in a jiffy, this one has you covered. - Source: Internet The spherical scroller: Kensington Expert Wireless Trackball (£60) Keen to confound your colleagues? Besides trackball accuracy and a static setup that’s kinder to your wrist, the big red orb on this ergonomic number offers guaranteed office amusement. How you’ll laugh as Ian from IT wrestles with its unfamiliar form. How you’ll cry when he flings it at a wall in frustration. What japes! Where to buy Buy the Kensington Expert Wireless Trackball here from Amazon - Source: Internet This is a serious gaming mouse designed for pros, which has the thrills of being lightweight, but without the usual honeycomb shell. It’s remarkably agile and wonderfully accurate too. The only downside is the odd lack of DPI switching button, but you can customise DPI and other button settings in the software. - Source: Internet For starters, it’s lighter at 114g, compared to 121g for the G502 Hero. Bear in mind that this mouse has an internal battery as well as a wireless radio, which should ‘add’ weight to the mouse, not make it lighter! Logitech achieved this by using a clever thin-wall endoskeleton design to reduce weight while maintaining stiffness, as well as lighter components overall. For example, the scroll wheel is hollowed out in order to save a few grams. - Source: Internet If you’re after the lightest gaming mouse on the market, the Roccat Burst Pro may seem like it’s failed at the first hurdle. Namely, Roccat’s Kone Pure Ultra weighs slightly less. However, this ignores the fact that the Pro is better in almost every way. - Source: Internet For left-hand users, it can be fairly difficult to find a good, comfortable mouse. Most mice in the market are targeted toward right-hand users. However, Logitech has the right answer in the guise of the G903 Wireless Gaming Mouse. - Source: Internet On a more minor note. During my time with MacOS I joined the dark side of “natural scroll.” It’s not a deal-breaker for me, as I don’t mind regular scroll, but Logitech and Microsoft both offer reverse scrolling as a setting, Razer doesn’t appear to — though you can work around this in other ways of course. - Source: Internet You’re also upgrading the clickers with optical switches. We found the Titan Optical switches to be incredibly responsive, adding to the speedy feel of the mouse as a whole. With a 16,000 DPI sensor and that superlight form factor, we were flying across the battlefield with the Burst Pro under hand. - Source: Internet If your job requires you to spend hours working in front of a computer every day, then you know how important it is to have the right mouse and keyboard to help you get the job done. It doesn’t matter what the size of your office is, what color your clothes are or anything else. If you have an uncomfortable mouse, it’ll grate on you all day. The most important thing for your office is finding a mouse that feels comfortable and improves your productivity. There’s a huge wireless mouse market out there, so it’s easy to find something that suits your specific needs, whatever they may be. - Source: Internet Lastly, the Razer logo, as well as the scroll wheel, have RGB lights—compatible with Razer Chroma RGB. With Razer Synapse 3 software, you can set the light rhythm, change colors, and also enable in-game lighting effects. The lights themselves are rather basic, however, and only get moderately bright. If it’s RGB you’re after, then consider Razer Basilisk V3 Pro instead, another mouse we have covered in this review. - Source: Internet Ah, the joys of an ailing mouse. Periodically picking fluff from the temperamental sensor. Shouting obscenities at its inconsistent scroll wheel. Smacking it on the desk when it refuses to cooperate. - Source: Internet A bigger hand can indeed give you a competitive edge when it comes to esports, FPS games, and MMOs. Longer fingers and an overall wider grip, can most definitely make it easier to perform quick 180-degree turns and help you with rapid mouse control. It’s by no means a coincidence that a lot of talented esports players have above-average hand sizes. - Source: Internet As for the buttons and other features, the mouse has 8 buttons in total, all of them programmable. Razer chose to use optical mouse switches—instead of a spring mechanism—with a response time of only 0.2ms. However, our testers had mixed feelings about the optical switches. Some liked them, while others noted the reduced tactile feel and ‘clicky’ sound we all come to expect from a gaming mouse. - Source: Internet With seven customisable buttons and a slot to store the wireless dongle, the Sabre RGB Pro wireless isn’t exactly overflowing with extra features, but from a technical perspective, this mouse is up there with the very best. A maximum resolution of 26,000 DPI plus 2,000Hz hyper-polling make this a supremely responsive mouse that should appeal to any self-confessed pro gamers out there. Corsair’s iCUE technology is available to those who want to toy with the discreet RGB lighting, remap buttons or adjust DPI intervals. - Source: Internet The 6 programmable buttons, as well as the RGB lights, are directly configurable via the Razer Synapse 3 software. As is the case with other Razer mice in this test, this mouse uses optical switches. And as we have established previously, our testers prefer the superior tactile feel and louder click of spring loading switches. However, it all depends on one’s personal preference. - Source: Internet As is the case with Logitech G Pro, the G502’s gaming performance is fantastic, all thanks to the Hero 25K gaming sensor. Our testers were very pleased with the gaming performance of this mouse. The G502 is, without a doubt, one of the best wired gaming mice available in the market right now. - Source: Internet This isn’t a particularly large mouse, and the steeply angled palm rest suits claw grippers more than anyone else. The sides are textured and concave to help your pinkie and thumb grip the mouse more easily. I had no difficulty using the AGM700 in Battlefield 2042: the feet glide smoothly and the mouse is suitably responsive – plus I quite like the additional weight. Your mileage may of course vary. - Source: Internet Polling rate: How many times the mouse communicates its position to your PC, per second. A 500Hz polling rate, for example, would report 500 times each second. Gaming mice generally target the 500-1000Mhz range, and there’s no real benefit to going higher than this, though cursor movements might not feel as smooth if you manually lower the polling rate below 400MHz or so. - Source: Internet Getting the right weight for your mouse will largely come down to the kinds of games you play. Lighter, more agile, mice are required for tournament level FPS play, but should also be considered for everyday action style titles as well. A heavier mouse is more likely to offer more configurable buttons, however, which means MOBA and MMO players may choose to forego that sub-100g profile for easy access to all their gear in-game. - Source: Internet If you walk into an electronics store and make a beeline for the laptop mice, the Logitech M325 is probably the first thing you’ll see. This mouse is inexpensive and ubiquitous, but it came by its popularity fairly. This small gadget is optimized for laptops, making it ideal for frequent travelers, or workers with limited desk space at home. It’s also extremely comfortable, according to user reviews, and provides a DPI just high enough to comfortably scroll across a screen without overshooting your target. It’s arguably the best wireless mouse for the price. - Source: Internet The mouse has SteelSeries’ TrueMove Core optical sensor. While it’s limited to just 8,000 DPI, we were really impressed by its performance. The polling rate is good at 1000 Hz, and the overall tracking is also surprisingly decent at 400 IPS. While the 8,000 DPI is less than half of something like Logitech G Pro or Razer Basilisk V3, it’s still more than plenty for casual gamers. Overall, this is a great mouse for gaming, despite the specs sheet suggesting otherwise. - Source: Internet If friends and family are sick of your late-night clicking, Logitech’s M330 could be the mouse for you. Its buttons are designed to be near-silent, with a claimed 90% reduction in click noise over similar Logitech mice. It’s a simple two-button optical device with a scroll wheel. However, with a similar ergonomic profile to some of Logitech’s more expensive mice and a combination of hard plastic and soft rubber grips, it feels surprisingly good in the hand. The compact size and weight are ideal for on the move use but it’s ideal for use when you’re working from home. - Source: Internet For example, a user with a hand width of 4″ (101mm) should look for a mouse with a width of around 2.66 inches (67mm) or more. In this case, the Logitech G502 with a width of 75mm (including the protruding thumb rest) should fit perfectly. - Source: Internet As satisfying as it is to click into shape, the hollow area under the arc does mean that your thumb and little finger don’t have anywhere to naturally rest. I also found the curve of the arc led me more into a claw position over my usual palm, which might be okay for you but gave me pause about using this for longer periods. As a purely mobile mouse, though, it’s one of the more pleasing, especially if you like its semi-trackpad nature. - Source: Internet We’ve tested a lot of mice, putting them through their paces so we can make the right recommendations, whether it’s the best gaming mouse you need or one for productivity. It isn’t the cushiest part of the job, as some mice are unbalanced or heavy or do not glide effortlessly, even when paired with the best mouse pads. But, we suffer through the annoying arm and shoulder pain to ensure that you don’t. - Source: Internet If you can’t stand having cords connected to your computer, you may want to consider a wireless, Bluetooth mouse. However, there are also few things more annoying than a mouse that won’t connect, so you need to choose something that has a strong signal and minimal connectivity issues. Long battery life is also essential. - Source: Internet Razer DeathAdder V2 The best mid-range gaming mouse Specifications Connection: Wired Shape: Right-handed Buttons: 8 DPI: 20,000 IPS: Up to 650 Switches: Optical Weight: 2.9oz (82g) Today’s Best Deals View at Box.co.uk (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Studio (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Accurate, reliable sensor + Perfectly shaped for various grips + Comfortable Reasons to avoid - Build materials could be more luxurious - Source: Internet Who was betting on Microsoft having the most stylish mouse on this list? The Surface Arc is a delight with a “transforming” design that pops into shape (an “arc” no less). Once you’re done simply snap it flat again for easy storage in a pocket of your laptop bag. You don’t even need to turn it on as “snapping” it also acts as a power switch. Oh, and did I mention that the touchpad area does double duty as left/right click and vertical or sideways scroll (Magic Mouse style)? There’s even the option for a “triple” click to give the Surface Arc an extra, assignable button. All that, and it’s only around $55. - Source: Internet ECx-B Divina: This is a special edition of the ECx-B line. It comes with a glossy coating (as opposed to the regular matte coating) and the four smaller feet have been changed back to two large feet on this special edition. In addition to that Zowie also moved the ‘information sticker’ (containing the serial number etc.) from the bottom of the mouse to a tab at the end of the cable in order to improve the glide. - Source: Internet The software is where the MX Master 3 shines, however, as it comes preinstalled with a variety of different functionalities for popular programs. From Photoshop to Excel, Logitech has already predicted how you might want to use the horizontal scroll wheel and gesture controls, and developed optimized profiles for each program. You can also use the handy Logitech Flow feature, which lets you drag and drop files between two totally different computers, as though they were connected via USB. - Source: Internet Black Friday deal: SAVE on this high-end Logitech wireless mouse The Logitech MX Master 2S is one of our favourite wireless mice for comfort and versatility, even though it no longer features on the below roundup.

This mouse is essentially what would happen if you squished a productivity mouse, then made it stand upright. It’s a little hard to describe, but once you see the MX Vertical in action, you’ll know right away whether it’s for you. If regular mice strain your wrists through small, repetitive motions, the MX Vertical might offer some relief. This is because it forces you to move your whole hand around, thus minimizing the strain on any one muscle. - Source: Internet It connects to your PC via a 2.4GHz wireless adapter – it’s USB-C, but SteelSeries includes a USB-A adapter cable in the box. There’s no Bluetooth support here, but for a mouse that manages to feel good, look great and play excellently, we don’t think that matters. - Source: Internet Back in the Before Times of 2019, RPS readers voted the Logitech G502 as your favourite gaming mouse. Good choice - I use one regularly as part of the main RPS test rig. There’s just something so wonderfully complete about it: a sweet blend of comfort, features and tactility, with plenty of opportunities for customisation. - Source: Internet The Razer Viper V2 Pro doesn’t initially make a very convincing case for itself. It’s meant as a replacement for the Viper Ultimate wireless mouse, but despite a higher price it ditches that mouse’s ambidextrous design - losing a pair of side buttons in the progress – as well as the included-as-standard charging dock. Why pay more for fewer features? - Source: Internet The Cherry MW8 Advanced is a joy to use if you’re a fan of compact mice and sleek design. We found it comfortable to use throughout the day and flexible, too. You can connect the MW8 Advanced via Bluetooth or over 2.4GHz RF using the provided USB receiver that’s magnetically stowed on the underside of the mouse. It’s also possible to connect via USB while charging the internal lithium-ion battery. - Source: Internet When you buy a new PC, it’s easy to focus on the big three: Processor, graphics and RAM (sorry storage fans, that’s a close fourth). It’s the little things that are simple to overlook. I say that with the confidence of someone that just migrated over from a decade-old iMac to a part-picked PC.

It’s only in the field of professional gaming, where that extra sensitivity could make the difference between victory and defeat, that going above 2,000dpi makes a whole heap of difference. It’s a nice-to-have, but not essential. - Source: Internet The M330 connects via a 2.4GHz wireless transceiver, which stows away in the battery compartment for travel. Other useful features include automatic power-off, which helps the mouse deliver up to two years of battery life. All in all, you’re looking at a great budget mouse that feels much nicer than the price suggests – there’s even a choice of colours. - Source: Internet With six buttons, it’s pretty configurable for something so small and at 99g it won’t overstay its welcome under your palm. Though for the life of me I cannot understand why there is no option to stow the USB dongle inside the mouse somewhere. Given its mobile nature this seems like a no-brainer. You can, of course, just use Bluetooth if, like me, USB dongles seem to vanish into thin air unless they have a home. - Source: Internet Zowie has been around for a while, and ever since their mice first hit the scene they’ve been a hit with gamers who specialize in shooters. The brand quite notably has been dominating the CS:GO pro scene for years now, but their products also see a lot of use in different pro scenes. Still, the EC has been the de facto ‘standard issue CS:GO mouse’ basically since it released, and the fact that it still holds that position today is a testament to its quality as a tactical shooter mouse. - Source: Internet To choose the best gaming mouse, you first have to determine the width of your palm. For reference, the width of an average male hand is 3.5 inches, measured from the widest area of one end of the palm to the other. In order to avoid fatigue and maximize comfort, try to pick a mouse that’s around 2/3rd the overall width of your palm. - Source: Internet That’s kinda it. It’s not a big ask but I soon learned there was always some mental bargaining going on trying to find the best balance. I also wanted to see what a modern mouse can offer beyond those requirements as, who knows, maybe there’s something I never knew I wanted or I have the sudden urge to get into Dota 2. Enter, the story I thought I’d never write: An 11-way PC mouse shoot out. - Source: Internet Razer Viper Mini is one of the best gaming mice for big hands. However, we wouldn’t recommend the Razer Viper Mini to people who use the palm grip style, as the mouse’s length is just too short. Lastly, the mouse has an ambidextrous design, but unfortunately, the side buttons are only located on the left, making it unsuitable for left-hand users. - Source: Internet As you may have noticed by now, most mice in our test tip the scale at well over 80 grams, some going well beyond 100g. But the thing is, not everyone prefers a heavyweight mouse. Hence, we had to include a lightweight mouse in our test. And after consideration and testing, we chose Razer Viper Mini to be the best lightweight gaming mouse currently available in the market. - Source: Internet The Logitech G Pro Wireless is hands down the best wireless gaming mouse we’ve tested. It’s not cheap, but wireless mice rarely are, and this is the absolute cream of the crop. It’s wonderfully agile and super comfy to use, and at 80g it’s lighter than a lot of its rivals (just not preposterously light, like the Razer Viper V2 Pro below). When you combine that featherlight nothingness with Logitech’s practically lag-free Lightspeed wireless tech and its brilliant Hero 16K sensor, the Pro Wireless definitely justifies its high price. - Source: Internet I’ve always maintained that a good gaming mouse is also a good computer mouse in general, and that’s definitely the case with the SteelSeries Rival 3. This sleek, medium-sized peripheral features a no-nonsense, semi-ambidextrous design with two programmable thumb buttons and a pretty LED strip on the bottom. The Rival 3 is the only mouse on this list with programmable RGB lighting, and while that won’t make you any more productive, it will make your desk look a whole lot prettier. - Source: Internet In terms of gaming, the mouse’s 8,500 DPI gaming sensor doesn’t disappoint. In CS: GO, for example, our Viper Mini totting testers had no trouble keeping up with their rivals equipped with Logitech G Pro and G502. It’s surprisingly decent for an unnamed sensor. - Source: Internet The G502 Lightspeed mouse should easily serve you for 5 years or more. Despite the fact that it’s lower weight compared to G502 Hero, the overall build quality is not affected thanks to the thin-wall endoskeleton design. All the premium features of the G502 Hero, such as rubber grips and comfortable mouse rest, are also here. - Source: Internet For one, its build quality feels far superior. It also looks more stylish (if that matters). More importantly, it has a more neutral position that feels really comfortable for a smaller mouse and doesn’t feel like it’s craning my hand forward. Throw in the fact that you can still assign app-specific controls via Microsoft’s Mouse and Keyboard center and you end up with something that’s smarter than it first seems. - Source: Internet Want to avoid breaking the bank? We’d recommend the Logitech G203 Lightsync. As well as being aggressively affordable, it’s the best gaming mouse for those on a budget - balancing a decent feature-set with that low cost. In fact, its competition generally only comes from the Razer Viper Mini and the Razer DeathAdder V2 Mini. The Logitech G203 Lightsync, however, is cheaper than the DeathAdder V2 Mini and offers a larger body than the Viper Mini, which will satisfy a wider range of grip types. - Source: Internet Unfortunately, the G502 is also one of the heaviest mice we tested, weighing in at 121g, bone stock. Oddly enough, the mouse has customizable weights, and you can bring that heft up to 140g. Some of our testers preferred the heavyweight nature of the G502, while others complained about it. Overall, we believe it would’ve been better if the mouse had a lower overall “dry weight”. - Source: Internet The born-again legend: Microsoft Pro IntelliMouse (£60) As familiar as a floppy disk, Microsoft’s trusty clicker is back (again) and better than ever. Inspired by the iconic IntelliMouse, don’t let the Pro’s understated packaging fool you: a braided cable, remappable buttons and seriously precise sensor – adjustable up to 16,000 DPI – make the throwback scroller a boon for gamers and graphic designers alike. Where to buy Buy the Pro IntelliMouse here from Microsoft - Source: Internet The Logitech MX Master 3 is the best mouse, at least on the productivity front, as well as the best wireless mouse. It’s comfortable, feature-rich and lasts an amazingly long time on a single charge. This sleek gray peripheral is the latest iteration of Logitech’s MX Master series, and everything the company has learned from the previous iterations is on full display. The buttons give satisfying clicks, the grip is pleasant to hold and the horizontal thumb wheel makes scrolling through documents a breeze. - Source: Internet Obviously, there’s a lot to consider when buying a gaming mouse. Trying to find the right one for you can be tricky as there are all sorts of mice in all manner of shapes and sizes with different specs and features on offer. It can be hard to know what matters or what you’ll like. - Source: Internet The Naga Pro features three unique, detachable panels, which allow you to up the ante in everything from battle royales to MOBAs. They’re a revelation - each panel includes a different button setup, so you can use your gaming mouse across a wide range of genres and experience the benefits of a tailor-made pointer for each one. Not only that, but you’re getting all this power with the reliability of a Razer HyperSpeed wireless connection to boot. - Source: Internet Fingertip grip: Another type of mouse grip. This involves using a similar pose to the claw grip, only here your palm sits on your mouse mat, not the back of the mouse. It supposedly makes for faster mouse movements, as you’re only moving it with your fingers rather than your whole hand or arm. If you favour this grip, you’ll probably want a mouse with extra grippy sides. - Source: Internet You should be most concerned by the overall shape and weight of the mouse. Then, in order of relevance, comes the buttons, the DPI, the sensor and everything else. We’ll explain ourselves below. - Source: Internet If you’re working from home, we recommend looking for a wireless mouse, and the best wireless mouse options come with sensors that work on almost all surfaces, like the Logitech MX. These let you connect to up to three devices by Bluetooth or through their included USB dongle, so you can quickly switch control between computers. However, they can be expensive and if you don’t need to work on a glass table, most newer mice will work on anything other than glass or reflective surfaces. - Source: Internet While it’s an older device, the Logitech G Pro Wireless still impresses thanks to its impressive tracking and comfortable ambidextrous shape. You’ll find removable buttons on both sides of the pointer here, but the best part is you can also run the G Pro Wireless with a full suite. That means plenty of space for macro customization. Not only that, but we found using the mouse with two buttons on either side to still be comfortable and precise - never once accidentally clicking. - Source: Internet ECx-C: This is the latest iteration of the EC series. It comes with a series of notable improvements such as a shoelace-like cable, reduced weight, and a 24-step scroll wheel. These mice feature modern improvements without losing sight of what makes Zowie mice so popular (reliability, plug and play, …) so if you’re asking us they’re the definitive version to get right now if you’re looking for a Zowie mouse. - Source: Internet Wireless mice divide into two broad camps. On the one hand, you have those that work with a wireless transceiver that plugs into a USB port on your PC or laptop. This means you don’t need Bluetooth – which many desktop PCs don’t support – and you’re pretty much guaranteed a trouble-free connection. The downside is that the transceiver takes up a USB port, which can be in short supply on some laptops, while the mouse becomes useless if you lose it. - Source: Internet Corsair Ironclaw RGB The best gaming mouse for larger hands Specifications Connection: Wired Shape: Right-handed Buttons: 7 DPI: 18,000 IPS: Up to 400 Switches: Omron Weight: 3.7oz (105g) Today’s Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at very.co.uk (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Comfortable, wider mouse + High-performance sensor + Thoughtful software features Reasons to avoid - Heavy for a wired mouse - Source: Internet Which gaming mouse brand is the best? It’s difficult to lock down the best gaming mouse brand, largely because each brand offers a wide range of budget, mid-range, and premium options. There are, however, a few contenders for the prize; Razer, Corsair, Logitech, SteelSeries and Roccat. These brands are all responsible for some of the best gaming mice on the market right now, and each offers a slightly different experience based on what you need from your pointer. If we were to be locked down for a top spot, though, our top picks for the best gaming mouse suggest that Razer is leading the competition right now. - Source: Internet Moreover, the G502 has a button to switch between smooth and ratchet scroll (fast, free gliding versus clicky slow, basically). The MX Master 3S offers both types of scrolling but with a setting where ratchet mode will seamlessly become smooth mode which is much more apt for browsing and navigating lists. I found scrolling on the G502 a bit annoying. Much bigger “clicks” and finding the button to switch to smooth seemed to kill my flow. I am guessing it’s better for gamers though. - Source: Internet Razer’s Synapse also offers app-specific controls alongside a wealth of predefined media and OS shortcuts, but perhaps less comprehensive than those found in Options. That said, you do also have full macro support: Simply hit record and whatever you do next can be converted into a single click of the mouse. There’s even “HyperShift” which means you can add a second layer of commands while holding down an allocated button. - Source: Internet The Cupertino clicker: Apple Magic Mouse 2 (£66) Longing to augment your iPad’s lovely touchscreen with the tactile certainty of a cold, hard click? Good news: iPadOS 13 brings a bit of mouse support to your Apple tablet. And what better peripheral to pair with your ‘Pad than Cupertino’s own Magic Mouse 2, complete with slender shell, rechargeable cell and a multi-touch surface that works a bit like, you know, a touchscreen. Where to buy Buy the Apple Magic Mouse 2 here from Amazon - Source: Internet It’s not without its quirks though. Zowie specifically designs their mice for competitive (FPS) gaming, and so the scroll wheel has very few steps when compared to most other mice, which can make it a bit strange to use for browsing. Zowie also uses Huano switches for their buttons instead of the more ubiquitous Omron switches. Huanos are known to be a bit heavier than Omrons, which is done to prevent accidental clicking, but that’s not to say that Huanos are worse than Omrons. They’re simply different, and what you prefer comes down to personal preference. - Source: Internet The latest releases keeps the same form factor as the original Razer DeathAdder, but brings that design into the modern age with a few crucial tweaks. We particularly enjoyed the design change in the textured grips. While the original model offers a larger hexagonal set set of ridges, the smaller bumps and tighter feel of the new grip is far more satisfying and tactile. There’s also additional programmable buttons on here, with two new DPI shifters located underneath the scroll wheel. - Source: Internet The best mouse for you will depend on what games you play and what shape feels the most comfortable for you. Having a good mouse that is catered to your game can allow you to really have the best competitive edge over your opponents. We have compiled this list after testing out each mouse thoroughly. - Source: Internet Beyond two clickers and a scroll wheel, the best mouse might have additional buttons that you can program to suit your computer needs. If you’re left-handed, you’ll want to invest in a mouse that’s ambidextrous or specifically designed with ergonomics for the left hand. If you’re a laptop user who travels frequently, you’ll want a mouse that is lightweight and travels easily. Above all, you’ll want to pick a mouse that fits in your price range and gets the job done without being overly expensive. - Source: Internet The Ironclaw RGB also offers more functionality than the mildly equally unassuming Steelseries Rival 310. The Rival 310 is still a great choice for those looking to keep costs down (as is the identical Sensei 310 if you’re looking for a cheap ambidextrous mouse), but the Ironclaw does a lot more for the money, such as giving you an extra DPI or sensitivity profile to play with, a braided USB cable, seven programmable buttons instead of six, and the ability to turn one of those buttons into a ‘sniper’ button for on-the-fly DPI adjustments to give you better control when lining up shots in FPS games. All in all, it’s a great value mouse. - Source: Internet The luxury puck: Azio Retro Classic Mouse ($100) This classy clicker might channel vintage vibes, but it’s no old-school scroller. Crafted from leather and aluminium, the refined RCM packs a rechargeable battery good for up to four months and a sensor that works on even the glossiest of retro desks. You can switch the top cover to match your antique mousepad, too.

The AGM700 packs an awful lot of mouse into a low price tag, with eight mappable buttons, a dedicated sniper button for instantly reducing the DPI and even a compartment on the bottom of the mouse that holds additional weights. These weights increase the overall weight from 90g to 115g; although neither of these are particularly light for a mouse with FPS aspirations, gamers who don’t much care for ultra-light gaming mice will appreciate the heft. - Source: Internet The Roccat Burst Pro Air goes for a far less garish coat of RGB than the Kone XP, lighting up both the top and bottom of the shell and nicely highlighting the reinforcing honeycomb pattern within. The exact colours and patterns can be tailored through Roccat’s Swarm software, though RGB effects aren’t really the big reason to buy this mouse. That would be simply how nice it feels, even without a thumb rest or even any notably premium materials. - Source: Internet The Modern Mobile mouse is Microsoft’s answer to the Pebble. Streamlined, lightweight and with a focus on the basics. There’s no 2.4GHz option here though; it’s Bluetooth only. At $35, compared to the Pebble’s $25 it might seem a foregone conclusion but there’s a lot to like about Microsoft’s take on a portable mouse. - Source: Internet However, finding the right mouse for you can be tricky. People hold them in different ways, and have different sized hands that make purchasing a tricky business. A wide mouse with thumb rests and grips might be perfect for someone with large hands, but others might find a small and sleek mouse preferable, both in terms of fit and agility. - Source: Internet Claw grip: A type of mouse grip that involves resting your palm on the back of the mouse and bending your index and middle fingers into a claw-like shape so the tips of them rest on the main right and left buttons. Professional players often say this allows for quicker, more precise mouse movements, and some mice will be designed with this grip in mind. In everyday use, though, it’s very uncomfortable. - Source: Internet The controls are fairly minimal, with just two side-mounted buttons accompanying the left and right buttons and scroll wheel, but the chunky, tyre-tread wheel works brilliantly, and with an adjustable 7,200dpi resolution it’s as good for Photoshop as Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 or League of Legends. A choice of Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connections makes it even more versatile. This little mobile mouse can do it all. - Source: Internet For all the jargon involved in buying a gaming mouse, it’s easy to forget the biggest factor of all - comfort. You will naturally hold your mouse in a certain grip, usually either a palm, claw, or tip grip. The size and shape of your mouse will determine whether it is comfortable to hold in this way, so it’s worth noting how you naturally place your hand on the pointer and double checking your chosen mouse will fit you. Palm: you hold the mouse with most of your hand and fingers resting on the mouse itself - aim for a wider mouse with a taller back arch. - Source: Internet One downside though is the lighter mice often feel cheap, sound hollow and aren’t as feature-rich. If you prefer your mouse to have a bit of heft and a premium solid build quality then there’s nothing wrong with that. Some of the heavier mice also have a lot more to offer, not just RGB but more buttons, wireless connectivity and more. - Source: Internet We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: while people obsess about the performance of their desktop PC or the resolution of the screen on their laptop, too many ignore the two factors that will have the greatest impact on their everyday use: the keyboard and mouse. Despite all the excitement around styluses and touchscreens, computer mice haven’t got any less important. Most of us are faster and more accurate when using a mouse to click on icons, buttons or links, or to make selections, and the combination of keyboard shortcuts and mouse navigation is pretty hard to beat when it comes to getting stuff done. - Source: Internet HyperX’s attempt at a honeycomb gaming mouse is a good one. The Pulsefire Haste weighs just 59g, making it easily the lightest mouse we’ve ever tested. This ridiculous weight is supposed to help where rapid mouse movements are required and for our part, it doesn’t disappoint. - Source: Internet Although we haven’t finished our review of the Magic Mouse – long overdue, we know – we’ve been using ours for months now, and it’s still the best mouse for productivity and creative workloads we’ve ever used. If you find yourself doing a double take when looking at the specs, as there are no buttons on the Magic Mouse. This mouse is completely controlled by gestures, giving it all the benefits of a trackpad, as well as a mouse. - Source: Internet Just because a mouse has a gaming focus, it doesn’t mean it’s no good for productivity. That was my reasoning when I looked at things like the Logitech G502 Lightspeed and the G Pro X Superlight. From Razer, the Viper Ultimate looked like another strong option. - Source: Internet Your mouse should function as an extension of your hand and arm, not a separate entity. You’ll want a mouse that can move and click as fast as you, without any lag time or lack of response. If you spend a lot of time at your computer, you might want to get an ergonomically designed mouse to alleviate and prevent pain in your hand, wrist, or shoulder. - Source: Internet Suffice to say, playing with a well-fitting gaming mouse does make a huge difference gameplay-wise, especially in competitive esports titles. It’s unfortunate, then, that many gamers often ignore the weight and dimensions of the mouse in favor of overall specs and features. However, you don’t have to compromise on comfort to have a great gaming mouse. - Source: Internet With a total of six programmable buttons, the Pulsefire Haste isn’t overladen with features, but this sort of feels like the point. Even the RGB lighting is limited to just a small strip that outlines the scroll wheel. The Pulsefire Haste can however be customised to your heart’s content (as much as this minimalist mouse can be) using HyperX’s Ngenuity software, so in this respect the essentials are covered and covered well. It even comes with grip tape to prevent accidental slippage, and the cable is braided, too. - Source: Internet But, that’s not all. It also features Microsoft’s BlueTrack technology so you can skip those pesky mouse pads, as well as Bluetooth connectivity with up to 33 feet in range. Although we haven’t fully tested this mouse, verified users have praised it for boasting effortless glide as well as an accurate, responsive performance. It has nice, clicky buttons that might be a little too loud for some, but those buttons are also extremely satisfying to press. - Source: Internet Razer’s Viper Ultimate, literally on the other hand, is a surprisingly competent all-purpose mouse. For one, as alluded to, it’s truly ambidextrous. At 74g it glides across the desk making it a pleasure to use for extended periods. With a 70 hour battery life it was joint first with the G Pro X for longevity in this category (the G502 offers around 50 hours). - Source: Internet Absolutely. The two biggest gaming mice in the market—namely the G502 Hero and Lightspeed—are made by Logitech. And yes, they’re indeed very good, thanks to the best-in-class Hero 25K optical gaming sensor and fantastic infinite scroll wheels. - Source: Internet To compete with the very best gamers out there, you’ll need to equip yourself with the best gaming mouse you can afford. That’s where we come in: we’ve spent hundreds of hours playing games and running tests to sort the winners from the wannabes. Read on and we’ll help you pick the best mouse for your games and playing style. - Source: Internet The newest iteration of the G502 comes with the Hero 25K gaming sensor—the same as Logitech G Pro—which is good for up to 25,600 DPI. Other features include 11 programmable buttons, a scroll wheel with support for infinite scroll, RGB lights (LightSync compatible), 400 IPS tracking speed, and a 1000Hz polling rate. Lastly, the mouse has adjustable weights. - Source: Internet The Surface Precision uses one of Microsoft’s Bluetrack optical sensors, swapping the usual red LED for (you guessed it) a blue one. The technology works extremely well across a wide range of surfaces. And while you don’t get as many buttons as there are on the Logitech 2S, you do get a silky scroll wheel with switchable smooth and clicky modes. The battery is charged via a micro-USB cable, which also allows you to use it as a normal wired mouse, although with the battery lasting up to three months on a single charge you shouldn’t have to plug it in too often. This is a pricey mouse and not particularly good value, but once you’ve used it it’s hard to pick up another rodent. - Source: Internet SteelSeries’ cheapest gaming mouse is a minimalistic affair. At just 22mm high, and weighing only 77g, this is a low profile pointer best suited to the tip or claw grippers out there. In testing, however, this palm gripper soon adjusted to the low weight and slim frame and wielded the Rival 3 with more accuracy than any other mouse on test. - Source: Internet There are three main grip types - palm grip, claw grip and fingertip grip. Some mice are designed to cater to all types while others are only suitable for one or two. SteelSeries has a nice guide to the different grip types and that’s worth reading if you don’t know how your hold your mouse already. - Source: Internet I did wonder, while hammering together that G502 X review, if I was just being an Olympic gold medallist nitpicker. But no – considering how much time you spend touching it, having a mouse that feels comfortable is just as important as having one that’s fast and responsive in games. Just like the best gaming keyboards and the best gaming headsets, the finest mice should be a pleasure to use in themselves, and that’s true of all the models this list – whether they’re dirt-cheap bargains or luxury gaming mice dripping with added buttons and RGB. - Source: Internet Razer Basilisk V3 is the perfect choice for the RGB enthusiasts among us. At the heart of the mouse is the iconic and improved Razer Focus+ 26K sensor with a 26,000 DPI. There are up to 11 programmable buttons, a great scroll-wheel with ‘hyperscroll’ (same as Logitech’s “Infinite Scroll”), eleven individual RGB zones offering support for Razer Chroma RGB, and the ultra-lightweight SpeedFlex braided cable. - Source: Internet MX Master 3S comes equipped with Darkfield 8000 laser sensor, good for up to 8,000 DPI. There are 7 programmable buttons in total, and the scroll wheel has a Smart Shift feature which uses an electromagnetic mechanism for infinite scrolling. Other features include a unique gesture button on the thumb rest, which can be used to assign different macros. And lastly, there’s a USB-C charging port at the front of the mouse that supports fast charging. - Source: Internet We tested the performance and comfort of the mice in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive—colloquially known as CS: GO and Fortnite. Being fast-paced esport titles, both games require lots of wrist flicking and rapid flexing of thumb and fingers. Next, we ran the mice through a series of mini-tests to evaluate their technical performance. We tested the sensitivity of their optical sensors, wireless connectivity (where applicable), DPI levels, tracking speed, input latency, polling rate, angle snapping, macros, and the overall customizability of the hardware, Finally, we evaluated each mouse’s physical and visual aspects, such as RGB lighting effects, thumb rests, side grips, scroll wheel, build quality, adjustable weights, the number of auxiliary buttons, and their overall ‘click’ feel. - Source: Internet The latter two sound similar to the two scroll wheel feels offered in the Logitech MX Master 3S and 3, which is the most premium-feeling scroll wheel I’ve used. I’ve seen this Logitech MagSpeed wheel imitated but never executed as successfully. The Razer Pro Click Mini, for example, also lets you scroll smoothly or notch by notch, but it feels rattly and is loud. - Source: Internet Take a look at our picks of the best mice for different users with different needs and budget. Some of them are incredibly affordable while others are a little more on the pricey end. Luckily, early Black Friday deals are live now, and a lot of these are already getting discounts so you can save money. For your convenience, we’re keeping track of those deals and making them available here. All you need to do is choose the right mouse for you, select the best price available, and hit buy. - Source: Internet Choosing the right award for the Razer Viper Ultimate was tough. For one thing, it’s one of the lightest, thinnest mice we’ve tested; but it’s also ambidextrous, and it boasts the best battery life of any wireless mouse I’ve tested. However, that ridiculous 74g weight paired with a slight build and some rather unique specifications mean that the Viper Ultimate stands out as a mouse for anyone looking to capitalise on their lightning-fast reflexes. - Source: Internet The buttons have a very nice, tactile feel to them; however, they aren’t nearly as loud as we would’ve liked. However, the company claims that each button is good for up to 60M clicks—about 10-20M more than most mice in our test—which is a good tradeoff. The buttons are also programmable via the SteelSeries Engine utility. The same goes for the RGB logo, as well as the light strip at the bottom. Overall, this is a feature-rich mouse, despite its budget-oriented price tag. - Source: Internet The Basilisk V3 Pro is a lot pricier than its wired counterpart, not to mention heavier, and if you want its wireless charger – the Razer Mouse Dock Pro – then that’s another big expense. Frankly, it’s a nice but unnecessary luxury, and at least with boring old cabled charging, you can keep using the mouse at the same time. And what a mouse this is: keenly sculpted to fit both palm and fingertip grips, with slip-proof textured rubber sections, tonnes of customisable buttons, solid-feeling optical switches, and a precise scroll wheel. This wheel also has a free-spinning mode, one of the Basilisk’s many similarities with the Logitech G502 series. - Source: Internet In everyday play, some tend to place too much emphasis on the CPI / DPI of the best gaming mice on the market. CPI (or sometimes referred to as DPI) tracks how often the mouse’s sensor tracks the surface it’s on. The higher this rate, the less you’ll need to move your mouse to register movement on the screen. CPI has been exploding recently, with mice now starting to push past the 20K sensors that were so impressive just last year. It’s worth noting, though, that these incredibly sensitive settings won’t be used from day to day, so an 8K or 10K sensor on the right mouse can still give you the edge. - Source: Internet Palm grip: This style of mouse grip involves resting your entire hand on the mouse. It’s a lot more relaxed than the claw and fingertip grip, and is better for large hand / arm movements. It’s probably how you’re holding your mouse right now. - Source: Internet Predictably, the MX Master 3S does seem to do most of the things I want. BUT, only really thanks to that thumbwheel. It is particularly suited for what I need. That said, I find myself quite taken by the Pro Click, and despite lacking a second scroll wheel, it pretty much matches the MX Master 3S in every other manner. It’s also lighter which is a small positive in its favor. - Source: Internet If you’re looking for the best gaming mouse then look no further. There are many factors to consider, the ones that take the top spots usually feature adjustable factors and programmable buttons but are still designed with comfort in mind so you can check in for those long sessions. The wide range available now means that prices are lower than ever. - Source: Internet While we’re on the topic of buttons, the new MX Master 3S has almost no click sound at all. It makes almost every other mouse seem quite conspicuous by comparison. It also means the click motion feels a little smoother which all adds up to a much nicer experience. - Source: Internet Bluetooth mice have some advantages, particularly if you’re using one with a laptop. First, they work with your computer’s built-in Bluetooth connectivity, so you won’t need to sacrifice a USB port. Second, once you’ve paired a mouse with your PC or laptop, it pretty much works as soon as you switch it on. Bluetooth mice used to have issues with performance, connection stability and battery life, but new Bluetooth standards and developments in battery technology have, for the most part, solved these. As an added bonus, some Bluetooth mice have been designed to pair with multiple devices – including PCs, laptops, convertibles and Android tablets – and switch between up to three with the aid of a switch or button. - Source: Internet Microsoft’s pint-sized mobile mouse is a budget belter, basic in terms of features but great in terms of build quality and feel. Depending on the colour, £10 to £15 will net you a simple two-button mouse with scroll wheel, connecting via a USB nano transceiver. On the one hand, its compact size and 90g weight make it a great mouse for slinging in a bag and carrying around when you’re using a laptop. On the other, it’s surprisingly comfortable and perfectly responsive in everyday use. - Source: Internet That includes Razer’s Pro 30K optical sensor, found in many of Razer’s $100-plus mice. It’s specced for up to 30,000 counts per inch, 750 inches per second max velocity, and a max acceleration of 70 g. All three of those are among the highest specs you can find in a mouse today. - Source: Internet The Pro Wireless is also one of the most tasteful gaming mice, design-wise. Its smooth, simple curves are accented by a single zone of RGB lighting over its G logo on the rear of the mouse, and that’s it. Not jaunty angles, no glossy flourishes; just good old-fashioned design that doesn’t make you want to blush with embarrassment every time another human being claps eyes on it. - Source: Internet The only real downside here is the datedness of both the mouse design and the AOC G-Tools application. The latter is the place to customise your DPI adjuster, map controls to buttons and change the fairly uninspiring LED lighting. It functions perfectly well, but it definitely needs dragging into the current year. The same is true of the mouse, which looks several years out of date thanks to the metallic left/right click and mismatched sniper button. - Source: Internet The G Pro has 8 programmable buttons, all with a nice, tactile feel. The scroll wheel is equally as good. However, the G Pro lacks its siblings ‘infinity’ scroll, namely the G502 and G903. It’s a minor complaint, but there shouldn’t be any at this price point. - Source: Internet The main nitpick for me with the Viper is that the two buttons near your ring finger and pinkie take a little getting used to if you palm a mouse like I do. I had to train myself to click with the side of my finger rather than the tip. The net result is that I was surprised to find myself gravitating toward the Viper Ultimate most out of this category, despite the G502 being closer to what I had in mind when setting out on this test. - Source: Internet Here are some recommendations for locating information about Free Spinning Mouse Wheel to get you started:\r- Research Logitech Hyper Scroll-related information from credible sources.

But if you are more of a MOBA, MMO or RPG gamer then you might like to consider a <strong>mouse</strong> with more buttons. That&rsquo;ll make life easier to carry out actions, combine in-game abilities and generally win. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We combed the Internet for information on the different mice while also reading customer reviews from real users; we sought advice from experts; and, of course, we relied on our accumulated experts. We considered specific features that are essential for gaming mice. We looked for lightweight, strong, and comfortable gaming mice, keeping in mind that a great gaming <strong>mouse</strong> needs to be very comfortable when held by the user. This will improve point precision and speed when playing games that require high speed when played. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Like other Kone mice, the Pro Air is quite large, with a long, wide body and a round palm rest. It’s asymmetrical and therefore built with right-handers in mind, but the design is supremely comfortable; the thumb rest is deep and we particularly like that the rear of the <strong>mouse</strong> flares outwards on the right-hand side, lifting your pinky finger off the body of the <strong>mouse</strong> a bit. It’s a lovely thing to use day-to-day. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There’s a very good reason why this <strong>mouse</strong> is one of the most popular gaming mice right now. Announced all the way back in 2014, it’s still selling strong, a testament to its capabilities and prowess. Of course, Logitech has made gradual changes over the years to keep it fresh. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Your pinky finger shouldn’t have to stretch to reach the side of the <strong>mouse</strong> opposite to your thumb. Palm: The front of your palm should be supported by the <strong>mouse</strong> itself. The back of the palm and the upper wrist should be able to rest on the table comfortably. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Google around for “the best PC <strong>mouse</strong>” and you’ll find one answer: Logitech’s MX Master 3. You might see a few mentions of others — like the Razer Pro Click and Microsoft’s Surface Precision <strong>mouse</strong> — but the reviews are clear that the MX 3 Master is the one. Since we first published this guide, Logitech has released the MX Master 3S which improves on the already popular device with a sharper sensor and quieter buttons. We’ve updated this guide accordingly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Look, feel and connectivity aside, the main things that distinguish different wireless mice are their sensitivity and selection of wheels and buttons. All wireless mice will feature the two buttons plus <strong>scroll</strong>-wheel layout that’s been standard since the mid-1990s, but some go further with a two-axis wheel that shifts left or right to <strong>scroll</strong> horizontally as well as vertically, or additional wheels or buttons on the top surface or side of the <strong>mouse</strong>. These may be supported directly in certain applications, but in most cases, you can configure what the buttons do using the software provided. You might use them to activate specific functions or controls in a design application, for example, or to minimise, maximise and switch between open windows. Once you get used to it, this can be a real time and effort-saver. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While Logitech G Pro is rather compact by definition, it’s by no means cramped or uncomfortable. Quite the opposite, in fact. Most gamers with big hands find the <strong>mouse</strong> extremely comfortable to handle. Having said that, people who use the claw grip method may find it a bit cramped. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The G502 Hero can easily last 5 years or more if handled and maintained well. The <strong>mouse</strong> was released all the way back in 2014, and there are still plenty of people out there who still have the original models. While the <strong>mouse</strong> is on the heavier side, it’s due to its build quality, which is superb. The G502 Hero means business with its nice, thick plastic shell and premium rubber grips which are built to last. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Besides, the Viper has a much more tasteful design than the Pugio, and its two main clicker buttons feel more responsive, too. Plus, the Viper is nicely light, coming in at just 69g. This means it&rsquo;s super easy to swish around your <strong>mouse</strong> mat, and never becomes a drag when you&rsquo;re playing games for long periods of time. Razer&rsquo;s Synapse 3 software gives you loads of customisation options, too. Anyone disappointed by the Viper V2 Pro adopting a purely right-handed design can take solace in the fact that it’s most ostensibly basic predecessor remains a brilliant ambidextrous gaming <strong>mouse</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>mouse</strong>’s <strong>scroll</strong> wheel has a rubber track and works excellently, although our review unit did squeak occasionally (hey, it&rsquo;s a <strong>mouse</strong>). Impressively, you also get a button to adjust tracking sensitivity, with four choices: 600dpi, 1,000dpi, 1,600dpi and 3,200dpi. The <strong>mouse</strong>’s sensor is accurate and responsive on every setting and a small blue LED helpfully flashes to indicate which resolution is selected (from one for 600dpi up to four times for 3,200dpi). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Let’s get the basic specs out of the way first: SteelSeries Rival 3 has an optical sensor with a DPI of 8,000, a 1,000Hz polling rate, 6 programmable buttons, and lastly, a non-braided rubber cable. Nothing groundbreaking compared to what we have already seen. Surprisingly enough, the <strong>mouse</strong> has an RGB logo, as well as a light strip at the bottom. Something we didn’t expect to find on a budget <strong>mouse</strong>! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For seamless connectivity, there’s a switch located at the bottom of the <strong>mouse</strong>, which you can use to select up to three different devices. The <strong>mouse</strong> can be easily connected with Windows or Mac laptops—as well as iPads—via Bluetooth. You can connect two devices right off the bat with Bluetooth, as well as the included USB dongle. An additional device can be connected via Logitech Bolt Receiver (not included with the <strong>mouse</strong>). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>That’s going to be of more use to you playing Apex Legends or Overwatch than making selections in Photoshop, but if precision matters you’ll struggle to find anything to match this <strong>mouse</strong>. Nor does it overload you with unnecessary buttons: just the normal two plus one beneath the <strong>scroll</strong> wheel and two more underneath the thumb. If you don’t game at all, this mighty <strong>mouse</strong> will be wasted, but if you do it’ll also handle any work you need to do – and more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I’d have very much liked to update this guide to the best gaming mice with the Logitech G502 X, a mouthwateringly extensive (that’s hyperbole) overhaul of possibly the greatest and most beloved PC peripheral on the market (that’s not hyperbole). Sadly, thanks to an excessively scratchy <strong>scroll</strong> wheel, it hasn’t made the cut, leaving its predecessor (and RPS reader favourite) the Logitech G502 Hero in the top spot. Oh well. At least that’s still good. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>These days, the best mice are primarily wireless and it’s really not hard to understand why. Cables are messy and a real hassle if you’re using a convertible tablet-style PC or laptop, there’s a huge choice of wireless and Bluetooth mice available, and the price premium is virtually non-existent. What’s more, battery life is now so good and connectivity so reliable that the old objections to going wireless have pretty much dropped away. While some hardcore gamers still believe wireless <strong>mouse</strong> performance is inferior to that of their cabled rivals, a decent wireless <strong>mouse</strong> with a stable connection generally provides an identical experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In a gaming <strong>mouse</strong>, not all components are alike between models and brands. This is even more noticeable in a <strong>scroll</strong> wheel encoder. A great encoder, like a TTC Gold, provides clear tactile steps and is designed with gamers in mind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The brand might not be as well known as Logitech or Microsoft, but the Rapoo MT-550 gives you the same comfort and features for less. It’s light and very solid-feeling, with a lovely soft-touch finish, and shaped so that it feels just right under the palm and fingers. The thumb can rest easy on the left-side of the <strong>mouse</strong>, and the extra backwards/forwards buttons and <strong>scroll</strong> wheel sit exactly where most of us would want them. The <strong>scroll</strong> wheel is a little light, but it’s still precise, and the same goes for movement, thanks to the switchable 600dpi to 1,600dpi sensor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol><li>Razer Basilisk V3 The best gaming <strong>mouse</strong> overall Specifications Connection: Wired Shape: Right-handed Buttons: 10 +1 DPI: 26,000 IPS: Up to 650 Switches: Razer 2nd Gen Optical Mechanical Weight: 3.67oz (104g) Today&rsquo;s Best Deals View at Sports Direct (opens in new tab) View at Razer (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Thoughtful additional features + Super fast 26K DPI sensor + Comfortable ergonomic design + Cheaper than the V2 Reasons to avoid - Not light enough for competitive players - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Where the wired Basilisk V3 really comes into its own, however, is with the new <strong>scroll</strong> wheel. The Basilisk V3 is the first gaming <strong>mouse</strong> outside of Logitech’s own factories with a free-wheeling <strong>scroll</strong>er and what this means is that you not only get a normal “notched” <strong>scroll</strong>ing mode, but there’s also a “free-spin” mode – enabled with a simple button press – which lets loose the <strong>scroll</strong> wheel for high-speed <strong>scroll</strong>ing. It also increases momentum the faster you spin the wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Looking for a Logitech G502 Hero, albeit with wireless connectivity? Logitech has the answer in the guise of G502 Lightspeed. Everything’s here: The remarkable Hero 25K sensor, the iconic G502 look, 11 programmable buttons with the familiar tactile spring switches, infinite <strong>scroll</strong>-wheel, RGB lights, and above all, full customizability via Logitech G Hub. However, G502 Lightspeed is more than just a rehashed G502 Hero with wireless circuitry stuffed inside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As the name suggests, the MX Anywhere 3 is the mobile version of the MX Master 3S. Unlike its bigger brother, the Anywhere has a semi-ambidextrous design. It’s perhaps a shade too small to cut it as desktop replacement, but in the mobile realm it feels premium, complete with the auto-switching between ratchet and free-flowing <strong>scroll</strong> wheel — which at $80, it should. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The answer, unfortunately for left-handers, is that in most other ways the Viper V2 Pro is a big improvement. Most noticeably, it’s even lighter than the Viper Ultimate, shedding down to just 58g – which combined with the impeccably smooth feet makes it a real pleasure to slide around. As does the comfortable shape, and while the Viper V2 Pro also gets rid of the Viper Ultimate’s built-in textured grips, it replaces them with stick-on rubber strips you can apply yourself. If you eventually wear one down, you can replace the strip alone, not the entire <strong>mouse</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>mouse</strong> sits nicely in the hand and is just heavy enough to feel precise. The see-through top cover has a texture I can only describe as smooth without being slippy. The resistance of the left and right <strong>mouse</strong> buttons is minimal thanks to Roccat’s own Titan optical switches, which makes clicking feel uniquely fast and responsive. It’s also surprisingly quiet, so you won’t have to worry about plaguing your roommates with your clicking around on a sleepy Sunday morning. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If done well, the Naga V2 Pro could have one of the most personal <strong>scroll</strong> wheel experiences available. But we&rsquo;ll hold off on any applause until we see this working without annoying rattling noises or inconsistent behavior. Software dependence can also be a turn-off to some users, from those using multiple devices to those not wanting to dedicate computing resources to a <strong>mouse</strong> app. You can toggle between <strong>scroll</strong> wheel feels on Logitech&rsquo;s MX Master 3S and 3 out of the box by simply pushing a button on the <strong>mouse</strong>; no software is necessary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are a lot of wireless mice to choose from, with the biggest players – Microsoft and Logitech – responsible for several bewildering lines. Which you go for will depend on your budget, the laptop or PC that you’re using, the features you want and the kind of shape and feel you prefer. The last of these is important. Some people love a big, chunky <strong>mouse</strong> that fills their hand; others a slimline <strong>mouse</strong> they can move with their fingertips and stow in a laptop case without adding weight or bulk. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The first thing you’ll notice when comparing it to other mice is the button below the thumb grip with a little [+] on it. This may be familiar to you if you’ve already got other Roccat products, and indicates their trademark EasyShift technology. Hold down the + button and it changes the normal function of your buttons into whatever you like. For instance, by default, holding down the EasyShift button and flicking the <strong>mouse</strong>wheel to the right lets you skip tracks on Spotify. With four more thumb buttons, including two at the front for changing DPI and one on top for switching profiles, this <strong>mouse</strong> can do a lot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Size is also a consideration, although this is strictly a matter of personal preference. Mice like the Microsoft Classic Intelli<strong>mouse</strong> are long-bodied, and appeal to users who hold mice with their entire palms. Smaller mice lend themselves to a &ldquo;claw&rdquo; grip, meaning you can comfortably hold it with three fingertips. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=9><li>Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite The best gaming <strong>mouse</strong> for MMOs and MOBAs Specifications Connection: Wired Shape: Right-handed Buttons: 17 DPI: 18,000 IPS: Up to 400 Switches: Omron Weight: 4.3oz (122g) Today&rsquo;s Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Scan (opens in new tab) View at CORSAIR (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Tonnes of programmable buttons + Exceptional build quality + Great sensitivity Reasons to avoid - Small side buttons - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>To add to this growing pile of positives, the Viper Ultimate will last 70 hours on a single charge and includes a nifty magnetic charging dock with braided cable. You can customise lighting and button functions within Razer Synapse, where you’ll also find the option to switch between right- and left-handed modes. Put simply, this <strong>mouse</strong> does it all – which explains the high price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Logitech G502 Hero, and its wireless variant, G502 Lightspeed, are two of the biggest gaming mice available in the market right now. They both are measured at 132 x 75 x 40mm. As a consequence, these <strong>mouse</strong>s are also quite heavy at 121g and 114g, respectively. However, they offer fantastic gaming performance, thanks to the Hero 25K optical sensor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>ECx-B: This is the new and upgraded version of the A. It features the flawless 3360 sensor, with the other most notable change found on the bottom, where Zowie swapped the 2 large <strong>mouse</strong> feet on the A for four smaller feet. Minor changes were also made to the side buttons and the coating. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Thanks to a durable 2.4 GHz wireless dongle, you can use the <strong>mouse</strong> wirelessly anywhere — and with up to 18 months of battery life, you&rsquo;ll rarely have to replace the peripheral&rsquo;s single AA battery. Another cool thing about the M325 is that, unlike many other productivity mice, it comes in a variety of colors: red, blue, purple and pink. Logitech also produces extremely similar mice under its Party and Doodle collections, which adorn their mice with floral and cartoon patterns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Black Friday deal: SAVE on this excellent Logitech gaming <strong>mouse</strong> The Logitech G703 Lightspeed is a talented multipurpose <strong>mouse</strong> that features on several of our <strong>mouse</strong> roundups. Right now at Amazon, it&rsquo;s going for £38, which is substantially lower than normal. If you work and play at the same PC, the G703 is the <strong>mouse</strong> you need. Amazon Average £55 Now £38 Buy Now - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Krystal 4D <strong>mouse</strong>wheel is prominent and lets you assign a function to its right and left ‘click’ function. Something to be aware of if you’re planning on using the <strong>mouse</strong> for work as well as play is that the <strong>scroll</strong> wheel offers quite a tactile feel. Good for choosing weapons in-game, but perhaps not ideal for <strong>scroll</strong>ing through PDFs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It&rsquo;s no slouch when it comes to features, either. It offers an enviable 18,000 DPI sensor with a tolerance of 400 IPS, meaning it&rsquo;ll still be able to track your movements when the <strong>mouse</strong> is hurtling across your mat. Additionally, the click action of each button is tactile and satisfying. That makes the Ironclaw RGB a real contender for the prize of best gaming <strong>mouse</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Razer itself claims that DeathAdder V2 possesses “best-in-class ergonomics”. Whatever your grip style may be, this <strong>mouse</strong> fits big hands like a glove. Unfortunately, the <strong>mouse</strong> isn’t ambidextrous, which is about the only gripe about its design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For gamers primarily looking for comfort, it doesn’t get much better than Razer DeathAdder V2. For starters, DeathAdder V2 has the Razer Focus+ 20K optical sensor, good for 20,000 DPI and 650 IPS tracking. It’s also the third lightest <strong>mouse</strong> in our test, weighing in at just 82g, i.e., just 2g heavier than the Logitech G Pro. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The streamlined sidekick: Microsoft Surface Mobile Mouse (£30) A <strong>mouse</strong> might be nothing without a surface, but you don’t need a Surface to enjoy the subtle charms of Microsoft’s Mobile Mouse. Pocket-friendly and powered by a trio of triple-As, this Bluetooth buddy gets the basics just right: compact, attractive and immeasurably more reliable than Windows 8. Where to buy Buy the Microsoft Surface Mobile Mouse here from Argos - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>scroll</strong> wheel on Razer&rsquo;s new <strong>mouse</strong> appears to take customization to a new level. Razer says it has six different modes. Those modes, Razer&rsquo;s announcement said, include: Standard &ldquo;for more typical in-game selections&rdquo;; Distinct &ldquo;for easy, definitive <strong>scroll</strong>ing&rdquo;; Ultrafine &ldquo;for the highest number of inputs&rdquo;; Adaptive Scrolling &ldquo;to give less resistance the faster the wheel is <strong>scroll</strong>ed&rdquo;; and Free Scrolling &ldquo;for always-on accelerated <strong>scroll</strong>ing.&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We at GamesRadar+ play a massive range of genres, which means we often have to compromise somewhere when finding hardware that fits them all. It&rsquo;s hard to find a <strong>mouse</strong> that serves each game&rsquo;s needs without it becoming an overstuffed monstrosity. That&rsquo;s where the Razer Naga Pro comes in. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Microsoft’s Surface Precision is listed as “up to 3 months” which I somehow read with an implied shrug on their part. It’s hard to know whether those are active use or “the <strong>mouse</strong> is on and it’s on your desk.” The better news is that all of them can be charged while you use them. In practice, I found the MX Master 3S to last the longest, but also needing a charge way sooner than its 70 days claim, in my experience it’s more like every 5-6 weeks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ergonomic mice don’t have to come with a higher price tag. The Microsoft Bluetooth Ergonomic Mouse is proof of this. It’s also a terrific value, offering more than just a comfortable grip, natural hand position, and light weight that this Bluetooth <strong>mouse</strong> offers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Is a gaming <strong>mouse</strong> really better? If you&rsquo;re new to PC gaming you may be wondering whether the often higher prices of gaming mice will actually enhance your game. While even the most expensive gaming <strong>mouse</strong> won&rsquo;t turn you into a pro player overnight, there are features included as standard on these devices that you won&rsquo;t find in regular pointers. A precise sensor, better acceleration, extra programmable buttons, and a form factor designed for longer sessions all make gaming mice far more suited to play than regular productivity mice. You&rsquo;ll likely find these specs on more premium non-gaming products, but you&rsquo;ll be spending a lot more to get them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The M720 doesn’t have the laser sensor of the MX Master 2S, but it’s nonetheless a feature-rich <strong>mouse</strong> for its price point. It connects via Bluetooth or a USB nano receiver that fits neatly into a slot inside the battery compartment. It will pair with up to three PCs or other devices, which you can switch between using the rear-most of three buttons on the side. The other two are user-configurable, while the wheel tilts for horizontal <strong>scroll</strong>ing. As with the more expensive Logitech 2S, you can switch between smooth and clicky <strong>scroll</strong>ing modes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The differences are small but significant. The MX Master 3 still has the extra programmable buttons of the 2S, with an extra thumbwheel for zooming or horizontal <strong>scroll</strong>ing and a hidden button where your thumb rests on the left-hand side. The <strong>scroll</strong> wheel still switches between clicky and superfast smooth <strong>scroll</strong>ing at the press of a button, but it’s even lighter, quieter and more pixel-level responsive than the wheel on last year’s model. Meanwhile, the two slightly awkward buttons tucked behind the thumbwheel have been dropped in favour of two slim, more conventional buttons just below, where they’re more ergonomic – and the design on the left-hand side is just that little bit smoother. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>– A highly customizable wired <strong>mouse</strong> for people with big hands, featuring Hero 25K optical sensor, 11 programmable buttons, an infinite <strong>scroll</strong>-wheel, LightSync compatible RGB lights, 400 IPS tracking, and customizable weights. Logitech G502 Lightspeed – Wireless variant of the G502 Hero with lighter weight, stiffened chassis, long battery life, cutting-edge endoskeleton design, good side grips, and excellent build quality, and the same Hero 25K optical sensor as the G502 Hero with 400 IPS tracking. Best wireless gaming <strong>mouse</strong> for big hands on the market! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grip aside, the controls are fairly conventional, with the <strong>scroll</strong> wheel and two buttons on what’s now the right-hand surface of the <strong>mouse</strong>, and two additional buttons – next and previous by default – near the top of the thumb grip. You can switch between three sensitivity settings with a button on the top edge of the <strong>mouse</strong>, and while it’s not quite as pinpoint-accurate as the high-end Microsoft and Logitech mice, it never feels laggy, vague or unresponsive. The only minor grumbles are that it uses two AAA batteries (not included) and that it needs to be woken up with a left or right-click if left unattended for eight minutes or more; a sensible battery-saving measure, but an annoyance when other mice wake on movement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The winner of the most forgettable-looking option in this nest of mice goes to the Orochi V2. Or maybe it’s just understated? Especially for a Razer product. Looks aside, the Orochi V2 is a very capable mobile <strong>mouse</strong> with six buttons, Bluetooth or dongle connectivity and it works with Razer’s Synapse software, so any macros you might already have can be assigned here (or make your own!). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Small, narrow and not particularly tall, the Pulsefire Haste is made for claw grippers. But like many of the mice on this list, these characteristics make it a fine choice for anyone who needs as much control and dexterity as a gaming <strong>mouse</strong> can offer. In fact, the Pulsefire Haste sailed through our accuracy test: we produced a perfect 100% score, hitting every target we aimed at over the course of a 30-second period. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At 425 (2.4Ghz) or 950 hours (BLE) you get a decent amount of time out of each battery and you can use either a single AA or AAA. It weighs just 60g, so it’s also pretty nimble. At $70, it’s edging into full-desktop <strong>mouse</strong> territory, but given that it’s big enough to actually use this full time, that seems less surprising. Especially given that you can stow the dongle under the top cover, which is more than can be said for the MX Anywhere 3 (or even the MX Master 3S). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Corsair Sabre RGB Pro Wireless is a supremely comfortable gaming <strong>mouse</strong> that connects to your PC/laptop via either Bluetooth or a Corsair Slipstream wireless dongle. It has a tall, round profile with a splayed front that best suits gamers who cling to their pointer for dear life. At 79g it’s surprisingly light but the bulky frame helps prevent it from feeling insubstantial. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For our tests, we paired the <strong>mouse</strong> simultaneously with our Windows PC via USB receiver and a MacBook Air M1 via Bluetooth. Overall, the <strong>mouse</strong> performed admirably. However, our testers were unimpressed by its gaming performance. As it turns out, the <strong>mouse</strong> has a very limited polling rate of just 125 Hz, along with a tracking rate of just 30 IPS. Good enough for casual gaming but unsuitable for competitive esports shooters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ergonomic ambidextrous design: Tournament ready <strong>mouse</strong> developed with Esports pros for maximum comfort, control and 50 million click durability. Four removable side buttons for supreme customization. Cable length: 1.80 meters Check Price - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In many ways, the type of sensor used by the <strong>mouse</strong> is more important. Cheaper mice still use a combination of an infrared or red LED light beam and an optical sensor, which is both effective on most surfaces and extremely accurate. However, the more advanced optical sensors, like Microsoft’s Bluetrack, and laser sensors, which switch LED for laser, tend to be more accurate across a wider range of surfaces. This isn’t a massive issue if you only use your <strong>mouse</strong> with a <strong>mouse</strong> pad, but if you want to use it directly on a desk or glass or coffee-shop table, premium mice with premium sensors can be more reliable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We&rsquo;re recommending the Kone XP as the best gaming <strong>mouse</strong> for RGB lovers, but it&rsquo;s important to note that this is from a brute force angle, rather than in terms of customization. It still feels like the Swarm software is catching up, which means we were a little disappointed to realise that you can&rsquo;t actually change the colors of these RGB strips. However, there are plenty of cycles to choose from, and the overall effect may be too good to turn down. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The hyper-responsive optical switches also have the clicky, tactile bite of mechanical switches, so while you do have slightly fewer buttons to configure overall, they feel as snappy as ever. And honestly, the dock isn’t a massive loss. The Viper V2 Pro still comes with a cable and USB-A-to-USB-C coupler, which can close the wireless dongle&rsquo;s distance to the <strong>mouse</strong> just as the dock could, and personally I’d rather charge the <strong>mouse</strong> directly over a wired connection than leave it on a stand. A stand that won’t, y’know, let me keep using the <strong>mouse</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Black Friday: Get our favourite gaming <strong>mouse</strong> for its lowest-ever price The Razer Basilisk V3 is the reigning champion on this roundup, and right now at Amazon, it&rsquo;s going for an all-time-low price.

Thanks to its heat-treated pure PTFE feet, 19K DPI optical sensor, and Titan optical switches, it can keep up with the fastest and most action packed games. Not only is it super fast and responsive, but we also found that it feels more lightweight than it is, thanks to those feet, as well as comfortable to button-mash with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You&rsquo;ll find all gaming mice have a number of specs worth paying attention to. These include max acceleration and max speed numbers. Usually the higher these numbers the better. Along with a good sensor, these specs ensure good tracking and accurate representation of your <strong>mouse</strong> movements and the ability to keep up with your quick flicks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The first thing we noticed right off the bat is its weight, or the lack of it. It’s extremely lightweight at just 80g. While the Razer Viper Mini in our test is even lighter than the G Pro, that <strong>mouse</strong> is wired with no internal battery or other wireless components. It’s amazing just how much performance Logitech has managed to cram in this compact, featherweight <strong>mouse</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>On the other hand, an excellent <strong>mouse</strong> is designed with accuracy, speed, and your comfort in mind, making sure that it does more than the bare minimum in terms of performance and preventing long-term pain and injury during long sessions of PC use. So, whether you’re a creative professional, gamer, business owner, student, office worker, or even a casual PC user, you absolutely need to invest in the best <strong>mouse</strong> for you. If you&rsquo;ve already invested in the best keyboard and the best laptop, you will want to get the best <strong>mouse</strong> as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Finding a suitable, comfortable gaming <strong>mouse</strong> can often take gamers a long time. This is especially true for gamers with big hands who may find regular gaming mice cramped and uncomfortable to use. For prolonged gaming sessions, the <strong>mouse</strong>’s dimensions need to match the player’s hand and their particular grip style to have the best gaming experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Mice for MMO games have a special appeal. These button-laden peripherals are intended to make laying down combos in games a breeze. But their high programmability gives them great potential for much more, including heavy-duty productivity. One of the most popular MMO mice, the Razer Naga series, received an update on Thursday. Offering up to 20 customizable buttons is still the Naga&rsquo;s main prize, but Razer has also made the <strong>scroll</strong> wheel much more interesting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Razer is well known for its comfortable, ergonomic mice – and Basilisk V3 is no exception. For people with either fingertip or palm grip styles, this <strong>mouse</strong> is a no-brainer. However, it hasn’t got the most ambidextrous design and is only suitable for right-handers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Yes. The <strong>mouse</strong> is lightweight at just 77g and also ergonomic friendly. While the overall design is ambidextrous, it’s best suited for right-handers with side buttons located at the left. People who use the palm grip style may find it unsuitable, though. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Then we test its performance, including speed, accuracy, and reliability, by using it in our day to day workloads and in gaming, especially if it’s a gaming <strong>mouse</strong> . We also check its buttons and <strong>scroll</strong> wheels to see how easy and comfortable they are to use. If you’ve been using a cheap <strong>mouse</strong> your whole life, you’ll certainly notice the difference between that and a great <strong>mouse</strong>. And, that’s what we look for here, regardless of whether it’s a productivity <strong>mouse</strong> or a gaming one, a wired <strong>mouse</strong> or a wireless one. If it’s wireless, however, we also test its connectivity, range and battery life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are other factors to consider, such as whether the computer <strong>mouse</strong> has a rechargeable battery or uses replaceable batteries, the number of buttons (some people need the extra buttons!), its ergonomic design, RGB lighting, the type of <strong>mouse</strong> grip and its size. Good software for programming the <strong>mouse</strong> matters, too. The list below takes all of these into consideration and, while the mice here use wireless technology, several can be used as traditional wired mice with a USB cable if you&rsquo;re worried about battery life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Let’s be clear, there’s almost no chance any of the mobile mice on offer would make a great full-time desktop replacement. That said, it’s also one of the more interesting categories thanks to being free from the burden of having to do everything. A mobile <strong>mouse</strong> can get a little wackier and do one or two things really well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In terms of features, the Kone Pro Air errs on the side of minimalist. It has a total of seven programmable buttons plus a switch on the underside to alternate between 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connectivity. There’s also a slot for the USB receiver, which is always appreciated. Bafflingly, the Kone Pro Air doesn’t have a DPI adjuster button - instead, you can create up to six unique profiles via the Swarm application that include lighting settings, button functions and sensitivities, and switch between them via a button on the bottom of the <strong>mouse</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Our Fantech Aria was designed with gamers in mind, to not only allow them to kick ass in their favorite games, but also to allow them to do it anywhere. Aria is designed with tri-mode Bluetooth 5.0 + Wired + 2.4GHz connectivity, as well as a TTC Gold Encoder, actual Kailh & Huano <strong>mouse</strong> button switches, and features a Pixart 3395 with 1000hz polling rate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This concludes our review of the top 9 best gaming mice suitable for people with large hands. All the mice in this test not only excel at competitive eSports gaming but will also serve you well in normal day-to-day and casual gaming. None of the mice we tested in this review are particularly bad at anything. Having said that, the best of the bunch is, without a doubt, the Logitech G Pro, a great all-rounder <strong>mouse</strong> that has gained somewhat cult status in recent years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Generally speaking, wireless mice tend to suffer from latency issues. Yet somehow, the G Pro’s input latency is comparable to a wired <strong>mouse</strong>. We compared the G Pro with the wired Logitech G502 Hero—another <strong>mouse</strong> with the same Hero 25K sensor—back-to-back in CS: GO and literally couldn’t notice any discernible input delay. Overall, very impressive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wireless gaming mice are gathering steam these days, as models hit the market that can overcome the traditional latency that used to come with untethering. However, it&rsquo;s still worth noting that you&rsquo;ll be paying a lot more for a wireless <strong>mouse</strong> that functions like a wired one. These superfast connections still come at a premium, especially when placed on devices with high CPI rates and other fancier features. A 2.4GHz connection is a must if you&rsquo;re looking to spend a little more on a wireless device, though, as this is the only way you&rsquo;ll pick up competitive response times without a cable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>– The lightest <strong>mouse</strong> in our test at just 61g, 8,500 DPI sensor, SpeedFlex cable, 6 programmable buttons, optical switches, an RGB light strip at the back, and a semi-ambidextrous design. Logitech G903 Wireless – Great wireless <strong>mouse</strong> for left-hand users with an ergonomic design, gentle curves, and a symmetrical ambidextrous design.

Within this testing, however, we&rsquo;re always keeping our assessments inline with value. That means we&rsquo;re making sure that a $150 gaming <strong>mouse</strong> offers just as much value for money as a $30 model, and measuring our results in accordance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The sculpted taskmaster: Logitech MX Master 3 (£100) Mastering a skill takes 10,000 hours. On a tight deadline? Spin up the machined steel Magspeed wheel on the moulded MX Master 3 and it’ll <strong>scroll</strong> through 1000 lines in a single second. Much too fast to digest any information, sure, but at least you’ll know the scale of your ignorance. Logitech’s productivity powerhouse also packs a secondary thumb wheel for horizontal <strong>scroll</strong>ing, while quick-charging smarts can deliver three hours of juice from just a minute at the plug – so you won’t be kept from your treasured spreadsheets for long. Where to buy Buy the Logitech MX Master 3 here from Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Of this trio, the Pro Click offers the most configurable buttons (8). The MX Master 3S is a close second (7) but has the advantage of a second <strong>scroll</strong> wheel near the thumb. In reality, two of Razer’s “buttons” are side-clicks on the <strong>scroll</strong> wheel — typically these default to sideways <strong>scroll</strong>, the same as Logi’s thumb dial does. The net result is that I found the MX Master 3S slightly more configurable for my use cases. The thumbwheel is perfect for switching between desktops — something I do a lot, which would occupy two slots on the Razer meaning, effectively, the MX Master 3S has one more spare button in this setup. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Place your hand on your <strong>mouse</strong>. If your entire hand (palm and fingers) is resting on the surface of the <strong>mouse</strong>, you have a palm grip. If your palm is elevated, and only your fingertips touch the <strong>mouse</strong>, you have a fingertip grip. If the rear of your palm touches the <strong>mouse</strong> surface, and your fingers are visibly arched rather than flat against the <strong>mouse</strong>, you have a claw grip. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a lot to pay even for a high-end, premium <strong>mouse</strong>, but it’s hard to complain when you experience the Microsoft Surface Precision and its luxury feel. Neither as big nor as heavy as the Logitech MX Master 2S, it combines a matt plastic shell with rubberised side panels to superb effect, so the shape fits perfectly inside the hand. Using the three aluminium buttons on the side soon becomes second nature. The “Precision” in its name is justified; when you’re trying to crop images to exact pixel dimensions, or notch up the colour levels on a video, this is exactly the kind of <strong>mouse</strong> you want to use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=10><li>Roccat Burst Pro The best lightweight gaming <strong>mouse</strong> Specifications Connection: Wired Shape: Right-handed Buttons: 6 DPI: 16,000 IPS: Up to 400 Switches: Titan optical Weight: 2.4oz (68g) Today&rsquo;s Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Studio (opens in new tab) View at Scan (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Easy to manoeuvre + Titan optical switches + Stunning RGB Reasons to avoid - Scroll wheel feels grindy - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>But despite the aggressive weight shedding, the <strong>mouse</strong> is still fairly heavy at 114g. Frankly, we could barely notice the reduced weight as most of our testers were skeptical about its weight savings compared to its wired sibling, the G502 Hero. Having said that, it’s every bit as good as the G502 Hero in terms of gaming performance, despite the wireless connectivity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At its core, though, the latest Razer Basilisk is the same versatile pointer that we&rsquo;ve always come to love from one of the best Razer <strong>mouse</strong> lines. With upgraded second generation switches in each main button, an additional trigger button on the left hand side, and a brand new smart <strong>scroll</strong> wheel, though, there are plenty of new features to celebrate here. We found those new switches to be a little lighter to the touch than previous iterations, but were impressed that they still managed to keep a satisfying response and snapped back quickly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s a smaller, lighter <strong>mouse</strong> than the MX Master 2S, which might suit those with smaller hands or who prefer fingertip control, and it’s powered by a single AA battery, which Logitech claims will last for up to two years. While the 1,000dpi resolution optical sensor doesn’t sound so impressive, this <strong>mouse</strong> coped well on a range of surfaces and in more precision-orientated graphics tasks. If you want a <strong>mouse</strong> that can switch from desktop to laptop to convertible in a jiffy, this one has you covered. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The spherical <strong>scroll</strong>er: Kensington Expert Wireless Trackball (£60) Keen to confound your colleagues? Besides trackball accuracy and a static setup that’s kinder to your wrist, the big red orb on this ergonomic number offers guaranteed office amusement. How you’ll laugh as Ian from IT wrestles with its unfamiliar form. How you’ll cry when he flings it at a wall in frustration. What japes! Where to buy Buy the Kensington Expert Wireless Trackball here from Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a serious gaming <strong>mouse</strong> designed for pros, which has the thrills of being lightweight, but without the usual honeycomb shell. It&rsquo;s remarkably agile and wonderfully accurate too. The only downside is the odd lack of DPI switching button, but you can customise DPI and other button settings in the software. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For starters, it’s lighter at 114g, compared to 121g for the G502 Hero. Bear in mind that this <strong>mouse</strong> has an internal battery as well as a wireless radio, which should ‘add’ weight to the <strong>mouse</strong>, not make it lighter! Logitech achieved this by using a clever thin-wall endoskeleton design to reduce weight while maintaining stiffness, as well as lighter components overall. For example, the <strong>scroll</strong> wheel is hollowed out in order to save a few grams. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;re after the lightest gaming <strong>mouse</strong> on the market, the Roccat Burst Pro may seem like it&rsquo;s failed at the first hurdle. Namely, Roccat&rsquo;s Kone Pure Ultra weighs slightly less. However, this ignores the fact that the Pro is better in almost every way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For left-hand users, it can be fairly difficult to find a good, comfortable <strong>mouse</strong>. Most mice in the market are targeted toward right-hand users. However, Logitech has the right answer in the guise of the G903 Wireless Gaming Mouse. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>On a more minor note. During my time with MacOS I joined the dark side of “natural <strong>scroll</strong>.” It’s not a deal-breaker for me, as I don’t mind regular <strong>scroll</strong>, but Logitech and Microsoft both offer reverse <strong>scroll</strong>ing as a setting, Razer doesn’t appear to — though you can work around this in other ways of course. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You&rsquo;re also upgrading the clickers with optical switches. We found the Titan Optical switches to be incredibly responsive, adding to the speedy feel of the <strong>mouse</strong> as a whole. With a 16,000 DPI sensor and that superlight form factor, we were flying across the battlefield with the Burst Pro under hand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your job requires you to spend hours working in front of a computer every day, then you know how important it is to have the right <strong>mouse</strong> and keyboard to help you get the job done. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the size of your office is, what color your clothes are or anything else. If you have an uncomfortable <strong>mouse</strong>, it&rsquo;ll grate on you all day. The most important thing for your office is finding a <strong>mouse</strong> that feels comfortable and improves your productivity. There&rsquo;s a huge wireless <strong>mouse</strong> market out there, so it&rsquo;s easy to find something that suits your specific needs, whatever they may be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Lastly, the Razer logo, as well as the <strong>scroll</strong> wheel, have RGB lights—compatible with Razer Chroma RGB. With Razer Synapse 3 software, you can set the light rhythm, change colors, and also enable in-game lighting effects. The lights themselves are rather basic, however, and only get moderately bright. If it’s RGB you’re after, then consider Razer Basilisk V3 Pro instead, another <strong>mouse</strong> we have covered in this review. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ah, the joys of an ailing <strong>mouse</strong>. Periodically picking fluff from the temperamental sensor. Shouting obscenities at its inconsistent <strong>scroll</strong> wheel. Smacking it on the desk when it refuses to cooperate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A bigger hand can indeed give you a competitive edge when it comes to esports, FPS games, and MMOs. Longer fingers and an overall wider grip, can most definitely make it easier to perform quick 180-degree turns and help you with rapid <strong>mouse</strong> control. It’s by no means a coincidence that a lot of talented esports players have above-average hand sizes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As for the buttons and other features, the <strong>mouse</strong> has 8 buttons in total, all of them programmable. Razer chose to use optical <strong>mouse</strong> switches—instead of a spring mechanism—with a response time of only 0.2ms. However, our testers had mixed feelings about the optical switches. Some liked them, while others noted the reduced tactile feel and ‘clicky’ sound we all come to expect from a gaming <strong>mouse</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With seven customisable buttons and a slot to store the wireless dongle, the Sabre RGB Pro wireless isn’t exactly overflowing with extra features, but from a technical perspective, this <strong>mouse</strong> is up there with the very best. A maximum resolution of 26,000 DPI plus 2,000Hz hyper-polling make this a supremely responsive <strong>mouse</strong> that should appeal to any self-confessed pro gamers out there. Corsair’s iCUE technology is available to those who want to toy with the discreet RGB lighting, remap buttons or adjust DPI intervals. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The 6 programmable buttons, as well as the RGB lights, are directly configurable via the Razer Synapse 3 software. As is the case with other Razer mice in this test, this <strong>mouse</strong> uses optical switches. And as we have established previously, our testers prefer the superior tactile feel and louder click of spring loading switches. However, it all depends on one’s personal preference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As is the case with Logitech G Pro, the G502’s gaming performance is fantastic, all thanks to the Hero 25K gaming sensor. Our testers were very pleased with the gaming performance of this <strong>mouse</strong>. The G502 is, without a doubt, one of the best wired gaming mice available in the market right now. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This isn’t a particularly large <strong>mouse</strong>, and the steeply angled palm rest suits claw grippers more than anyone else. The sides are textured and concave to help your pinkie and thumb grip the <strong>mouse</strong> more easily. I had no difficulty using the AGM700 in Battlefield 2042: the feet glide smoothly and the <strong>mouse</strong> is suitably responsive – plus I quite like the additional weight. Your mileage may of course vary. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Polling rate: How many times the <strong>mouse</strong> communicates its position to your PC, per second. A 500Hz polling rate, for example, would report 500 times each second. Gaming mice generally target the 500-1000Mhz range, and there&rsquo;s no real benefit to going higher than this, though cursor movements might not feel as smooth if you manually lower the polling rate below 400MHz or so. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Getting the right weight for your <strong>mouse</strong> will largely come down to the kinds of games you play. Lighter, more agile, mice are required for tournament level FPS play, but should also be considered for everyday action style titles as well. A heavier <strong>mouse</strong> is more likely to offer more configurable buttons, however, which means MOBA and MMO players may choose to forego that sub-100g profile for easy access to all their gear in-game. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you walk into an electronics store and make a beeline for the laptop mice, the Logitech M325 is probably the first thing you&rsquo;ll see. This <strong>mouse</strong> is inexpensive and ubiquitous, but it came by its popularity fairly. This small gadget is optimized for laptops, making it ideal for frequent travelers, or workers with limited desk space at home. It&rsquo;s also extremely comfortable, according to user reviews, and provides a DPI just high enough to comfortably <strong>scroll</strong> across a screen without overshooting your target. It&rsquo;s arguably the best wireless <strong>mouse</strong> for the price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>mouse</strong> has SteelSeries’ TrueMove Core optical sensor. While it’s limited to just 8,000 DPI, we were really impressed by its performance. The polling rate is good at 1000 Hz, and the overall tracking is also surprisingly decent at 400 IPS. While the 8,000 DPI is less than half of something like Logitech G Pro or Razer Basilisk V3, it’s still more than plenty for casual gamers. Overall, this is a great <strong>mouse</strong> for gaming, despite the specs sheet suggesting otherwise. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If friends and family are sick of your late-night clicking, Logitech’s M330 could be the <strong>mouse</strong> for you. Its buttons are designed to be near-silent, with a claimed 90% reduction in click noise over similar Logitech mice. It’s a simple two-button optical device with a <strong>scroll</strong> wheel. However, with a similar ergonomic profile to some of Logitech’s more expensive mice and a combination of hard plastic and soft rubber grips, it feels surprisingly good in the hand. The compact size and weight are ideal for on the move use but it&rsquo;s ideal for use when you&rsquo;re working from home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For example, a user with a hand width of 4″ (101mm) should look for a <strong>mouse</strong> with a width of around 2.66 inches (67mm) or more. In this case, the Logitech G502 with a width of 75mm (including the protruding thumb rest) should fit perfectly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As satisfying as it is to click into shape, the hollow area under the arc does mean that your thumb and little finger don’t have anywhere to naturally rest. I also found the curve of the arc led me more into a claw position over my usual palm, which might be okay for you but gave me pause about using this for longer periods. As a purely mobile <strong>mouse</strong>, though, it’s one of the more pleasing, especially if you like its semi-trackpad nature. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We&rsquo;ve tested a lot of mice, putting them through their paces so we can make the right recommendations, whether it&rsquo;s the best gaming <strong>mouse</strong> you need or one for productivity. It isn&rsquo;t the cushiest part of the job, as some mice are unbalanced or heavy or do not glide effortlessly, even when paired with the best <strong>mouse</strong> pads. But, we suffer through the annoying arm and shoulder pain to ensure that you don&rsquo;t. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you can’t stand having cords connected to your computer, you may want to consider a wireless, Bluetooth <strong>mouse</strong>. However, there are also few things more annoying than a <strong>mouse</strong> that won’t connect, so you need to choose something that has a strong signal and minimal connectivity issues. Long battery life is also essential. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=3><li>Razer DeathAdder V2 The best mid-range gaming <strong>mouse</strong> Specifications Connection: Wired Shape: Right-handed Buttons: 8 DPI: 20,000 IPS: Up to 650 Switches: Optical Weight: 2.9oz (82g) Today&rsquo;s Best Deals View at Box.co.uk (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Studio (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Accurate, reliable sensor + Perfectly shaped for various grips + Comfortable Reasons to avoid - Build materials could be more luxurious - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Who was betting on Microsoft having the most stylish <strong>mouse</strong> on this list?

This <strong>mouse</strong> is essentially what would happen if you squished a productivity <strong>mouse</strong>, then made it stand upright. It&rsquo;s a little hard to describe, but once you see the MX Vertical in action, you&rsquo;ll know right away whether it&rsquo;s for you. If regular mice strain your wrists through small, repetitive motions, the MX Vertical might offer some relief.

It’s meant as a replacement for the Viper Ultimate wireless <strong>mouse</strong>, but despite a higher price it ditches that <strong>mouse</strong>&rsquo;s ambidextrous design - losing a pair of side buttons in the progress – as well as the included-as-standard charging dock. Why pay more for fewer features? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Cherry MW8 Advanced is a joy to use if you’re a fan of compact mice and sleek design. We found it comfortable to use throughout the day and flexible, too. You can connect the MW8 Advanced via Bluetooth or over 2.4GHz RF using the provided USB receiver that’s magnetically stowed on the underside of the <strong>mouse</strong>. It’s also possible to connect via USB while charging the internal lithium-ion battery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you buy a new PC, it’s easy to focus on the big three: Processor, graphics and RAM (sorry storage fans, that’s a close fourth). It’s the little things that are simple to overlook. I say that with the confidence of someone that just migrated over from a decade-old iMac to a part-picked PC. The rig I ended up with is solid, I had a nice keyboard already, but oh boy do I really need a new <strong>mouse</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol><li>Logitech MX Master 3S The best <strong>mouse</strong> overall Specifications DPI: 8,000 Interface: Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless Buttons: 7 Ergonomic: Right-handed Features: up to 70 days battery life, USB-C charging, Logitech Flow-enabled, app-specific customizations specifications Colour Black, Grey, White Condition New Today&rsquo;s Best Deals View at Dell (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Walmart (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Quiet tactile clicking + Long-lasting battery life + Customizable seven-button inputs Reasons to avoid - May be uncomfortable for smaller hand - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Arguably, you need a more sensitive <strong>mouse</strong> if you have a higher-resolution screen, but even here 1,000dpi will be enough for most users and 1,600dpi high enough even for graphics professionals. It’s only in the field of professional gaming, where that extra sensitivity could make the difference between victory and defeat, that going above 2,000dpi makes a whole heap of difference. It’s a nice-to-have, but not essential. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The M330 connects via a 2.4GHz wireless transceiver, which stows away in the battery compartment for travel. Other useful features include automatic power-off, which helps the <strong>mouse</strong> deliver up to two years of battery life. All in all, you’re looking at a great budget <strong>mouse</strong> that feels much nicer than the price suggests – there&rsquo;s even a choice of colours. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With six buttons, it’s pretty configurable for something so small and at 99g it won’t overstay its welcome under your palm. Though for the life of me I cannot understand why there is no option to stow the USB dongle inside the <strong>mouse</strong> somewhere. Given its mobile nature this seems like a no-brainer. You can, of course, just use Bluetooth if, like me, USB dongles seem to vanish into thin air unless they have a home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Zowie has been around for a while, and ever since their mice first hit the scene they&rsquo;ve been a hit with gamers who specialize in shooters. The brand quite notably has been dominating the CS:GO pro scene for years now, but their products also see a lot of use in different pro scenes. Still, the EC has been the de facto &lsquo;standard issue CS:GO <strong>mouse</strong>&rsquo; basically since it released, and the fact that it still holds that position today is a testament to its quality as a tactical shooter <strong>mouse</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To choose the best gaming <strong>mouse</strong>, you first have to determine the width of your palm. For reference, the width of an average male hand is 3.5 inches, measured from the widest area of one end of the palm to the other. In order to avoid fatigue and maximize comfort, try to pick a <strong>mouse</strong> that’s around 2/3rd the overall width of your palm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>That’s kinda it. It’s not a big ask but I soon learned there was always some mental bargaining going on trying to find the best balance. I also wanted to see what a modern <strong>mouse</strong> can offer beyond those requirements as, who knows, maybe there’s something I never knew I wanted or I have the sudden urge to get into Dota 2. Enter, the story I thought I’d never write: An 11-way PC <strong>mouse</strong> shoot out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Razer Viper Mini is one of the best gaming mice for big hands. However, we wouldn’t recommend the Razer Viper Mini to people who use the palm grip style, as the <strong>mouse</strong>’s length is just too short. Lastly, the <strong>mouse</strong> has an ambidextrous design, but unfortunately, the side buttons are only located on the left, making it unsuitable for left-hand users. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As you may have noticed by now, most mice in our test tip the scale at well over 80 grams, some going well beyond 100g. But the thing is, not everyone prefers a heavyweight <strong>mouse</strong>. Hence, we had to include a lightweight <strong>mouse</strong> in our test. And after consideration and testing, we chose Razer Viper Mini to be the best lightweight gaming <strong>mouse</strong> currently available in the market. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Logitech G Pro Wireless is hands down the best wireless gaming <strong>mouse</strong> we&rsquo;ve tested. It&rsquo;s not cheap, but wireless mice rarely are, and this is the absolute cream of the crop. It&rsquo;s wonderfully agile and super comfy to use, and at 80g it&rsquo;s lighter than a lot of its rivals (just not preposterously light, like the Razer Viper V2 Pro below). When you combine that featherlight nothingness with Logitech&rsquo;s practically lag-free Lightspeed wireless tech and its brilliant Hero 16K sensor, the Pro Wireless definitely justifies its high price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I&rsquo;ve always maintained that a good gaming <strong>mouse</strong> is also a good computer <strong>mouse</strong> in general, and that&rsquo;s definitely the case with the SteelSeries Rival 3. This sleek, medium-sized peripheral features a no-nonsense, semi-ambidextrous design with two programmable thumb buttons and a pretty LED strip on the bottom. The Rival 3 is the only <strong>mouse</strong> on this list with programmable RGB lighting, and while that won&rsquo;t make you any more productive, it will make your desk look a whole lot prettier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In terms of gaming, the <strong>mouse</strong>’s 8,500 DPI gaming sensor doesn’t disappoint. In CS: GO, for example, our Viper Mini totting testers had no trouble keeping up with their rivals equipped with Logitech G Pro and G502. It’s surprisingly decent for an unnamed sensor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The G502 Lightspeed <strong>mouse</strong> should easily serve you for 5 years or more. Despite the fact that it’s lower weight compared to G502 Hero, the overall build quality is not affected thanks to the thin-wall endoskeleton design. All the premium features of the G502 Hero, such as rubber grips and comfortable <strong>mouse</strong> rest, are also here. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For one, its build quality feels far superior. It also looks more stylish (if that matters). More importantly, it has a more neutral position that feels really comfortable for a smaller <strong>mouse</strong> and doesn’t feel like it’s craning my hand forward. Throw in the fact that you can still assign app-specific controls via Microsoft’s Mouse and Keyboard center and you end up with something that’s smarter than it first seems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Want to avoid breaking the bank? We&rsquo;d recommend the Logitech G203 Lightsync. As well as being aggressively affordable, it&rsquo;s the best gaming <strong>mouse</strong> for those on a budget - balancing a decent feature-set with that low cost. In fact, its competition generally only comes from the Razer Viper Mini and the Razer DeathAdder V2 Mini. The Logitech G203 Lightsync, however, is cheaper than the DeathAdder V2 Mini and offers a larger body than the Viper Mini, which will satisfy a wider range of grip types. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Unfortunately, the G502 is also one of the heaviest mice we tested, weighing in at 121g, bone stock. Oddly enough, the <strong>mouse</strong> has customizable weights, and you can bring that heft up to 140g. Some of our testers preferred the heavyweight nature of the G502, while others complained about it. Overall, we believe it would’ve been better if the <strong>mouse</strong> had a lower overall “dry weight”. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The born-again legend: Microsoft Pro IntelliMouse (£60) As familiar as a floppy disk, Microsoft’s trusty clicker is back (again) and better than ever. Inspired by the iconic IntelliMouse, don’t let the Pro’s understated packaging fool you: a braided cable, remappable buttons and seriously precise sensor – adjustable up to 16,000 DPI – make the throwback <strong>scroll</strong>er a boon for gamers and graphic designers alike. Where to buy Buy the Pro IntelliMouse here from Microsoft - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Logitech MX Master 3 is the best <strong>mouse</strong>, at least on the productivity front, as well as the best wireless <strong>mouse</strong>. It&rsquo;s comfortable, feature-rich and lasts an amazingly long time on a single charge. This sleek gray peripheral is the latest iteration of Logitech&rsquo;s MX Master series, and everything the company has learned from the previous iterations is on full display. The buttons give satisfying clicks, the grip is pleasant to hold and the horizontal thumb wheel makes <strong>scroll</strong>ing through documents a breeze. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Obviously, there&rsquo;s a lot to consider when buying a gaming <strong>mouse</strong>. Trying to find the right one for you can be tricky as there are all sorts of mice in all manner of shapes and sizes with different specs and features on offer. It can be hard to know what matters or what you&rsquo;ll like. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Naga Pro features three unique, detachable panels, which allow you to up the ante in everything from battle royales to MOBAs. They&rsquo;re a revelation - each panel includes a different button setup, so you can use your gaming <strong>mouse</strong> across a wide range of genres and experience the benefits of a tailor-made pointer for each one. Not only that, but you&rsquo;re getting all this power with the reliability of a Razer HyperSpeed wireless connection to boot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fingertip grip: Another type of <strong>mouse</strong> grip. This involves using a similar pose to the claw grip, only here your palm sits on your <strong>mouse</strong> mat, not the back of the <strong>mouse</strong>. It supposedly makes for faster <strong>mouse</strong> movements, as you&rsquo;re only moving it with your fingers rather than your whole hand or arm. If you favour this grip, you&rsquo;ll probably want a <strong>mouse</strong> with extra grippy sides. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You should be most concerned by the overall shape and weight of the <strong>mouse</strong>. Then, in order of relevance, comes the buttons, the DPI, the sensor and everything else. We&rsquo;ll explain ourselves below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;re working from home, we recommend looking for a wireless <strong>mouse</strong>, and the best wireless <strong>mouse</strong> options come with sensors that work on almost all surfaces, like the Logitech MX. These let you connect to up to three devices by Bluetooth or through their included USB dongle, so you can quickly switch control between computers. However, they can be expensive and if you don&rsquo;t need to work on a glass table, most newer mice will work on anything other than glass or reflective surfaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While it&rsquo;s an older device, the Logitech G Pro Wireless still impresses thanks to its impressive tracking and comfortable ambidextrous shape. You&rsquo;ll find removable buttons on both sides of the pointer here, but the best part is you can also run the G Pro Wireless with a full suite. That means plenty of space for macro customization. Not only that, but we found using the <strong>mouse</strong> with two buttons on either side to still be comfortable and precise - never once accidentally clicking. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>ECx-C: This is the latest iteration of the EC series. It comes with a series of notable improvements such as a shoelace-like cable, reduced weight, and a 24-step <strong>scroll</strong> wheel. These mice feature modern improvements without losing sight of what makes Zowie mice so popular (reliability, plug and play, &mldr;) so if you&rsquo;re asking us they&rsquo;re the definitive version to get right now if you&rsquo;re looking for a Zowie <strong>mouse</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wireless mice divide into two broad camps. On the one hand, you have those that work with a wireless transceiver that plugs into a USB port on your PC or laptop. This means you don’t need Bluetooth – which many desktop PCs don’t support – and you’re pretty much guaranteed a trouble-free connection. The downside is that the transceiver takes up a USB port, which can be in short supply on some laptops, while the <strong>mouse</strong> becomes useless if you lose it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=7><li>Corsair Ironclaw RGB The best gaming <strong>mouse</strong> for larger hands Specifications Connection: Wired Shape: Right-handed Buttons: 7 DPI: 18,000 IPS: Up to 400 Switches: Omron Weight: 3.7oz (105g) Today&rsquo;s Best Deals View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at Amazon (opens in new tab) View at very.co.uk (opens in new tab) Reasons to buy + Comfortable, wider <strong>mouse</strong> + High-performance sensor + Thoughtful software features Reasons to avoid - Heavy for a wired <strong>mouse</strong> - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Which gaming <strong>mouse</strong> brand is the best? It&rsquo;s difficult to lock down the best gaming <strong>mouse</strong> brand, largely because each brand offers a wide range of budget, mid-range, and premium options. There are, however, a few contenders for the prize; Razer, Corsair, Logitech, SteelSeries and Roccat. These brands are all responsible for some of the best gaming mice on the market right now, and each offers a slightly different experience based on what you need from your pointer. If we were to be locked down for a top spot, though, our top picks for the best gaming <strong>mouse</strong> suggest that Razer is leading the competition right now. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Moreover, the G502 has a button to switch between smooth and ratchet <strong>scroll</strong> (fast, free gliding versus clicky slow, basically). The MX Master 3S offers both types of <strong>scroll</strong>ing but with a setting where ratchet mode will seamlessly become smooth mode which is much more apt for browsing and navigating lists. I found <strong>scroll</strong>ing on the G502 a bit annoying. Much bigger “clicks” and finding the button to switch to smooth seemed to kill my flow. I am guessing it’s better for gamers though. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Razer’s Synapse also offers app-specific controls alongside a wealth of predefined media and OS shortcuts, but perhaps less comprehensive than those found in Options. That said, you do also have full macro support: Simply hit record and whatever you do next can be converted into a single click of the <strong>mouse</strong>. There’s even “HyperShift” which means you can add a second layer of commands while holding down an allocated button. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Cupertino clicker: Apple Magic Mouse 2 (£66) Longing to augment your iPad’s lovely touchscreen with the tactile certainty of a cold, hard click? Good news: iPadOS 13 brings a bit of <strong>mouse</strong> support to your Apple tablet. And what better peripheral to pair with your ‘Pad than Cupertino’s own Magic Mouse 2, complete with slender shell, rechargeable cell and a multi-touch surface that works a bit like, you know, a touchscreen. Where to buy Buy the Apple Magic Mouse 2 here from Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It&rsquo;s not without its quirks though. Zowie specifically designs their mice for competitive (FPS) gaming, and so the <strong>scroll</strong> wheel has very few steps when compared to most other mice, which can make it a bit strange to use for browsing. Zowie also uses Huano switches for their buttons instead of the more ubiquitous Omron switches. Huanos are known to be a bit heavier than Omrons, which is done to prevent accidental clicking, but that&rsquo;s not to say that Huanos are worse than Omrons. They&rsquo;re simply different, and what you prefer comes down to personal preference. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The latest releases keeps the same form factor as the original Razer DeathAdder, but brings that design into the modern age with a few crucial tweaks. We particularly enjoyed the design change in the textured grips. While the original model offers a larger hexagonal set set of ridges, the smaller bumps and tighter feel of the new grip is far more satisfying and tactile. There&rsquo;s also additional programmable buttons on here, with two new DPI shifters located underneath the <strong>scroll</strong> wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best <strong>mouse</strong> for you will depend on what games you play and what shape feels the most comfortable for you. Having a good <strong>mouse</strong> that is catered to your game can allow you to really have the best competitive edge over your opponents. We have compiled this list after testing out each <strong>mouse</strong> thoroughly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Beyond two clickers and a <strong>scroll</strong> wheel, the best <strong>mouse</strong> might have additional buttons that you can program to suit your computer needs. If you’re left-handed, you’ll want to invest in a <strong>mouse</strong> that’s ambidextrous or specifically designed with ergonomics for the left hand. If you’re a laptop user who travels frequently, you’ll want a <strong>mouse</strong> that is lightweight and travels easily. Above all, you’ll want to pick a <strong>mouse</strong> that fits in your price range and gets the job done without being overly expensive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Ironclaw RGB also offers more functionality than the mildly equally unassuming Steelseries Rival 310. The Rival 310 is still a great choice for those looking to keep costs down (as is the identical Sensei 310 if you&rsquo;re looking for a cheap ambidextrous <strong>mouse</strong>), but the Ironclaw does a lot more for the money, such as giving you an extra DPI or sensitivity profile to play with, a braided USB cable, seven programmable buttons instead of six, and the ability to turn one of those buttons into a &lsquo;sniper&rsquo; button for on-the-fly DPI adjustments to give you better control when lining up shots in FPS games. All in all, it&rsquo;s a great value <strong>mouse</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The luxury puck: Azio Retro Classic Mouse ($100) This classy clicker might channel vintage vibes, but it’s no old-school <strong>scroll</strong>er.

The AGM700 packs an awful lot of <strong>mouse</strong> into a low price tag, with eight mappable buttons, a dedicated sniper button for instantly reducing the DPI and even a compartment on the bottom of the <strong>mouse</strong> that holds additional weights. These weights increase the overall weight from 90g to 115g; although neither of these are particularly light for a <strong>mouse</strong> with FPS aspirations, gamers who don’t much care for ultra-light gaming mice will appreciate the heft. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Roccat Burst Pro Air goes for a far less garish coat of RGB than the Kone XP, lighting up both the top and bottom of the shell and nicely highlighting the reinforcing honeycomb pattern within. The exact colours and patterns can be tailored through Roccat’s Swarm software, though RGB effects aren’t really the big reason to buy this <strong>mouse</strong>. That would be simply how nice it feels, even without a thumb rest or even any notably premium materials. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Modern Mobile <strong>mouse</strong> is Microsoft’s answer to the Pebble. Streamlined, lightweight and with a focus on the basics. There’s no 2.4GHz option here though; it’s Bluetooth only. At $35, compared to the Pebble’s $25 it might seem a foregone conclusion but there’s a lot to like about Microsoft’s take on a portable <strong>mouse</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, finding the right <strong>mouse</strong> for you can be tricky. People hold them in different ways, and have different sized hands that make purchasing a tricky business. A wide <strong>mouse</strong> with thumb rests and grips might be perfect for someone with large hands, but others might find a small and sleek <strong>mouse</strong> preferable, both in terms of fit and agility. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Claw grip: A type of <strong>mouse</strong> grip that involves resting your palm on the back of the <strong>mouse</strong> and bending your index and middle fingers into a claw-like shape so the tips of them rest on the main right and left buttons. Professional players often say this allows for quicker, more precise <strong>mouse</strong> movements, and some mice will be designed with this grip in mind. In everyday use, though, it&rsquo;s very uncomfortable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The controls are fairly minimal, with just two side-mounted buttons accompanying the left and right buttons and <strong>scroll</strong> wheel, but the chunky, tyre-tread wheel works brilliantly, and with an adjustable 7,200dpi resolution it’s as good for Photoshop as Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 or League of Legends. A choice of Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connections makes it even more versatile. This little mobile <strong>mouse</strong> can do it all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For all the jargon involved in buying a gaming <strong>mouse</strong>, it&rsquo;s easy to forget the biggest factor of all - comfort. You will naturally hold your <strong>mouse</strong> in a certain grip, usually either a palm, claw, or tip grip. The size and shape of your <strong>mouse</strong> will determine whether it is comfortable to hold in this way, so it&rsquo;s worth noting how you naturally place your hand on the pointer and double checking your chosen <strong>mouse</strong> will fit you. Palm: you hold the <strong>mouse</strong> with most of your hand and fingers resting on the <strong>mouse</strong> itself - aim for a wider <strong>mouse</strong> with a taller back arch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One downside though is the lighter mice often feel cheap, sound hollow and aren&rsquo;t as feature-rich. If you prefer your <strong>mouse</strong> to have a bit of heft and a premium solid build quality then there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. Some of the heavier mice also have a lot more to offer, not just RGB but more buttons, wireless connectivity and more. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: while people obsess about the performance of their desktop PC or the resolution of the screen on their laptop, too many ignore the two factors that will have the greatest impact on their everyday use: the keyboard and <strong>mouse</strong>. Despite all the excitement around styluses and touchscreens, computer mice haven’t got any less important. Most of us are faster and more accurate when using a <strong>mouse</strong> to click on icons, buttons or links, or to make selections, and the combination of keyboard shortcuts and <strong>mouse</strong> navigation is pretty hard to beat when it comes to getting stuff done. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>HyperX’s attempt at a honeycomb gaming <strong>mouse</strong> is a good one. The Pulsefire Haste weighs just 59g, making it easily the lightest <strong>mouse</strong> we’ve ever tested. This ridiculous weight is supposed to help where rapid <strong>mouse</strong> movements are required and for our part, it doesn’t disappoint. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although we haven&rsquo;t finished our review of the Magic Mouse – long overdue, we know – we&rsquo;ve been using ours for months now, and it&rsquo;s still the best <strong>mouse</strong> for productivity and creative workloads we&rsquo;ve ever used. If you find yourself doing a double take when looking at the specs, as there are no buttons on the Magic Mouse. This <strong>mouse</strong> is completely controlled by gestures, giving it all the benefits of a trackpad, as well as a <strong>mouse</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Just because a <strong>mouse</strong> has a gaming focus, it doesn’t mean it’s no good for productivity. That was my reasoning when I looked at things like the Logitech G502 Lightspeed and the G Pro X Superlight. From Razer, the Viper Ultimate looked like another strong option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Your <strong>mouse</strong> should function as an extension of your hand and arm, not a separate entity. You’ll want a <strong>mouse</strong> that can move and click as fast as you, without any lag time or lack of response. If you spend a lot of time at your computer, you might want to get an ergonomically designed <strong>mouse</strong> to alleviate and prevent pain in your hand, wrist, or shoulder. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Suffice to say, playing with a well-fitting gaming <strong>mouse</strong> does make a huge difference gameplay-wise, especially in competitive esports titles. It’s unfortunate, then, that many gamers often ignore the weight and dimensions of the <strong>mouse</strong> in favor of overall specs and features. However, you don’t have to compromise on comfort to have a great gaming <strong>mouse</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With a total of six programmable buttons, the Pulsefire Haste isn’t overladen with features, but this sort of feels like the point. Even the RGB lighting is limited to just a small strip that outlines the <strong>scroll</strong> wheel. The Pulsefire Haste can however be customised to your heart’s content (as much as this minimalist <strong>mouse</strong> can be) using HyperX’s Ngenuity software, so in this respect the essentials are covered and covered well. It even comes with grip tape to prevent accidental slippage, and the cable is braided, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But, that’s not all. It also features Microsoft’s BlueTrack technology so you can skip those pesky <strong>mouse</strong> pads, as well as Bluetooth connectivity with up to 33 feet in range. Although we haven&rsquo;t fully tested this <strong>mouse</strong>, verified users have praised it for boasting effortless glide as well as an accurate, responsive performance. It has nice, clicky buttons that might be a little too loud for some, but those buttons are also extremely satisfying to press. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Razer’s Viper Ultimate, literally on the other hand, is a surprisingly competent all-purpose <strong>mouse</strong>. For one, as alluded to, it’s truly ambidextrous. At 74g it glides across the desk making it a pleasure to use for extended periods. With a 70 hour battery life it was joint first with the G Pro X for longevity in this category (the G502 offers around 50 hours). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Absolutely. The two biggest gaming mice in the market—namely the G502 Hero and Lightspeed—are made by Logitech. And yes, they’re indeed very good, thanks to the best-in-class Hero 25K optical gaming sensor and fantastic infinite <strong>scroll</strong> wheels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To compete with the very best gamers out there, you&rsquo;ll need to equip yourself with the best gaming <strong>mouse</strong> you can afford. That&rsquo;s where we come in: we&rsquo;ve spent hundreds of hours playing games and running tests to sort the winners from the wannabes. Read on and we&rsquo;ll help you pick the best <strong>mouse</strong> for your games and playing style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The newest iteration of the G502 comes with the Hero 25K gaming sensor—the same as Logitech G Pro—which is good for up to 25,600 DPI. Other features include 11 programmable buttons, a <strong>scroll</strong> wheel with support for infinite <strong>scroll</strong>, RGB lights (LightSync compatible), 400 IPS tracking speed, and a 1000Hz polling rate. Lastly, the <strong>mouse</strong> has adjustable weights. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Surface Precision uses one of Microsoft’s Bluetrack optical sensors, swapping the usual red LED for (you guessed it) a blue one. The technology works extremely well across a wide range of surfaces. And while you don’t get as many buttons as there are on the Logitech 2S, you do get a silky <strong>scroll</strong> wheel with switchable smooth and clicky modes. The battery is charged via a micro-USB cable, which also allows you to use it as a normal wired <strong>mouse</strong>, although with the battery lasting up to three months on a single charge you shouldn’t have to plug it in too often. This is a pricey <strong>mouse</strong> and not particularly good value, but once you’ve used it it’s hard to pick up another rodent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>SteelSeries’ cheapest gaming <strong>mouse</strong> is a minimalistic affair. At just 22mm high, and weighing only 77g, this is a low profile pointer best suited to the tip or claw grippers out there. In testing, however, this palm gripper soon adjusted to the low weight and slim frame and wielded the Rival 3 with more accuracy than any other <strong>mouse</strong> on test. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are three main grip types - palm grip, claw grip and fingertip grip. Some mice are designed to cater to all types while others are only suitable for one or two. SteelSeries has a nice guide to the different grip types and that&rsquo;s worth reading if you don&rsquo;t know how your hold your <strong>mouse</strong> already. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I did wonder, while hammering together that G502 X review, if I was just being an Olympic gold medallist nitpicker. But no – considering how much time you spend touching it, having a <strong>mouse</strong> that feels comfortable is just as important as having one that’s fast and responsive in games. Just like the best gaming keyboards and the best gaming headsets, the finest mice should be a pleasure to use in themselves, and that’s true of all the models this list – whether they’re dirt-cheap bargains or luxury gaming mice dripping with added buttons and RGB. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Razer Basilisk V3 is the perfect choice for the RGB enthusiasts among us. At the heart of the <strong>mouse</strong> is the iconic and improved Razer Focus+ 26K sensor with a 26,000 DPI. There are up to 11 programmable buttons, a great <strong>scroll</strong>-wheel with ‘hyper<strong>scroll</strong>’ (same as Logitech’s “Infinite Scroll”), eleven individual RGB zones offering support for Razer Chroma RGB, and the ultra-lightweight SpeedFlex braided cable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>MX Master 3S comes equipped with Darkfield 8000 laser sensor, good for up to 8,000 DPI. There are 7 programmable buttons in total, and the <strong>scroll</strong> wheel has a Smart Shift feature which uses an electromagnetic mechanism for infinite <strong>scroll</strong>ing. Other features include a unique gesture button on the thumb rest, which can be used to assign different macros. And lastly, there’s a USB-C charging port at the front of the <strong>mouse</strong> that supports fast charging. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We tested the performance and comfort of the mice in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive—colloquially known as CS: GO and Fortnite. Being fast-paced esport titles, both games require lots of wrist flicking and rapid flexing of thumb and fingers. Next, we ran the mice through a series of mini-tests to evaluate their technical performance. We tested the sensitivity of their optical sensors, wireless connectivity (where applicable), DPI levels, tracking speed, input latency, polling rate, angle snapping, macros, and the overall customizability of the hardware, Finally, we evaluated each <strong>mouse</strong>’s physical and visual aspects, such as RGB lighting effects, thumb rests, side grips, <strong>scroll</strong> wheel, build quality, adjustable weights, the number of auxiliary buttons, and their overall ‘click’ feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The latter two sound similar to the two <strong>scroll</strong> wheel feels offered in the Logitech MX Master 3S and 3, which is the most premium-feeling <strong>scroll</strong> wheel I&rsquo;ve used. I&rsquo;ve seen this Logitech MagSpeed wheel imitated but never executed as successfully. The Razer Pro Click Mini, for example, also lets you <strong>scroll</strong> smoothly or notch by notch, but it feels rattly and is loud. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Take a look at our picks of the best mice for different users with different needs and budget. Some of them are incredibly affordable while others are a little more on the pricey end. Luckily, early Black Friday deals are live now, and a lot of these are already getting discounts so you can save money. For your convenience, we&rsquo;re keeping track of those deals and making them available here. All you need to do is choose the right <strong>mouse</strong> for you, select the best price available, and hit buy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Choosing the right award for the Razer Viper Ultimate was tough. For one thing, it’s one of the lightest, thinnest mice we’ve tested; but it’s also ambidextrous, and it boasts the best battery life of any wireless <strong>mouse</strong> I’ve tested. However, that ridiculous 74g weight paired with a slight build and some rather unique specifications mean that the Viper Ultimate stands out as a <strong>mouse</strong> for anyone looking to capitalise on their lightning-fast reflexes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The buttons have a very nice, tactile feel to them; however, they aren’t nearly as loud as we would’ve liked. However, the company claims that each button is good for up to 60M clicks—about 10-20M more than most mice in our test—which is a good tradeoff. The buttons are also programmable via the SteelSeries Engine utility. The same goes for the RGB logo, as well as the light strip at the bottom. Overall, this is a feature-rich <strong>mouse</strong>, despite its budget-oriented price tag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Basilisk V3 Pro is a lot pricier than its wired counterpart, not to mention heavier, and if you want its wireless charger – the Razer Mouse Dock Pro – then that’s another big expense. Frankly, it’s a nice but unnecessary luxury, and at least with boring old cabled charging, you can keep using the <strong>mouse</strong> at the same time. And what a <strong>mouse</strong> this is: keenly sculpted to fit both palm and fingertip grips, with slip-proof textured rubber sections, tonnes of customisable buttons, solid-feeling optical switches, and a precise <strong>scroll</strong> wheel. This wheel also has a free-spinning mode, one of the Basilisk’s many similarities with the Logitech G502 series. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In everyday play, some tend to place too much emphasis on the CPI / DPI of the best gaming mice on the market. CPI (or sometimes referred to as DPI) tracks how often the <strong>mouse</strong>&rsquo;s sensor tracks the surface it&rsquo;s on. The higher this rate, the less you&rsquo;ll need to move your <strong>mouse</strong> to register movement on the screen. CPI has been exploding recently, with mice now starting to push past the 20K sensors that were so impressive just last year. It&rsquo;s worth noting, though, that these incredibly sensitive settings won&rsquo;t be used from day to day, so an 8K or 10K sensor on the right <strong>mouse</strong> can still give you the edge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Palm grip: This style of <strong>mouse</strong> grip involves resting your entire hand on the <strong>mouse</strong>. It&rsquo;s a lot more relaxed than the claw and fingertip grip, and is better for large hand / arm movements. It&rsquo;s probably how you&rsquo;re holding your <strong>mouse</strong> right now. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Predictably, the MX Master 3S does seem to do most of the things I want. BUT, only really thanks to that thumbwheel. It is particularly suited for what I need. That said, I find myself quite taken by the Pro Click, and despite lacking a second <strong>scroll</strong> wheel, it pretty much matches the MX Master 3S in every other manner. It’s also lighter which is a small positive in its favor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;re looking for the best gaming <strong>mouse</strong> then look no further. There are many factors to consider, the ones that take the top spots usually feature adjustable factors and programmable buttons but are still designed with comfort in mind so you can check in for those long sessions. The wide range available now means that prices are lower than ever. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While we’re on the topic of buttons, the new MX Master 3S has almost no click sound at all. It makes almost every other <strong>mouse</strong> seem quite conspicuous by comparison. It also means the click motion feels a little smoother which all adds up to a much nicer experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bluetooth mice have some advantages, particularly if you’re using one with a laptop. First, they work with your computer’s built-in Bluetooth connectivity, so you won’t need to sacrifice a USB port. Second, once you’ve paired a <strong>mouse</strong> with your PC or laptop, it pretty much works as soon as you switch it on. Bluetooth mice used to have issues with performance, connection stability and battery life, but new Bluetooth standards and developments in battery technology have, for the most part, solved these. As an added bonus, some Bluetooth mice have been designed to pair with multiple devices – including PCs, laptops, convertibles and Android tablets – and switch between up to three with the aid of a switch or button. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Microsoft’s pint-sized mobile <strong>mouse</strong> is a budget belter, basic in terms of features but great in terms of build quality and feel. Depending on the colour, £10 to £15 will net you a simple two-button <strong>mouse</strong> with <strong>scroll</strong> wheel, connecting via a USB nano transceiver. On the one hand, its compact size and 90g weight make it a great <strong>mouse</strong> for slinging in a bag and carrying around when you’re using a laptop. On the other, it’s surprisingly comfortable and perfectly responsive in everyday use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>That includes Razer&rsquo;s Pro 30K optical sensor, found in many of Razer&rsquo;s $100-plus mice. It&rsquo;s specced for up to 30,000 counts per inch, 750 inches per second max velocity, and a max acceleration of 70 g. All three of those are among the highest specs you can find in a <strong>mouse</strong> today. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Pro Wireless is also one of the most tasteful gaming mice, design-wise. Its smooth, simple curves are accented by a single zone of RGB lighting over its G logo on the rear of the <strong>mouse</strong>, and that&rsquo;s it. Not jaunty angles, no glossy flourishes; just good old-fashioned design that doesn&rsquo;t make you want to blush with embarrassment every time another human being claps eyes on it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The only real downside here is the datedness of both the <strong>mouse</strong> design and the AOC G-Tools application. The latter is the place to customise your DPI adjuster, map controls to buttons and change the fairly uninspiring LED lighting. It functions perfectly well, but it definitely needs dragging into the current year. The same is true of the <strong>mouse</strong>, which looks several years out of date thanks to the metallic left/right click and mismatched sniper button. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The G Pro has 8 programmable buttons, all with a nice, tactile feel. The <strong>scroll</strong> wheel is equally as good. However, the G Pro lacks its siblings ‘infinity’ <strong>scroll</strong>, namely the G502 and G903. It’s a minor complaint, but there shouldn’t be any at this price point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The main nitpick for me with the Viper is that the two buttons near your ring finger and pinkie take a little getting used to if you palm a <strong>mouse</strong> like I do. I had to train myself to click with the side of my finger rather than the tip. The net result is that I was surprised to find myself gravitating toward the Viper Ultimate most out of this category, despite the G502 being closer to what I had in mind when setting out on this test. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://prod-images-static.radiopaedia.org/images/40525393/b8bb5e97735bea68fe563184ef46fd_gallery.jpeg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Mouse With Good Scroll Wheel - Mouse With Best Scroll Wheel Reddit">
