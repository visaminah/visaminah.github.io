Go group larger pieces together to make an even more bold punch in a room rather than several smaller pieces spread throughout the room. - Source: Internet ‘If you want to create a gallery wall, then I’d always advise laying your frames out on the floor to create the layout. This will allow you to move pieces around until you find the layout that works best for you, and will avoid you creating many holes in the wall. Ultimately, the key is to create a relaxing room, allowing space and room to breathe around artworks and furniture,’ advises Helen Armon-Jones. - Source: Internet One of the easiest ways to fill a large living room wall is with artwork – whether a single piece, a collection or in a gallery wall style. ‘A commanding piece of statement art is ideal for filling a large wall, as it won’t take up valuable floor space. Two to three pieces hung together is also effective,’ advises Cynthia Masters, designer and founder of Panageries (opens in new tab). You can then use the colors and textures in the piece (or pieces) to guide your interior design and color palettes, resulting in a beautifully harmonious space. - Source: Internet A folding screen can act as a statement piece while decorating the blank wall in your living room. A traditional folding screen might sound a bit odd, but it works beautifully as a wall decor without requiring any installation. Simply place it in the corner or line it along an empty wall, and the folding screen will become the main attraction of the room. - Source: Internet Here’s a peek at that Family Room I recently remodeled. I went with 3 large prints when I decorated the large wall over the couch. That extra height made sense on those 9′ high walls. You can see how I painted the built in bookshelves in another post. - Source: Internet The grid gallery wall follows a theme and offers a streamlined and symmetrical artwork display. If you own any favorite art collection or series, the grid-themed style is the best way to decorate the gallery wall.

There are plenty of bookshelf ideas for living rooms meaning you can find the perfect design to suit your space and living room layout. A floor-to-ceiling built-in bookshelf will create a feature wall effect that will add texture and color to your room – we love the geometric blocked look of this design – as well as helping you in organizing a living room. - Source: Internet Moreover, a console table goes well with both modern and traditional styles of interior decoration. So, no matter the style of your living room space, a console table can be perfect for decorating the large empty wall. However, if you don’t have enough space to set up a large console table, you can also go for a set of benches or small stools. - Source: Internet Perhaps pick two or three lamps of larger scale with similar shades and then mix in slimmer less obtrusive metal floor and wall lamps to bring lighting all around the room. Mixing in glass lamps can also prevent lamp overload. You can have an outlet put into the floor near the perimeter of a conversation area for a lamp cord if it isn’t convenient to plug it in the wall. - Source: Internet Consider backlighting your driftwood for extra drama. The gnarled beauty of this piece casts shadows on the walls because of the lights. Gorgeous. - Source: Internet One common option is to do a wall of built-in cabinets or bookcases. However, they are usually the most expensive option. If you are thinking of doing built-in cabinetry, consider if doing so will add value to your home. Or, maybe the subsequent owners might want to rip it all out. - Source: Internet The first board is from my old living room. This is the Donald cabinet before Laurel impulsively (but happily) painted it Cotton Balls. (you can see it painted by clicking on the link) - Source: Internet If your TV is floating in a big, empty space, try to surround it with art, creating a gallery wall. When the TV is off, it’ll blend right in with the frames. This is an especially useful idea if you’re looking to design a living room that doesn’t focus on the TV. - Source: Internet In a small room, you will likely only have room for one conversation area and no additional space for furniture groupings. Large rooms can function as so much more than just a large sitting area, but you might have to get creative with how to best utilize the size or shape of the room you have. Identify several possible functional areas within the room, such as a conversation zone (or two or three!), a media zone, an area for a writing desk, a console or a game table, a dining area or perhaps a reading area. - Source: Internet To that end, I made several boards for sharing some ideas for a big living room wall. At the top and left side, of some of them, you’ll see some boxes. Those represent one foot. Most of these walls are about 18 to 20 feet. If your wall is bigger, you’ll probably need larger furniture, or it’s also okay to have a little breathing space. - Source: Internet Create greater punch by bringing together four chairs and a round ottoman or table rather than just two chairs. Chairs are less visually divisive in a room than a sofa so they can create a pleasing flow and conversation area in large spaces, small rooms or awkward areas with challenging traffic patterns. Anytime you can use several of anything like double footstools, two lamps or sets of chairs, the impact will be greater! - Source: Internet With big, spacious walls come big decorating dreams—and plenty of stress to go around. Should you go vintage or contemporary? Simple or maximalist? The countless possibilities of decorating a wall are equal parts thrilling and paralyzing, so we rounded up a few large wall decor ideas for living rooms to point you in the right direction. Read on to find the perfect idea to bring your space to life. - Source: Internet No matter what size of a room you have, lighting can make a difference in how the room feels. Fortunately with a large room there are often more windows, so during the day lighting isn’t as much of a concern. But shadows and dark corners can make everyone feel uneasy at night. If you have just one center ceiling light, you will likely want to add more light with lamps. A room can look awkward if you have too many lamps, though, so here are a couple of tips for lighting a large room. - Source: Internet Creating a wall of curtains will help you fill up any large and empty space in your living room and amp up the room’s aesthetic appeal. Just make sure that the color of your curtains goes perfectly well with the color of the walls. So, carefully consider the color scheme before choosing the curtains for your new curtain panels. - Source: Internet You could also do different colors and styling. This would be for a slightly smaller wall. I think it’s best if there’s a little breathing room, like 6″-12″, on either side of the piece of furniture. But, if it’s tighter than that, it should be okay. But the moulding of the piece of furniture should not touch the wall. - Source: Internet Also, you can add a sculptural dimension to your otherwise bare living room by installing sconces having unique and interesting shapes. What’s more, wall lighting can help open up space in your living room and brighten it up. A pair of sconces also goes perfectly well with modern and traditional living room styles. - Source: Internet Well, yes, and no.

They’ll add a dramatic visual dimension to the room along with the sleek TV design. So, creating a TV wall can be an excellent way to use the empty space. - Source: Internet Decorating with mirrors is always a good idea – whether you’re looking to fill a wall in a living room, bedroom, bathroom or even kitchen. ‘Living room mirrors are a great way to fill the space on the wall. As well as adding texture and dimension to the room, it can also make a small living room look bigger by reflecting light back into the space,’ says Brittany Farinas, creative director, House of One (opens in new tab). - Source: Internet The reflection of the windows on that cheap plastic film ruined those fun posters. Removing it let the bold colors POP against that light paint color on the wall. You can also see how I used boards (Tip 6) to get those posters level and evenly spaced in this picture. - Source: Internet A huge piece covering the entire wall will command the eye and serve as an impressive focal point. You could also hang multiple paintings side by side or in a grid to add a little variety. While many artists sell complementary pieces that would look great together, you don’t necessarily have to buy a set. You can unify eclectically sourced paintings through their colors, styles, themes, or frames. - Source: Internet Light fixtures are an often-overlooked way to make a statement, so keep an eye out for attention-grabbing sconces, lamps, or overhead fixtures. For a painting or fireplace smack in the middle of the wall without much room on either side, try placing two intricately designed sconces on either side. By framing the feature in this way, you subtly draw attention toward it while filling in the gaps. - Source: Internet If wall hangings and other artworks cannot fill up the entire space in your living room, you can always go for a full-length bookcase installation. A bookcase system with tall bookshelves with a floor-to-ceiling design can be ideal for decorating large walls. You don’t need to worry about installing costly paintings or artwork if you go for this wall decor idea. - Source: Internet In a large space there tends to be more furniture and accessories, which can feel a bit haphazard. One way to tie a large room of furniture together and unify your style is through repetition. Repeating fabric patterns or colors on chairs or throw pillows will help carry your eye around the room and feel visually more pleasing. - Source: Internet Similarly, placing tall plants, like a tall faux fig tree, can act as the statement piece and be the focal point in your living room. It will add a splash of greenery and make the room look fresh and organic. You can turn the entire place around by positioning a tall plant in front of the large, bare wall. It can perfectly complement a modern or traditional living room style. - Source: Internet Here are a few tips to help you find information about Big Wall Décor:\nLook for good places to get information about What To Do With A Blank Wall.

It’s simple, it’s beautiful, and it’s so much more practical than going for large-scale artwork. Simply place it on the floor to brighten up the entire living <strong>room</strong> space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We could also fill a long unbroken <strong>wall</strong> with art. Above is a fabulous example by Maura Endres.

So lets chat about different things you can do to a large <strong>wall</strong> space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you think that a large painting or photo will be too much for the living <strong>room</strong>, you can go for a curated gallery <strong>wall</strong>. It’s one of the most popular ideas of <strong>wall</strong> art decor that go well in any living <strong>room</strong>, small or big. Start collecting eclectic and unique art pieces, including paintings, drawings, or photos, for decorating the huge <strong>wall</strong> in your living <strong>room</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Do you have tall ceilings that makes your <strong>room</strong> feel out of balance? Opt for taller furniture whenever possible. If furniture is all short, your ceilings will feel too tall and your furniture will be dwarfed. Consider a taller bookcase, an armoire, taller backs on chairs and sofas and taller accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another option when considering design ideas for a large living <strong>room</strong> <strong>wall</strong> is an accent <strong>wall</strong>. Wallpaper is back in style, so why not highlight your favorite colors by adding a pop of pattern to one <strong>wall</strong>. Here a geometric pattern in grey and white matches the throw pillows on the sofa. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While contemporary design tends to favor neutrals, <strong>wall</strong> decor is a wonderful avenue for adding visual interest through pops of color. Brightly colored abstract pieces, for example, can liven up an otherwise sterile living <strong>room</strong>. If there is already a little color present in the space, look for artwork that features the same color. This is a great way to make the <strong>room</strong> feel fun, cultured, and cohesive. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I love the Amma cabinet from Scout & Nimble. It’s only 72″ high, so better for a <strong>room</strong> with an eight-foot ceiling. However, this height looks good with a collection of Chinoiserie porcelains. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Large scale metal farm equipment and cast-off vintage items can make incredible <strong>wall</strong> decor.

In this piece, a rustic windmill, cut in half, creates a unique <strong>wall</strong> piece. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wall Hangings: Wall hangings can be tapestries, flags, rugs, or even some kind of fabric installation.

BUT, that chair rail wainscoting along the bottom fills the bottom third of that stretch. That helps just one canvas decorate the large <strong>wall</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Entire Wall Design/Wood panel designs: Having a large <strong>wall</strong> is a great opportunity to use the whole <strong>wall</strong> as decor. You can create so many amazing designs using wood planks or MDF on your large empty <strong>wall</strong>s. There are many geometric designs including board and batten and more. The color pallet can also help to create a gorgeous <strong>wall</strong>. By painting the <strong>wall</strong> a different color you create an accent <strong>wall</strong>, which gives the <strong>room</strong> a more stylized look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Living <strong>room</strong>s often have a lot of square-edged pieces – coffee tables, TV, media consoles, etc. so adding some round baskets to a <strong>wall</strong> breaks things up and adds texture and softness. I love the look of a grouping of different shaped baskets like {this set of 8 <strong>wall</strong> baskets}: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When choosing a piece, be mindful of the space on the <strong>wall</strong> you expect it to fill. If the painting is too big, it may overwhelm the <strong>room</strong> or be hard to situate nicely. Make sure to leave some breathing <strong>room</strong> between the painting and the ceiling and floor. Pieces that are too small, on the other hand, can look awkward. The solution? Buy multiple pieces and arrange them to create a stunning accent <strong>wall</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Fill the large empty space with an oversized piece of artwork like Brooke & Lou’s Field of Flowers (opens in new tab) art or A Morning View (opens in new tab) art. This will draw attention to the artwork and not so much how large the <strong>wall</strong> space is. Complete the look with a console table underneath the artwork with coordinating décor pieces and a table lamp,&rsquo; says Bria Hammel, CEO and Creative Director of Bria Hammel Interiors (opens in new tab). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Mirrors are a gorgeous way to reflect the <strong>room</strong> around you. This decadent, luxurious living <strong>room</strong> in sultry greys, silvers, and black utilizes a large-scale mirror above the mantel as decor. Matching trim on the <strong>wall</strong> repeats the mirror&rsquo;s pattern as a design element. This creates comfort in such a large <strong>room</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Wallpaper generally features flowers, a stripe or a damask style pattern, but there is so much more variety now. A big trend this year is bees, but we’ve also seen papers with flamingos, crystals, glitter and 3D effects, so there is more choice than ever. You can even have your favorite photograph turned into bespoke <strong>wall</strong>paper these days,&rsquo; says Stuart Yates (opens in new tab), award-winning professional decorator. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Store and flaunt your collection of hardcovers and paperbacks with a beautiful bookcase system that can be the focal point of the living <strong>room</strong>.

Also, when it comes to home decor ideas, a bookcase system is ideal both in terms of practicality and style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At first glance, large <strong>wall</strong> decor might seem like a bad idea for a small <strong>wall</strong>, since you don’t want to crowd or overwhelm the <strong>room</strong>. However, the truth is that small pieces can leave a lot of empty <strong>wall</strong> space, making the <strong>room</strong> feel awkward and even smaller than it actually is.

I absolutely love these kinds of gallery <strong>wall</strong>s.An art collection can fill a blank <strong>wall</strong> space with smaller pieces adding interest and design. The good news is that you can change the artwork out as you choose and make it what you want it to be. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While floating bookshelves and hanging bike racks have their place, sometimes you want decor that’s simply, well, decorative. It goes without saying, but photography and paintings are great options for filling up a <strong>wall</strong> and adding a little pizzazz. Art containing subject matter or color palettes that complement those already present—ocean photography for a coastal-style living <strong>room</strong>, black-and-white paintings for a minimalist vibe—elevates the space and ties it all together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;For smaller nooks and spaces, I love compact still-life studies covering anything from fruit to stoneware in subject. Soft, painterly florals and botanicals in colorful frames also work well here as they help to bring color into the <strong>room</strong>.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Color and pattern can be used to break up big expanses of <strong>wall</strong>s in a great <strong>room</strong> or cut the size of a tall <strong>wall</strong> down to a more comfortable height. Add wainscoting with varying shades of neutrals or colors painted above and below the molding. If you have a high ceiling, you may want to try a simple trick to cozy up your <strong>room</strong>. If you paint the ceiling a shade or two or even several shades darker than your <strong>wall</strong>s (or use paneling!), your ceiling won’t seem as tall and your <strong>room</strong> might feel more snug and cozy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you’re entertaining your friends and family, a hanging bar keeps the conversation going because it makes serving drinks to the guests so much easier. Also, you don’t need to worry about wasting any floor space while installing a hanging bar in the living <strong>room</strong>. It works beautifully with an open floor plan and connects your dining <strong>room</strong> and living <strong>room</strong> space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want your living <strong>room</strong> to have a more decadent, sophisticated feel, look for detailed <strong>wall</strong> decor and precious materials. Even if you don’t have the intricate <strong>wall</strong> moldings often present in Parisian-style homes, you can emulate the look by filling your space with classy, vintage-inspired pieces. Antique mirrors and ornately framed art, for example, add an air of old-school luxury. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Whether you lean more boho or traditional, your <strong>wall</strong> decor will impact the <strong>room</strong>’s style in a big way. Light colors, simple designs, and light wood shelves or frames go well with contemporary, mid-century modern, Scandinavian, and rustic-style decor. Darker hues, metal accents, and rough textures like stone, on the other hand, complement modern decor perfectly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While it is easy t start with bare <strong>wall</strong>s, these can often be the most daunting. You literally have a blank canvas, but you also have a blank canvas. See what I did there? Sometimes having nothing is harder. I want to share some inspiring <strong>wall</strong> decor ideas that might help you with that next big project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are so many fascinating stick-on murals available for home interiors. They are easy to apply and easy to change out and can give your <strong>room</strong> a unique character. In this <strong>room</strong>, a large neutral gray and white botanical print perfectly enhances the contemporary design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If artwork isn&rsquo;t for you, you don&rsquo;t have to leave your <strong>wall</strong> blank. You can also fill a large living <strong>room</strong> <strong>wall</strong> by installing bookshelves or paneling to add texture and character. Alternatively, consider being creative with a contrasting colors or paint tricks or by using a bold and busy <strong>wall</strong>paper to make a feature of the <strong>wall</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>That said, there are tons of other ways to create a beautiful, visually engaging space. Hanging tapestries or other woven artwork draws the eye upward, making them excellent choices if you want to dress up an awkwardly empty high spot on the <strong>wall</strong>. As a bonus, textile art introduces a new material into the <strong>room</strong>, adding a layer of interest. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you don’t even know where to start, take a minute and peruse Pinterest. Search large <strong>wall</strong> decor ideas, and just simply scroll for a minute. Pin those images that catch you eye and make you feel a certain way. I often know I have found something I love because of the way it makes me feel. The idea is not to copy the image but to use it as inspiration and as a jumping off point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s best to go for any large art piece that’s vibrant and colorful that can fill large blank <strong>wall</strong>s. Plus, a large-scale art piece will add more visual texture and color to your living <strong>room</strong>, enhancing its aesthetic appeal. You can consider installing an oversized and beautifully framed photograph or painting on the empty <strong>wall</strong> behind your living <strong>room</strong> sofa for the <strong>wall</strong> decor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>However, you don&rsquo;t have to put anything on either side of a large painting at all. &lsquo;Don’t be afraid of negative or empty space on a large <strong>wall</strong>. Hang the right piece or pieces and place your furniture appropriately so that the eye has a place to rest when looking at the <strong>room</strong>,&rsquo; adds Sarah Brannon, designer and founder of Sarah Brannon Interiors (opens in new tab). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As I have shown you with floor plans, you can create a scale elevation drawing of your long <strong>wall</strong> plan. I use quarter-inch graph paper, but I find that 1/2″ scale is easier on the eyes for elevations. In that case, four squares will equal a square foot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fabric <strong>wall</strong> hangings, like rugs and tapestries, also help to add a soft and natural texture to the living <strong>room</strong>. They come with large art prints that help in enhancing the visual appeal of any <strong>room</strong>. Not only that, but these <strong>wall</strong> hangings are more affordable than any large-scale painting, making the <strong>wall</strong> decor much cheaper for your living <strong>room</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gallery Wall: I think gallery <strong>wall</strong>s are one of the most popular ways to fill large blank <strong>wall</strong>s . There are so many different ways to hang your gallery <strong>wall</strong>s and I actually shared a post a couple of years ago with over 4o different layouts. Make sure to check it out here. Here are a couple ideas below of how other people have created their own gallery <strong>wall</strong>s with family photos. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Quilts are another interesting idea for a <strong>wall</strong> feature. This selection of mini-quilts goes up a stairway but could easily be on the <strong>wall</strong> of a large living <strong>room</strong>. If you inherited quilts from a grandparent or love to quilt yourself, this is a great way to display your beautiful pieces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The mood board above is from the paint and palette collection. It’s one of my favorite boards. Plus, this is a reasonably long <strong>wall</strong> in a dining <strong>room</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Driftwood provides gorgeous colors and interesting shapes for a large living <strong>room</strong> <strong>wall</strong>.

Even if you have a small living <strong>room</strong>, the <strong>wall</strong>paper adds a dramatic tone and becomes the focal point of the <strong>room</strong>. As such, you can pick any <strong>wall</strong>paper based on your personal style and preferences. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are lots of living <strong>room</strong> paneling ideas to inspire you. &lsquo;The highlights and shadows created by the panelling will add another level to your feature color creating a very bold statement <strong>wall</strong>.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are wanting to create a gallery <strong>wall</strong>, use templates of your picture frames using wrapping paper and tape them to the <strong>wall</strong> to find the best layout of design. It can help you with the spacing of the picture frames and the balance of them. Plus, it is easier to move the taped on ones than to move ones that are nailed into the <strong>wall</strong>. Less holes! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can also mix in other interesting items while decorating the floating shelves, like placing small indoor plants or your favorite figurines to enhance the visual interest of the <strong>wall</strong> decor. It can be a great way to flaunt your personal preferences while decorating the living <strong>room</strong> <strong>wall</strong>. However, be careful while placing items on the floating shelves because you don’t want them to loom cluttered. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Not only that, but a mirror centerpiece also helps to reflect light across the entire living <strong>room</strong> space and brightens it up. Thus, the space automatically opens up with this <strong>wall</strong> decor idea and looks bigger. Always go for a mirror having a unique and bold shape so that it can stand out and be the central attraction of the <strong>room</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Simplicity is key when it comes to modern design, so stick to sleek, minimal decor to avoid cluttering the space. Floating shelves create extra storage, and you can arrange them in many ways, offering an opportunity for functional decor. Other decorations like metal <strong>wall</strong> art or an oversized clock can fill empty space and add character to your living <strong>room</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When we think of eye-catching living <strong>room</strong>s, the design ideas are endless. Add a comfy sofa for family movie nights, hang chic curtains as the finishing touch (here are some living <strong>room</strong> curtain ideas for your viewing) or choose a statement rug that&rsquo;s colorful, neutral, patterned or textured. Not to mention the beauty that comes with finding the right lighting! Every detail counts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sometimes a painted accent <strong>wall</strong> is more than enough to turn the whole place around. No heavy artwork or <strong>wall</strong> hangings, just some fresh paint, will do the trick of decorating a large living <strong>room</strong> <strong>wall</strong>. But, before you start painting the <strong>wall</strong>, be careful about choosing the right color scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One option that can go a long way is to add applied <strong>wall</strong> moulding. In this example, the chair rail would be better as a solid piece, but you get the idea. Imagine how the art would like more random if the moulding wasn’t there. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Your home isn’t a showplace—it’s a sanctuary. You’re invited to forget about the rules and discover inspired ways to personalize your spaces and express your style with texture, color, and your favorite treasures. Room by <strong>room</strong>, I’ll help you shape a home that is inspired by the people, beauty, and life you love. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What is the best way to decorate a large <strong>wall</strong> in the living <strong>room</strong>? If you&rsquo;re fortunate enough to have a big space, it expands your options of what you can do. However, it might be a daunting prospect. We&rsquo;ve dug around the Internet and come up with some fantastic ideas for showcasing a large living <strong>room</strong> <strong>wall</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>wall</strong> art decor can add a multidimensional visual impact to the living <strong>room</strong> with different art pieces. It’s best to follow an asymmetric pattern while arranging the art pieces on the large empty <strong>wall</strong>s to create an eclectic appeal. Also, you can install artwork of different sizes to maintain a sense of contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can go for murals with natural patterns that add visual textures and dimensions to the <strong>room</strong>. Moreover, the best thing about <strong>wall</strong> murals is that they’re not permanent and very easy to remove. So, you can easily change the <strong>wall</strong> mural if you decide to spruce up the <strong>wall</strong> decor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>On the flip side, however, <strong>wall</strong> decor also offers a chance to add your own spin to a well-loved design style. Minimalist living <strong>room</strong> falling a little flat? Lemon yellow <strong>wall</strong>s will brighten the space and add a little cheer. Likewise, deep black or emerald green <strong>wall</strong>s can add an unexpected moody twist to a usually easy-breezy bohemian design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s easy to get lost in all the complex decorating ideas out there, but you simply can’t go wrong with the basics. With their ability to brighten a <strong>room</strong> and show off a person’s unique tastes, paintings have always been a go-to for sprucing up blank <strong>wall</strong>s. Whether you go landscape or portrait, contemporary or impressionist, a handpicked piece of art is the perfect way to fill your living <strong>room</strong> with character. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Plus, it’s quite easy to maintain the plant <strong>wall</strong> without worrying about water dripping from the built-in planters. You can also add some visual textures to the living <strong>room</strong> by installing the plant <strong>wall</strong> and hanging different indoor plants on this empty <strong>wall</strong>. So, it can be a great way to fill up the empty space in your living <strong>room</strong> and add some lush greenery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Curtain panels go beautifully in living <strong>room</strong>s and bed<strong>room</strong>s for decorating and covering up any large <strong>wall</strong> space. If you have a blank <strong>wall</strong> that’s idly standing in the <strong>room</strong>, give it a new curtain makeover. Add some huge curtain panels using long rods and hang some curtains that go well with the entire interior decor of the <strong>room</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are new to the world of artwork then it can feel like a daunting prospect –especially if you&rsquo;re trying to fill a large living <strong>room</strong> <strong>wall</strong>. As a result, homeowners often try to &lsquo;play it safe&rsquo; by going for smaller pieces. If you have a large expanse of <strong>wall</strong>, this small single frame will quickly become dwarfed and can even end up making the <strong>wall</strong> seem larger than if it was left bare. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Below is the board design in progress. Please note that this is not the <strong>room</strong> layout. But, I do it to get in as many elements as possible. I like to put the furniture in an approximation of perspective. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want a more refined living <strong>room</strong> interior, then one or two large posters may be enough to fill the gaps and to direct focus towards the designs you have selected. Let <strong>wall</strong> art express who you are. Living <strong>room</strong> surfaces offer endless possibilities: assemble your gallery <strong>wall</strong> from floor to ceiling, in a corner, or around a piece of furniture – find inspiration in our Inspiration photos! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We hope these ideas have given you food for thought. Whether you want to buy something off the shelf, or cast about for something uniquely you, decorating a large <strong>wall</strong> is lucky. There are fun options. Decide on the style or vibe you want, then pick the right choice for that, and your budget. But most of all, have fun on the journey. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Separating that large <strong>wall</strong> into blocks divided up the space. And, it even framed in the perfect spot for <strong>wall</strong> art. How great is that cow art?! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hanging a paper mural can be just as mesmerizing and captivating as any <strong>wall</strong>paper. But, what is a <strong>wall</strong> mural? It’s a large <strong>wall</strong> art piece that’s pretty cheap because you don’t have to frame it to hang it on the big <strong>wall</strong> in your living <strong>room</strong>. Also, these <strong>wall</strong> murals are perfect for filling up the large space in any <strong>room</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hanging decor has become a popular way to cover up and decorate a large <strong>wall</strong>, apart from paintings and photographs. Wall hangings include any piece of fabric, such as <strong>wall</strong> tapestries, rugs, or flags. They can be a perfect solution for decorating a huge <strong>wall</strong> that can’t be covered with only paintings or photos. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Oversized Mirror: If you have a small space with a large or taller <strong>wall</strong>, using an oversized mirror is a creative way to make the space look larger while adding style. You can also do a cluster of mirrors in a collection on the <strong>wall</strong>. Both of these options are effective ways of filling a blank space with something that adds gorgeous details. You can often find affordable mirrors at flea markets or at thrift stores. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Art work and accessories in a big <strong>room</strong> should be bigger and bolder. If you have framed prints or photos for your <strong>wall</strong>, go with a larger size than the standard 8 x 10 or 5 x 7 frames. Go group larger pieces together to make an even more bold punch in a <strong>room</strong> rather than several smaller pieces spread throughout the <strong>room</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;If you want to create a gallery <strong>wall</strong>, then I&rsquo;d always advise laying your frames out on the floor to create the layout. This will allow you to move pieces around until you find the layout that works best for you, and will avoid you creating many holes in the <strong>wall</strong>. Ultimately, the key is to create a relaxing <strong>room</strong>, allowing space and <strong>room</strong> to breathe around artworks and furniture,&rsquo; advises Helen Armon-Jones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the easiest ways to fill a large living <strong>room</strong> <strong>wall</strong> is with artwork – whether a single piece, a collection or in a gallery <strong>wall</strong> style. &lsquo;A commanding piece of statement art is ideal for filling a large <strong>wall</strong>, as it won’t take up valuable floor space. Two to three pieces hung together is also effective,&rsquo; advises Cynthia Masters, designer and founder of Panageries (opens in new tab). You can then use the colors and textures in the piece (or pieces) to guide your interior design and color palettes, resulting in a beautifully harmonious space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A folding screen can act as a statement piece while decorating the blank <strong>wall</strong> in your living <strong>room</strong>. A traditional folding screen might sound a bit odd, but it works beautifully as a <strong>wall</strong> decor without requiring any installation. Simply place it in the corner or line it along an empty <strong>wall</strong>, and the folding screen will become the main attraction of the <strong>room</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Here’s a peek at that Family Room I recently remodeled. I went with 3 large prints when I decorated the large <strong>wall</strong> over the couch. That extra height made sense on those 9′ high <strong>wall</strong>s. You can see how I painted the built in bookshelves in another post. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The grid gallery <strong>wall</strong> follows a theme and offers a streamlined and symmetrical artwork display. If you own any favorite art collection or series, the grid-themed style is the best way to decorate the gallery <strong>wall</strong>. Or, you can also arrange some botanical prints for creating a beautiful grid gallery <strong>wall</strong> in your living <strong>room</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you love literature, then a bookshelf is the perfect way to fill a large living <strong>room</strong> <strong>wall</strong>. There are plenty of bookshelf ideas for living <strong>room</strong>s meaning you can find the perfect design to suit your space and living <strong>room</strong> layout. A floor-to-ceiling built-in bookshelf will create a feature <strong>wall</strong> effect that will add texture and color to your <strong>room</strong> – we love the geometric blocked look of this design – as well as helping you in organizing a living <strong>room</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Moreover, a console table goes well with both modern and traditional styles of interior decoration. So, no matter the style of your living <strong>room</strong> space, a console table can be perfect for decorating the large empty <strong>wall</strong>. However, if you don’t have enough space to set up a large console table, you can also go for a set of benches or small stools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Perhaps pick two or three lamps of larger scale with similar shades and then mix in slimmer less obtrusive metal floor and <strong>wall</strong> lamps to bring lighting all around the <strong>room</strong>. Mixing in glass lamps can also prevent lamp overload. You can have an outlet put into the floor near the perimeter of a conversation area for a lamp cord if it isn’t convenient to plug it in the <strong>wall</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Consider backlighting your driftwood for extra drama. The gnarled beauty of this piece casts shadows on the <strong>wall</strong>s because of the lights. Gorgeous. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One common option is to do a <strong>wall</strong> of built-in cabinets or bookcases. However, they are usually the most expensive option. If you are thinking of doing built-in cabinetry, consider if doing so will add value to your home. Or, maybe the subsequent owners might want to rip it all out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The first board is from my old living <strong>room</strong>. This is the Donald cabinet before Laurel impulsively (but happily) painted it Cotton Balls. (you can see it painted by clicking on the link) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your TV is floating in a big, empty space, try to surround it with art, creating a gallery <strong>wall</strong>. When the TV is off, it’ll blend right in with the frames. This is an especially useful idea if you’re looking to design a living <strong>room</strong> that doesn’t focus on the TV. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In a small <strong>room</strong>, you will likely only have <strong>room</strong> for one conversation area and no additional space for furniture groupings. Large <strong>room</strong>s can function as so much more than just a large sitting area, but you might have to get creative with how to best utilize the size or shape of the <strong>room</strong> you have. Identify several possible functional areas within the <strong>room</strong>, such as a conversation zone (or two or three!), a media zone, an area for a writing desk, a console or a game table, a dining area or perhaps a reading area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To that end, I made several boards for sharing some ideas for a big living <strong>room</strong> <strong>wall</strong>. At the top and left side, of some of them, you’ll see some boxes. Those represent one foot. Most of these <strong>wall</strong>s are about 18 to 20 feet. If your <strong>wall</strong> is bigger, you’ll probably need larger furniture, or it’s also okay to have a little breathing space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Create greater punch by bringing together four chairs and a round ottoman or table rather than just two chairs. Chairs are less visually divisive in a <strong>room</strong> than a sofa so they can create a pleasing flow and conversation area in large spaces, small <strong>room</strong>s or awkward areas with challenging traffic patterns. Anytime you can use several of anything like double footstools, two lamps or sets of chairs, the impact will be greater! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With big, spacious <strong>wall</strong>s come big decorating dreams—and plenty of stress to go around. Should you go vintage or contemporary? Simple or maximalist? The countless possibilities of decorating a <strong>wall</strong> are equal parts thrilling and paralyzing, so we rounded up a few large <strong>wall</strong> decor ideas for living <strong>room</strong>s to point you in the right direction. Read on to find the perfect idea to bring your space to life. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>No matter what size of a <strong>room</strong> you have, lighting can make a difference in how the <strong>room</strong> feels. Fortunately with a large <strong>room</strong> there are often more windows, so during the day lighting isn’t as much of a concern. But shadows and dark corners can make everyone feel uneasy at night. If you have just one center ceiling light, you will likely want to add more light with lamps. A <strong>room</strong> can look awkward if you have too many lamps, though, so here are a couple of tips for lighting a large <strong>room</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Creating a <strong>wall</strong> of curtains will help you fill up any large and empty space in your living <strong>room</strong> and amp up the <strong>room</strong>’s aesthetic appeal. Just make sure that the color of your curtains goes perfectly well with the color of the <strong>wall</strong>s. So, carefully consider the color scheme before choosing the curtains for your new curtain panels. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You could also do different colors and styling. This would be for a slightly smaller <strong>wall</strong>. I think it’s best if there’s a little breathing <strong>room</strong>, like 6″-12″, on either side of the piece of furniture. But, if it’s tighter than that, it should be okay. But the moulding of the piece of furniture should not touch the <strong>wall</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Also, you can add a sculptural dimension to your otherwise bare living <strong>room</strong> by installing sconces having unique and interesting shapes. What’s more, <strong>wall</strong> lighting can help open up space in your living <strong>room</strong> and brighten it up. A pair of sconces also goes perfectly well with modern and traditional living <strong>room</strong> styles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Well, yes, and no. Usually, it’s not a good idea to line up the furniture along a long <strong>wall</strong>. We discussed this in one of my favorite posts about 21 Interior Design Mistakes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Plus, installing some glass sconces, such as the Murano Glass Chandelier and some floating shelves, can transform the entire space and brighten up the <strong>room</strong>. They’ll add a dramatic visual dimension to the <strong>room</strong> along with the sleek TV design. So, creating a TV <strong>wall</strong> can be an excellent way to use the empty space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Decorating with mirrors is always a good idea – whether you&rsquo;re looking to fill a <strong>wall</strong> in a living <strong>room</strong>, bed<strong>room</strong>, bath<strong>room</strong> or even kitchen. &lsquo;Living <strong>room</strong> mirrors are a great way to fill the space on the <strong>wall</strong>. As well as adding texture and dimension to the <strong>room</strong>, it can also make a small living <strong>room</strong> look bigger by reflecting light back into the space,&rsquo; says Brittany Farinas, creative director, House of One (opens in new tab). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The reflection of the windows on that cheap plastic film ruined those fun posters. Removing it let the bold colors POP against that light paint color on the <strong>wall</strong>. You can also see how I used boards (Tip 6) to get those posters level and evenly spaced in this picture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A huge piece covering the entire <strong>wall</strong> will command the eye and serve as an impressive focal point. You could also hang multiple paintings side by side or in a grid to add a little variety. While many artists sell complementary pieces that would look great together, you don’t necessarily have to buy a set. You can unify eclectically sourced paintings through their colors, styles, themes, or frames. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Light fixtures are an often-overlooked way to make a statement, so keep an eye out for attention-grabbing sconces, lamps, or overhead fixtures. For a painting or fireplace smack in the middle of the <strong>wall</strong> without much <strong>room</strong> on either side, try placing two intricately designed sconces on either side. By framing the feature in this way, you subtly draw attention toward it while filling in the gaps. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If <strong>wall</strong> hangings and other artworks cannot fill up the entire space in your living <strong>room</strong>, you can always go for a full-length bookcase installation. A bookcase system with tall bookshelves with a floor-to-ceiling design can be ideal for decorating large <strong>wall</strong>s. You don’t need to worry about installing costly paintings or artwork if you go for this <strong>wall</strong> decor idea. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In a large space there tends to be more furniture and accessories, which can feel a bit haphazard. One way to tie a large <strong>room</strong> of furniture together and unify your style is through repetition. Repeating fabric patterns or colors on chairs or throw pillows will help carry your eye around the <strong>room</strong> and feel visually more pleasing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Similarly, placing tall plants, like a tall faux fig tree, can act as the statement piece and be the focal point in your living <strong>room</strong>. It will add a splash of greenery and make the <strong>room</strong> look fresh and organic. You can turn the entire place around by positioning a tall plant in front of the large, bare <strong>wall</strong>. It can perfectly complement a modern or traditional living <strong>room</strong> style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://www.woohome.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Home-Touch-With-Brick-Wall-14.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Large Wall In Living Room Ideas - Big Wall Décor"><p>Here are a few tips to help you find information about Big Wall Décor:</p><ul><li>Look for good places to get information about What To Do With A Blank Wall.
