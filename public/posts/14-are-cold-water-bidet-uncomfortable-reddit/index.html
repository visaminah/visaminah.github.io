Would you like bidet to become common in US?. 14 Things About Are Cold Water Bidet Uncomfortable Reddit | Toto Washlet They’ll say that bidet water isn’t uncomfortable. But, as we’ll see, it certainly can be. But, don’t worry. If you live in a particularly cold area, you do have options. - Source: Internet Today we’re looking at whether bidet water tends to be cold. This is probably one of the most common questions posed by newcomers to the subject. It’s a great question. If bidet water is icy cold, then the phrase, “freezing one’s butt off” would no longer just be a metaphor. - Source: Internet I’m sure Reddit would have me beheaded for this opinion, but I don’t know where to start. For one, I’m 100% certain that a good amount of the sentiment for bidets here on Reddit is fuelled by a combination of wanting to be “in the know” of how unspeakably amazing these things are, and very Reddit-like attempted humour by praising your “squeaky clean balloon knot”. When I come across a bidet discussion in a random thread, it is always like this and it annoys me every time. I don’t think I’ve literally ever come across negative bidet sentiment on Reddit. - Source: Internet Again, the water isn’t necessarily cold, but it’s unheated. This could be a problem depending on where you live, the time of year, etc. Living in the southern US, I know my water runs extra cold during winter months. - Source: Internet Cold water bidets are generally considered comfortable. The water is unheated but not necessarily cold. But, they can be uncomfortable for those who live in colder climates. Both the location of the user and the time of year determine how cold bidet water gets. - Source: Internet Most non-electric bidets clean with unheated or “cold” water (~40 to 70 F ̊). While unheated, most don’t find cool tap water to be uncomfortable. Electric bidets have warm water (~90 to 104 F ̊) that can be adjusted via remote control. “Dual temp” non-electric bidets exist that provide warm water. - Source: Internet A standalone bidet is a separate washbasin. They’re located next to the toilet and are about toilet height. After conducting your business on the commode, you make your way to the bidet and wash off with fresh flowing water. - Source: Internet If you purchase the kind that hooks up to a faucet, then you may find that you have to hook the bidet up with each use, unless you don’t mind having an unsightly supply hose suspended from your faucet 24/7. The water has to warm up (faucet bidets). The warm water comes from the home’s plumbing. So, just like with a sink, you’ll have to turn the bidet on for a bit before it starts to run warm. While it may sound like a minor inconvenience, a lot of folks find that they’re done cleaning before they feel the water become warm. - Source: Internet Most non-electric bidets spray unheated water (~40 to 70 F ̊), while electric bidets cleanse with warm water (~90 to 104 F ̊). With unheated bidets, the water can feel cold depending on location and time of year. “Dual temp” non-electric bidets exist that spray warm water, but they’re less common. - Source: Internet Both electric seats and bidet-toilet combos provide warm water. Models vary but the remote control (or side panel) typically allows for adjusting the water temp between 90 – 104 °F (or 32.2-104 °C). - Source: Internet Non-electric bidets include bidet attachments, non-electric seats, handheld sprayers, and standalone bidets. It’s the former three (attachments, sprayers, and non-electric seats) that are known for using cold water. Standalone bidets are basically small sinks so they’re hooked into the home’s plumbing thus proving warm water. - Source: Internet By the way I’ve been to Japan and they have these everywhere - hotels, hostels, train stations, restaurants, Starbucks, 7-11s. You name it, it has a space toilet. More often than not I didn’t go with the bidet option in public toilets, but my point is I’ve tried enough different ones that the problem wasn’t lack of good options. - Source: Internet I’ll always recommend electric bidets. I have one and it’s awesome. But, non-electric units are still a hundred times better than toilet paper. - Source: Internet Edit: for clarification, I mean the toilet-integrated (or attached) bidets. I’m also European and we have standalone bidets in most houses but I’ve never heard of anyone actually using one. So no sir, not gonna use my hands there - Source: Internet Here are a few tips to help you find information about Reddit Bidet:\r- Look for good places to get information about Bidet Attachment Reddit.
