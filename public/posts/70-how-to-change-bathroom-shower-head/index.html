Drill ¼” holes into the tile and insert an anchor, gently tapping it with a rubber mallet until it’s flush with the surface. Attach the wall bracket with screws, and slide the bracket cover over it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The O-ring, a circular rubber part of the fixture, is inside the <strong>shower****head</strong>. It attaches to the various threads when the <strong>head</strong> has been unscrewed. When this part of the <strong>shower****head</strong> breaks, it can cause leaks and may need to be replaced. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A common part that wears away and needs to be replaced is the rubber washer (or O ring).

This will allow you to safely remove the <strong>shower</strong> <strong>head</strong> without pulling the whole <strong>shower</strong> off the wall. Using an adjustable wrench, turn the <strong>head</strong> counterclockwise to unscrew it from the <strong>shower</strong> arm completely. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To fix this problem, replace your <strong>shower</strong> diverter. Before you do, also check to see if there’s anything in your faucet blocking the diverter or if the washer in your diverter is bent or broken. It could be that you only need to replace that part rather than the whole <strong>shower</strong> diverter valve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>: Relatively easy to install, handheld <strong>shower</strong> <strong>head</strong>s are simply connected to the end of the <strong>shower</strong> arm clockwise, then the <strong>shower</strong> hose is connected to the mount.
