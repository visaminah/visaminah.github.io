You can use the flat side of the blade, a rubbing stone, or sandpaper for smoothing. - Source: Internet Snap: Place a wire hanger on a flat surface, and position your scored line over it. Using gentle pressure, push down on the sides of the tile to snap it. You can also use tile nippers to complete this step. - Source: Internet Different jobs require different cuts. The material you’re working with as well as the shape of cut you need entails different methods and tools. To figure out how to handle all those different cuts, we’re bringing you this guide which will help you plan ahead of time - remember, you can never ‘uncut’ a tile! - Source: Internet Geraghty says: ‘For simple trimming, mark on top of the tile, where you would like to cut. Using a glass cutter, score the tile on the cut line. Then, place the tile on a solid surface with a wire clothes hanger under the score line. Press down and break the tile along the line and smooth the cut if necessary.’ - Source: Internet As with the manual cutter, place the marked and measured tile in line with the blade and feed it slowly and securely along the line. Wear protective equipment (chain gloves are ideal) tiles can raise due to the movement of the blade, keep it pressed down to ensure a smoother line. Make sure the protective cover is in place on the blade too - Source: Internet Position: Place the tile on a flat surface, and use a square ruler as a guide for your glass cutter. Always set your square ruler slightly off the marked line (less than ¼ inch) so the cutter hits the right place. - Source: Internet My work always presents a problem of finding a place to set up my tile saw. Usually, the saw is banished to a garage or back porch far from the project, so I decided to invest in a tile cutter that I could use where I was tiling. I settled on the Masterpiuma P3, a manual tile cutter by Montolit. - Source: Internet Position: Place the tile on a flat surface. Place masking tape painter’s tape around the outer edge to prevent the glaze from chipping. Make sure you have the right blade depending on the type of tile you have (as mentioned above). Secure your tile with a clamp. - Source: Internet Compared to tile cutters, wet saws are best for large projects. You can cut tile faster, easier, and with more precision than manual tile cutters. The only price to pay is the set up and preparation of the working area. Wet saws are recommended for large rooms or rooms with complicated floor plans. - Source: Internet Measure \u0026 Mark: Mark the line on the tile where you want to make a cut. You can also use a compass, or round objects such as cans or lids to draw a curve or semicircles. - Source: Internet The expert recommendation when you’re opening a hole in a fixed tile is to put the drill to the tile at a 45-degree angle, pushing until it is at a 90-degree angle. Don’t push too hard, or the drill bit will be worn out too fast. Once you reach the end of your cut line, pull the tool out gently. Cutting past the marked lines may result in damaged tile. - Source: Internet Another built-in device introduced in 1960 was the snapping element.

Finally, go at your own pace. - Source: Internet These small tools work in the same way as manual cutters, with tile scribes used as a quick way to cut through thin ceramic tiles. You will need to manually measure and mark the tile before scoring, with the tile then snapped across the scribe. In comparison, nippers are very similar to pliers and they can be used to cut the edges of tiles so that they fit into awkward spots. They are relatively easy to use, however the level of difficulty when making the small cuts will depend on the thickness of the tile. - Source: Internet When you have measured and marked your tile, place it face up in the cutter and ensure it is straight using the guides. Score from the bottom of the tile to the top, applying enough pressure to score through the glaze. When scored pull the handle down (again with a relative amount of pressure) to snap the tile along the score. - Source: Internet On the tile, mark out the shape which is to be cut and have a clear idea about which side is the waste.

However in reality, porcelain <strong>tile</strong>s are a type of ceramic <strong>tile</strong>s which are mostly used for flooring and walling purposes with an absorption rate of around 0.5%. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>TOP TIP: You can’t un-cut a <strong>tile</strong>. Measure twice cut once to be certain. It’s also good practice to have a few spares in case you make a mistake - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cutting ceramic <strong>tile</strong> without chipping it can be a separate challenge. That’s why experts have invented methods for cutting <strong>tile</strong> that can prevent chips and breaks. Here are a few methods to prevent chips during the <strong>tile</strong> cutting process if you’re working with ceramic <strong>tile</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I would recommend you to use <strong>tile</strong> nippers only to cut curvy and circular areas. For straight and angled cuts, use a wet <strong>tile</strong> saw . Also, a good idea today would be to use the new generation <strong>tile</strong> nipper with replaceable teeth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Our website lists a number of different <strong>tile</strong> cutters. We carry different sizes made to accommodate any type of project. We also sell the maintenance materials, like lubrication, to keep your cutter smoothly working. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Used for Which Materials? A <strong>snap</strong> cutter is mostly used to cut ceramic <strong>tile</strong>s that are up to 3/8 inches thick. Depending on the type of texture, you can also use it for cutting porcelain <strong>tile</strong>. A <strong>snap</strong> cutter may be used to cut marble <strong>tile</strong>s too - but only if it has tungsten carbide blades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A <strong>tile</strong> cutter is used to cut ceramic <strong>tile</strong>s upto a desired size and shape. However, depending upon the type of texture, you can even cut certain porcelain <strong>tile</strong>s using a standard manual <strong>tile</strong> cutter. It is favourite among the woodworkers because it is the fast among all the cutting tools and you can make many adjustments to the type of cuts you want to make depending on the <strong>tile</strong> type and size. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With a Dremel tool, it is especially easy to cut holes. A Dremel tool allows you to drill holes in a fixed <strong>tile</strong> as well as make holes in a loose <strong>tile</strong> that has not been installed yet. Cutting ceramic <strong>tile</strong> with a Dremel is the easiest option, as other <strong>tile</strong>s may require a different bit. To cut a round hole in porcelain <strong>tile</strong> or in marble, a diamond bit is ideal to cut holes through those <strong>tile</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Next, narrow down your options by figuring out the sort of cut(s) you need (straight, angled, curved, etc.) and how many <strong>tile</strong>s you plan on cutting for the whole project. After you narrow down your options, you can finally decide on the right tool(s) based on your budget and personal preferences. But first, let’s see the purpose of each tool and how they work! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There is a trick to scoring glass and that is to score lightly because putting too much pressure on the <strong>tile</strong> when you score can cause it to crack or give it a jagged edge. As you can see, breaking <strong>tile</strong>s along the score isn’t always easy. Sometimes the <strong>tile</strong> cutter won’t score deep enough. Other times the <strong>tile</strong> just doesn’t want to break. Expect to fight with more than a few <strong>tile</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In almost every tiling project, you will need to make cuts to the <strong>tile</strong>s, as very rarely are <strong>tile</strong>s able to fit perfectly into an area. In general, <strong>tile</strong>s fit into three categories; porcelain, ceramic and natural stone, and the type of cutter you will need will depend on the material and its thickness. To achieve a perfectly precise cut you will need great tools, and in this guide, we will take you through everything you need to know to be able to choose the best <strong>tile</strong> cutter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The guide above should serve as a good start in the <strong>tile</strong> cutter vs wet saw debate. Material, project size, and skill all factor into your choice. However, the best choice for your project isn’t always straightforward. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Stop right there. Tile cutting isn’t difficult. Just because you’re an amateur <strong>tile</strong> setter doesn’t mean you should shy away from cutting some <strong>tile</strong>. It all comes down to choosing the right tool for the job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Make multiple small cuts by turning over the <strong>tile</strong>. These will avoid the jamming and help you maintain control. The blade should run into the waste side. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=3><li>Score: Place the scoring tool on the marked line, starting at the edge of the <strong>tile</strong>. Press down the cutter as you move across the <strong>tile</strong> - the goal is to score a line without cutting all the way through. If you hear a scratching noise as you move the, it means your <strong>tile</strong> is being scored! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Wet saws cut <strong>tile</strong> extremely straight. The guide helps make perfect cuts so long as your hand doesn’t shake. With some skill, you can also cut <strong>tile</strong> into intricate shapes. While <strong>tile</strong> cutters can only cut straight, a wet saw can create curved <strong>tile</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Sigma <strong>tile</strong> saw also offers you lots of smart user-friendly features. The spring-loaded table provides good stability. A swivel measurement bar ensures consistent cutting precision and the rapid positioning button activates the 0-45° locking angle mechanism. The easy-grip handle gives you good leverage as you cut your <strong>tile</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ceramic <strong>tile</strong> cutters are used to cut <strong>tile</strong>s to a required size or shape. They come in a number of different forms, from basic manual devices to complex attachments for power tools.[1] - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>That’s where we’d like to help. Our experts would love to hear all about your project and help you decide between a <strong>tile</strong> cutter and a wet saw. We’ll take the time to ensure you’re buying the right tool for the job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Drilling holes are same as making cuts in a porcelain <strong>tile</strong> only in smaller scale and in circular shapes. However, drilling is not easy, and you want a clean drilled hole in the <strong>tile</strong> so that it can fit the screws, plumbing pipes, space for radiators et. al. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Tile types such as glass, cork, concrete, and stone are used for any number of other applications. There’s no rule dictating which <strong>tile</strong> you can or can’t use for a project. Though some <strong>tile</strong> does hold up better in certain environments. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Accurately measuring your floor plan is imperative for choosing the correct amount of <strong>tile</strong>s for your project. Measure the entire floor plan’s boundaries, diagonal interiors, width, and height. Next, measure one square of sample <strong>tile</strong>. Use those numbers to calculate how many <strong>tile</strong>s you’ll need for your entire project. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=4><li>Smooth: Finally, smooth out the edges of the <strong>tile</strong>. You can use the flat side of the blade, a rubbing stone, or sandpaper for smoothing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li><ol start=4><li>Snap: Place a wire hanger on a flat surface, and position your scored line over it. Using gentle pressure, push down on the sides of the <strong>tile</strong> to <strong>snap</strong> it. You can also use <strong>tile</strong> nippers to complete this step. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Different jobs require different cuts. The material you’re working with as well as the shape of cut you need entails different methods and tools. To figure out how to handle all those different cuts, we’re bringing you this guide which will help you plan ahead of time - remember, you can never ‘uncut’ a <strong>tile</strong>! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Geraghty says: &lsquo;For simple trimming, mark on top of the <strong>tile</strong>, where you would like to cut. Using a glass cutter, score the <strong>tile</strong> on the cut line. Then, place the <strong>tile</strong> on a solid surface with a wire clothes hanger under the score line. Press down and break the <strong>tile</strong> along the line and smooth the cut if necessary.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As with the manual cutter, place the marked and measured <strong>tile</strong> in line with the blade and feed it slowly and securely along the line. Wear protective equipment (chain gloves are ideal) <strong>tile</strong>s can raise due to the movement of the blade, keep it pressed down to ensure a smoother line. Make sure the protective cover is in place on the blade too - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=2><li>Position: Place the <strong>tile</strong> on a flat surface, and use a square ruler as a guide for your glass cutter. Always set your square ruler slightly off the marked line (less than ¼ inch) so the cutter hits the right place. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>My work always presents a problem of finding a place to set up my <strong>tile</strong> saw. Usually, the saw is banished to a garage or back porch far from the project, so I decided to invest in a <strong>tile</strong> cutter that I could use where I was tiling. I settled on the Masterpiuma P3, a manual <strong>tile</strong> cutter by Montolit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=2><li>Position: Place the <strong>tile</strong> on a flat surface. Place masking tape painter’s tape around the outer edge to prevent the glaze from chipping. Make sure you have the right blade depending on the type of <strong>tile</strong> you have (as mentioned above). Secure your <strong>tile</strong> with a clamp. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Compared to <strong>tile</strong> cutters, wet saws are best for large projects. You can cut <strong>tile</strong> faster, easier, and with more precision than manual <strong>tile</strong> cutters. The only price to pay is the set up and preparation of the working area. Wet saws are recommended for large rooms or rooms with complicated floor plans. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol><li>Measure & Mark: Mark the line on the <strong>tile</strong> where you want to make a cut. You can also use a compass, or round objects such as cans or lids to draw a curve or semicircles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>The expert recommendation when you’re opening a hole in a fixed <strong>tile</strong> is to put the drill to the <strong>tile</strong> at a 45-degree angle, pushing until it is at a 90-degree angle. Don’t push too hard, or the drill bit will be worn out too fast. Once you reach the end of your cut line, pull the tool out gently. Cutting past the marked lines may result in damaged <strong>tile</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Another built-in device introduced in 1960 was the <strong>snap</strong>ping element. It allowed users to <strong>snap</strong> the <strong>tile</strong>s easily and not with the bench, the cutter handle or hitting the <strong>tile</strong> with a knee as it was done before. This was a revolution in the cutting process of the ceramic world. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This method is suitable for bigger jobs that involve a great amount of <strong>tile</strong>, but one has to be experienced to use a wet saw. Their <strong>tile</strong> cuts are extremely precise - not only can they be cut to your exact measurements, but they create a smooth, straight edge. Wet saws can even cut <strong>tile</strong> trimmings with bullnose or quarter-round shapes. When Does it Work Best? Wet saws are great for bulk projects! If you’re cutting a large amount of <strong>tile</strong>, or need corner cuts around door jambs and wall outlets, this is the tool for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;For example, if you&rsquo;re cutting such as porcelain, then you should only use a wet-saw cutter as anything else will be too tough. A multi-tool can replace the need for a <strong>tile</strong> nipper, used to make circular cuts in a ceramic <strong>tile</strong>, however they cannot replace a manual <strong>tile</strong> cutter.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Your “floor plan” refers to where you’re laying <strong>tile</strong>. Every project comes with unique spatial challenges. Sometimes you need more <strong>tile</strong>, sometimes less, and other times you need to cut <strong>tile</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Safety notice: With all <strong>tile</strong> cutting methods be sure to wear safety goggles (opens in new tab) and utility gloves (opens in new tab), both of which you can buy on Amazon. Do not touch the blade and keep fingers away from it. Ensure any hazards are not present, do not wear loose clothing and keep children away also. Finally, go at your own pace. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>These small tools work in the same way as manual cutters, with <strong>tile</strong> scribes used as a quick way to cut through thin ceramic <strong>tile</strong>s. You will need to manually measure and mark the <strong>tile</strong> before scoring, with the <strong>tile</strong> then <strong>snap</strong>ped across the scribe. In comparison, nippers are very similar to pliers and they can be used to cut the edges of <strong>tile</strong>s so that they fit into awkward spots. They are relatively easy to use, however the level of difficulty when making the small cuts will depend on the thickness of the <strong>tile</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you have measured and marked your <strong>tile</strong>, place it face up in the cutter and ensure it is straight using the guides. Score from the bottom of the <strong>tile</strong> to the top, applying enough pressure to score through the glaze. When scored pull the handle down (again with a relative amount of pressure) to <strong>snap</strong> the <strong>tile</strong> along the score. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>On the <strong>tile</strong>, mark out the shape which is to be cut and have a clear idea about which side is the waste. You can get carried away easily and score on the side of the <strong>tile</strong>. Use an electrician’s tape to make a cross as a marker. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best kitchen <strong>tile</strong>s can be pricier than your bog standard basic porcelain plates and ceramic slates. So the last thing you want to do is perform a sub-standard job when you&rsquo;re dealing with premium products. So we&rsquo;ll show you how to dress your scheme, so that you can reclaim your cooking space but in an instant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol><li>Measure & Mark: Mark the desired shape (circular shape, square, semi-circular, etc.) you want to cut on both sides of the <strong>tile</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>A <strong>tile</strong> scribe works in a similar way to the manual cutter. You measure and mark the <strong>tile</strong> and rather than have a manual cutter you use a secure metal ruler and score along your line, then <strong>snap</strong> the <strong>tile</strong> across the back of the scribe. This method is only useful for smaller ceramic <strong>tile</strong>s such as metros. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The only difference is that the ceramic <strong>tile</strong>s are made of clay. water and sand while the porcelain <strong>tile</strong>s constitutes of clay which is more dense. These <strong>tile</strong>s are formed by the application of heat and pressure which makes the porcelain <strong>tile</strong> more hard and dense than ceramic <strong>tile</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>(As a note, you’ll see that with most of the tools, in general, have the same cutting process: Measure and mark the <strong>tile</strong>, <strong>snap</strong> or cut it, then smooth the edges. Also, some <strong>tile</strong> projects may need a combination of tools and techniques too. Let’s start.) - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Then, secure the <strong>tile</strong> to a flat workbench, using a clamp, with the edge of the <strong>tile</strong> you intend to cut handing off the side of the bench. Finally, using a continuous rim blade on your grinder, slowly pull the angle grinder along your cut line. Do not rush this as this can cause jagged edges.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=5><li>Smooth: Smooth out sharp cut edges to ensure there are no cuts or snags. Use your rubbing stone (aluminum oxide stone) to file glass <strong>tile</strong> edges as well as high fired porcelain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li><ol start=2><li>Position & Score: Place the <strong>tile</strong> on a flat surface, glazed side up, beneath the cutting wheel. Starting at the edge of the <strong>tile</strong>, press the carbide scoring wheel firmly across the face of the <strong>tile</strong>, until you score a straight line. It may require a second pass of the cutting wheel to start a line, but don’t attempt multiple passes as too many scores will chip the edges. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li><ol start=3><li>Snap: Squeeze the nipper’s handles forcefully to nibble the chips one by one. Take small nips, without going too fast so that you don’t risk breaking the <strong>tile</strong> beyond the mark. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Porcelain <strong>tile</strong> is made from a denser type of clay than ceramic <strong>tile</strong>. Clay <strong>tile</strong>s are entirely clay. Ceramic, porcelain, and clay <strong>tile</strong>s are either glazed for inside use or unglazed for roofing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Each is readily available through the RUBI store. Which you should choose is an entirely different story. Ready to learn the difference between <strong>tile</strong> cutters and wet saws? Let’s get started. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wet saws are best for large projects when your <strong>tile</strong> cutters aren’t cutting it (literally). Instead of relying on human power, wet saws use electricity. At first glance, a wet saw looks like a table saw. A rotating diamond blade cuts the <strong>tile</strong> while a guide keeps your <strong>tile</strong> straight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Constructed from aircraft-grade aluminum and high-density polyethylene, the <strong>tile</strong> cutter is sturdy, durable and quite lightweight. Its extended handle with a rubber grip gives you the maximum leverage to complete the toughest of tiling jobs. Cleaning up is a breeze as this <strong>tile</strong> cutter is dust-free. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Over the time the tool evolved, incorporating elements that made it more accurate and productive. The first cutter had an iron point to scratch the <strong>tile</strong>s. It was later replaced by the current tungsten carbide scratching wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As you can see, there are various tools to use for cutting <strong>tile</strong>s based on the type and number of <strong>tile</strong>s, as well as the kinds of cuts you want to make. Consider your factors and pick the one that fits your needs to ensure a professional result. Initially, you might break a <strong>tile</strong> or two, but that’s okay! With time, you’ll be an expert. If you have any doubts regarding the usage of any tool, let us know in the comment section for further guidance! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wet saws can also cut harder <strong>tile</strong> materials. The diamond blade can cut the hardest varieties of <strong>tile</strong>. The wet saw is a must if you want to feel cutting glass <strong>tile</strong>s as if it was butter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=3><li>Snap: After scoring the line, lift the handle and let the pressure down onto the center of the <strong>tile</strong>. Apply a firm and gentle pressure to the handle. If your <strong>tile</strong> was properly scored, it will <strong>snap</strong> easily. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>A manual <strong>tile</strong> cutter is a great tool for cutting <strong>tile</strong>s which will be placed in small gaps, such as at the edge of a <strong>tile</strong>d floor or wall. Once the <strong>tile</strong> is measured and marked, you should place it onto the <strong>tile</strong> cutter and use the guides to ensure it is perfectly straight. Next, you will be able to score the cut with just enough pressure to penetrate the glazed layer. Finally, pull the <strong>tile</strong> cutter handle downwards to <strong>snap</strong> the <strong>tile</strong> along your score line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Tile cutters by nature, take longer to set up and use than wet saws. You need to find your <strong>tile</strong>, place it inside the cutter, score the <strong>tile</strong>, and finally <strong>snap</strong> the <strong>tile</strong> along the score. What’s more, some harder <strong>tile</strong>s don’t score well, so choosing the proper scoring wheel is a must. For glass <strong>tile</strong>, for an instance, scoring glass can be done with any scoring wheel, but the one we recommend is 6mm and the RUBI Extreme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Used for Which Materials? A <strong>tile</strong> nipper is commonly used with ceramic <strong>tile</strong>s. It can also cut thinner porcelain, concrete, or even some natural stone <strong>tile</strong>s but beware that you need a quite firm grip and squeeze to cut those materials. It’s also useful for <strong>tile</strong>s with smaller sections, such as mosaic <strong>tile</strong> sheets. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;For a round cut then you can use an angle grinder [like this Black + Decker product on Amazon (opens in new tab)], which is a handheld power tool that can be purchased from any good hardware store. Firstly, draw out the rounded shape or edge onto the front of the <strong>tile</strong>, ideally with a <strong>tile</strong> marker although a lead pencil should be perfectly sufficient too.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Your two best <strong>tile</strong> cutting options are <strong>tile</strong> cutters and a wet saw. Tile cutters generally take more time, less skill, but are more convenient. Wet saws take less time, more skill, but are less convenient. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Applying Pressure - With a successful notching system in place, another way to prevent the likelihood of chips or cracks is by gently applying pressure while cutting the <strong>tile</strong>. The method is the same whether using a hand tool or a power saw. Apply an even amount of pressure from start to finish as your blade goes through the cutter. Gentle pressure ensures that your <strong>tile</strong> goes all the way through, from end to end, as smoothly as possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Tile cutter vs wet saw? These are the two best <strong>tile</strong> cutting tools for <strong>tile</strong> setters. But which you should choose depends on the specific job at hand, the materials you’re cutting, and the space to work on. That’s why today, we’re bringing you our guide for choosing the best tool for your project. When it comes to the great <strong>tile</strong> cutter vs wet saw debate, we’re here to help. Let’s get started. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re planning on tiling often, it might make sense to buy a <strong>tile</strong> cutter and a wet saw. You’re likely to run across situations where you’ll need each tool. It’s always best to have the proper tool for the job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Tiles come in all shapes and sizes and there isn’t a ‘one size fits all’ approach. The tools and blades required depend on the thickness and material of the <strong>tile</strong>. Using the correct equipment gives you a finer and safer cut, which looks more professional and reduces the risk of leaving a jagged or sharp edge - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When to Avoid? A <strong>snap</strong> cutter will not cut curves or bevels. Because it is a manual process, it’s not very ideal for large projects (such as large scale floor tiling projects). Although this tool is handy for making straight cuts, it doesn’t create perfectly straight lines like a wet <strong>tile</strong> saw. Ceramic or porcelain <strong>tile</strong>s more than 3/8 inches thickness, natural stone and marble <strong>tile</strong>s, and large format <strong>tile</strong>s shouldn’t be cut with a <strong>snap</strong> cutter - these <strong>tile</strong>s should be cut with a wet <strong>tile</strong> saw. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Tile comes in all different varieties. Ceramic <strong>tile</strong>, clay <strong>tile</strong>, and porcelain <strong>tile</strong> are the <strong>tile</strong>s you’ll commonly see at the store. Though these three types only scratch the proverbial <strong>tile</strong> surface. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Everyone should have <strong>tile</strong> cutters in their toolbox. The cutters look somewhat like a car jack with a bar that runs from top to bottom. Tiles get placed inside the cutters and scored. The <strong>tile</strong>s break along the scored line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=2><li>Position & Score: If the area you’ll be cutting is far from the edge of the <strong>tile</strong>, consider cutting the <strong>tile</strong> down first. In that case, start with a <strong>snap</strong> cutter or a wet <strong>tile</strong> saw to score and cut off straight pieces. Then continue shaping your smaller area once it has been trimmed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>After marking the edges, take a cutter and score the line to make the clean cuts.
