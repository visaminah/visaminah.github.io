We found the two most popular filling materials were polystyrene beads or shredded foam. It was important that our list of finalists contain bean bags filled with both types of material, so that we could put the two most popular materials to the test. - Source: Internet Half of the bean bags we tested had removable covers which could be washed or switched with ease. This removability is especially important for microsuede or cotton covers, which are best cleaned in the washing machine. Spot cleaning is often adequate for bean bag chairs with vinyl or polyester covers. - Source: Internet This bean bag had a good quality cotton cover with tough zippers that locked to ensure EPS beads stayed inside. Because this cover is non-removable, Flash Furniture recommends spot cleaning the chair as needed. This is a pain because of cotton’s tendency to stain and absorb smells. We do not recommend this bean bag because it is a pain to clean and needed more filling. - Source: Internet The Big Joe has double zippers, which securely enclose inner beads. This is important as EPS beads can be choking hazards for small children. The Big Joe’s cover is not removable. The recommended cleaning method for the bean bag chair is to spot clean with a mix of water and detergent. - Source: Internet Filling material: All of our bean bag finalists were filled with either a type of expandable polystyrene (EPS) bead or shredded foam. EPS is the same material used in disposable coffee cups and packaging peanuts. It is a good material for bean bag chairs because it is lightweight and can hold its form for several years. - Source: Internet Multiple testers cited wishing there were more beads inside the Flash Furniture – Oversized Bean Bag Chair. The lack of filling contributed to its just below average ranking for comfort overall. This bean bag chair was our only adult bean bag that was filled with EPS beads. - Source: Internet While the Sofa Sack’s quality microsuede cover ranked well with our testers, our testers cited disappointment in the chair’s foam filling. Our testers complained that the Sofa Sack’s foam was too hard to snuggle into. Multiple testers noted that the bean bag chair was comfortable for laying down flat, but did not offer any back support when sitting in an upright or slightly reclined position. - Source: Internet Straight out of the box, the Lumaland had no musty foam or packaging odor. Like other foam bean bag chairs, the Lumaland’s assembly requires foam contained in an inner polyester lining to be broken up and placed in its outer cover. While the foam had already puffed up slightly during shipping, breaking up the rest of the foam was quick and easy. - Source: Internet All of the shredded foam bean bags required an inner bag full of foam material to be broken apart and then put inside a cover. This assembly was simple, taking only about five to ten minutes. Foam bean bags take three to seven days for the foam to completely expand. During this period we sat, fluffed and flipped over bean bags multiple times to ensure foam was completely expanded before comfort testing. - Source: Internet This bean bag showed no signs of wearing or flattening after four weeks of intense use. This bean bag’s quality is apparent in its comfortable foam filling and outer microsuede cover. For under $200, the Lumaland is a great option for adults looking for a comfortable classic bean bag. - Source: Internet Our bean bag finalists were cuddled, squished, bounced and kicked during four weeks of rigorous comfort testing by six different testers. Our testers incorporated all eight bean bags into their daily life. A comfort questionnaire was completed after the first and fourth week of use, so that any changes in the bean bag’s comfort would be noticed. In addition to comfort testing, we also took careful notes on the ease of each bean bag’s assembly and how easy it was to wash the cover. - Source: Internet There’s a lot to love about this Loft 25 bean bag. For starters, it’s water resistant, so you can use it outdoors as well as inside. That means it’s perfect for lounging on in the garden, and you don’t need to worry about a spilled drink or a drop of rain. - Source: Internet Best Bean Bag Chair for Kids: Big Joe - Dorm This bean bag chair offers quality and comfort for under $200. Don’t let the name fool you, this bean bag isn’t just meant for dorm rooms. Big Joe’s comfortable structure, durable fabric and lightweight filling make it a versatile, comfortable chair for kids. See Price at Amazon.com - Source: Internet This bean bag chair’s best aspect was its tough vinyl cover, which was very easy to spot clean. This vinyl cover did not rank high for aesthetics with our testers, but definitely did the job for durability and stain resistance. This small bean bag is also very lightweight, meaning this bean bag could easily be moved for indoor and outdoor use. - Source: Internet But when it comes to buying a bean bag, not all products are created equal. You’ll want to consider whether it’s washable if kids are involved, and it’s worth buying a waterproof or outdoor bean bag if you want to use yours in the garden and not worry about a drop of rain. Other factors such as size and weight will come into play, as well as whether your bean bag is refillable. - Source: Internet The Big Joe – Dorm Bean Bag Chair took our top spot for kids because it fits a wide variety of age ranges from small child to teen. This highly structured bean bag delivers on back support and is extremely lightweight. It is stain resistant and priced under $50, meaning parents can save more money for the college fund. - Source: Internet Oversized bean bags are a great option if you’ve got plenty of room, or want a bean bag you can lie down on. Outdoor bean bags are often larger for this reason and have the benefit of being waterproof. A bean bag chair, meanwhile, has a more structured shape so you can sit upright comfortably, with a certain degree of back support. If that’s a priority, look for an ergonomic bean bag designed to encourage good posture. - Source: Internet The Fugu also had the strongest odor of all of the finalists. The bean bag chair reeked of “cardboardy,” musty packaging material. To make matters worse, we were not able to wash the Fugu’s cover in the washing machine because of a leak of foam in the bag’s inner lining. - Source: Internet Comfort is another big factor when it comes to picking your perfect bean bag, and that all comes down to what you’ll be using it for. If you’re buying a kids’ bean bag, check it’s squashy enough for a toddler to sit comfortably in, or that it has enough back support for a teenager to do some serious gaming in. If you’re buying for yourself, you’ll want to make sure it’s big enough to accommodate a grown-up, with the right amount of support for you. Some people want to sink into a soft, fluffy bean bag, while others prefer a more rigid shape – the best way to tell is by testing it. - Source: Internet If you’ve got plenty of space to play with, this supersized Fatboy bean bag is as comfy as they come. Regardless of whether you’re sitting or lying on it, it’s big enough to wrap around your body and provide lots of support. It ‘s great for relaxing in the home or out in the garden. - Source: Internet Compared to a regular ol’ seat, there’s just something about a bean bag chair that hits different. Ya feel? Not only is it a sack of pure happiness that conforms to your body, but a bean bag also serves as a fun and affordable piece of furniture that can really jazz up your space. If you’ve been playing with the idea of getting one for your home, then this is your sign to go for it. And since we’re here already, defff look through all the best bean bag chairs we’ve gathered up here. You and your peach deserve a comfy floof to relax on! - Source: Internet The EPS bean bags did not have removable covers. Instead these brands recommended that the bags be spot cleaned as needed. We found that the ECR4Kids – Classic and Big Joe – Dorm models were exceptionally easy to spot clean because of their resilient vinyl and polyester covers. - Source: Internet It’s small enough to tuck into the corner of a bedroom, and squashy enough to mould around them and create a little bean bag chair for reading or playing. It’s also super light – 1.4kg – so they can pick it up and move it around independently. - Source: Internet Top Pick: Lumaland - Luxury Bean Bag Chair The Lumaland is our most comfortable bean bag chair with quality foam filling and microsuede cover. Its cover is machine washable and easy to assemble. This bean bag provides high quality for under $200. See Price at Amazon.com - Source: Internet During week one and week four of comfort testing, testers answered questions regarding neck and back comfort, how easy getting in and out of the chair was, presence of any off-gassing odor and overall quality of the bean bag. The testing revealed no significant changes to any of the bean bags’ comfort over the course of four weeks. The most significant difference noted by our testers was the dissipation of initial chemical odors from packaging. - Source: Internet Seriously, there’s a bean bag chair for every type of need. So, go on and shop our picks. We’re sure you’ll find one that speaks to you. - Source: Internet At 40 inches wide, this bean bag comfortably fits one adult. It arrived already at its full size, and no assembly was required. It also had no off-gassing odor straight out of the box. - Source: Internet No. When you’re choosing a bean bag, it’s worth paying close attention to the cover. Many bean bags have a separate internal bag that keeps all the tiny balls contained, which means you can take the cover off if needed, and – if it’s machine-washable – pop it in the washing machine. Others are wipe-clean only, particularly if they’re made from a plush fabric like velvet or sheepskin, which is far less practical where kids and pets are concerned. - Source: Internet Half of the bean bags we tested had removable covers that we washed in a washing machine. We found that the Lumaland – Luxury’s cover was exceptionally easy to remove and put back on because of the quality zipper design. Chill Sack – 2-Foot Round and Cozy Sack were not far behind; both bean bag covers were easy to remove and put back on. As previously noted, we were unable to remove the Fugu’s cover because of a breakage in its inner lining. - Source: Internet EPS is not biodegradable, but EPS beads may be recycled. Bean bags that use recycled EPS beads have a shorter lifespan than those that use non-recycled EPS beads. Unfortunately, this means that consumers who want to “go green” and use recycled EPS beads may end up having to refill their bean bags sooner than those who opt for non-recycled EPS beads. - Source: Internet Why it’s great: This bean bag has options for the whole family! It comes in a kids’ size all the way up to a six-foot ultimate sack and in 24 different color options, so there’s something for everyone. You can also choose between suede or fur for the cover. The outer cover is machine washable for added convenience. The inside is stuffed with high-quality memory foam for comfort and flexibility, and it has an inner cover to keep it all together while you wash the outer one. The cover has a durable zipper with a safety lock, so you don’t have to worry about your child trying to take it apart. - Source: Internet Our testers complained that the ECR4Kids – Classic Bean Bag Chair needed more of its EPS bead filling material. This bean bag chair also had a tendency to fill up with air, and then decompress when sat on. At 35” wide, this bean bag is best suited for kids 12 years old and under. - Source: Internet Some bean bag covers are made from a waterproof material, or have a water-resistant coating, which is ideal if you plan to use your bean bag outside in the garden or on a balcony – or even if you just want to guard against splashes and spills. Be mindful of the difference, though, as while a waterproof bean bag can be left outside in the rain, a water-resistant bean bag may not stand up to a full downpour. Check if your bean bag is suitable for outdoor use when you buy it. - Source: Internet The bean bag chairs filled with EPS beads did not require assembly. However, the majority of our testers noted that the ECR4Kids – Classic felt like it needed more beads than it came with. If you find your bean bag chair a bit “deflated,” additional EPS beads can be purchased online and added to your bean bags at home. - Source: Internet This bean bag had a slight chemically smell that dissipated over time. The outer cover is not removable and is hard to spot clean because the polyester material absorbs liquids and odors. At 32” wide this bean bag is a good size for kids 12 years old and younger, but does not deliver on quality and comfort. - Source: Internet We spent four weeks rigorously chilling, cuddling and sleeping on eight of the top-selling bean bag chairs on the market. We tested durability, washed the covers and researched safety of filling materials and in the end, found the Lumaland – Luxury Bean Bag Chair to be the best bean bag chair. Lumaland stood out because of its shredded foam filling and quality microsuede cover. All our testers loved this bag’s back support and how easy it was to change the cover making machine washing a breeze. For a kid-sized bean bag, we found Big Joe – Dorm Bean Bag Chair stood out from the competition because of its comfort, easy-to-clean cover and lightweight design. - Source: Internet The Lumaland – Luxury Bean Bag Chair ranked highest for comfort with all but one of our testers, plus it has an easy-to-remove cover and no odor. Our testers loved Lumaland’s shredded foam filling and microsuede cover. This bean bag’s price tag is under $200, meaning you can get a quality bean bag without breaking the bank. - Source: Internet This massive bean bag chair was rated as above average for comfort overall by our testers. However, this bean bag did not rate as comfortable as the Lumaland because of irregular chunks of unbroken foam inside. Though this was technically our fault, the foam inside this bean bag was very hard to break apart during assembly. Our testers detected foam chunks even after four weeks of intense use. - Source: Internet If you use your bean bag a lot, it’s likely that it will lose shape over time and may need to be topped up with balls. Most bean bags come with a zip that allows you to do this, and some companies sell the balls separately as top-ups or full refills. Check to see if your bean bag has an opening and if you need to buy the internal bag separately. If you already have bean bag balls going spare, or find some on a cheap deal, you can look for a bean bag cover without any filling – this may save you a few quid. - Source: Internet Because the Fugu’s foam had broken through its inner lining, we contacted the seller for a refund. We did not get a response, but a few days later we received a new bean bag. Fugu’s confusing return process and quality issues were a pain. Therefore, we recommend either opting for the similarly priced Sofa Sack – 5-Foot Round, or paying around $50 more for the superior Lumaland – Luxury Bean Bag Chair. - Source: Internet Big Joe is filled with Megahh Beads, the company’s own proprietary polystyrene bead, which our testers found comfortable. Unlike with other kids’ bean bags, our testers did not want more or less beads inside. However, as noted earlier, polystyrene beads lose their structure over the course of years and need to be replaced. Additional Megahh Beads, which are fully recyclable, can be purchased for under $20. - Source: Internet Shredded foam is also popular as bean bag chair filling because of its high density and comfort. This is a heavier material that often requires the consumer to break apart large foam pieces by massaging the foam within a cover. If the foam is not broken up enough, irregular-shaped foam chunks can be uncomfortable when sitting. However, when broken in correctly, this material provides a high degree of comfort. - Source: Internet Because of its five foot diameter and foam filling, this bean bag is very difficult to move. While its cover has the quality of a good piece of furniture, its inner foam is lacking in comfort. The price difference between the Sofa Sack and Lumaland – Luxury is under $50, so if possible we recommend springing for the more comfortable Lumaland. - Source: Internet At the end of week one and week four, each bean bag’s widest and tallest dimensions were taken. We gathered this information to see if the bean bags would lose their structure or flatten out after intense use. Encouragingly, none of our bean bag finalists’ dimensions changed significantly. However, EPS beads usually lose their structure over the course of the first five years, so if you buy this type of bean bag you may need to purchase bead refills at a later point. - Source: Internet This bean bag chair was also the easiest to move because it is lightweight and has a built-in handle. This bean bag chair is only about four pounds, meaning that even a child could move it. The bean bag’s tough nylon-polyester blend fabric is waterproof, stain resistant and durable. This means the Big Joe could be easily taken and used outdoors. - Source: Internet The Lumaland is four feet wide, a size our testers found to be comfortable for one adult. It is also available in three foot and five foot diameters. Our testers ranked the Lumaland as one of the easiest bean bags to get out of due to its taller height at around 28 inches. - Source: Internet Believe it or not, bean bag chairs aren’t just for first-time apartment dwellers or college kids who can’t afford takeout, much less a brand-new sofa (though ofc, bean bags are smaller and more affordable than a fancy armchair). From binge-watching bad television to playing too many video games, bean bags are perfect for all your lounging needs, and investing in the right one can be a T-O-T-A-L game-changer. Below, you’ll find various styles of loungers—we’re talking small, large, long, memory foam, and even reclining styles, as well as tons of different fabric options, from faux leather to faux fur. - Source: Internet We began our research by consulting online reviews from respected retailers like Amazon, Target and Walmart. User reviews from these sites were used to find out which features are important to consumers, and to determine the leading bean bag chair brands. We also read subreddits such as /r/furniture/, where consumers discussed which bean bag chairs had proved to be good purchases. - Source: Internet Only one of the bean bag chairs we tested specified whether its EPS beads were made from recycled or non-recycled material. The Big Joe – Dorm uses Megahh Beads, which is Big Joe’s proprietary formula. The company claims this material has no recycled components. Our other bean bag chairs did not specify whether their EPS beads were made with recycled or new material. - Source: Internet During the course of our testing, we found that our testers were split on whether they preferred EPS beads or foam filling. If you are not able to test which filling material you prefer, we recommend considering whether you want a lightweight or stationary bean bag chair. Bean bags filled with EPS beads are much easier to move, while foam bean bags stay put like other classic furniture pieces. - Source: Internet This bean bag is safe for small children because it does not use chokable EPS beads and has a secure inner bag of foam. The removable microsuede cover is easy to remove and replace to machine wash. Two of our testers noted a slight musty odor initially. However, this disappeared over a week. Overall, this bean bag chair is a good choice for those with very small children. - Source: Internet The Fugu – 4XL Bean Bag Chair was the largest bean bag chair we tested. We found that after 3-7 days of use this bean bag measured about 6” wider than the advertised four feet. This is because of a breakage of the inner polyester lining that held the foam. - Source: Internet The Big Joe had the firmest structure of all of our bean bags. Our testers appreciated this firmness and rated this bean bag chair as the most comfortable for kids. While the Big Joe is less cuddly than other unstructured bean bags, it offers more support. - Source: Internet There’s a wealth of bean bag options on the market, so it’s well worth knowing the difference before you make your purchase. A classic round bean bag is the most traditional shape and has a distinctly retro vibe, whereas a triangular bean bag is a modern take and gives a more contemporary look in your room. Flatter, circular bean bag cushions are bang on-trend and they’re a good option if you want something that also doubles up as a floor cushion or pouffe. - Source: Internet Top Pick: Lumaland - Luxury Bean Bag Chair This bean bag chair offers quality and comfort for under $200. Its comfortable foam filling and easy to clean microsuede cover push it a cut above the competition. Available in eight different colors, the Lumaland’s large 4-foot diameter makes a perfect adult lounger. See Price at Amazon.com - Source: Internet Thankfully, bean bag chairs are having a moment right one. Mainstream furniture makers have accepted these former kids-only chairs as perfectly acceptable seating for grown adult homes.

We found the two most popular filling materials were polystyrene beads or shredded foam. It was important that our list of finalists contain <strong>bean</strong> bags filled with both types of material, so that we could put the two most popular materials to the test. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Half of the <strong>bean</strong> bags we tested had removable covers which could be washed or switched with ease. This removability is especially important for microsuede or cotton covers, which are best cleaned in the washing machine. Spot cleaning is often adequate for <strong>bean</strong> bag chairs with vinyl or polyester covers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>bean</strong> bag had a good quality cotton cover with tough zippers that locked to ensure EPS beads stayed inside. Because this cover is non-removable, Flash Furniture recommends spot cleaning the chair as needed. This is a pain because of cotton’s tendency to stain and absorb smells. We do not recommend this <strong>bean</strong> bag because it is a pain to clean and needed more filling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Big Joe has double zippers, which securely enclose inner beads. This is important as EPS beads can be choking hazards for small children. The Big Joe’s cover is not removable. The recommended cleaning method for the <strong>bean</strong> bag chair is to spot clean with a mix of water and detergent. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Filling material: All of our <strong>bean</strong> bag finalists were filled with either a type of expandable polystyrene (EPS) bead or shredded foam. EPS is the same material used in disposable coffee cups and packaging peanuts. It is a good material for <strong>bean</strong> bag chairs because it is lightweight and can hold its form for several years. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Multiple testers cited wishing there were more beads inside the Flash Furniture – Oversized Bean Bag Chair. The lack of filling contributed to its just below average ranking for comfort overall. This <strong>bean</strong> bag chair was our only adult <strong>bean</strong> bag that was filled with EPS beads. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While the Sofa Sack’s quality microsuede cover ranked well with our testers, our testers cited disappointment in the chair’s foam filling. Our testers complained that the Sofa Sack’s foam was too hard to snuggle into. Multiple testers noted that the <strong>bean</strong> bag chair was comfortable for laying down flat, but did not offer any back support when sitting in an upright or slightly reclined position. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Straight out of the box, the Lumaland had no musty foam or packaging odor. Like other foam <strong>bean</strong> bag chairs, the Lumaland’s assembly requires foam contained in an inner polyester lining to be broken up and placed in its outer cover. While the foam had already puffed up slightly during shipping, breaking up the rest of the foam was quick and easy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>All of the shredded foam <strong>bean</strong> bags required an inner bag full of foam material to be broken apart and then put inside a cover. This assembly was simple, taking only about five to ten minutes. Foam <strong>bean</strong> bags take three to seven days for the foam to completely expand. During this period we sat, fluffed and flipped over <strong>bean</strong> bags multiple times to ensure foam was completely expanded before comfort testing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>bean</strong> bag showed no signs of wearing or flattening after four weeks of intense use. This <strong>bean</strong> bag’s quality is apparent in its comfortable foam filling and outer microsuede cover. For under $200, the Lumaland is a great option for adults looking for a comfortable classic <strong>bean</strong> bag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Our <strong>bean</strong> bag finalists were cuddled, squished, bounced and kicked during four weeks of rigorous comfort testing by six different testers. Our testers incorporated all eight <strong>bean</strong> bags into their daily life. A comfort questionnaire was completed after the first and fourth week of use, so that any changes in the <strong>bean</strong> bag’s comfort would be noticed. In addition to comfort testing, we also took careful notes on the ease of each <strong>bean</strong> bag’s assembly and how easy it was to wash the cover. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There’s a lot to love about this Loft 25 <strong>bean</strong> bag. For starters, it’s water resistant, so you can use it outdoors as well as inside. That means it’s perfect for lounging on in the garden, and you don’t need to worry about a spilled drink or a drop of rain. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Best Bean Bag Chair for Kids: Big Joe - Dorm This <strong>bean</strong> bag chair offers quality and comfort for under $200. Don’t let the name fool you, this <strong>bean</strong> bag isn’t just meant for dorm rooms. Big Joe’s comfortable structure, durable fabric and lightweight filling make it a versatile, comfortable chair for kids. See Price at Amazon.com - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>bean</strong> bag chair’s best aspect was its tough vinyl cover, which was very easy to spot clean. This vinyl cover did not rank high for aesthetics with our testers, but definitely did the job for durability and stain resistance. This small <strong>bean</strong> bag is also very lightweight, meaning this <strong>bean</strong> bag could easily be moved for indoor and outdoor use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But when it comes to buying a <strong>bean</strong> bag, not all products are created equal. You’ll want to consider whether it’s washable if kids are involved, and it’s worth buying a waterproof or outdoor <strong>bean</strong> bag if you want to use yours in the garden and not worry about a drop of rain. Other factors such as size and weight will come into play, as well as whether your <strong>bean</strong> bag is refillable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Big Joe – Dorm Bean Bag Chair took our top spot for kids because it fits a wide variety of age ranges from small child to teen. This highly structured <strong>bean</strong> bag delivers on back support and is extremely lightweight. It is stain resistant and priced under $50, meaning parents can save more money for the college fund. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Oversized <strong>bean</strong> bags are a great option if you’ve got plenty of room, or want a <strong>bean</strong> bag you can lie down on. Outdoor <strong>bean</strong> bags are often larger for this reason and have the benefit of being waterproof. A <strong>bean</strong> bag chair, meanwhile, has a more structured shape so you can sit upright comfortably, with a certain degree of back support. If that’s a priority, look for an ergonomic <strong>bean</strong> bag designed to encourage good posture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Fugu also had the strongest odor of all of the finalists. The <strong>bean</strong> bag chair reeked of “cardboardy,” musty packaging material. To make matters worse, we were not able to wash the Fugu’s cover in the washing machine because of a leak of foam in the bag’s inner lining. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Comfort is another big factor when it comes to picking your perfect <strong>bean</strong> bag, and that all comes down to what you’ll be using it for. If you’re buying a kids’ <strong>bean</strong> bag, check it’s squashy enough for a toddler to sit comfortably in, or that it has enough back support for a teenager to do some serious gaming in. If you’re buying for yourself, you’ll want to make sure it’s big enough to accommodate a grown-up, with the right amount of support for you. Some people want to sink into a soft, fluffy <strong>bean</strong> bag, while others prefer a more rigid shape – the best way to tell is by testing it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’ve got plenty of space to play with, this supersized Fatboy <strong>bean</strong> bag is as comfy as they come. Regardless of whether you’re sitting or lying on it, it’s big enough to wrap around your body and provide lots of support. It ‘s great for relaxing in the home or out in the garden. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Compared to a regular ol&rsquo; seat, there&rsquo;s just something about a <strong>bean</strong> bag chair that hits different. Ya feel? Not only is it a sack of pure happiness that conforms to your body, but a <strong>bean</strong> bag also serves as a fun and affordable piece of furniture that can really jazz up your space. If you&rsquo;ve been playing with the idea of getting one for your home, then this is your sign to go for it. And since we&rsquo;re here already, defff look through all the best <strong>bean</strong> bag chairs we&rsquo;ve gathered up here. You and your peach deserve a comfy floof to relax on! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The EPS <strong>bean</strong> bags did not have removable covers. Instead these brands recommended that the bags be spot cleaned as needed. We found that the ECR4Kids – Classic and Big Joe – Dorm models were exceptionally easy to spot clean because of their resilient vinyl and polyester covers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s small enough to tuck into the corner of a bedroom, and squashy enough to mould around them and create a little <strong>bean</strong> bag chair for reading or playing. It’s also super light – 1.4kg – so they can pick it up and move it around independently. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Top Pick: Lumaland - Luxury Bean Bag Chair The Lumaland is our most comfortable <strong>bean</strong> bag chair with quality foam filling and microsuede cover. Its cover is machine washable and easy to assemble. This <strong>bean</strong> bag provides high quality for under $200. See Price at Amazon.com - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>During week one and week four of comfort testing, testers answered questions regarding neck and back comfort, how easy getting in and out of the chair was, presence of any off-gassing odor and overall quality of the <strong>bean</strong> bag. The testing revealed no significant changes to any of the <strong>bean</strong> bags’ comfort over the course of four weeks. The most significant difference noted by our testers was the dissipation of initial chemical odors from packaging. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Seriously, there&rsquo;s a <strong>bean</strong> bag chair for every type of need. So, go on and shop our picks. We&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;ll find one that speaks to you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At 40 inches wide, this <strong>bean</strong> bag comfortably fits one adult. It arrived already at its full size, and no assembly was required. It also had no off-gassing odor straight out of the box. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>No. When you’re choosing a <strong>bean</strong> bag, it’s worth paying close attention to the cover. Many <strong>bean</strong> bags have a separate internal bag that keeps all the tiny balls contained, which means you can take the cover off if needed, and – if it’s machine-washable – pop it in the washing machine. Others are wipe-clean only, particularly if they’re made from a plush fabric like velvet or sheepskin, which is far less practical where kids and pets are concerned. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Half of the <strong>bean</strong> bags we tested had removable covers that we washed in a washing machine. We found that the Lumaland – Luxury’s cover was exceptionally easy to remove and put back on because of the quality zipper design. Chill Sack – 2-Foot Round and Cozy Sack were not far behind; both <strong>bean</strong> bag covers were easy to remove and put back on. As previously noted, we were unable to remove the Fugu’s cover because of a breakage in its inner lining. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>EPS is not biodegradable, but EPS beads may be recycled. Bean bags that use recycled EPS beads have a shorter lifespan than those that use non-recycled EPS beads. Unfortunately, this means that consumers who want to “go green” and use recycled EPS beads may end up having to refill their <strong>bean</strong> bags sooner than those who opt for non-recycled EPS beads. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Why it’s great: This <strong>bean</strong> bag has options for the whole family! It comes in a kids’ size all the way up to a six-foot ultimate sack and in 24 different color options, so there’s something for everyone. You can also choose between suede or fur for the cover. The outer cover is machine washable for added convenience. The inside is stuffed with high-quality memory foam for comfort and flexibility, and it has an inner cover to keep it all together while you wash the outer one. The cover has a durable zipper with a safety lock, so you don’t have to worry about your child trying to take it apart. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Our testers complained that the ECR4Kids – Classic Bean Bag Chair needed more of its EPS bead filling material. This <strong>bean</strong> bag chair also had a tendency to fill up with air, and then decompress when sat on. At 35” wide, this <strong>bean</strong> bag is best suited for kids 12 years old and under. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some <strong>bean</strong> bag covers are made from a waterproof material, or have a water-resistant coating, which is ideal if you plan to use your <strong>bean</strong> bag outside in the garden or on a balcony – or even if you just want to guard against splashes and spills. Be mindful of the difference, though, as while a waterproof <strong>bean</strong> bag can be left outside in the rain, a water-resistant <strong>bean</strong> bag may not stand up to a full downpour. Check if your <strong>bean</strong> bag is suitable for outdoor use when you buy it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>bean</strong> bag chairs filled with EPS beads did not require assembly. However, the majority of our testers noted that the ECR4Kids – Classic felt like it needed more beads than it came with. If you find your <strong>bean</strong> bag chair a bit “deflated,” additional EPS beads can be purchased online and added to your <strong>bean</strong> bags at home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>bean</strong> bag had a slight chemically smell that dissipated over time. The outer cover is not removable and is hard to spot clean because the polyester material absorbs liquids and odors. At 32” wide this <strong>bean</strong> bag is a good size for kids 12 years old and younger, but does not deliver on quality and comfort. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We spent four weeks rigorously chilling, cuddling and sleeping on eight of the top-selling <strong>bean</strong> bag chairs on the market. We tested durability, washed the covers and researched safety of filling materials and in the end, found the Lumaland – Luxury Bean Bag Chair to be the best <strong>bean</strong> bag chair. Lumaland stood out because of its shredded foam filling and quality microsuede cover. All our testers loved this bag’s back support and how easy it was to change the cover making machine washing a breeze. For a kid-sized <strong>bean</strong> bag, we found Big Joe – Dorm Bean Bag Chair stood out from the competition because of its comfort, easy-to-clean cover and lightweight design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Lumaland – Luxury Bean Bag Chair ranked highest for comfort with all but one of our testers, plus it has an easy-to-remove cover and no odor. Our testers loved Lumaland’s shredded foam filling and microsuede cover. This <strong>bean</strong> bag’s price tag is under $200, meaning you can get a quality <strong>bean</strong> bag without breaking the bank. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This massive <strong>bean</strong> bag chair was rated as above average for comfort overall by our testers. However, this <strong>bean</strong> bag did not rate as comfortable as the Lumaland because of irregular chunks of unbroken foam inside. Though this was technically our fault, the foam inside this <strong>bean</strong> bag was very hard to break apart during assembly. Our testers detected foam chunks even after four weeks of intense use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you use your <strong>bean</strong> bag a lot, it’s likely that it will lose shape over time and may need to be topped up with balls. Most <strong>bean</strong> bags come with a zip that allows you to do this, and some companies sell the balls separately as top-ups or full refills. Check to see if your <strong>bean</strong> bag has an opening and if you need to buy the internal bag separately. If you already have <strong>bean</strong> bag balls going spare, or find some on a cheap deal, you can look for a <strong>bean</strong> bag cover without any filling – this may save you a few quid. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Because the Fugu’s foam had broken through its inner lining, we contacted the seller for a refund. We did not get a response, but a few days later we received a new <strong>bean</strong> bag. Fugu’s confusing return process and quality issues were a pain. Therefore, we recommend either opting for the similarly priced Sofa Sack – 5-Foot Round, or paying around $50 more for the superior Lumaland – Luxury Bean Bag Chair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Big Joe is filled with Megahh Beads, the company’s own proprietary polystyrene bead, which our testers found comfortable. Unlike with other kids’ <strong>bean</strong> bags, our testers did not want more or less beads inside. However, as noted earlier, polystyrene beads lose their structure over the course of years and need to be replaced. Additional Megahh Beads, which are fully recyclable, can be purchased for under $20. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Shredded foam is also popular as <strong>bean</strong> bag chair filling because of its high density and comfort. This is a heavier material that often requires the consumer to break apart large foam pieces by massaging the foam within a cover. If the foam is not broken up enough, irregular-shaped foam chunks can be uncomfortable when sitting. However, when broken in correctly, this material provides a high degree of comfort. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Because of its five foot diameter and foam filling, this <strong>bean</strong> bag is very difficult to move. While its cover has the quality of a good piece of furniture, its inner foam is lacking in comfort. The price difference between the Sofa Sack and Lumaland – Luxury is under $50, so if possible we recommend springing for the more comfortable Lumaland. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>At the end of week one and week four, each <strong>bean</strong> bag’s widest and tallest dimensions were taken. We gathered this information to see if the <strong>bean</strong> bags would lose their structure or flatten out after intense use. Encouragingly, none of our <strong>bean</strong> bag finalists’ dimensions changed significantly. However, EPS beads usually lose their structure over the course of the first five years, so if you buy this type of <strong>bean</strong> bag you may need to purchase bead refills at a later point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>bean</strong> bag chair was also the easiest to move because it is lightweight and has a built-in handle. This <strong>bean</strong> bag chair is only about four pounds, meaning that even a child could move it. The <strong>bean</strong> bag’s tough nylon-polyester blend fabric is waterproof, stain resistant and durable. This means the Big Joe could be easily taken and used outdoors. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Lumaland is four feet wide, a size our testers found to be comfortable for one adult. It is also available in three foot and five foot diameters. Our testers ranked the Lumaland as one of the easiest <strong>bean</strong> bags to get out of due to its taller height at around 28 inches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Believe it or not, <strong>bean</strong> bag chairs aren&rsquo;t just for first-time apartment dwellers or college kids who can&rsquo;t afford takeout, much less a brand-new sofa (though ofc, <strong>bean</strong> bags are smaller and more affordable than a fancy armchair). From binge-watching bad television to playing too many video games, <strong>bean</strong> bags are perfect for all your lounging needs, and investing in the right one can be a T-O-T-A-L game-changer. Below, you&rsquo;ll find various styles of loungers—we&rsquo;re talking small, large, long, memory foam, and even reclining styles, as well as tons of different fabric options, from faux leather to faux fur. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We began our research by consulting online reviews from respected retailers like Amazon, Target and Walmart. User reviews from these sites were used to find out which features are important to consumers, and to determine the leading <strong>bean</strong> bag chair brands. We also read subreddits such as /r/furniture/, where consumers discussed which <strong>bean</strong> bag chairs had proved to be good purchases. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Only one of the <strong>bean</strong> bag chairs we tested specified whether its EPS beads were made from recycled or non-recycled material. The Big Joe – Dorm uses Megahh Beads, which is Big Joe’s proprietary formula. The company claims this material has no recycled components. Our other <strong>bean</strong> bag chairs did not specify whether their EPS beads were made with recycled or new material. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>During the course of our testing, we found that our testers were split on whether they preferred EPS beads or foam filling. If you are not able to test which filling material you prefer, we recommend considering whether you want a lightweight or stationary <strong>bean</strong> bag chair. Bean bags filled with EPS beads are much easier to move, while foam <strong>bean</strong> bags stay put like other classic furniture pieces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>bean</strong> bag is safe for small children because it does not use chokable EPS beads and has a secure inner bag of foam. The removable microsuede cover is easy to remove and replace to machine wash. Two of our testers noted a slight musty odor initially. However, this disappeared over a week. Overall, this <strong>bean</strong> bag chair is a good choice for those with very small children. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Fugu – 4XL Bean Bag Chair was the largest <strong>bean</strong> bag chair we tested. We found that after 3-7 days of use this <strong>bean</strong> bag measured about 6” wider than the advertised four feet. This is because of a breakage of the inner polyester lining that held the foam. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Big Joe had the firmest structure of all of our <strong>bean</strong> bags. Our testers appreciated this firmness and rated this <strong>bean</strong> bag chair as the most comfortable for kids. While the Big Joe is less cuddly than other unstructured <strong>bean</strong> bags, it offers more support. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There’s a wealth of <strong>bean</strong> bag options on the market, so it’s well worth knowing the difference before you make your purchase. A classic round <strong>bean</strong> bag is the most traditional shape and has a distinctly retro vibe, whereas a triangular <strong>bean</strong> bag is a modern take and gives a more contemporary look in your room. Flatter, circular <strong>bean</strong> bag cushions are bang on-trend and they’re a good option if you want something that also doubles up as a floor cushion or pouffe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Top Pick: Lumaland - Luxury Bean Bag Chair This <strong>bean</strong> bag chair offers quality and comfort for under $200. Its comfortable foam filling and easy to clean microsuede cover push it a cut above the competition. Available in eight different colors, the Lumaland&rsquo;s large 4-foot diameter makes a perfect adult lounger. See Price at Amazon.com - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Thankfully, <strong>bean</strong> bag chairs are having a moment right one. Mainstream furniture makers have accepted these former kids-only chairs as perfectly acceptable seating for grown adult homes. When design-savvy brands like Architectural Digest and Pottery Barn are getting in on the action, you know they’ve officially become cool again. If you’re in the market for a legit <strong>bean</strong>bag chair—the GOAT of comfortable home seating—read on.
