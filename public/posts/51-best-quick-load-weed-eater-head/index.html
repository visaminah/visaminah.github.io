Product build quality, cutting performance, and additional features such as Edger function, are key benefits identified within the comparison. - Source: Internet We like how the pre-cut line strips are retained by a convenient method so that you don’t need to open the head each time. This, in turn, helps save a lot of time and keeps you free from the frustration of managing the spools. Since setting up the trimmer head is relatively quick and easy, it won’t create a lot of trouble for first-timers. - Source: Internet While people with straightforward yard work needs probably don’t need them, they can be beneficial for avid landscapers. But my recommendation is not to worry about this multi-functional type of weed eater, as the lightweight products are just not powerful enough to get value from this type of feature. It is really intended for high-powered brush cutters. - Source: Internet But you may have to witness that soon if you’re still working with an inefficient trimmer head. So, do away with it and get a truly effective and durable unit for your trimmer instead.

The QuickLoad cutting head also features “bump” line feed technology for continuous trimming and edging operation. - Source: Internet Weed eaters use plastic or composite string-like cutting lines.

There is always a trade-off. A battery has a limited run-time, and a corded weed eater has a limited distance of travel due to being tethered to a power outlet. - Source: Internet Battery voltage refers to the amount of power it has to drive the motor of the weed eater. Most cordless string trimmers run on 20v batteries, while others use as high as 60V.

Check the Worx GT 3.0 latest price here. - Source: Internet The great thing with an automatic feed weed eater is that instead of focusing on the length of the string, you can pay attention to where the grass ends and the prize daffodils begin. Since you don’t have to pause to tap the head on the ground, you can finish trimming faster, leaving more time to dig out the lawn edger (opens in new tab) and fire up the lawn mower (opens in new tab) to give your garden the complete works. Automatic feed string trimmers are more prevalent in stores than bump feed trimmers, so shopping for one will be a breeze as well. - Source: Internet Traditionally, a lawn edger is an entirely separate garden power tool from a weed eater. However, many modern designs combine the two functions. Making them a great choice if you’re looking for versatility and value. - Source: Internet With a bump feed weed eater, when you press the head of your trimmer against a flat surface, it squeezes a spring in the head of the string trimmer. This action releases string from the spool so you have a line with which you can cut down debris. The bump feed electric trimmer uses centrifugal force to pull the string from the spool. - Source: Internet However, there is one huge advantage to a battery-weed eater, unrestricted mobility. You can weave around your yard without getting in a tangle. In fact, you can throw your weed eater in your vehicle and take it anywhere you need to use it. - Source: Internet In most cases, battery-powered string trimmers can run under nickel-cadmium or lithium-ion batteries. The latter has a higher power holding capacity than the nickel-cadmium batteries. That implies that the weed eaters bearing lithium-ion batteries are the best buy. However, the high quality comes at a price. - Source: Internet Whether you decide to go with the automatic feed or bump feed electric weed eater essentially comes down to your personal preference. For a less attentive weed trimming experience, the automatic feed option is ideal, but will likely cost more and could break. If you’re happy to bump your way along the garden, it will be the cheaper option, but wear and tear could eventually prove a problem. - Source: Internet But I can keep this section short. If our goal is to find a lightweight weed eater for residential use, then we can skip over gas-powered machines and stock with electric technology. It easier to maintain, quieter, cleaner, and of course lighter. - Source: Internet The aim of this test is to find the best lightweight weed eater and weighing in at 8.0lbs this is very light, but not the lightest product under review. However, I really like the feel and quality of this trimmer and have no hesitation in recommending it for light domestic work. - Source: Internet This model is battery-powered to provide more mobility and flexibility. It includes an ergonomic telescoping pole, which allows you to turn the head for a closer, more accurate cut. This lets you do even the most delicate work without hitting bushes or flowers. - Source: Internet In case of taking care of a smaller garden, a smaller trimmer head capable of light to medium trimming tasks will be sufficient. But for bigger lawns and gardens, you will need larger units capable of handling heavy-duty trimming work. Note that the size of the trimmer head can be determined by its diameter. - Source: Internet The Dalom Speed Feed 400 Trimmer Head is also a good option to go for if you are searching for an efficient universal trimmer head.

It is really intended for high-powered brush cutters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But you may have to witness that soon if you’re still working with an inefficient trimmer <strong>head</strong>.

Fixing the motor on the automatic feed may be more difficult and expensive than it would be to replace the whole unit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One drawback of electric corded weed <strong>eater</strong>s is the lack of moveability compared to battery-powered designs. There is always a trade-off. A battery has a limited run-time, and a corded weed <strong>eater</strong> has a limited distance of travel due to being tethered to a power outlet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Battery voltage refers to the amount of power it has to drive the motor of the weed <strong>eater</strong>.

However, the high quality comes at a price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Whether you decide to go with the automatic feed or bump feed electric weed <strong>eater</strong> essentially comes down to your personal preference.
