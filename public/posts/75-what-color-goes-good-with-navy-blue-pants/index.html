The Navy Blue Shirt will help you look professional and put together. The perfect fit and a great color make this a must-have. - Source: Internet Although blue and gray is usually a conservative combination, one of the boldest things you can do for your overall outfit is to wear these colors as footwear. Dark navy Oxfords are the best choice with a suit since they resemble a standard black business shoe with just a hint of added color, but they are difficult to find. Those with dandy impulses and in a less conservative environment could go with brighter blues, such as a blue wholecut Oxford or monk strap, paired with a light gray suit. - Source: Internet And finally I need to warn you: don’t try to mix navy blue color trousers with a lot of black, dark purple or dark blue things.

After all, navy is a neutral tone, which means that it matches most <strong>color</strong> palettes. Some <strong>color</strong>ed shoes go better with navy than others, though. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In general, light <strong>color</strong>ed dress pants and light <strong>color</strong>ed dress shoes are more casual while darker pants and darker shoes are more formal. With this in mind, light shades of brown shoes with <strong>blue</strong> dress pants can be paired with more <strong>color</strong>ful socks for a sharp casual look. Alternatively, wear darker shades of brown shoes with <strong>blue</strong> dress pants for a more professional look. When choosing accompanying socks, opt for more reserved shades of grey, navy and black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Don’t be afraid to try prints. An everyday <strong>blue</strong> denim pant perfectly complements prints such as stripes and checks dress shirts. Wear different <strong>color</strong>s that match or contrast the dark <strong>blue</strong> tone of the jeans, and finish the look with dark brown loafers or slip-ons. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Navy <strong>blue</strong> and blush pink are the classic hues to choose for the most sophisticated, grown-up look. The shades just work so well to balance each other out.

These <strong>color</strong>s look amazing with a pair of navy <strong>blue</strong> pants and will actually pop out even more with them on. Pastel-<strong>color</strong>ed shirts can be anything like pink, lavender, peach, yellows, and more! Also, because of their fun <strong>color</strong>s, you don’t have to do much with your outfit as the top will give your outfit the stylish look it needs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The rule of thumb in menswear is to match your socks with your dress pants, although they don’t have to exactly match. Instead of focusing on finding the identical <strong>color</strong> of socks as your pants, opt for sock <strong>color</strong>s that complement your <strong>blue</strong> dress pants. This will break up any monotony in your outfit while still creating a smooth, tasteful transition down to your shoes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Royal <strong>blue</strong> is a bright and cheery <strong>color</strong>; it is very modern and flattering for most people. These suits fall in the middle range of formality. Royal <strong>blue</strong> is suitable for weddings, casual office settings, and cocktail parties. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Beyond avoiding sharp contrast, try adding complexity and interest to your <strong>blue</strong> and gray combinations by introducing textures and patterns. Sure, you can start simply with a white shirt, solid tie, and a plain worsted wool suit, but this gets boring fast. An easy way to add a pattern while remaining classic is to use a gray glen check tie in silk (or wool for winter) with a navy suit. For a gray suit, get a navy grenadine tie in either a large or fine weave (garza grossa or garza fina) to inject texture. In the reverse scenario, pick up a silver grenadine for a <strong>blue</strong> suit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When in doubt, white and cream are a classic pair with navy <strong>blue</strong> dresses or pants. White and cream will pop against the dark <strong>blue</strong> and accentuate the <strong>color</strong>ful side of navy. Sometimes, navy can look so dark that it is mistaken for black. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fall is almost here, so it’s the right time to prepare for this season. If you wanna create chic and elegant looks, then this theme of an article will be perfect for you. Today we’ll talk about navy <strong>blue</strong> pants, I think that this piece of clothes is one of the basic ones for anybody’s wardrobe. So if you haven’t them yet, choose and buy them urgently. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>They are the perfect addition to any wardrobe for any occasion. The pants are soft and durable, the shirt is breathable and stylish, and the tie will add a splash of <strong>color</strong> to any outfit. The pants are also easy to care for and are a great buy for the price. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>color</strong> wheel already tells us this is a combination that&rsquo;s meant to work. Complementary <strong>color</strong>s sit opposite each other so orange was made to pair with <strong>blue</strong>, the warmth balancing out the cool of the navy. And it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a dramatic high-contrasting scheme (although we do love how tangerines really zing against navy), a deep rusty orange looks beautiful against the moodier tones of a dark <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sky <strong>blue</strong> is a very summery <strong>color</strong>. It’s the most casual shade of <strong>blue</strong> you can wear and has a super relaxed vibe. It’s an excellent <strong>color</strong> for warm weather weddings or outdoor parties. However, sky <strong>blue</strong> is best worn for daytime events. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To channel your inner feminine energy, peach brings a soft, ladylike vibe to a navy <strong>blue</strong> dress. Peach tones not only brighten up a navy <strong>blue</strong> dress or pants but also contrast the <strong>blue</strong> shades with a rosy tone. The fresh feel of peach livens up the more muted, somber look of navy <strong>blue</strong>. Similar shades of orange-tinged pink such as coral also match well with navy <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue on <strong>blue</strong> might sound bland, but going all over with a single <strong>color</strong> always has a surprisingly striking effect. Trying pairing navy <strong>blue</strong> furniture, whether that be a sofa or a headboard, with slightly lighter rich <strong>blue</strong> walls for a calming and cocooning look. Add some much-needed warmth with gold accents as can be seen here with the mirror and the lighting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We couldn&rsquo;t not have a crisp white right up there as one of the best <strong>color</strong>s to pair with navy. It&rsquo;s the oldest, most tried combination and we will never tire of it. Classic, clean, and crisp it&rsquo;s a mix that lends itself to any room and any style, but it works particularly well in kitchens for a look that&rsquo;s bold and yet timeless. Consider opting for a two-tone look, mixing dark navy cabinets with a true white island. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sometimes we are clueless and it is quite hard to make a decision. No worries, there are an immense number of ways to come up with a solution. You should always look closely on your skin tone and then head up to stylize the <strong>color</strong>s of your outfit . While being creative is important, you also need to determine the time of the day for instance during day time women can opt for light yellow shirts or peach hued ones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Printed silk ties with <strong>blue</strong> and gray geometric patterns or knit ties with both <strong>color</strong>s in them are likewise excellent options. I especially like the versatility of striped ties with either a repp pattern or large block stripes for this purpose. If you get a tie with stripes of both <strong>color</strong>s you can wear them easily with either gray or <strong>blue</strong> suits. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>White or gray t-shirt. Navy <strong>blue</strong> sweatshirt. Light pale <strong>color</strong> button-down shirt. Mandarin style jersey. And turtleneck with a sports coat. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This outfit is perfect for the office or any other casual event. The navy <strong>blue</strong> shirt is a great match for the white pants and can be worn to work or with a pair of sandals on the weekend. The shirt is also a good way to show off your style with a unique pattern. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>No one will tell you that it’s easy to find a comfortable and stylish pair of brown pants. The secret is to find the right fit for your body type. These brown pants with navy <strong>blue</strong> shirt have a slim fit that make them the perfect choice for anyone who wants to feel good in their clothes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As illustrated in the graphic above, <strong>blue</strong> dress pants can be worn with a diverse range of sock <strong>color</strong>s. For a more traditional look, try navy, black or grey dress socks with your <strong>blue</strong> pants. To add a splash of <strong>color</strong>, orange, light <strong>blue</strong> and red dress socks will all look fantastic with <strong>blue</strong> dress pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Depending on the shade of your <strong>blue</strong> suit, black dress socks can be a stark contrast against the trousers. The <strong>blue</strong> you choose is completely up to you; go for a lighter shade if you’d like something a little more casual, or perhaps a royal <strong>blue</strong> if you’re looking to really make a statement. Whatever you decide, coordinating black socks with <strong>blue</strong> dress pants is an almost fool-proof way to assemble a classy, stylish outfit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Navy <strong>blue</strong> is also a favorite choice among the stars. Last Monday, the renowned actress Miranda Kerr was spotted wearing a white pant with a white shirt and teaming it up with a navy <strong>blue</strong> shrug at the airport in Korea. She totally nailed the look styling the attire up with black sun shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Whether I am planning an outfit around a navy-<strong>color</strong>ed dress or navy-<strong>color</strong>ed pants, I always feel classy and elevated in a navy look. The nautical hues indicate a level of refinement and restraint, no matter what style of clothes you are wearing. I love wearing navy in all seasons–it’s truly a timeless <strong>color</strong> that will never go out of style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Lilac and lavender have been gaining quite a bit of traction recently, with trend forecasters predicted it&rsquo;s likely to be the <strong>color</strong> of the year 2023. It&rsquo;s a very calming hue, that much like pink does need something darker to ground it and give it a less saccharine quality. Hence why it works so well with navy <strong>blue</strong>. It has the same cool undertones but adds a softness to the darker shade and you can find lilac shades that are so subtle, they almost just act like a neutral. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The same techniques mentioned above can be used when wearing sports coat and trouser combinations, though some men may be put off by the perceived difficulties of coordinating an additional article of clothing: pants in a different shade. If you begin with <strong>blue</strong> and gray, this is actually a piece of cake. Like the navy suit, the navy blazer is a staple, foundational item of menswear. Technically, a solid blazer has to be <strong>blue</strong>, so begin there and add gray pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The easiest way to coordinate <strong>blue</strong> and gray is to match the two in a suit and tie combination. It’s commonly said that when a man first ventures into the world of tailored clothing–or into the working world that demands such a dress code–he should begin with a navy <strong>blue</strong> suit. Using a gray tie with this navy suit is a surefire way to earn style points. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Accessories, including gloves, hats, and scarves, are another great way to use these two <strong>color</strong>s, and, again, you have two broad options. If you have a gray coat on, you could go monochromatic and select elegant gray cashmere-lined peccary gloves to match tones. Alternatively, go with a contrast and choose a pair of bold petrol <strong>blue</strong> leather gloves in lamb nappa leather. With a scarf, you may be able to “kill two birds with one stone” by purchasing a double-sided version, like this dark <strong>blue</strong> and gray one in alpaca from Fort Belvedere, which lets you contrast or blend with a flip of the cloth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A bright orange shirt can be worn with navy <strong>blue</strong> pants. The contrast between the two <strong>color</strong>s is striking and looks great on any man or woman. You can wear it with confidence as it will definitely make you stand out from the crowd. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Like all dark <strong>color</strong>s, navy <strong>blue</strong> is the perfect backdrop for making bright bold hues really pop. A sunny mustard yellow stands out so vividly against navy <strong>blue</strong> walls even just a splash of it becomes the focal point in a room. It&rsquo;s also a lovely shade for warming up a navy <strong>blue</strong> <strong>color</strong> scheme as this steely <strong>blue</strong> living room demonstrates – the dark walls and cool grey sofa need that accent of something warmer to make this space feel more inviting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The second suit a man should own when starting a business wardrobe is a gray one, but here the recommendations vary between a mid-gray and a charcoal. In either case, you simply take the opposite approach as your first suit and coordinate with a <strong>blue</strong> tie. The entire range of gray presents a neutral backdrop for any mid – to navy <strong>blue</strong> tie to work. And, the fact that both <strong>blue</strong> and gray are cool <strong>color</strong>s ensures they will pair naturally. Even if your gray suit contains warmer brown tones, you’ll have no issues because <strong>blue</strong> also combines perfectly with brown. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Are you looking for a pant to match your navy <strong>blue</strong> shirt? A navy <strong>blue</strong> shirt is a good option because it goes with different <strong>color</strong> pants/jeans/cargos to pair with it. But there are some simple guidelines to follow. First, a black belt will work with a navy <strong>blue</strong> shirt, as will a navy <strong>blue</strong> belt. A pair of khaki pants is a good option for a more casual look. For a more formal outfit, a pair of dark grey or black slacks would work well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A. White baggy button-down shirts and oversize t-shirts look wonderful with thin <strong>blue</strong> jeans. You can even go with an ash gray V-neck sweatshirt with a thin white tee underneath for a catchier look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Today, I’m trying to exemplify many of the concepts we discussed. Most of my outfit elements have <strong>blue</strong> and gray in them; the largest of these would be my <strong>blue</strong> jacket and gray trousers. The jacket is a bit lighter than a standard navy, probably in something more like a medium to even a royal <strong>blue</strong>. It’s plain in <strong>color</strong> to ground the trousers which have a bit more texture in their weave. As mentioned previously, my shirt features a micro check pattern in light <strong>blue</strong> and dark gray, perhaps even almost black, but everything is working harmoniously within the <strong>color</strong> pairing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With a fitted waist and wide leg, these pants are a comfortable and stylish option for both men and women. Pair them with a button-down shirt for a day at the office or wear them with a button-down shirt and blazer for a more formal occasion. The Navy Blue Shirt will help you look professional and put together. The perfect fit and a great <strong>color</strong> make this a must-have. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although <strong>blue</strong> and gray is usually a conservative combination, one of the boldest things you can do for your overall outfit is to wear these <strong>color</strong>s as footwear. Dark navy Oxfords are the best choice with a suit since they resemble a standard black business shoe with just a hint of added <strong>color</strong>, but they are difficult to find. Those with dandy impulses and in a less conservative environment could go with brighter <strong>blue</strong>s, such as a <strong>blue</strong> wholecut Oxford or monk strap, paired with a light gray suit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>And finally I need to warn you: don’t try to mix navy <strong>blue</strong> <strong>color</strong> trousers with a lot of black, dark purple or dark <strong>blue</strong> things. Now look below and find more cool ideas that you can repeat. Get inspired and enjoy! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Patterned or creatively <strong>color</strong>ed shirts do not work well with navy <strong>blue</strong> pants. Also, make it a hard and fast rule not to pair navy <strong>blue</strong> with black ever.This is because dark <strong>color</strong>s block out each other. Navy <strong>blue</strong> pants can also be teamed up with the right pair of shoes and accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A. Brown, white, gray, and black look great with <strong>blue</strong> jeans. If you want to add a little more chic to your outfit, look for brown suede shoes with a white sole. It will bump up your style even more! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The modern gentleman can now look as stylish as ever with these Denim Jeans with Navy Blue Shirt. Looking for a professional, yet casual outfit? They are the perfect shade of <strong>blue</strong> to match with a navy <strong>blue</strong> shirt. This outfit is a classic combination that will never go out of style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;As long as you carefully pair the right tones, this <strong>color</strong> combination can be an unexpected, yet striking pairing. By using the same tonal <strong>color</strong> group, the two hues will complement one another.&rsquo; explains Helen Shaw, UK Director at Benjamin Moore (opens in new tab). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Socks are also a terrific option to coordinate <strong>blue</strong> and gray. As a rule, begin with the principle of matching socks to your pants, not your shoes. You can show some panache by wearing socks that contain the complementary <strong>color</strong> to your pants (for example, <strong>blue</strong> socks with gray trousers ) or, better yet, socks that contain both <strong>color</strong>s, like a light <strong>blue</strong> and light gray shadow stripe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although pairing a gray tie with a <strong>blue</strong> suit and vice versa is nearly foolproof, there are some ways for you to make the most of this combination. For one thing, avoid too strong a contrast between the two <strong>color</strong>s, which is the general rule for any <strong>color</strong> coordination. So, if your suit is dark gray, avoid a really pale <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A french tuck is when you tuck only half of your shirt usually just the front of it. This idea helps your look be stylish and professional too, especially if you have a long-length blouse on top. Another way of wearing it is by putting on a navy <strong>blue</strong> or black cardigan on top of the blouse as well as the pants. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Though the Gentleman’s Gazette focuses on classic style, we’d be remiss not to mention the most popular article of casual clothing and probably the most popular <strong>blue</strong> fabric worn throughout the world–denim. We don’t specifically think of wearing gray with denim, but maybe we should take this page out of the classic menswear book and apply it to casual wear too. Blue jeans can easily be paired with a gray sports coat, provided the jeans are not overly distressed and the jacket casual enough, like something in an unstructured cotton or with sufficient texture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A. Blue is considered a basic <strong>color</strong> in jeans. Therefore you can pair anything with it, from casual tees to a crisp white shirt. A mandarin collar shirt will also look stunning with <strong>blue</strong> jeans if you have a broad neck and wide shoulders. You can even try several <strong>color</strong>s and styles ranging from white, black, and brown to sneakers and leather boots in shoes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A fun and easy way to make certain the <strong>color</strong> combinations for any occasion is to switch and practice clothes at the comfort of your home. You can keep on trying various combinations until you get the best and perfect look. Your best neutral is often close to your hair <strong>color</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Women everywhere have been enjoying working from home because it’s comfortable and easier. Working from home has many benefits, one being that you can work and not worry about what to wear that day. For those who still are required to work in person, you find yourself having to pick out new outfits daily. Well, luckily with the right paint of navy <strong>blue</strong> pants you can come up with different looks to change it up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A. Angel Jackets is a greatly reviewed website with a great collection of sweatshirts, t-shirts, and flannels that you can buy at an amazingly affordable price. These shirts are the durable fabric that retains <strong>color</strong> despite several washes and feels comfy to the body. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For a more neutral, dressed-down version of the classic gold-and-navy <strong>color</strong> combination, yellow shoes match wonderfully with a navy <strong>blue</strong> dress or navy <strong>blue</strong> pants. Mustard yellow in particular looks great against a backdrop of navy <strong>blue</strong>. The earthy tones in mustard yellow play off of the muted hue of navy <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Maybe it&rsquo;s the neon yellow sweater you scored for pennies before an &rsquo;80s-themed party but secretly want to wear again, or maybe you own a zebra-print sweater that you&rsquo;ve never figured out how to dress up enough to wear to the office. Whatever bold or even slightly wacky sweater is gathering dust in the back of the closet, it will probably look right with navy pants. Navy pants have a tendency to dress up any look, so a sweater that you would otherwise choose to wear only as a jeans companions may be elevated into dressiness worn over navy. And bright shades of red and pink you couldn&rsquo;t bring yourself to place next to stark black can blend well when they find a home next to dark <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Navy is the most conservative shade of <strong>blue</strong>. And because it is the closest <strong>color</strong> to black, it is also the most formal. Therefore, navy suits are excellent for professional offices, weddings, and any semi-formal event. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The opposite move–a gray sports coat with navy trousers–is rarer, maybe because it is generally more difficult to pull off a lighter jacket with darker pants. However, there’s no reason to be dissuaded, as long as your <strong>blue</strong> pants don’t look like the bottom half of a suit. Here, a pattern can be your friend and using a gray sports coat that contains a pattern, again the classic glen check or Prince of Wales, will enhance your chances of success. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In all these styles, you must have noticed one thing in common: the combination of brown shoes with <strong>blue</strong> jeans. It’s because these <strong>color</strong>s compliment each other so well. Take this style to the next level by adding a timeless brown leather jacket. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>‘When bringing navy into the home I suggest mixing it with soft natural shades, such as Farrow & Ball’s Skimming Stone, with its clay-like hue, this is the perfect natural <strong>color</strong> to make navy pop. With dusty <strong>blue</strong>s set to be big in 2022, bring in on-trend touches of pale <strong>blue</strong> to harmonize the room, creating a serene and tranquil living space where navy stands proud.’ explains interior designer Juliette Thomas (opens in new tab). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The most sophisticated method to combine gray and <strong>blue</strong> with a suit and tie, however, is to choose items that contain both <strong>color</strong>s together. For example, you can wear a navy suit with a gray windowpane pattern. By definition, Prince of Wales suiting fabric differs from a glen check because it contains an overcheck in an additional <strong>color</strong>, and a common version of this is a gray base pattern with the addition of a <strong>blue</strong> overcheck, giving you both in one shot. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now let’s find out with what pieces of clothes and what <strong>color</strong>s navy <strong>blue</strong> pants will ideally match. Of course, white shirt and navy trousers will be great clothes combination, so you can pair classic button down shirt (it can be printed one, for example, with stripes) with navy <strong>blue</strong> pants, neutral shoes and big bag for the traditional office looks (you can also add a jacket in the same <strong>color</strong> palette). You can also change simple white shirt to any pastel <strong>color</strong> ones and boldly add some printed shoes to create a funny and more interesting look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;There are plenty of complementary <strong>color</strong> options to choose from when it comes to navy. To create a contrast, look at <strong>color</strong>s such as browns, reds and oranges. Orange sits just next to yellow on the <strong>color</strong> wheel and works particularly well with navy as the bright tones of the orange make the dark <strong>blue</strong> appear even deeper.&rsquo; says the designer and head of creative at Swyft (opens in new tab), Kelly Collins. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Both being jewel-like tones, navy <strong>blue</strong> and deep rich purples are a sumptuous combination that would be perfect if you want to create a cozy but sophisticated living room or bedroom. Experiment with a deep aubergine on the walls and combine it with a statement piece of navy <strong>blue</strong> velvet furniture for a pairing that&rsquo;s moody and dramatic but also so elegant and timeless. Add in some golden accents for extra glamour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can never go wrong with a classic look. These gray pants with navy <strong>blue</strong> shirt are perfect for any occasion. The gray pants have a subtle pinstripe design and a flattering fit that are perfect for the office or a night out.

Pair yellow, red, purple, or green socks with your <strong>blue</strong> dress pants and you’ll probably get some (positive) comments. Great for <strong>color</strong> blocking, bright <strong>color</strong>ed socks are an easy way to pull together an entire outfit. Try finding a matching pocket square or tie to pull together your whole look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Navy <strong>blue</strong> pants are a wonderful wardrobe staple.The eye looks for something different. Since there isn’t a difference in tone or colour, the eye looks at the figure as one continuous shape and looks at you against the background, of the world, to find contrast. Girls can also use chunky necklaces to complete their look. Yellow shirts can also go with navy <strong>blue</strong> pants and give it a day time look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A. The light <strong>blue</strong> jeans emphasize the more casual look, so they are perfect if you are wearing them for outdoor activities and hang out with friends.

Certainly, you can wear leather trucker jackets with <strong>blue</strong> jeans. This classic symbol of American heritage is really cool to wear. However, a denim trucker with jeans will look awkward, so avoid it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Coral is a warm <strong>color</strong>, and it pairs well with navy <strong>blue</strong>. It’s also a good <strong>color</strong> for spring and summer. You can wear coral with white slacks or khakis for an easy outfit that still looks put together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you need to look professional but want to stay comfortable, the perfect look is a khaki pant with a navy <strong>blue</strong> shirt.
