This mix of the two hues is a classy, modern choice which effortlessly carries a royal look. Feel free to add it in your living room if it’s a king that you want to feel like. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blend with the rosy pink and the shades of <strong>gray</strong> to create a more feminine and refined look that never goes out of fashion. This tinge develops a gentle and soothing ambiance. Not only can it be used in the dressing and bedrooms, but also in the dining hall or the living room to create fun yet elegant design. Who said <strong>gray</strong> has to be neutral all the time? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If Classic Gray doesn’t hit the spot, check out Benjamin Moore Gray Mist. It’s an off-<strong>white</strong> (heavy off-<strong>white</strong>) that’s a greige, but rather than having the subtle purple of Classic Gray, it has a wink more warmth with a touch of cream/yellow. I also love the slightly darker approach of Benjamin Moore Balboa Mist. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>And THAT’S why we’re having our lil chat today, as I’ve pulled together some of my fave off-<strong>white</strong>s, as well as some comments on a few more of today’s most POPULAR off-<strong>white</strong>s. These colours are relatively neutral, but that doesn’t mean they’re fool-proof (as there are no fool-proof neutrals). It all depends on your home, exposure, furnishings, interior finishings and of COURSE, personal tastes, but they’ll at least get you started! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Shoji White is a gorgeous off-<strong>white</strong> greige (more beige than <strong>gray</strong>) that CAN…but doesn’t always, pick up a very vague green. It’s VERY similar to White Duck. Try it, you might like it! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Eider White is a gorgeous off-<strong>white</strong> that is a barely warm <strong>gray</strong>. However, it can flash a NOT quite as subtle purple undertone. Deal-breaker? No, but certainly something to keep in mind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Off-<strong>white</strong> colour = higher LRV = more light reflection. This means that if the light that’s shining on your wall happens to have a ‘colour’ to it, your walls can pick up on that. For example… - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The cherry red is an extravagantly bright and bold color that imbues a sense of luxury and energy when combined with shades of <strong>gray</strong>. The contrast of the two hues makes this an excellent combination and gives you a strikingly sensual and romantic vibe. Take a look at the image below; is it hard to not fall in love? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To create a classic and vintage ambiance, just use the fusion of the <strong>gray</strong> and black shades. This design has been deliberately created to exude a simple yet delightful look that also gives good vibes. The style is ideal for your bedroom, the lounger, guest’s room, or any place that ought to make people feel welcome. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>20 of 21 Art-Inspired Gray Color Scheme Brie Williams Antique Pewter + Historical Hues Every color scheme needs a starting point. For this dining room, antique artwork provided inspiration. Gray shades such as mushroom, khaki, blue-<strong>gray</strong>, and cream show up in the chandelier shades, sisal rug, and off-<strong>white</strong> trim. Striped chairs and a vibrant bouquet of orange dahlias play to the secondary colors in the artwork. Wallpaper in an oversized paisley pattern animates the soft <strong>gray</strong> walls without overpowering the art. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There&rsquo;s no doubt that off-<strong>white</strong> walls in a study make the vibe of that place quite suitable for learning, reading and studying. Additionally, if you add plantation and basic wooden furniture to the area, you’ll have the most classy and sober study with minimal décor. You can also take up Vastu tips to know the direction in which your study table should be placed for ensuring proper concentration and enhancing grasping power. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It&rsquo;s common to want to hide architectural features such as RSJs. But in a grey room, letting them sing by painting them in <strong>white</strong> can create an interesting structural contrast. It also helps zone the space and therefore make it seem cosier – a neat trick, particularly if you&rsquo;re using a cooler grey palette. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although ivory can feel like a shade of beige because of its warm undertones, it is actually a deeper shade of off-<strong>white</strong> color while beige is a yellowish-brown color with a <strong>gray</strong>ish hue quite similar to khaki. While ivory is relaxing and soothing on the eyes with a rich sense of luxury, beige is the color of unbleached wool which is dull and boring. The name ivory comes from the Latin word &rsquo;ebur&rsquo; which means elephant as it is very evidently ivory meaning. Due to its subtle yellowish tint, it is also known as pale yellow or <strong>gray</strong>ish-yellow. Cream and olive are a close match to this magnificent color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The kitchen of the house is often a messed up and highly occupied place. For such a place in your house, you should focus on painting it with light colours to impart a spacious look and a clean appearance despite the hassle that goes on in making delicious food. The best option for this is to try off-<strong>white</strong> colour ideas and paint the walls in this beautiful and simple shade. The twist of elegance and class comes in when you compliment the off-<strong>white</strong> colour with wooden furniture including cabinets and the sitting area. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the best blends of green and blue elements, this shade of seafoam when used in combination with <strong>gray</strong>, portrays a soft and exotic look. This combination is very much contemporary and will give your interiors a global appeal. Try the mix in your kitchen and dining spaces, and we promise that you’ll fall in love. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Considered to be a softer feminine shade, coral is a vibrant color. This tone actually stands out with both the darker and lighter shades of <strong>gray</strong>. It is one of the combinations that will give you the energetic feel. It would be an ideal choice in the living rooms or the kitchen and dining spaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>VIOLET. Remember, every <strong>gray</strong> will have an undertone, and Silver Satin favours a very slight violet. If you like the general look of Silver Satin, but want your walls LIGHTER, Benjamin Moore Calm has a similar approach. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>03 of 21 Soothing Color Scheme Kat Teutsch Steely Gray + Honey Yellow This primary bedroom uses a soothing blend of cool <strong>gray</strong>s and warm golden-honey hues. The harmony of these tones is perfect for relaxation. Gray walls and an upholstered headboard set the stage for the room, while the golden notes enter in through accent pillows and a throw at the end of the bed. Striped bedding sets steely <strong>gray</strong> against bright <strong>white</strong>, which is repeated on floor-to-ceiling drapes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Off-White color shade- This is a more caramelized, warmer and darker shade of <strong>white</strong> with a brown tint and <strong>gray</strong>ish and mostly bronze undertones. This works great in painting walls and ceilings and the floor. Did you know that this creamy color was even used in the stone age? Which makes it the first color to be made and used by the whole of mankind! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In-home décor, cream is used to create a more traditional and rustic vibe and is mainly used in ceilings and kitchens, while ivory is more modern and is usually associated with luxury, this is because ivory has a slight silver sheen to it that looks fantastic especially on curtains when sunlight hits them. When comparing the two colors, you will also notice that ivory is a little bit darker than cream and has a less noticeable yellow tint than cream color. While warm and bright colors look better with ivory, the cream color would look best with cool tones and deep <strong>gray</strong>s. If you’re planning on using either of these two colors in your home décor or as paint options, you must choose the former as ivory makes everything more lively and cream can come out as a little dull and old-fashioned. In the fashion industry too, ivory has been the most widely used choice since the 1600s and is the most trending color for a wedding dress, while the use of cream is always discouraged. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>08 of 21 Decorating in Neutrals Neutral tones combine to create soothing, simplistic color schemes. But it&rsquo;s not always as easy as throwing together a few browns and <strong>gray</strong>s. Watch and learn the secrets to a perfect living room color scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>05 of 21 Vintage-Inspired Color Scheme Nathan Kirkman Antique Pewter + Warm White + Weathered Wood Bold cement tiles with a vintage feel inspired this kitchen&rsquo;s <strong>gray</strong> color scheme. The pattern pairs warm <strong>white</strong> with a mid-tone shade of pewter, which is repeated across several banks of cabinetry. Walnut base cabinetry and open shelves introduce rich wood tones that add depth to the palette. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>18 of 21 Relaxing Gray Color Scheme Dominique Vorillon Cool Gray + Crisp White Contrast reigns in this neutral bathroom, where cool <strong>gray</strong> walls mingle with crisp <strong>white</strong> trim and furnishings. The rich wall color creates a luxurious environment that&rsquo;s perfect for relaxing after a long day. Shimmering chrome fixtures echo the <strong>gray</strong> walls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Drift of Mist is a beautiful off-<strong>white</strong> neutral with a subtle warmth that can pick up an interesting green undertone. TRUTHFULLY, it’s more of a light depth paint colour, but it’s on the higher side of that range. Read all about it HERE. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As the sophisticated color adds a comfortable aura to your rooms, you can use it in any combination in your living room. As <strong>gray</strong> is a soothing tone, it may also come as an aid to your sleep. Add a few tinges of sunny yellow here and off-<strong>white</strong>s there, and you’ve got yourself a winning look! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>04 of 21 Dramatic Gray Color Scheme Annie Schlecther Charcoal Gray + Blush Pink + Brass Charcoal <strong>gray</strong> wraps this closet nook in coziness. Set against a dark background, pops of pink and shiny brass seem even bolder and brighter. The warm brass accents and pink velvet upholstered chair stand out vividly against a cool <strong>gray</strong> color on the walls and built-in vanity area. The contrasting colors form a dramatic, unexpected <strong>gray</strong> color scheme. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Having used this colour in my brother’s house (not shown above, pictures are coming soon), I’ve been able to see firsthand how it shifts from a beige-greige blend (but never definitively <strong>gray</strong> or beige) into a really subdued, neutralized cream. Mad love. I’ve also been able to see firsthand how lucky he is to have me in his life. True story. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to decorating or painting your house, the first thing that probably comes to your mind is what color to use to make your rooms look elegant. The shades of <strong>gray</strong> have grown in popularity over the years leaving behind <strong>white</strong> and beige. Some of the world’s best designers have been in awe of the color’s versatility and used it successfully to craft masterpieces of modern architecture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There’s just something so heavenly about an all-<strong>white</strong> room. It’s no secret that I love simplicity, and these <strong>white</strong> rooms are the epitome of simple. It’s sorta like when it snows…everything gets covered in a peaceful blanket of <strong>white</strong>. It’s like a minimalist’s dream! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sue Wadden says: “Agreeable Gray SW 7029 has some slight green undertones, but it is still warmer than most <strong>gray</strong>s. It bodes well with the beiges and warm hues we’re seeing people start to gravitate toward and embrace in their homes.” - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>07 of 21 Earthy Gray Color Scheme Edmund Barr Nature&rsquo;s Gray + Red-Orange + Cream Using the <strong>gray</strong> and brown tones in the stone fireplace as a guide, this room goes natural with its blend of earthy hues and varied materials. A wing-back chair is covered in chic <strong>gray</strong> flannel, while the two-tone sectional sofa introduces leather. Rich shades of red-orange, dispersed throughout the room on pillows, throws, and the upholstered ottoman, accent the rustic spirit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Opaline- Although Ivory itself is a shade of <strong>white</strong>, opaline tilts more towards the green color palette. It is a muted yet bright cheery color that soothes the eyes and is a mixture of <strong>white</strong>, green, and a little hint of yellow. This beautiful color is a close match for mint green and pairs well with different shades. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I brought my Sherwin-Williams and Benjamin Moore paint decks along with loose swatches of some of my favorite colors. I also brought drafting tape and a piece of <strong>white</strong> foam core. I like to tape the loose swatches to the foam core and then move the foam core around the room. Plus, the <strong>white</strong> of the foam keeps the existing wall color from distorting the color of the swatches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But what color is <strong>gray</strong>, exactly? This is the next big question that might come to your mind while if you intend to use this neutral color. Not to worry; we’ll tell you all you need to know about <strong>gray</strong> shades with some terrific examples. So, let’s take a look at 10 colors that goes incredibly well with <strong>gray</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The combination of <strong>white</strong> and black has remained a classic example of complementing colours for centuries now. Making use of this royal and intriguing combination for your office space will be an idea that you wouldn&rsquo;t regret working on. Add black furniture and window panes to the office with off-<strong>white</strong> walls and watch how the place turns classy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>19 of 21 Cool Color Scheme Kim Cornelison Industrial Gray + Brown + Chartreuse Concrete <strong>gray</strong> walls set the tone for midcentury modern style in this dining room. The cool hue works in harmony with the edgy furniture, bold patterns, and blocky black shade. Chartreuse green (with cool blue undertones) is a perfect complement to the industrial decor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>16 of 21 Chic Gray Color Scheme Emily Followill Soft Gray + Hot Pink Hot pink is a standout against warm <strong>gray</strong> walls and <strong>white</strong> linen. The uncluttered aesthetic of this bedroom combines just enough ruffles and pleats with contemporary motifs for a sophisticated retreat. Small doses of color take precedence over frilly accents. To maintain the crisp feel, walls are upholstered in the same fabric as window drapery. The bright pink tufted headboard makes an elegantly dramatic statement. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to LRV, it can be tricky to know just where the cut-off is between <strong>white</strong>, off-<strong>white</strong> and light. Not familiar with LRV? You should read this blog post, it will become your best friend (or I will, one or the other). And while 62 is the magic LRV for almost any room, when it comes to off-<strong>white</strong>, its LRV range sits between 73-82 (approx). In this range, you’ll find off-<strong>white</strong>s that are light and bright but will still show some contrast with standard <strong>white</strong> trim. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>12 of 21 Modern Gray Color Scheme James Carriere Mushroom + Brown + Navy This <strong>gray</strong>-green wall color has just enough warmth to work well with brown and neutral tones. Giving depth to this woodsy hue is a distressed leather armchair and floor lamp made from spindly driftwood. Deeper hues such as black and navy offer bold contrast to the muted walls and light wood finishes. A fiddle leaf fig tree adds a pleasant punch of green, adding to the natural feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We couldn&rsquo;t not have a crisp <strong>white</strong> right up there as one of the best colors to pair with navy. It&rsquo;s the oldest, most tried combination and we will never tire of it. Classic, clean, and crisp it&rsquo;s a mix that lends itself to any room and any style, but it works particularly well in kitchens for a look that&rsquo;s bold and yet timeless. Consider opting for a two-tone look, mixing dark navy cabinets with a true <strong>white</strong> island. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gray is much more than just a combination of black and <strong>white</strong>. This versatile neutral offers a wide array of possibilities. See how various shades play out in these gorgeous <strong>gray</strong> color schemes. Plus, learn how to use <strong>gray</strong> in your decor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There&rsquo;s a right shade of <strong>gray</strong> for any room, from the palest silver to dark charcoal. Designers love the chameleon-like hue for its ability to lean warm, cool, or simply strike the perfect balance between the two. The best <strong>gray</strong>s also change with the light throughout the day, adding depth and visual interest to your interior. Gray&rsquo;s neutral character also makes it the ideal partner for other colors. Whether you&rsquo;re looking to create a serene tone-on-tone environment or find a piece of furniture that&rsquo;ll really stand out, here are some of our favorite colors to pair with <strong>gray</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Now, before we get into the guts n’ the glory, let’s talk about off-<strong>white</strong>s and why they are such a bugger to choose. And if this is your first time to my blog – the Ginger likes to hear herself talk (or type). Consider yourself warned. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s very important to read through the descriptions so that you can understand the undertone of each color and how it might work in your home. The other day I did a consult with a client to select paint colors for her open living room / dining room / kitchen. The home had been a builder spec home in a new development, and the client had re-painted when they moved in but felt the color, which was a very cool blue-<strong>gray</strong>, wasn’t quite right. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>17 of 21 Shades of Gray Color Scheme Werner Straube Cool Grays + Dusty Lavender With shades of <strong>gray</strong> infused with tints such as green, khaki, putty, and slate, this home proves that layer upon layer of tonal <strong>gray</strong>s gives even more interest to this favored neutral. A muted shade of purple pops up throw pillows and complements the cool <strong>gray</strong> undertones. The diamond-pattern doors, brick floor, striped rug, and variety of pillow fabrics add texture and interest creating a monochromatic scheme that is anything but dull. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>11 of 21 Eclectic Gray Color Scheme Robert Brinson Weathered Gray + White Walls + Vibrant Brights Gray makes a beautiful backdrop for bolder colors. Here, <strong>white</strong> walls and quiet washes of <strong>gray</strong> on doors and window sashes take a backseat to the vibrant kaleidoscope of color supplied by the room&rsquo;s rug and hot fuchsia accents. To maintain interest elsewhere (and refrain from competing with the rug), the designer layered weathered and woven textures in furnishings and accents. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pale grey walls create the perfect backdrop for statement patterns in this country living room. The warm undertones of grey absorbs busy patterns, meaning it&rsquo;s less stark than, say, <strong>white</strong> walls. This quality allows pattern to sit more comfortably within the overall scheme. Want to see if <strong>white</strong> works better? Our <strong>white</strong> living room ideas show you how this shade can be used. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;I’ve always been lavender skeptical, perhaps because I’m insecure in my own masculinity? Well, I’m insecure no more! Lavender is the pastel du jour and I am obsessed with it.&rsquo; says Jonathan Adler (opens in new tab). &lsquo;Lavender feels dreamy and floaty and surreal. And lavender plays well with others – navy, chocolate brown, taupe, and <strong>white</strong>.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>10 of 21 Punchy Gray Color Scheme Emily Followill Gray-Brown + Orange + Coral Like a fine woolen jacket paired with a patterned tie, this <strong>gray</strong>, brown, and orange bedroom exudes elegant-yet-playful sensibilities. The upholstered headboard is covered in a business-suit check and accented with just enough pattern and color for interest. For extra personality, the side table, which leans more toward coral, is a few steps off of the orange on the pillow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sometimes it is good to go with a divergent thinking of contrasting colors. A combination of vibrant green grass shade compliments incredibly well with shades of <strong>gray</strong>. It is a perfect fit for kid’s rooms as you would want a lively and spirited combination in their rooms just as much as they are. This combination can work equally well in places that you would want to exude a cheerful vibe. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you are going for off-<strong>white</strong> colour for your interior, you can also combine the same with coloured furniture to add an additional dose of elegance to space. In order to beautify more, you can add cushions of any bright colour on the couch and add vibrance to the room. These coloured cushions add the spark needed by an elegant and sober space as per the current trends. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>13 of 21 Warmed Up Color Scheme Ray Kachatorian Putty + Warm Red and Orange When decorating with <strong>gray</strong>, it is important to look at the undertones. Deep enough in tone (and tinted with the perfect amount of green), this warm <strong>gray</strong> complements the deep red coverlet and orange hues in the drapery. Opposite each other on the color wheel, green and red are complementary colors and naturally look good together. The eclectic scheme includes a gallery of artwork in varying frames and styles that stands out against the rich neutral. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The subtle and relaxed shades of <strong>gray</strong> color are sometimes visually the most attracting. If you are using a combination of fluffy <strong>white</strong>s and soft <strong>gray</strong>s, it is one of the cleanest and elegant choices. The combo can create a serene and cozy look, striking the right balance between gracefully welcoming and beautiful. Designers often recommend this eye-catching combination in your living area, bedroom, or any space that’s meant for relaxation. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>02 of 21 Bold Gray Color Scheme James Nathan Schroder Iron Gray + Fuschia + Gold Introduce bold personality to your <strong>gray</strong> color scheme with accent furniture and decor in vibrant tones. In this living room, a dark <strong>gray</strong> accent wall is lifted by pops of fuchsia, periwinkle, and dusty blue. Metallic gold appears on the coffee table legs, an ornate hanging picture frame, and a side table to brighten the space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you opt for off-<strong>white</strong> wall colour ideas, you sign up for simplicity and royalty both together. However, for some people, the simplicity in this wall colour turns out to be quite dull that can be rightfully combated with the proper combination of vintage furniture placed in a space where off-<strong>white</strong> wall colour is done. Try getting vintage furniture painted in pastel shades to add an unexpected twist to it. You can also rent furniture rather than burning a hole in your pocket by buying it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>01 of 21 What Goes with Gray? Kim Cornelison Far from boring, <strong>gray</strong> is the neutral of choice for many designers. More complex than cream or <strong>white</strong> (and typically not as yellow or glaring), <strong>gray</strong> comes in a variety of shades and tints to provide a soothing backdrop or set the perfect scene to showcase an accent color. Whether mixed with a dab of black, green, or blue, the range of <strong>gray</strong>s and possible color palettes are endless. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Color ivory is slightly on the warmer side because of its yellow tint and, therefore, it pairs well with other warm colors like pink, yellow, orange, beige, and red. Other colors that go well with ivory are dusty pink, lavender, silver, and <strong>gray</strong>. Ivory even goes well with black to create an elegant design. When it comes to clothing ivory can be paired with pastel blue to create a neutral look that looks elegant and formal or you could pair it with chocolate brown for high contrast that looks amazing as these two colors bring out each other. When it comes to home décor, ivory goes great with black or deep <strong>gray</strong> furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Her instincts were right, and I could definitely see how she’d had trouble selecting the right paint color. The builder had used a pretty stone on the fireplace with warm <strong>gray</strong> undertones, tan carpeting, medium dark wood floors (not too red, which was good), espresso colored cabinets, and then granite countertops that were mostly gold with flecks of burgundy. The fixed finishes were all over the place, and the <strong>gray</strong> they’d picked was too cool to coordinate with any of them. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;re looking to design with this well-loved color but feeling a bit overwhelmed by the options, never fear. Navy blue is a versatile color that pairs with everything from classic <strong>white</strong> to deep bordeaux.
