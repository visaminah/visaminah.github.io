Do not tumble dry. Avoid using pegs to hang on the line. To avoid fading and to minimise wrinkling, the best practice is to hang <strong>curtains</strong> back on their hooks and dry outside in the shade to dry. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Repairing frayed hems on <strong>curtains</strong> can be tricky and rehemming is usually the best way to remove frays. If you can&rsquo;t rehem the panels, try to snip as many frayed threads from the hem before and after <strong>clean</strong>ing the <strong>curtains</strong>, however, you run the risk of creating more holes. You can try treating the hems with a fray-sealing adhesive product that dries clear. If you have <strong>curtains</strong> with a frayed fabric liner, it may be best to talk to a professional <strong>clean</strong>er to see if they can replace the lining fabric. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blackout <strong>curtains</strong> are built to endure thanks to their densely woven materials. Even though they’re more expensive, these drapes and <strong>curtains</strong> are well worth the investment. Not only can blackout <strong>curtains</strong> provide insulation and save you money on your energy costs, but they also enhance the beauty of your house. Blackout <strong>curtains</strong> are an excellent investment because of their many uses and appealing aesthetics. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>How to Clean blackout <strong>curtains</strong> that are made of foam-coated fabric, by giving them a proper hand wash. Don’t use the washing machine <strong>clean</strong>ing method because the machine can easily ruin the layers. It is recommended to prepare the soapy water in a bathtub, by mixing a specific amount (manufacturer’s recommended) in the warm water and get the bathtub filled with that soapy water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To wash rubber-backed <strong>curtains</strong> outdoors, hang them from a clothesline or spread them out on a <strong>clean</strong> tarp. Spray the <strong>curtains</strong> thoroughly with a hose. Use a <strong>clean</strong>, large sponge (as you would use to wash a car) to work mild laundry detergent into the fabric. Rinse the <strong>curtains</strong> with the hose until the water runs clear with no suds. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If the fabric of your curtain allows for heat (e.g. cotton, cotton/polyester, linen) then you may be able to steam <strong>clean</strong> your <strong>curtains</strong>. The heat from the steam can dislodge dirt and allergens, and sanitise your <strong>curtains</strong> by killing germs, bacteria, and mould. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Machine-wash unlined <strong>curtains</strong> and sheers made from cotton, nylon, and polyester. Lace <strong>curtains</strong> can be washed in a machine if protected in a mesh bag. Synthetic and lined blackout <strong>curtains</strong> are likely fine to wash in the machine but check the label first. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Curtains can become worn at the bottom or torn and frayed elsewhere. Pets can accidentally leave claw marks on <strong>curtains</strong>, too. Instead of tossing your <strong>curtains</strong>, try repairing them first. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Usually, blackout hangings that are made of foam-coated fabric have a grey or white coating on their backside., these coated <strong>curtains</strong> require some gentle <strong>clean</strong>ing. Don’t go for a washing machine or soaking method to get them <strong>clean</strong>ed. Rather than this, spot <strong>clean</strong>s them with gentle hand wash, and then dry <strong>clean</strong>ing is the best way to <strong>clean</strong> these alluring hangings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some curtain fabrics must be dry-<strong>clean</strong>ed because of special materials (such as adhesive <strong>curtains</strong>) or fabrics with special weaving methods (such as knitted fabrics). Do not wash them in order to avoid damage or deformation of the fabric. If there is a top-cover style, the <strong>curtains</strong> are decorated with ornaments, such as silk tassels or hanging tassels next to the curtain cloth. Dry <strong>clean</strong> or hand wash as much as possible, never machine wash. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What are the benefits to using Nataro over my nearest dry <strong>clean</strong>er?
