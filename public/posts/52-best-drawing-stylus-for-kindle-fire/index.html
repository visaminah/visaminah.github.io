Can also double up as a computer. Perfect gift for young artists. Stylus: Capacitive Check on Amazon - Source: Internet Active styluses are much more technologically advanced. They’re best for when you want to handwrite a lot of notes or draw and sketch. The very best will feel almost like you’re writing on paper. - Source: Internet With a color gamut featuring 1.07 billion colors and HDR capabilities, you can create more life-like images than ever before. Also, the stylus uses felt nibs that glide across the screen and feel identical to using an ink pen. - Source: Internet Ultimately, how the Scribe’s writing experience works and feels is the biggest question about this device. You can buy it with one of two stylus options: a “Basic Pen” or a “Premium Pen” for $30 more that also includes a customizable shortcut button and an eraser sensor on the top. Both use the same Wacom EMR technology and magnetically attach to the side of the Scribe but don’t have batteries or need to be charged. - Source: Internet As this stylus doesn’t feature a fine tip – it measures 0.7 mm- it’s not aimed at those looking to write on a screen. Instead, its tip measures around the diameter of a fingertip so you can use the pen for navigating through your web browser, rather than continuously using your fingertip. Once you have your stylus sorted out, another handy accessory is the best tablet floor stand. - Source: Internet Apart from frontrunners like Apple, Microsoft, and Samsung, Adonit is another name that has garnered considerable appreciation from all corners. And this simple, utility-based stylus from the brand seemed deserving enough for our list. Weighing 0.04 lbs and coming with a 1.9 mm pointed tip, it offers an authentic drawing experience. - Source: Internet The precision disc tip of this active stylus is undoubtedly its most noteworthy feature. Interestingly, it simulates a finger-like touch to enable sensitive and precise contact on the tablet screen. That’s why it’s least likely to cause any scratch while being used for drawing or scrolling. Plus, such efficient sensitivity also brings perfection to the drawing and prevents any lag. - Source: Internet WHY WE LIKE IT: This Active stylus digital pen offers two tips, with fabric and fiber materials. The 1.45mm fine tip is great for extreme accuracy, whereas the fabric tip provides quick use for covering a larger surface area, making it ideal for an employee in an office environment. - Source: Internet WHY WE LIKE IT: This Bargains Depot stylus features two different rubber tips measuring 4.55mm and 6mm, and it’s made from stainless steel and aluminum to provide a real pen feeling. These features allow for hours of use for scrolling through the Internet. - Source: Internet To draw on the Fire HD Kids Pro, you need to download specific drawing applications. Three of the most highly-rated apps are ArtFlow, Paint Pad HD, and Kids Doodle 2. They all work with fingers, or you can buy a compatible stylus for more control. - Source: Internet There are various different models of Samsung’s ‘S-Pen’ styluses, each compatible with different iterations of the company’s tablets. There are also S-Pens designed for the Samsung Galaxy Note series of smartphones. S-Pen prices vary, but are typically cheaper than Apple Pencils. - Source: Internet This stylus’s rubber tip is soft and won’t leave any scratches on your screen. It’s also padded within the tip to prevent you from pressing down hard on your device, which improves its sensitivity. We love that this product also features a clip design, so you always have a pen or stylus to hand if you need one. You want the best android tablets, so you should have a quality stylus. And also if you have the best ipads with you always, this is handy. - Source: Internet Choosing the most suitable stylus as per your needs might seem confusing if you can’t understand where to start from. Simply put, you should have a clear idea about certain key factors that ultimately determine the performance of a stylus. So, let’s have a brief look at each of them: - Source: Internet Alternatively, switch the stylus to a mesh tip to use the stylus for tapping when you’re scrolling through the Internet. Even on this setting, the product doesn’t drag across the screen, thanks to the mesh material. As a result, it offers excellent precision. - Source: Internet Keep in mind that styluses with Bluetooth will need a battery. Some models have replaceable AAA or AAAA batteries, while others have rechargeable cells. If the battery runs out, the pointer function of your stylus will still work, but the buttons won’t. - Source: Internet Contrary to the claims of the brand that this stylus pen comes weighted to enable easy handling, we found that it often rolled off the table. This makes it more prone to accidental damage. Also, it’s slightly thicker than the 2nd generation counterpart, so some people might find it less comfortable to use. - Source: Internet First off, the superior pressure sensitivity of this stylus pen differentiates it from other similar options on the market. Thanks to the use of advanced MMP 2.0 technology, it lets you shade and sketch precisely with as many as 4,096 different pressure sensitivities. Notably, you can use this stylus with most Surface tablets, including the Surface Pro 8 that was launched late last year. - Source: Internet This pen is reasonably priced and won’t break the bank. Instead of using our fingers to scroll through social media, play online games or type text messages, use this stylus pen to avoid fingerprints on your screen. To keep your pen in tip-top condition, your purchase comes with a cleaning cloth. This avoids any debris or dust from touching your screen to keep it smear-free. - Source: Internet To discover the best stylus for home use or in the office, we searched for products that offer excellent precision and pressure sensitivity, durability and a weight that is neither too light or too heavy, both of which can cause fatigue. This all comes down to the material used on the tip, as well as its thickness. Therefore, any products that required several taps to the screen to respond were eliminated from this list. The best styluses make the best tablets even better. - Source: Internet Some capacitive styluses have Bluetooth connectivity, which adds some basic functionality. Usually, a stylus that has Bluetooth will have at least one button, which can be used to perform a function on the tablet you’re using. What the button does depends on the device and the app you’re using; it could undo an action, or activate an eraser, for example. - Source: Internet Each of these responds to even a light touch quite efficiently, making your sketches and drawings more consistent and visually appealing. Moreover, the streamlined design facilitates greater ease of use for extended periods. That’s how handling larger projects can become a cakewalk for digital artists and designers opting for this stylus. - Source: Internet We discovered the best styluses online by creating a guideline and sticking to the criteria for each product. Whether you’re looking for a stylus compatible with Apple, Samsung, Kindle, or other tablet devices, the most important aspect of a stylus is that it offers excellent precision. The stylus should tap the exact location you’re pointing it to without any accidental errors. This means the pen should have a thin point to help you target anywhere on your screen. As a result, we only chose styluses with a narrow tip for the best accuracy possible. - Source: Internet We appreciate you may use the stylus for a variety of tasks, including drawing, writing, or tapping. Therefore, the weight plays a significant role in accuracy too. If the stylus weighs more than 45g, it’ll hurt your wrist after holding it for a while, leading you to rest your wrist on the device, and resulting in marks or permanent scratches. - Source: Internet This stylus pen is designed to resemble a fingertip, so you can avoid fingerprints by constantly touching your device’s screen. The rubber tip offers excellent accuracy, and the metal body improves durability when carrying the stylus around with you. If you wish to switch to handwriting on paper, twist the pen on the other end to release the ballpoint pen. - Source: Internet The main 2-mm tip is designed with rubber and a transparent plastic disc to improve the responsiveness against your screen without impacting your view. Without the plastic disc, the stylus could sometimes lose responsiveness. The 2-mm tip makes the stylus perfect for drawing intricate lines or handwriting on your device. Alternatively, switch to the 6-mm tip to move pictures, icons, or navigate through menu settings, rather than using your fingers. - Source: Internet Unlike other standard stylus pens, this one doesn’t come with programmable buttons or a rubber. As such, it might seem less convenient to users who have to keep up with a greater workload regularly. But in terms of drawing efficiency, this stylus performs quite well. - Source: Internet On a touchscreen keyboard, typing can be a rather slow affair and prone to mistakes. If you can type quickly and accurately on your Kindle Fire then great - but many people can’t. If you want to avoid sending out emails which are littered with mistakes which could reflect badly on you if it’s for business, then get yourself a stylus instead. - Source: Internet It has a 13-inch, high-resolution touchscreen display ideal for working. The high pixel count means that detail retention remains sharp even when zoomed in on an image. If you want to work with a stylus, the best one is the Surface Slim Pen 2. - Source: Internet That has almost brought us to the end of our guide. We hope you’re more confident about choosing a suitable drawing stylus now. So, don’t delay taking the best step towards improving your drawing productivity. - Source: Internet If you’re on the hunt for a cost-effective yet high-performing stylus for a Microsoft Surface tablet, this Renaisser stylus will undoubtedly be a great pick. Weighing a mere 14 g and measuring 9.2 mm in diameter, the stylus comes with a host of utility-based features that make you feel like you’re drawing on paper. - Source: Internet Drawing tablets are often called graphic tablets. They are unique devices that allow you to create digital hand-drawn images and edit photos. They use styluses that closely resemble the look and feel of pens. Using the stylus with the drawing tablet, you can create a wide variety of beautiful digital art and navigate photo editing software. - Source: Internet The LED indicator of this drawing stylus might not function consistently. Sometimes, it may not light up instantly after it’s turned on and might also turn off while you’re working. In case you face similar issues with the product, you must get in touch with customer support as soon as possible. - Source: Internet For Huion Camvas users who need to work on professional-grade graphic drawings regularly, this Huion stylus will be the best bet. Equipped with standard utility-based features, it comes in a lightweight and convenient design to enable maximum accuracy for all types of drawings. Plus, the brand provides extra accessories for extended use. - Source: Internet This stylus pen offers a unique combination of style and functionality that’s bound to impress any modern artist. Measuring 140 mm long and weighing only 14 g, this pen is rechargeable and comes with quite a few extra accessories for extended use. Want to know more? Then keep reading. - Source: Internet We begin our list with this versatile Apple pencil that set a new standard in the art stylus industry with its debut in 2015.

To know more about the product, read through the next few sections. - Source: Internet Moving on, the stylus pen features a 2nd generation Wacom Tip Sensor with a tilt sensitivity of 60 degrees to facilitate efficient drawing. Note that its lightest pressure sensitivity is as little as one gram, letting you effectively capture subtle nuances for beautiful results. Moreover, you can adjust the tilt and pressure sensitivity of the options. - Source: Internet For artists looking to get the best out of their Microsoft Surface Tablets, this stylus is a no-brainer. Giving the feel of a natural writing and drawing tool, this stylus pen helps you complete all projects on time and with the utmost perfection. It weighs just 0.04 lbs and operates on a single CR2 battery. - Source: Internet The styluses’ tip determines accuracy, too. For example, a rubber tip is excellent for providing friction on the screen so you can easily draw a line without marking the screen. On the other hand, copper tips are suitable for daily writing and allow you to mark minute details on the screen. We avoided any tips larger than 5mm as this size lacks versatility, and makes writing or tapping difficult. - Source: Internet Huawei Mediapad M5 Lite A good alternative to Samsung tablets with good stylus support. But limited in the number of drawing apps available since it does not has the official google app store.

Instead of screens, they have touchpads. Using a pen or stylus, you draw on the touchpad, and the image appears on your computer. - Source: Internet Replacing the tips and erasers might seem a bit tricky as the instruction manual has the steps mentioned rather briefly.

If you look at the tip from the side, you’ll notice it’s larger than most styluses, which allows children to use the pen on their device from all angles. Perfect for 8 of the best 10-inch tablets. - Source: Internet This stylus comes in a range of colors to match your child’s device. The pen is also incredibly durable as it’s made from metal, so it’s designed to last for daily use and survive accidental drops.

On the whole, it’s a durable, easy-to-use, and cost-effective alternative. - Source: Internet Not only do active styluses activate a tablet’s touchscreen, they also work with your tablet to establish how hard you’re pressing (for thicker or thinner lines). Some even identify what angle the stylus is being held at (to simulate pencils, fountain pens and even paint brushes). This technical complexity means they need a rechargeable or replaceable battery, depending on the model. - Source: Internet If you’re looking for a stylus to scroll through the Internet, we recommend the Bargains Depot stylus.

Can also double up as a computer. Perfect gift for young artists. Stylus: Capacitive Check on Amazon - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Active <strong>stylus</strong>es are much more technologically advanced. They&rsquo;re best for when you want to handwrite a lot of notes or draw and sketch. The very best will feel almost like you&rsquo;re writing on paper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With a color gamut featuring 1.07 billion colors and HDR capabilities, you can create more life-like images than ever before. Also, the <strong>stylus</strong> uses felt nibs that glide across the screen and feel identical to using an ink pen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Ultimately, how the Scribe’s writing experience works and feels is the biggest question about this device. You can buy it with one of two <strong>stylus</strong> options: a “Basic Pen” or a “Premium Pen” for $30 more that also includes a customizable shortcut button and an eraser sensor on the top. Both use the same Wacom EMR technology and magnetically attach to the side of the Scribe but don’t have batteries or need to be charged. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As this <strong>stylus</strong> doesn’t feature a fine tip – it measures 0.7 mm- it’s not aimed at those looking to write on a screen. Instead, its tip measures around the diameter of a fingertip so you can use the pen for navigating through your web browser, rather than continuously using your fingertip. Once you have your <strong>stylus</strong> sorted out, another handy accessory is the best tablet floor stand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Apart from frontrunners like Apple, Microsoft, and Samsung, Adonit is another name that has garnered considerable appreciation from all corners. And this simple, utility-based <strong>stylus</strong> from the brand seemed deserving enough for our list. Weighing 0.04 lbs and coming with a 1.9 mm pointed tip, it offers an authentic drawing experience. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The precision disc tip of this active <strong>stylus</strong> is undoubtedly its most noteworthy feature. Interestingly, it simulates a finger-like touch to enable sensitive and precise contact on the tablet screen. That’s why it’s least likely to cause any scratch while being used for drawing or scrolling. Plus, such efficient sensitivity also brings perfection to the drawing and prevents any lag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>WHY WE LIKE IT: This Active <strong>stylus</strong> digital pen offers two tips, with fabric and fiber materials. The 1.45mm fine tip is great for extreme accuracy, whereas the fabric tip provides quick use for covering a larger surface area, making it ideal for an employee in an office environment. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>WHY WE LIKE IT: This Bargains Depot <strong>stylus</strong> features two different rubber tips measuring 4.55mm and 6mm, and it’s made from stainless steel and aluminum to provide a real pen feeling. These features allow for hours of use for scrolling through the Internet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To draw on the Fire HD Kids Pro, you need to download specific drawing applications. Three of the most highly-rated apps are ArtFlow, Paint Pad HD, and Kids Doodle 2. They all work with fingers, or you can buy a compatible <strong>stylus</strong> for more control. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are various different models of Samsung&rsquo;s &lsquo;S-Pen&rsquo; <strong>stylus</strong>es, each compatible with different iterations of the company&rsquo;s tablets. There are also S-Pens designed for the Samsung Galaxy Note series of smartphones. S-Pen prices vary, but are typically cheaper than Apple Pencils. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>stylus</strong>’s rubber tip is soft and won’t leave any scratches on your screen. It’s also padded within the tip to prevent you from pressing down hard on your device, which improves its sensitivity. We love that this product also features a clip design, so you always have a pen or <strong>stylus</strong> to hand if you need one. You want the best android tablets, so you should have a quality <strong>stylus</strong>. And also if you have the best ipads with you always, this is handy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Choosing the most suitable <strong>stylus</strong> as per your needs might seem confusing if you can’t understand where to start from. Simply put, you should have a clear idea about certain key factors that ultimately determine the performance of a <strong>stylus</strong>. So, let’s have a brief look at each of them: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Alternatively, switch the <strong>stylus</strong> to a mesh tip to use the <strong>stylus</strong> for tapping when you’re scrolling through the Internet. Even on this setting, the product doesn’t drag across the screen, thanks to the mesh material. As a result, it offers excellent precision. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Keep in mind that <strong>stylus</strong>es with Bluetooth will need a battery. Some models have replaceable AAA or AAAA batteries, while others have rechargeable cells. If the battery runs out, the pointer function of your <strong>stylus</strong> will still work, but the buttons won’t. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Contrary to the claims of the brand that this <strong>stylus</strong> pen comes weighted to enable easy handling, we found that it often rolled off the table. This makes it more prone to accidental damage. Also, it’s slightly thicker than the 2nd generation counterpart, so some people might find it less comfortable to use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>First off, the superior pressure sensitivity of this <strong>stylus</strong> pen differentiates it from other similar options on the market. Thanks to the use of advanced MMP 2.0 technology, it lets you shade and sketch precisely with as many as 4,096 different pressure sensitivities. Notably, you can use this <strong>stylus</strong> with most Surface tablets, including the Surface Pro 8 that was launched late last year. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This pen is reasonably priced and won’t break the bank. Instead of using our fingers to scroll through social media, play online games or type text messages, use this <strong>stylus</strong> pen to avoid fingerprints on your screen. To keep your pen in tip-top condition, your purchase comes with a cleaning cloth. This avoids any debris or dust from touching your screen to keep it smear-free. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To discover the best <strong>stylus</strong> for home use or in the office, we searched for products that offer excellent precision and pressure sensitivity, durability and a weight that is neither too light or too heavy, both of which can cause fatigue. This all comes down to the material used on the tip, as well as its thickness. Therefore, any products that required several taps to the screen to respond were eliminated from this list. The best <strong>stylus</strong>es make the best tablets even better. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some capacitive <strong>stylus</strong>es have Bluetooth connectivity, which adds some basic functionality. Usually, a <strong>stylus</strong> that has Bluetooth will have at least one button, which can be used to perform a function on the tablet you’re using. What the button does depends on the device and the app you’re using; it could undo an action, or activate an eraser, for example. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Each of these responds to even a light touch quite efficiently, making your sketches and drawings more consistent and visually appealing. Moreover, the streamlined design facilitates greater ease of use for extended periods. That’s how handling larger projects can become a cakewalk for digital artists and designers opting for this <strong>stylus</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We discovered the best <strong>stylus</strong>es online by creating a guideline and sticking to the criteria for each product. Whether you’re looking for a <strong>stylus</strong> compatible with Apple, Samsung, Kindle, or other tablet devices, the most important aspect of a <strong>stylus</strong> is that it offers excellent precision. The <strong>stylus</strong> should tap the exact location you’re pointing it to without any accidental errors. This means the pen should have a thin point to help you target anywhere on your screen. As a result, we only chose <strong>stylus</strong>es with a narrow tip for the best accuracy possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We appreciate you may use the <strong>stylus</strong> for a variety of tasks, including drawing, writing, or tapping. Therefore, the weight plays a significant role in accuracy too. If the <strong>stylus</strong> weighs more than 45g, it’ll hurt your wrist after holding it for a while, leading you to rest your wrist on the device, and resulting in marks or permanent scratches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>stylus</strong> pen is designed to resemble a fingertip, so you can avoid fingerprints by constantly touching your device’s screen. The rubber tip offers excellent accuracy, and the metal body improves durability when carrying the <strong>stylus</strong> around with you. If you wish to switch to handwriting on paper, twist the pen on the other end to release the ballpoint pen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The main 2-mm tip is designed with rubber and a transparent plastic disc to improve the responsiveness against your screen without impacting your view. Without the plastic disc, the <strong>stylus</strong> could sometimes lose responsiveness. The 2-mm tip makes the <strong>stylus</strong> perfect for drawing intricate lines or handwriting on your device. Alternatively, switch to the 6-mm tip to move pictures, icons, or navigate through menu settings, rather than using your fingers. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Unlike other standard <strong>stylus</strong> pens, this one doesn’t come with programmable buttons or a rubber. As such, it might seem less convenient to users who have to keep up with a greater workload regularly. But in terms of drawing efficiency, this <strong>stylus</strong> performs quite well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>On a touchscreen keyboard, typing can be a rather slow affair and prone to mistakes. If you can type quickly and accurately on your Kindle Fire then great - but many people can&rsquo;t. If you want to avoid sending out emails which are littered with mistakes which could reflect badly on you if it&rsquo;s for business, then get yourself a <strong>stylus</strong> instead. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It has a 13-inch, high-resolution touchscreen display ideal for working. The high pixel count means that detail retention remains sharp even when zoomed in on an image. If you want to work with a <strong>stylus</strong>, the best one is the Surface Slim Pen 2. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>That has almost brought us to the end of our guide. We hope you’re more confident about choosing a suitable drawing <strong>stylus</strong> now. So, don’t delay taking the best step towards improving your drawing productivity. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re on the hunt for a cost-effective yet high-performing <strong>stylus</strong> for a Microsoft Surface tablet, this Renaisser <strong>stylus</strong> will undoubtedly be a great pick. Weighing a mere 14 g and measuring 9.2 mm in diameter, the <strong>stylus</strong> comes with a host of utility-based features that make you feel like you’re drawing on paper. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Drawing tablets are often called graphic tablets. They are unique devices that allow you to create digital hand-drawn images and edit photos. They use <strong>stylus</strong>es that closely resemble the look and feel of pens. Using the <strong>stylus</strong> with the drawing tablet, you can create a wide variety of beautiful digital art and navigate photo editing software. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The LED indicator of this drawing <strong>stylus</strong> might not function consistently. Sometimes, it may not light up instantly after it’s turned on and might also turn off while you’re working. In case you face similar issues with the product, you must get in touch with customer support as soon as possible. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For Huion Camvas users who need to work on professional-grade graphic drawings regularly, this Huion <strong>stylus</strong> will be the best bet. Equipped with standard utility-based features, it comes in a lightweight and convenient design to enable maximum accuracy for all types of drawings. Plus, the brand provides extra accessories for extended use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>stylus</strong> pen offers a unique combination of style and functionality that’s bound to impress any modern artist. Measuring 140 mm long and weighing only 14 g, this pen is rechargeable and comes with quite a few extra accessories for extended use. Want to know more? Then keep reading. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We begin our list with this versatile Apple pencil that set a new standard in the art <strong>stylus</strong> industry with its debut in 2015. Since then, this <strong>stylus</strong> pen has been appreciated by artists everywhere, owing to its intelligent features and compatibility with multiple Apple devices. To know more about the product, read through the next few sections. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Moving on, the <strong>stylus</strong> pen features a 2nd generation Wacom Tip Sensor with a tilt sensitivity of 60 degrees to facilitate efficient drawing. Note that its lightest pressure sensitivity is as little as one gram, letting you effectively capture subtle nuances for beautiful results. Moreover, you can adjust the tilt and pressure sensitivity of the options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For artists looking to get the best out of their Microsoft Surface Tablets, this <strong>stylus</strong> is a no-brainer. Giving the feel of a natural writing and drawing tool, this <strong>stylus</strong> pen helps you complete all projects on time and with the utmost perfection. It weighs just 0.04 lbs and operates on a single CR2 battery. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>stylus</strong>es’ tip determines accuracy, too. For example, a rubber tip is excellent for providing friction on the screen so you can easily draw a line without marking the screen. On the other hand, copper tips are suitable for daily writing and allow you to mark minute details on the screen. We avoided any tips larger than 5mm as this size lacks versatility, and makes writing or tapping difficult. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Huawei Mediapad M5 Lite A good alternative to Samsung tablets with good <strong>stylus</strong> support. But limited in the number of drawing apps available since it does not has the official google app store.

It’s compatible with all touchscreen devices without the need for batteries meaning the battery life should last forever. Weighing a total of 24g, it’s heavier than some <strong>stylus</strong>es on this list, but this weight is a great way to keep the <strong>stylus</strong> connected to your screen for optimum accuracy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pen tablets, or graphic tablets, are devices used for drawing, but you need to connect them to computers. Instead of screens, they have touchpads. Using a pen or <strong>stylus</strong>, you draw on the touchpad, and the image appears on your computer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Replacing the tips and erasers might seem a bit tricky as the instruction manual has the steps mentioned rather briefly. So, it would be best to refer to some online videos in case you find it too difficult. That said, we have no complaints regarding the performance of this <strong>stylus</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The overall winner and #1 best <strong>stylus</strong> is the MEKO Universal Stylus. This pen offers two tips, so you can type and tap with it, without having to switch to another unit. Its disc tip is great for typing or for moments when you need optimum accuracy. Switch to the metal mesh tip, and feel how smoothly the pen glides against glass. These features make the <strong>stylus</strong> a top pick as you can adjust from handwriting a message to scrolling the Internet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although this <strong>stylus</strong> isn’t designed for extensive drawing or handwriting (as the tip is rubber and not as sensitive as some of the other products on this list), it’s perfect for tapping and playing games for long periods. If you look at the tip from the side, you’ll notice it’s larger than most <strong>stylus</strong>es, which allows children to use the pen on their device from all angles.

Though not crowded with many features, this <strong>stylus</strong> the much-desired full creative control to artists looking to enhance their productivity. On the whole, it’s a durable, easy-to-use, and cost-effective alternative. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Not only do active <strong>stylus</strong>es activate a tablet&rsquo;s touchscreen, they also work with your tablet to establish how hard you’re pressing (for thicker or thinner lines). Some even identify what angle the <strong>stylus</strong> is being held at (to simulate pencils, fountain pens and even paint brushes). This technical complexity means they need a rechargeable or replaceable battery, depending on the model. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re looking for a <strong>stylus</strong> to scroll through the Internet, we recommend the Bargains Depot <strong>stylus</strong>. This product features two rubber tips, measuring 4.5mm and 6mm, making it versatile enough to use on a small smartphone or larger tablet.
