Often referred to as the bones of the garden, the evergreen structure should be the starting point once the initial layout of the garden has been decided.’ - Source: Internet If berries aren’t your style, you might want to try planting a Japanese yew. These evergreens grow lovely red fruits that contrast neatly with their green needles. This durable tree does well in moist areas with either shade or sunlight. With proper care, a Japanese yew can grow up to 50 feet, though their patience with pruning makes them an excellent hedge option as well. - Source: Internet Deer can damage shrubs by nibbling their twigs, fruit, and foliage. Gardeners across the country always look for ornamentals that deer won’t touch. Lists vary by region (and even by neighborhood), but certain types of plants appear on many of them. Consider shrubs with thorns or prickers, resinous wood, aromatic foliage, and fuzzy leaves. - Source: Internet This plant’s vibrant red berries make a striking contrast against both snowy landscapes and dark green foliage, making it a great addition to any winter garden.

Overall, they are rather low maintenance, only requiring supplemental water when the season is very dry. - Source: Internet Cold-resistant perennials and other plants survive the winter in a resting stage underground. They store nutrients in storage organs, such as bulbs, tap roots, and tubers, throughout the spring and summer. During this time they rely on their storage organs to survive while resting underground. - Source: Internet ‘Evergreens can provide privacy and are a useful way of dividing up a garden naturally without the need for walls or fences,’ says garden designer Fiona Lamb (opens in new tab). ‘Domes of evergreen foliage in this outdoor seating area are interspersed with perennials to give seasonal color and interest.’ The evergreen planting helps to define a softly delineated space too. - Source: Internet Bird’s nest is an evergreen spruce. It is noted for spreading out in an oval shape and forming a depression in the middle. The result is a look that’s similar to a bird’s nest. - Source: Internet Oversized garden planters sit on the fossilised sandstone paving that forms the terrace.

Mature branches exhibit exfoliating bark that peels in strips to reveal several layers of reddish to light brown inner bark making it an excellent addition to the winter landscape. - Source: Internet Going “green” in your yard means a lot more than the color of your lawn. In fact, you may not always want your lawn to look so green! (Hint: It uses a lot of water.) Check out these eco-landscaping ideas to green your yard in healthy, sustainable, environmentally friendly ways. - Source: Internet In this garden design by Rae Wilkinson (opens in new tab), evergreen hedges combine with ornamental grasses to divide spaces with blocks of varying texture. ‘A large portion of the structure within gardens should be provided by the planting,’ says Rae. ‘When herbaceous plants die back in the winter and deciduous leaves fall, the evergreen structure retains the green element and defines the space.’ - Source: Internet Varying your planting colors Subdued neutrals in front Dynamic contrast at the side Bright highlights in the back The green and burgundy of my house make good backdrop colors for planting schemes. As the predominant color of nature, green serves to unify any landscape. Red is the complement of green—its opposite on the color wheel—and thus offers strong contrast. However, the subdued form of red I chose—a ruddy burgundy—paired with a silvery moss green creates a complementary scheme that soothes rather than shouts. Subdued neutrals in front - Source: Internet Physocarpus opulifolius ‘Jefam’ AMBER JUBILEE ninebark Deciduous shrub ‘Jefam’, commercially sold as AMBER JUBILEE, is most noted for its foliage color and compact plant habit. The new leaves emerge orange with yellow veins on in spring and summer before turning purple in fall. Foliage on old wood is green throughout the summer. - Source: Internet Not all yards are flat, and grass won’t grow in all places. You can use a ground cover, like Pachysandra, to add greenery and color to areas where shade or slopes make it difficult for grass to grow. With seasonal maintenance, ground cover can look neat and professional without overtaking the parts of your yard where grass and other features shine. - Source: Internet If your front yard already has a tree, adding a flower bed will give it a lot of character. These beds should match (or at least align with) the beds at the front of your house. Add color in the form of annuals or perennials. All in all, this project will likely cost $100 to $300, depending on the border and plants that you buy. - Source: Internet The rose flowers are held against glossy green foliage in spring that turns to deep-red tints in fall. It has been a very vigorous grower for me and has an upright growth habit. Another in the Girard Series that is extremely hardy in St. Louis. - Source: Internet Plants are central to the “green” part of green landscaping. When thinking about what to plant, consider native plants or cultivars derived from native plants (sometimes referred to as “nativars”). Native landscaping plants are naturally adapted to your regional environment. Stay close to home when making your choices, however. Just because a plant is native to the United States doesn’t make it good for your location. - Source: Internet Tree peonies are actually shrubby plants. The deeply cut, gray-green foliage is attractive all season. Plant in a protected area. Seek out good quality cultivars for longevity. - Source: Internet Those yews smothering every other house in your neighborhood may be indestructible, but they’re not much to look at. The right evergreens give a foundation planting year-round structure, but incorporating deciduous shrubs and perennials provides ornamental value all year long. Choose plants with an eye to staggered bloom times from early spring to late summer, colorful fall foliage, and fruits in winter. - Source: Internet The Cavatine Dwarf Japanese Pieris is also known as Lily of the Valley. It doesn’t grow higher than 2 feet. The white flowers stand out against its dark green leaves, making it a popular choice in front yards. - Source: Internet Evergreens are a hugely important consideration for most gardens. They provide essential, year round structure, ensuring that there is interest in the garden even in midwinter. They are the backdrop against which everything else can perform as perennials, annuals and ornamental grasses will all benefit from an evergreen foil. - Source: Internet Wild columbine should be a delight for wildlife enthusiasts as well as gardeners for its ability to attract hummingbirds. This enchanting variety of flower typically does well in partial shade, though it can also thrive in full sunlight in colder climates. Make sure young plants have moist soil and reduce watering to weekly once they have become established. - Source: Internet The reliable large white flowers put on a great spring show. The Girard Series is excellent for northern gardens since the flower buds are cold-temperature tolerant of our winters. Has a pleasant fall color and the evergreen foliage adds year-round interest. - Source: Internet The Emerald N Gold shrub is an evergreen shrub that belongs to the family of Winter creepers. These shrubs show excellent foliage in bright yellow and green colors. They grow only 1 to 2 feet in height, making them ideal for edgings, garden borders, and house borders. Emerald N Gold’s leaves also change their colours to the shades of pink and red in the fall and winter, offering a delightful visual. - Source: Internet This is an attractive, compact evergreen shrub that is easily pruned. It is very heat tolerant, but not for wet conditions. It provides a dwarf, mounding habit in your garden and is deer resistant as are all Buxus. - Source: Internet Shrubs can be deciduous (meaning they lose their leaves every winter) or evergreen. Some families of shrubs include both of these types, like hollies. There are also coniferous (cone-bearing evergreens) species like many junipers and yews. - Source: Internet By nature, evergreens are often quite dense, which also makes them a great choice for topiary too. ‘Ensuring there is a balance in the planting design is key to letting evergreens shine,’ adds Kate. ‘That said, if you really want to go for it then opt for an all-evergreen garden with lots of clipped shapes that contrast with each other. It is a bold move but one that will look timeless.’ - Source: Internet ‘Make Hebe rakiensis a regular in your evergreen planting,’ suggests garden designer Fiona Lamb. (opens in new tab) ‘Its neat shape and apple green brightness look great repeated through planting beds or for edging steps.’ - Source: Internet The Taunton spreading yew is an evergreen shrub that grows and spreads upright. You can use this shrub for mass plantings for ground cover or at hedges and screening. This densely compact shrub has bright green foliage dark green needles throughout the year. - Source: Internet An abundance of white or pastel blue, yellow, and pink plants will unify the house and landscape. Avoid only dark, rich colors because they will look harsh against white. It’s fine to use darker colors sparingly, as small, sharply contrasting details. Foliage that is blue, silver, or variegated also makes a good accent. - Source: Internet Before going too far down the creative rabbit hole, it is best to face reality. Set realistic goals for the future plants. Ask yourself some important questions to determine some goals, dreams, expectations, and limitations of the front of your home. - Source: Internet To create green landscaping, you don’t need to change your landscape. It can be as simple as reducing the amount of solid waste you produce. For example, instead of bagging lawn waste such as twigs and leaves, create compost piles. When the yard waste has decomposed, add the finished product to your lawn and gardens to increase fertility. - Source: Internet Flowering varieties add extra color and sweet fragrances. Depending on where you live and the conditions in your yard, different shrubs can add evergreen texture, groundcover on a slope, and even more privacy by blocking street noise. They also help protect the soil from erosion and support wildlife with food and shelter. - Source: Internet This evergreen yew is low growing, with a low mounding habit. The branches provide an arching habit. I like to use it for a foundation planting since the height is 3’ to 4’ and spreading. - Source: Internet The Cavatine Dwarf is an evergreen shrub that offers beautiful flowering. It is one of the best low-growing shrubs for the front of the house due to the white flowers. Chains of little bell-shaped white flowers make an attractive combination with dark green leaves. Also known as ‘Lily of the valley,’ this informal shrub grows not more than 2 feet in height. - Source: Internet In addition to being too static, most foundation plantings are also too narrow, with a single row of shrubs that doesn’t extend far enough out into the yard. You may be able to fix that simply by enlarging your bed and adding more plants in front. Layer them back to front from tallest to shortest, making sure none of the new ones towers over the established back row. - Source: Internet Every garden should include some clever ideas for landscaping with evergreens as they’re the most hardworking shrubs and trees that will really earn their place in your scheme. They add year-round interest and structure, which makes them especially important over winter. They are generally a low maintenance option too. - Source: Internet A broad-leaved evergreen growing slowly with a compact, rounded habit. It is very tolerant of a wet planting site, heavy clay soils and pollution. Use it in a full-sun area as well as a light-shaded area. I have found it to be a tough urban plant. - Source: Internet Smaller evergreen plants such as hebe are one of the best plants for small gardens and can be clipped into mounds to provide form, color and texture at a lower level. These work well for enhancing edges, softening level changes, dividing connected spaces, or filling up planters for year-round interest. They are a great choice for cheap landscaping ideas too as they’re not an expensive plant choice. - Source: Internet Compared to many smaller plants, most shrubs are pretty drought-tolerant once they are established (for the first year after planting, you’ll want to make sure your shrub stays well watered, so the roots have a chance to grow in). Unfortunately, you can’t always count on rain to water your plants in some parts of the country. So if you want to use less water in your garden, choose shrubs that can tolerate dry conditions. Some examples are potentilla, spirea, and many viburnums. - Source: Internet As the name suggests, Bird’s nest spruce is nest-like in appearance. This dwarf shrub eventually makes a dip in the center with a rounded mound, making it look like the nest of a bird. This Bird’s nest spruce is a beautiful light green foliage that takes time to grow.

It requires moderate acidity and soil for efficient growth. - Source: Internet Mugo Pine is an evergreen that works well in informal gardens. It’s a hearty shrub that can handle hard seasonal changes. It loves full sun. - Source: Internet The leaves of shrubs come in just about every color, even nearly black like ‘Black Lace’ elderberry ($11, The Home Depot). Even plain green deciduous varieties often turn bright colors in the fall. And evergreen shrubs, despite their name, offer a fantastic range of foliage colors beyond green, including soft blue, yellow, and variegated in yellow or cream with green. These hues look even more striking in a snow-covered winter landscape. When selecting bushes or shrubs, make sure to consider their appearance throughout all seasons. - Source: Internet This juniper provides a slight mounding habit in full sun locations. It does not brown out in the landscape, which makes it valuable in my designs. The green foliage stays a good color all season long. - Source: Internet The Cherry Laurel shrub is an evergreen tree that can grow 20 to 24 feet high. Sweet smelling white flowers blossom between May and June. After this time, tiny red fruit appears. - Source: Internet When planting against a blue house, take a strong cue from the color wheel. Choose blue’s color-wheel opposite—soft orange, golden yellow, copper—for an energetic look, or choose neighboring colors—lavender, blue, purple—to cool down the scene. Silver or blue-green foliage makes a subtle accent. Burgundy may be difficult to integrate well. - Source: Internet Moonshadow can work as landscaping shrubs or as ornamental plants. The leaves are green and yellow. They have an almost surreal quality that encourages their name. - Source: Internet This is a dense, evergreen, needled shrub with elegant silvery-blue foliage.

There is a slight fragrance to the 2-inch flowers. This is an extremely hardy azalea for the Midwest landscape. - Source: Internet Not taking into account plants’ size at maturity is probably the number-one mistake homeowners make. We’ve all seen windows curtained with overgrown evergreens that no doubt looked just fine when they were planted. Choosing shrubs of the right size will also help keep pruning to a minimum.

Though they can thrive in a range of full sunlight to partial shade, it may be best to plant them under the shelter of trees where their roots have protection from the heat. Weekly watering is required for the first two years after planting. - Source: Internet Hummocks of clipped lavender work well in a south-facing front garden. For small spaces, repeating shapes can be most effective. Try contrasting the lavender balls with taller plants such as alliums or verbascum in between. For shady front gardens, you can’t go wrong with clipped box (Buxus sempervirens) or bay tree standards with hart’s tongue ferns to create different shapes. - Source: Internet Boxwood is one of the common types of low-growing shrubs, one of them being the winter gem. This is a dense, bushy evergreen shrub that makes great foundation plant for any house. The winter gem shows glossy green leaves and grows up to 4 feet. However, Winter Gem has a slow-growing rate as compared to other landscaping shrubs. You can trim it according to your choice, and eventually takes a pyramid-like shape. - Source: Internet In the heat of summer, allow your lawn to go dormant instead of keeping it green with watering. Grass is naturally programmed to go into dormancy. Water infrequently, if at all. When you do water, be sure it’s a deep soaking; shallow watering promotes shallow root growth that is more susceptible to drought and insect problems. - Source: Internet The Oakleaf Hydrangea is a deciduous shrub that shows big pure green leaves in the shape of oakleaf leaves. These leaves look fuzzy when young but look great once the shrub is mature. The shrub experiences beautiful foliage in the fall when the green leaves turn red and purple.

All the types of Inkberries grow not more than 4 feet in height and 6 feet wide. Shamrock, a variety of Inkberry, is the most popular low-growing shrub that offers thick, dark green leaves year-round with flowers in summer and blackberries in the fall. Inkberry shrubs thrive well in both full sun and partial sun positions. Moreover, these shrubs adjust with almost all kinds of soils and in both dry and wet conditions. - Source: Internet The idea is simple: Foundation plants should enhance your home, make it more welcoming, and tie it to the surrounding landscape. Unfortunately, these house-hugging plantings frequently consist of stiff evergreen shrubs that do little for the house they adorn. Even worse, they’re often sheared into something closer to green loaves of bread than to anything found in nature. Here are some ways to rethink that timeworn row of clipped evergreens. - Source: Internet In contrast, herbaceous perennials can take a snow load and grow quickly again next spring. Indeed, some even love the extra moisture. Likewise, some plants look wonderful and airy dancing and waving in windy places. - Source: Internet A great blue 12- to 15-foot tall evergreen tree for the landscape. The rigid, incurved prickly foliage provides a nesting site for our feathered friends. Great for full sun areas. The tight pyramidal shape is a strong accent.

The indestructible Griselinia littoralis (New Zealand broad leaf) is also be a good choice, particularly for a roof terrace or coastal garden.’ - Source: Internet Purple and yellow are the key colors in a sunny, south-facing border between the driveway and the house. From spring’s golden daffodils and mahogany and yellow tulips through the fall spectacle of purple asters, goldenrod (Solidago rugosa ‘Fireworks’, Zones 5–9), and Rudbeckia ‘Herbst­sonne’ (Zones 3–9), there’s always an interplay of contrasts. Two dark-leaved woody plants—a purple smoke bush (Cotinus coggygria ‘Royal Purple’, Zones 5–9) and a purple beech (Fagus sylvatica ‘Purpurea Pendula’, Zones 4–7)—repeat the trim color and anchor the far ends of this border. Bright highlights in the back - Source: Internet This can be a small specimen tree in the landscape. The shiny, green foliage turns deep purple to scarlet in fall and the accompanying blue-black fruit is a wildlife magnet.

I have found it to be a tough urban plant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Smaller ever<strong>green</strong> <strong>plants</strong> such as hebe are one of the best <strong>plants</strong> for small gardens and can be clipped into mounds to provide form, color and texture at a lower level. These work well for enhancing edges, softening level changes, dividing connected spaces, or filling up planters for year-round interest. They are a great choice for cheap landscaping ideas too as they&rsquo;re not an expensive plant choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Compared to many smaller <strong>plants</strong>, most shrubs are pretty drought-tolerant once they are established (for the first year after planting, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure your shrub stays well watered, so the roots have a chance to grow in). Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t always count on rain to water your <strong>plants</strong> in some parts of the country. So if you want to use less water in your garden, choose shrubs that can tolerate dry conditions. Some examples are potentilla, spirea, and many viburnums. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As the name suggests, Bird’s nest spruce is nest-like in appearance. This dwarf shrub eventually makes a dip in the center with a rounded mound, making it look like the nest of a bird. This Bird’s nest spruce is a beautiful light <strong>green</strong> foliage that takes time to grow. The ever<strong>green</strong> multi-stemmed shrub grows up to a height of around 3 to 4 feet.

Even plain <strong>green</strong> deciduous varieties often turn bright colors in the fall. And ever<strong>green</strong> shrubs, despite their name, offer a fantastic range of foliage colors beyond <strong>green</strong>, including soft blue, yellow, and variegated in yellow or cream with <strong>green</strong>. These hues look even more striking in a snow-covered winter landscape. When selecting bushes or shrubs, make sure to consider their appearance throughout all seasons. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This juniper provides a slight mounding habit in full sun locations.

Sweet smelling white flowers blossom between May and June. After this time, tiny red fruit appears. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When planting against a blue house, take a strong cue from the color wheel. Choose blue’s color-wheel opposite—soft orange, golden yellow, copper—for an energetic look, or choose neighboring colors—lavender, blue, purple—to cool down the scene. Silver or blue-<strong>green</strong> foliage makes a subtle accent. Burgundy may be difficult to integrate well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Moonshadow can work as landscaping shrubs or as ornamental <strong>plants</strong>. The leaves are <strong>green</strong> and yellow. They have an almost surreal quality that encourages their name. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a dense, ever<strong>green</strong>, needled shrub with elegant silvery-blue foliage. The blue star juniper gets its name because the shrub looks like stars in clusters from a far-off view. The needles on this shrub come in all shapes.

It is best to plant this shrub in full sun locations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It’s a favorite to use as an accent piece. Its natural globe shape makes it easy to maintain. The yellow tips add a lot of color to this ever<strong>green</strong> shrub. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Fiona is a big fan of Pittosporums too. &lsquo;Another of my go-to <strong>plants</strong> are Pittosporums, and especially Pittosporum tenuifolium ‘Tom Thumb’ whose purple leaves can give fantastic contrast when surrounded by <strong>green</strong> <strong>plants</strong>.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sporting breathtaking blossoms in various pink hues, camellias are another excellent source of color against dark <strong>green</strong>, wintry foliage. These relatively carefree <strong>plants</strong> are happiest in partial shade, where they can be sheltered from early morning and afternoon sun. They also require protection from cold winter winds and should be watered frequently, keeping them consistently moist. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The vivid purple flowers make this a great spring addition.

This ever<strong>green</strong> shrub grows well in both full sun and partial shade and is extremely drought tolerant. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Taunton Spreading Yew is a versatile ever<strong>green</strong>. It can be used for screening, hedges, or ground cover. Green foliage contrasts with its dark <strong>green</strong> needles. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a semi-ever<strong>green</strong> shrub when planted in a protected area in our landscapes. The glossy foliage is a great compliment to the rose-purple flowers. This may die back to the ground in northern climates, but grows back quickly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Physocarpus opulifolius &lsquo;Diabolo&rsquo; ninebark Deciduous shrub &lsquo;Diabolo&rsquo; is a purple-leaved cultivar that gets a bit larger, reaching a height of 4-8 feet and about the same spread.

Mature branches exhibit exfoliating bark that peels in strips to reveal several layers of reddish to light brown inner bark making it an excellent addition to the winter landscape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Moonshadow is another winter creeper that provides any landscape a beautiful lush <strong>green</strong> foliage. This ever<strong>green</strong> shrub looks so pretty that it can be planted as a single accent plant too. You can also plant several of these as low hedges. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The flowers are rose colored followed by dark <strong>green</strong> summer foliage that is red-purple in fall. There is a slight fragrance to the 2-inch flowers. This is an extremely hardy azalea for the Midwest landscape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Not taking into account <strong>plants</strong>&rsquo; size at maturity is probably the number-one mistake homeowners make. We&rsquo;ve all seen windows curtained with overgrown ever<strong>green</strong>s that no doubt looked just fine when they were planted.

Look for dwarf varieties that max out at 2 to 4 feet tall for under windows and other tight spots. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Stand Out Feature: The gateway plant to formal gardening. Boxwood takes well to shaping. It is a small broadleaf ever<strong>green</strong> with smooth, bright <strong>green</strong> leaves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a fairly fast growing yew, yet compact form for the landscape.

Shamrock Inkberries are commonly used as foundation <strong>plants</strong> in the front gardens of houses. Flowers bloom in the spring and summer and blackberries appear in the fall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Cold weather slows down plant growth. In winter, the lack of sunlight prevents <strong>green</strong> <strong>plants</strong> from photosynthesizing and creating food and the below-freezing temperatures stop water circulation in the plant’s sap. While some <strong>plants</strong> can survive winter, others will die. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The brick red color will light up your landscape. The foliage is dark <strong>green</strong> in summer and turns wine-red in winter. This azalea is a Gable Series selection and performs well in the Midwest winters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A great dwarf conifer that provides a reliable, ever<strong>green</strong>, <strong>green</strong> color to the landscape. The soft needles add a texture element to the landscape. Gives a nice winter character to the landscape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Boxwood hedges are great for lining your garden and preserving privacy while maintaining a fresh <strong>green</strong> look all throughout winter. Though they can thrive in a range of full sunlight to partial shade, it may be best to plant them under the shelter of trees where their roots have protection from the heat. Weekly watering is required for the first two years after planting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hummocks of clipped lavender work well in a south-facing front garden. For small spaces, repeating shapes can be most effective. Try contrasting the lavender balls with taller <strong>plants</strong> such as alliums or verbascum in between. For shady front gardens, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with clipped box (Buxus sempervirens) or bay tree standards with hart&rsquo;s tongue ferns to create different shapes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Boxwood is one of the common types of low-growing shrubs, one of them being the winter gem. This is a dense, bushy ever<strong>green</strong> shrub that makes great foundation plant for any house. The winter gem shows glossy <strong>green</strong> leaves and grows up to 4 feet. However, Winter Gem has a slow-growing rate as compared to other landscaping shrubs. You can trim it according to your choice, and eventually takes a pyramid-like shape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In the heat of summer, allow your lawn to go dormant instead of keeping it <strong>green</strong> with watering. Grass is naturally programmed to go into dormancy. Water infrequently, if at all. When you do water, be sure it&rsquo;s a deep soaking; shallow watering promotes shallow root growth that is more susceptible to drought and insect problems. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Oakleaf Hydrangea is a deciduous shrub that shows big pure <strong>green</strong> leaves in the shape of oakleaf leaves. These leaves look fuzzy when young but look great once the shrub is mature. The shrub experiences beautiful foliage in the fall when the <strong>green</strong> leaves turn red and purple. The flowers that this shrub offers grow in bright white and turn to shades of pink or purple with time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Also known as Gallberry and ever<strong>green</strong> winterberry, this shrub is an ever<strong>green</strong> plant. All the types of Inkberries grow not more than 4 feet in height and 6 feet wide. Shamrock, a variety of Inkberry, is the most popular low-growing shrub that offers thick, dark <strong>green</strong> leaves year-round with flowers in summer and blackberries in the fall. Inkberry shrubs thrive well in both full sun and partial sun positions. Moreover, these shrubs adjust with almost all kinds of soils and in both dry and wet conditions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The idea is simple: Foundation <strong>plants</strong> should enhance your home, make it more welcoming, and tie it to the surrounding landscape. Unfortunately, these house-hugging plantings frequently consist of stiff ever<strong>green</strong> shrubs that do little for the house they adorn. Even worse, they&rsquo;re often sheared into something closer to <strong>green</strong> loaves of bread than to anything found in nature. Here are some ways to rethink that timeworn row of clipped ever<strong>green</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In contrast, herbaceous perennials can take a snow load and grow quickly again next spring. Indeed, some even love the extra moisture. Likewise, some <strong>plants</strong> look wonderful and airy dancing and waving in windy places. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A great blue 12- to 15-foot tall ever<strong>green</strong> tree for the landscape.

Its small size is a big asset in many locations. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This dense, summer-blooming shrub has <strong>green</strong> foliage that turns deep red in fall. It has a compact form in the landscape that blooms best in full sun. A very nice small shrub. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Zone and Growing Condition: Moist, well-draining soil. Sun to part shade. Protect from deer, drought, salt, and wind for luxurious <strong>green</strong> growth. Zone 2 to 11. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Ever<strong>green</strong>s play an important role and there are some that we use regularly in our designs, such as Trachelospermum jasminoides (star jasmine) and Liriope (lily turf) for example. The indestructible Griselinia littoralis (New Zealand broad leaf) is also be a good choice, particularly for a roof terrace or coastal garden.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Purple and yellow are the key colors in a sunny, south-facing border between the driveway and the house. From spring’s golden daffodils and mahogany and yellow tulips through the fall spectacle of purple asters, goldenrod (Solidago rugosa ‘Fireworks’, Zones 5–9), and Rudbeckia ‘Herbst­sonne’ (Zones 3–9), there’s always an interplay of contrasts. Two dark-leaved woody <strong>plants</strong>—a purple smoke bush (Cotinus coggygria ‘Royal Purple’, Zones 5–9) and a purple beech (Fagus sylvatica ‘Purpurea Pendula’, Zones 4–7)—repeat the trim color and anchor the far ends of this border. Bright highlights in the back - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This can be a small specimen tree in the landscape. The shiny, <strong>green</strong> foliage turns deep purple to scarlet in fall and the accompanying blue-black fruit is a wildlife magnet. It needs room in the landscape to use as a single tree or as a hedge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The key is you don’t want <strong>plants</strong> that grow out of control or need constant pruning. No one wants to spend every waking moment trimming invasive <strong>plants</strong> or cutting back trees. You also want to be mindful of the root systems and be sure you’re using <strong>plants</strong> that won’t disrupt your foundation or sidewalks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Hostas are perfect low lying <strong>plants</strong> for the front landscaping areas of your house. They come in a variety of striking <strong>green</strong> shades from chartreuse to dark <strong>green</strong>. You can layer in Hostas in front of taller <strong>plants</strong> for increased variety. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A great addition to your broad-leaved ever<strong>green</strong> choices for foundation plantings, hedges, or used singly in your landscape. This male plant should be planted for pollination of CHINA GIRL. One of the most trouble-free ever<strong>green</strong> hollies. A great substitute for yews. They truly have lustrous and rich <strong>green</strong> foliage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The foliage is semi-ever<strong>green</strong> in the Midwest.

The foliage is dense in the 3’-tall <strong>plants</strong>. It does best in full sun and dry areas of the landscape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>White draws the most attention and should be used with care. I look to white primarily for a focal point or to unite a space. In our back garden, which surrounds a patio, I use this potent color sparingly and as a connector. The repetition of the white blooms of hosta (Hosta cvs., Zones 3–9) and other <strong>plants</strong> throughout the season is offset by sprinklings of violet-purple flowers and accents of burgundy foliage. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The winter interest of this plant is highlighted with the <strong>green</strong> zig-zag stems. Use these for cutting during the winter months to bring inside. The flowers are bright yellow if the plant is located in bright shaded areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This medium <strong>green</strong> yew is extremely narrow so it can be used in tight locations in the landscape.

Happily they require the least amount of maintenance too.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are so many great reasons to create exceptional curb appeal at the front door.

In general, they&rsquo;re <strong>plants</strong> with multiple woody stems that usually don&rsquo;t die back to the ground in winter (which most perennial <strong>plants</strong> typically do).
