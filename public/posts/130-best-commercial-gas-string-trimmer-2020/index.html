It’s a bit of a contradiction, since it’s heavy (more than 15 pounds), it has the smallest cutting width of all the trimmers on this list, and it has only a 25 cc, 2-cycle engine. For the price, though, it’s a solid weed eater and brush cutter for residential use. - Source: Internet Looking for a solid steel string trimmer for cheap? This one works well enough. We don’t recommend it for the toughest jobs, but it has some capabilities. Consider this to be like #4 on the main list, but not as good. However, it should have everything you need. - Source: Internet The workhorse could chop down weeds as long as my waist level with ease. The trimmer’s deflector prevented a lot of bad debris from flying around. The RM1159 is quite compact and can easily reach around small corners and nooks. Once I was done with the mowing process, my lawn looked like entirely new terrain. - Source: Internet To avoid any potential engine issues, hanging it on the wall, by the engine will keep your weed eater safe and well maintained. However, there are a couple of nuisances to be aware of should you have an electric or gas-powered weed eater, and a few additional rules to go by when storing your equipment. One of the most important considerations is how powerful the cutter is. If you choose a gas-powered trimmer, power is important, and you should pay attention to whether the power output is enough for the kind of jobs you want to do. Gas-powered engines in weed eaters are either 2-stroke or 4-stroke. - Source: Internet If you are looking for a reliable way to weed your lawn or garden with a weed wacker, look no further than the Cyclone Desert trimmer string. This .095-inch, multi-sided weed wacker string is made with a durable copolymer, offering abrasion resistance while cutting brush, weeds, and grass.

This trimmer weighs about 12.2 lbs which makes it heavy but comfortable to carry around in the yard. - Source: Internet While choosing a commercial weed eater, you should also take into consideration the cutting path. It is important if you need a tool that will assist you in clearing grass on a lawn effectively. Plus, it takes lesser time to accomplish the task. Most trimmers come with a small cutting track that is quite less effective when you clear larger fields. - Source: Internet Wind the string in the opposite direction of its rotation. In most cases, you’ll want to wind the string counterclockwise. Many trimmer manufacturers imprint an arrow on the spool to show the proper direction to wind the string. - Source: Internet Husqvarna Gas Straight Shaft String Trimmer 128LD - Editor’s Choice Via Amazon.com Husqvarna 128ld String Trimmer is one of the best weed eaters that I have ever tried! It is equipped with a lot of specifications and unique features. This machine has helped me with all types of edging and trimming needs. For me, it is the right trimmer that can cut an overgrown lawn before using a lawnmower. - Source: Internet If the Ego ST1511T is not available, we also like the Ego ST1521S Power+ String Trimmer with Powerload. This is the previous generation of Ego string trimmer, and it shares much of what makes the ST1511T such a success: long battery life, excellent power, and the easy line change. The significant differences are that it doesn’t have the telescoping shaft or the quick adjustment on the handle, so it’s not as flexible for varying body heights. The two trimmers are typically sold for around the same price, so we recommend choosing this model only if the ST1511T is out of stock and you can’t wait for it. - Source: Internet First, you need to make sure the trimmer line you’ve purchased is right for your weed eater. Too thin, or too thick, and it may not work with your machine. Do your research and get the right line. - Source: Internet Husqvarna 128ld trimmer is fitted with a 2-stroke, 28-cc engine, which makes it optimized for performance. The 1-horsepower engine is powerful enough to cut through bush-like terrain with no hassles. Similar to other gas-powered trimmers, the Husqvarna 128ld also makes use of 100% gasoline, which needs to be mixed with oil before use. - Source: Internet The Husqvarna 128LD weighs 10.8 lbs which makes it lightweight for a gas trimmer. It should be easy to carry this trimmer around for a long period of time. - Source: Internet The Milwaukee 2825-21ST M18 FUEL String Trimmer is our premium choice pick. It’s a battery-powered trimmer that allows complete portability and near-silent operation. The battery and charger come with it, and it can run close to an hour on a single charge thanks to its brushless motor that uses less power and creates less heat. It has a straight 74-inch shaft that should be long enough for most people. - Source: Internet The weight of a trimmer is another thing that you should consider while buying a weed eater for commercial purposes. As you know, clearing your larger fields will take time and therefore, it should not be heavy if you want to complete the work without getting tired. The weed eater’s weight can be determined by the elements it comprises. That’s why you should not go with trimmers that come with various parts. Power - Source: Internet Instead of a blade, string trimmers use a string (or “line”) to slice through foliage. String trimmers consist of a long shaft with a cutting head, also known as a trimmer head, on one end. The cutting head is the part of the tool where you load the string, and it’s the part that does the cutting (thus the name). - Source: Internet The RM1159 weighs roughly about 78 pounds and consists of a 4-cycle 159cc OHV engine. The loop handle is ergonomic in design that also folds, allowing for easy storage and smooth transport. The RM1159 is capable of mowing down the toughest blades of grass. You can also adjust the cutting height of the trimmer. - Source: Internet It is a common question that why should you choose this trimmer when there are bigger and better trimmers in the market in the same price range. I have to offer several reasons why you should choose the GT-225 over others. Just because it is a lightweight trimmer does not mean that it lacks power. The Echo GT-225 is capable of edging and trimming without giving up midway. While other models pack a lot more power, they do not have the combination of being lightweight and powerful at the same time. - Source: Internet But there are a few bonus features offered by some manufacturers that can take your string trimmer from “good” to the best weed eater around. However—and this is a big drawback for some—the power cord can severely limit your range and may prove to be a hazard. It may be all too easy for some to cut through it by accident or even trip over it while they work. For these reasons, corded weed eaters are best for those with smaller yards, who live in big towns, and who can stick close to home for their trimming. - Source: Internet That depends on your specific needs. Trimmers with curved shafts are usually shorter, lighter, and cheaper. Straight shafts are longer, so they can reach a wider radius, and these trimmers typically produce more torque. You’ll notice all of our top picks have straight shafts. - Source: Internet Tanaka TCG22EAP2SLB 2-Cycle Gas Powered Curved Shaft String Trimmer Now another two-stroke gas-powered Tanaka commercial weed eater enters the list. Instead of focusing on commercial-grade cutting power, the Tanaka TCG22EAP2SLB trimmer prides itself on an ergonomic design. - Source: Internet Why does the power of the engine matter the most when making a gas string trimmer comparison of similar models? This characteristic determines the strength and effectiveness of the device, as the engine is what powers the equipment. Therefore, the more potent the engine is, the better the performance your tool delivers. It also means that a trimmer with a powerful engine can handle heavy-duty jobs. - Source: Internet Square trimmer line has four hard cutting edges that are designed to aggressively cut through coarse weeds and green underbrush, where it excels. Round line is quieter and more fuel-efficient due to reduced wind resistance. It is also more durable than square line of the same size because it consists of more material. For generally weed-free lawns, round line could be the best choice. - Source: Internet This is a corded string trimmer, which means you need to have a long enough extension cord for your yard. With 8,000 RPM and 6.5 amps, this string trimmer should be powerful enough to handle most light yard work. - Source: Internet Everyone likes a well-maintained lawn. However, achieving such a look requires the right tool for trimming your compound. In this article, I have provided the seven gas weed trimmer reviews so that you could choose the best equipment to keep your lawn neat and know how to use such tools. - Source: Internet It is well balanced for easy maneuverability and comes with a harness and safety glasses for added user comfort. But it has a lot of other features to commend it as a great choice in 4 stroke trimmers. Straight shaft trimmers have the advantage of transferring power more efficiently to the trimmer head. Given all the moving parts of a gas-powered trimmer, these particular types of weed eaters can be somewhat expensive to maintain. Because the gas-powered string trimmer has no cord, it is not limited by the length of that cord as to where it can go. - Source: Internet We test our gas-engine and battery-powered string trimmers in identical fashion. We use the machines on ordinary suburban lawn grasses such as blue grass, perennial ryegrass, and fescues in a variety of suburban and rural locations. However, our most severe testing occurred along the sloping bank of a sand floor drainage basin in southern New Jersey, where we used the trimmers to cut down knee-deep weeds and wild flowers. We also did considerable edging where sidewalks meet lawns. - Source: Internet One of the more annoying parts of using a weed eater is putting in new trimmer line. Once you run out, you have to put more in. For some, it can feel like a hassle, but once you know how it works, it can be quite easy. Let’s look at some of the best ways to string it. - Source: Internet While searching for the best string trimmer lines on the market, the most popular types among users were made with gatorline, nylon, polymer, and colymer and had round, square, twisted, and multi-sided designs, each with their unique durability, cutting power, and noise- and vibration-reduction. We also included weed wacker strings of varying sizes for light- to heavy-duty yard work, ranging from .080 to .155 inches, making them compatible with a range of residential and commercial weed wacker heads. - Source: Internet While the materials used to make trimmer strings are all reasonably weld resistant, some string types have a higher degree of resistance than others. Given the same material, shaped line is more weld-resistant than round because of the increased surface area. Round string has the least amount of surface area, allowing heat buildup to occur more quickly. - Source: Internet The Greenworks ST80L210 String Trimmer is another battery-powered model that features a 16-inch trimmer head. It uses a brushless motor to increase torque and battery life. One full charge usually lasts about 45 minutes. It’s not light, but it’s not heavy either at a little under 10 pounds. At 65 inches long, it should be suitable for most people. - Source: Internet This string trimmer is your basic cheapie corded unit. Again, it works well for casual use, so check it out if you want something for cheap. It may end up surprising you. - Source: Internet This bump feed and trimmer head has a line that is nice and quiet, yet it works at cutting your bushes. Reviews seem to agree, with most saying that this is a powerful commercial grade weed eater that manages to compete with gas string trimmers. This string trimmer manages to shatter the stereotype that electric isn’t meant for tough jobs. - Source: Internet Even if you aren’t familiar with the term “string trimmer,” you’re probably familiar with the tool itself. These tools go by many names, including weed eater, weed wacker, grass trimmer, and weed trimmer. Don’t worry too much about which name to use — they’re all the same thing. - Source: Internet The Ryobi RY253SS is the best gas string trimmer for the money. See our review above to find out why. 2.

Apart from being quieter than other models, the Husqvarna 324L also limits the exhaust emissions. - Source: Internet Round string comes in all sizes. It is economical, durable, and easy to reload. A round string is best for lawns with mostly grass and just a few weeds. It is not as efficient on weedy properties because the smooth edges tend to tear through weeds rather than cutting cleanly. A round string is also more likely to overheat and weld together when trimming along concrete walls or fences. - Source: Internet Weed trimmer string is available in round, square, multi-sided, twisted, and serrated shapes for different types of yard work. The shape of the string affects performance in several ways, including the cleanness of the cut, the durability of the string, and even noise level. It is important to match the shape with the application for which you’ll be using the string. - Source: Internet No matter what, you are going to run out of string and need to replace it. Most models require you to rewind it by hand, but some make it much more difficult than others. Some use a fancy ratchet system, while others need you to disassemble the head to add more string. We tried to list any models that used outdated systems in our reviews. - Source: Internet The Craftsman CMXGTAMD30SA Straight Shaft String Trimmer is the last model on our list to review for you, and this one features a large 30cc, 4-cycle engine that provides the user with a 17-inch cutting width. The shaft is straight, so it’s easier to use in some situations, especially when using attachments. It has a two-step starting mechanism where you push a priming bulb before pulling the string for easy starting. A multi-position handle helps make holding it more comfortable, and it also helps to reduce vibrations. - Source: Internet This offering from Black and Decker also converts from a trimmer to an edger with a simple turn of the trimmer’s shaft making it an excellent investment for many of your lawn care needs. Moreover, it has a curved shaft that makes trimming and cutting actually more comfortable even if this is not a task that you enjoy. It has a straight shaft which makes it easier to get under bushes, etc and it does seem to eat up the line like lots of weed eaters do. - Source: Internet It’s not a great feeling to get injured by the string trimmer. That’s why you should wear protective equipment before using the trimmer. Wear a good pair of jeans and shoes that cover your feet. - Source: Internet However, four-stroke engines are lubricated with oil from a reservoir, while two-stroke versions are not. It means you need to mix oil into the fuel manually with a two-stroke engine, and you will probably need to change the spark plugs more often. Uses quick start technology that makes the pull start easier when compared to other trimmers in the market. You can simply tap the head on the ground to feed more line on your trimmer. Very easy to assemble as you just have to reposition the handle and install its guard. - Source: Internet Gasoline weed trimmers are available either with straight or curved shafts. The curved ones can bend between the spinning trimmer head and its handle. Such a tool will be a perfect match for small people. A device with a curved shaft also comes as more durable because such a design allows the flexibility of the drive cable. The curved shafts also have a better balance than straight ones that increases their maneuverability in hard-to-reach areas. - Source: Internet The cutting width that the weed eater provides can make a big difference in how long it takes you to complete a project. A wider cutting will go through more string, but the time-saving advantage makes it worth it. If choosing between two similar models, we recommend the one with the bigger cutting width. - Source: Internet If you are a tall person, you want a weed trimmer that will fit your height. Otherwise, you risk bending too much while at work and straining your back before even finishing trimming your yard.

See if it works well for your needs. - Source: Internet Echo GT-225 2 Cycle Curved Shaft Gas Trimmer Via Amazon.com The Echo GT-225 is one of my favorite budget picks for lawn care.

While it might be void of some features housed by other weed eater models, for the price range, you will be purchasing a decent trimmer that can handle daily wear-and-tear and will last for many years. - Source: Internet Some reviewers had problems with the carburetor. Some said it wasn’t as ergonomic if you were taller. However, these reviews do appear to be in the minority.

Put the spool into the head of the trimmer and take out any line in the retainer. Put the cap back on. - Source: Internet The cutting width can be compared to the working space operated by the device’s blades when cutting grass. The standard width of most gas trimmers is between twelve to fifteen inches. However, there are also some durable options with a cutting width of over fifteen inches. - Source: Internet There are many different types of weed trimmers you can see in the market today. Some are powered by gas, some by a battery, while others by electricity. While the ultimate goal of trimming the lawn is met, they tend to differ in many aspects. - Source: Internet The string could be places in the cutting head as part of a fixed line or spool. A fixed line means you don’t need to worry about the string getting jammed. But it tends to wear the line out faster. - Source: Internet A 4-stroke engine runs on straight gasoline, so you won’t have to mix fuel. String trimmers with 4-stroke engines are typically quieter and have better fuel efficiency than 2-stroke weed eaters. These benefits are what makes 4-cycle trimmers cost more. However, these also require more maintenance, since these tools need regular oil changes. - Source: Internet Many weed eaters employ a starting line to start the trimmer. Here, you need to pull this line a few times, which is quite time-consuming and tiring also. Meanwhile, some trimmers do not even start with consistent pulling. That’s the reason you should go with weed eaters that come with S-start or sequential start. - Source: Internet Here is a battery powered trimmer that is awfully thin. It’s probably underpowered and is only recommended for very light jobs. If you’re looking for the cheapest commercial weed eater, you can’t go wrong with this one.

Place the trimmer on the ground, squeeze the throttle and pull the rope a couple of times. Then set the choke to the middle position, squeeze the throttle and pull the rope so that the gas trimmer starts. - Source: Internet For the greatest durability, round string is the standard.

With a low capacity comes a low speed. - Source: Internet On the other hand, trimmers with straight shafts are considered a better option for taller users. Also, such models are usually more powerful and suitable for maintaining large areas. Also, a tool with the straight shaft allows for working for extended periods. The downside is that this type of string trimmers comes at a higher price tag compared to devices with curved shafts. - Source: Internet The brushless motor powers the Greenworks PRO 80V engine.

This weed eater is the best for a mid-range job. With a nice trimmer head, solid steel construction, and its long-lasting battery, this is a brush cutter that works well for most people. - Source: Internet Some string trimmers require pre-cut lengths of line. Others use either one or two long lengths of line that wind onto a spool. You may need to remove the spool from the housing or load it in place. Refer to the owner’s manual or manufacturer’s website for detailed instructions for your specific trimmer brand and model. - Source: Internet The Husqvarna 324L Cutting Path Gas String Trimmer is our pick for the best overall commercial weed eater. It has a 25cc, 4-cycle engine that can spin the line up to 7,000 revolutions per minute (RPM). The 18-inch trimmer head makes short work of any tall grass and weeds, and the easy to use bumper feed releases line when you tap it on the ground for ultimate control.

Even though 4-stroke engine weed trimmers are considered heavy, the Husqvarna 324L is quite light. - Source: Internet Every string trimmer, whether cordless, plug-in electric, or gas-powered, has limitations on line size. Line diameter is a good indicator of durability. Assuming the same material and shape, a thicker line lasts longer.

The manufacturer has designed it in a way that everyone can open and replace the detail without the help of an expert.

That’s even light for an electric string trimmer. 3. Is a straight or curved shaft string trimmer better? - Source: Internet When buying a car, the first place you will look is under the hood. With string trimmers, it’s all the same because the primary focus should be put on the power of an engine.

The gadget has a powerful four-cycle 25cc engine.

The cushioning on the handle will ensure that your hands feel minimum vibration while using the machinery. The handle assembly can also be folded down for easier storage. - Source: Internet The line of the weed eater is, well, what eats the weed.

However, heavy lines may not work for certain weed eaters. - Source: Internet Basic trimmer string is made of hardened monofilament nylon.

With this power, the tool comes as the multipurpose equipment. So, you can easily transform the gadget from a cutter to a bump by changing the head of the device. - Source: Internet For battery-powered trimmers, our primary goal was to assess power and run time. For gas-engine trimmers, we wanted to judge whether the power they provided was offset by their noise and weight. For all trimmers, we wanted to see if each machine was comfortable and well balanced, and whether its line feed was finicky or robust. We found that especially when we were using the machines to cut down weeds, the growth was so tough, it took an immediate toll on the trimmer’s line, causing us to use the bump feed line mechanism at twice or three times the rate that we would in normal grass trimming. - Source: Internet Reviews of this string trimmer are quite positive. Most people say that for a cheaper trimmer, it has a punch to it, and is able to tackle most lawns with ease. While a few people got duds that ended up breaking, the majority of people were satisfied with the commercial weed eater they had. - Source: Internet The downside to the Honda HHT35SLTAT is that it quickly goes through gas, which is not surprising considering the engine size, but it would often run out when we were far from a refill source. The trimmer is difficult to get off the tool, and refilling it is tedious, and it’s difficult to get the head back on when you are finished. At 17 pounds, it can get quite heavy after a short time. - Source: Internet Similarly, battery-powered trimmers are great as they are extremely portable, light and noiseless.

There are many ways to kill weeds and keep your garden in tip top condition, but weed eaters are certainly the easiest, most convenient and most effective. - Source: Internet Negative reviews focus on its bump feed, with some saying that the head is hard to remove or that it gets tangled.

However, most people say the trimmer head isn’t too bad, especially after some tinkering, and the overall review score is nearly perfect. - Source: Internet To give it enough power to stand among commercial-grade trimmers, this machine has a 21.1cc PureFire 2-Stroke engine.

We’re confident recommending it for its value and use on large, rural properties. - Source: Internet The last crucial point to consider when buying a string trimmer is its weight.

For me, it is the right <strong>trimmer</strong> that can cut an overgrown lawn before using a lawnmower. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>If the Ego ST1511T is not available, we also like the Ego ST1521S Power+ String Trimmer with Powerload. This is the previous generation of Ego <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>, and it shares much of what makes the ST1511T such a success: long battery life, excellent power, and the easy line change. The significant differences are that it doesn’t have the telescoping shaft or the quick adjustment on the handle, so it’s not as flexible for varying body heights. The two <strong>trimmer</strong>s are typically sold for around the same price, so we recommend choosing this model only if the ST1511T is out of stock and you can’t wait for it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>First, you need to make sure the <strong>trimmer</strong> line you’ve purchased is right for your weed eater. Too thin, or too thick, and it may not work with your machine. Do your research and get the right line. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Husqvarna 128ld <strong>trimmer</strong> is fitted with a 2-stroke, 28-cc engine, which makes it optimized for performance. The 1-horsepower engine is powerful enough to cut through bush-like terrain with no hassles. Similar to other gas-powered <strong>trimmer</strong>s, the Husqvarna 128ld also makes use of 100% gasoline, which needs to be mixed with oil before use. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Husqvarna 128LD weighs 10.8 lbs which makes it lightweight for a gas <strong>trimmer</strong>. It should be easy to carry this <strong>trimmer</strong> around for a long period of time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Milwaukee 2825-21ST M18 FUEL String Trimmer is our premium choice pick. It’s a battery-powered <strong>trimmer</strong> that allows complete portability and near-silent operation. The battery and charger come with it, and it can run close to an hour on a single charge thanks to its brushless motor that uses less power and creates less heat. It has a straight 74-inch shaft that should be long enough for most people. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The weight of a <strong>trimmer</strong> is another thing that you should consider while buying a weed eater for commercial purposes. As you know, clearing your larger fields will take time and therefore, it should not be heavy if you want to complete the work without getting tired. The weed eater’s weight can be determined by the elements it comprises. That’s why you should not go with <strong>trimmer</strong>s that come with various parts. Power - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Instead of a blade, <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s use a <strong>string</strong> (or “line”) to slice through foliage. String <strong>trimmer</strong>s consist of a long shaft with a cutting head, also known as a <strong>trimmer</strong> head, on one end. The cutting head is the part of the tool where you load the <strong>string</strong>, and it’s the part that does the cutting (thus the name). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The RM1159 weighs roughly about 78 pounds and consists of a 4-cycle 159cc OHV engine. The loop handle is ergonomic in design that also folds, allowing for easy storage and smooth transport. The RM1159 is capable of mowing down the toughest blades of grass. You can also adjust the cutting height of the <strong>trimmer</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It is a common question that why should you choose this <strong>trimmer</strong> when there are bigger and better <strong>trimmer</strong>s in the market in the same price range. I have to offer several reasons why you should choose the GT-225 over others. Just because it is a lightweight <strong>trimmer</strong> does not mean that it lacks power. The Echo GT-225 is capable of edging and trimming without giving up midway. While other models pack a lot more power, they do not have the combination of being lightweight and powerful at the same time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But there are a few bonus features offered by some manufacturers that can take your <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> from “good” to the best weed eater around. However—and this is a big drawback for some—the power cord can severely limit your range and may prove to be a hazard. It may be all too easy for some to cut through it by accident or even trip over it while they work. For these reasons, corded weed eaters are best for those with smaller yards, who live in big towns, and who can stick close to home for their trimming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>That depends on your specific needs. Trimmers with curved shafts are usually shorter, lighter, and cheaper. Straight shafts are longer, so they can reach a wider radius, and these <strong>trimmer</strong>s typically produce more torque. You’ll notice all of our top picks have straight shafts. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=6><li>Tanaka TCG22EAP2SLB 2-Cycle Gas Powered Curved Shaft String Trimmer Now another two-stroke gas-powered Tanaka commercial weed eater enters the list. Instead of focusing on commercial-grade cutting power, the Tanaka TCG22EAP2SLB <strong>trimmer</strong> prides itself on an ergonomic design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Why does the power of the engine matter the most when making a gas <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> comparison of similar models? This characteristic determines the strength and effectiveness of the device, as the engine is what powers the equipment. Therefore, the more potent the engine is, the better the performance your tool delivers. It also means that a <strong>trimmer</strong> with a powerful engine can handle heavy-duty jobs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Square <strong>trimmer</strong> line has four hard cutting edges that are designed to aggressively cut through coarse weeds and green underbrush, where it excels. Round line is quieter and more fuel-efficient due to reduced wind resistance. It is also more durable than square line of the same size because it consists of more material. For generally weed-free lawns, round line could be the best choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This is a corded <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>, which means you need to have a long enough extension cord for your yard. With 8,000 RPM and 6.5 amps, this <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> should be powerful enough to handle most light yard work. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Everyone likes a well-maintained lawn.

But it has a lot of other features to commend it as a great choice in 4 stroke <strong>trimmer</strong>s. Straight shaft <strong>trimmer</strong>s have the advantage of transferring power more efficiently to the <strong>trimmer</strong> head. Given all the moving parts of a gas-powered <strong>trimmer</strong>, these particular types of weed eaters can be somewhat expensive to maintain. Because the gas-powered <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> has no cord, it is not limited by the length of that cord as to where it can go. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We test our gas-engine and battery-powered <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s in identical fashion. We use the machines on ordinary suburban lawn grasses such as blue grass, perennial ryegrass, and fescues in a variety of suburban and rural locations. However, our most severe testing occurred along the sloping bank of a sand floor drainage basin in southern New Jersey, where we used the <strong>trimmer</strong>s to cut down knee-deep weeds and wild flowers. We also did considerable edging where sidewalks meet lawns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the more annoying parts of using a weed eater is putting in new <strong>trimmer</strong> line. Once you run out, you have to put more in. For some, it can feel like a hassle, but once you know how it works, it can be quite easy. Let’s look at some of the best ways to <strong>string</strong> it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While searching for the best <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> lines on the market, the most popular types among users were made with gatorline, nylon, polymer, and colymer and had round, square, twisted, and multi-sided designs, each with their unique durability, cutting power, and noise- and vibration-reduction. We also included weed wacker <strong>string</strong>s of varying sizes for light- to heavy-duty yard work, ranging from .080 to .155 inches, making them compatible with a range of residential and commercial weed wacker heads. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While the materials used to make <strong>trimmer</strong> <strong>string</strong>s are all reasonably weld resistant, some <strong>string</strong> types have a higher degree of resistance than others. Given the same material, shaped line is more weld-resistant than round because of the increased surface area. Round <strong>string</strong> has the least amount of surface area, allowing heat buildup to occur more quickly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Greenworks ST80L210 String Trimmer is another battery-powered model that features a 16-inch <strong>trimmer</strong> head. It uses a brushless motor to increase torque and battery life. One full charge usually lasts about 45 minutes. It’s not light, but it’s not heavy either at a little under 10 pounds. At 65 inches long, it should be suitable for most people. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> is your basic cheapie corded unit. Again, it works well for casual use, so check it out if you want something for cheap. It may end up surprising you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This bump feed and <strong>trimmer</strong> head has a line that is nice and quiet, yet it works at cutting your bushes.

These tools go by many names, including weed eater, weed wacker, grass <strong>trimmer</strong>, and weed <strong>trimmer</strong>.

It is fitted with a 25cc X-Torq engine and equipped with a Smart Start System. The X-Torq engine helps increase the efficiency of fuel by up to 20% and reduces the emission of harmful exhaust by 60%. Apart from being quieter than other models, the Husqvarna 324L also limits the exhaust emissions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Round <strong>string</strong> comes in all sizes. It is economical, durable, and easy to reload. A round <strong>string</strong> is best for lawns with mostly grass and just a few weeds. It is not as efficient on weedy properties because the smooth edges tend to tear through weeds rather than cutting cleanly. A round <strong>string</strong> is also more likely to overheat and weld together when trimming along concrete walls or fences. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Weed <strong>trimmer</strong> <strong>string</strong> is available in round, square, multi-sided, twisted, and serrated shapes for different types of yard work. The shape of the <strong>string</strong> affects performance in several ways, including the cleanness of the cut, the durability of the <strong>string</strong>, and even noise level. It is important to match the shape with the application for which you’ll be using the <strong>string</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>No matter what, you are going to run out of <strong>string</strong> and need to replace it. Most models require you to rewind it by hand, but some make it much more difficult than others.

Very easy to assemble as you just have to reposition the handle and install its guard. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gasoline weed <strong>trimmer</strong>s are available either with straight or curved shafts. The curved ones can bend between the spinning <strong>trimmer</strong> head and its handle. Such a tool will be a perfect match for small people. A device with a curved shaft also comes as more durable because such a design allows the flexibility of the drive cable. The curved shafts also have a better balance than straight ones that increases their maneuverability in hard-to-reach areas. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The cutting width that the weed eater provides can make a big difference in how long it takes you to complete a project. A wider cutting will go through more <strong>string</strong>, but the time-saving advantage makes it worth it. If choosing between two similar models, we recommend the one with the bigger cutting width. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are a tall person, you want a weed <strong>trimmer</strong> that will fit your height.

String <strong>trimmer</strong>s with 4-stroke engines are typically quieter and have better fuel efficiency than 2-stroke weed eaters.

However, these also require more maintenance, since these tools need regular oil changes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Many weed eaters employ a starting line to start the <strong>trimmer</strong>. Here, you need to pull this line a few times, which is quite time-consuming and tiring also. Meanwhile, some <strong>trimmer</strong>s do not even start with consistent pulling.

For extra tough grass and commercial-grade jobs, the Craftsman CMXGTAMD30SA might be the best choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The handle of electric <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s might be fixed.

You don’t have to wait for a battery to recharge. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Like most of high-quality gas <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong>s, this Remington model has a super-fast starting technology.

Negative reviews focus around its guard being low or some other flaws, but even the negative reviewers seem to like it in the end. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Better materials, like reinforced composite nylon have a greater more cutting power and breakage resistance. Some products include strengthening materials like aluminum that are incorporated into the nylon or a hardened core material to prevent breakage. Other <strong>trimmer</strong> <strong>string</strong>s are made from non-nylon polymers or copolymers for added strength. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You need to start the engines with the help of the manual recoil, which makes use of the fuel delivery system to get the engine running immediately.

However, heavy lines may not work for certain weed eaters. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Basic <strong>trimmer</strong> <strong>string</strong> is made of hardened monofilament nylon.

With this power, the tool comes as the multipurpose equipment. So, you can easily transform the gadget from a cutter to a bump by changing the head of the device. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For battery-powered <strong>trimmer</strong>s, our primary goal was to assess power and run time. For gas-engine <strong>trimmer</strong>s, we wanted to judge whether the power they provided was offset by their noise and weight. For all <strong>trimmer</strong>s, we wanted to see if each machine was comfortable and well balanced, and whether its line feed was finicky or robust. We found that especially when we were using the machines to cut down weeds, the growth was so tough, it took an immediate toll on the <strong>trimmer</strong>’s line, causing us to use the bump feed line mechanism at twice or three times the rate that we would in normal grass trimming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Reviews of this <strong>string</strong> <strong>trimmer</strong> are quite positive. Most people say that for a cheaper <strong>trimmer</strong>, it has a punch to it, and is able to tackle most lawns with ease.

The <strong>trimmer</strong> is difficult to get off the tool, and refilling it is tedious, and it’s difficult to get the head back on when you are finished. At 17 pounds, it can get quite heavy after a short time. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Similarly, battery-powered <strong>trimmer</strong>s are great as they are extremely portable, light and noiseless. But, you will always have to keep an extra battery handy if the battery in use gets drained. Weight - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You are able to customize the weed eater using the Power Command Dial.

There are many ways to kill weeds and keep your garden in tip top condition, but weed eaters are certainly the easiest, most convenient and most effective. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Negative reviews focus on its bump feed, with some saying that the head is hard to remove or that it gets tangled. Some negative reviews said it was a great <strong>trimmer</strong> otherwise, but that has ruined it. However, most people say the <strong>trimmer</strong> head isn’t too bad, especially after some tinkering, and the overall review score is nearly perfect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To give it enough power to stand among commercial-grade <strong>trimmer</strong>s, this machine has a 21.1cc PureFire 2-Stroke engine.

When using such a tool, you expose yourself to some risks. Therefore, as a rule, always check for a model with a safety guard fixed around its head. Also, make sure to wear personal protection while operating the <strong>trimmer</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the difference in the Echo, besides the curved shaft, is the rapid feed line. Unlike the bump feed, the rapid feed puts out <strong>string</strong> itself. However, at times, it is known to get stuck. The rapid feed is convenient for users. Pros The Echo is lightweight. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Note that we haven’t yet tested the Craftsman WS2400, due in part to supply-chain issues and shipping delays.
