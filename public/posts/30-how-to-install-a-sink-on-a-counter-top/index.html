As the roll top runs all the way from the front to the back and is fully supported on the kitchen unit you do not need to cut out the sink shape or etch in the drainage grooves. Simply seal with silicone to the countertop and you are good to go! - Source: Internet Fabricators can achieve this look in a granite worktop by cutting out a hole with a core drill and then using a router to route out the kitchen sink shape. To achieve the true professional look you can follow with a 20mm polishing wheel. Fluting wheels will add your drainage grooves and should be followed by an abrasive polishing wheel to polish it to a high shine finish. - Source: Internet Step 5: Add Backsplash and Caulk Backsplashes come in a million styles.

Simply drop the sink in and seal with the silicone. - Source: Internet First, decide if you’re installing a drop-in or an under-mounted sink. Under-mounted sinks can only be supported by a solid slab like granite, marble, or quartz countertops. Lighter stone and non-stone material like ceramic will likely need a drop-in sink. This controls the required size of your cutout and the final effect of your installed sink. - Source: Internet Start by fitting the mounting clips onto the sink where they will attach to the countertop and provide secure support around the circumference. Then fit, seal, and secure the strainer basket and gaskets. Install the faucet through the top, then secure the mount for the garbage disposal below.

If your drainpipe connections are not perfectly aligned or the right length, this is easily fixed. If your drainpipe is misaligned, you can adjust with a few elbow pieces and short pipe sections to realign with your current drains.

To release the water pressure off the lines, open your <strong>sink</strong> faucet and let the water run until it turns to a slow drip. Use an adjustable wrench to disconnect the water supply tubes, keeping a bucket on hand to catch any excess water. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Not all <strong>sink</strong>s have the same drain alignment. If your drainpipe connections are not perfectly aligned or the right length, this is easily fixed. If your drainpipe is misaligned, you can adjust with a few elbow pieces and short pipe sections to realign with your current drains. If the drainline is too short or too long, you can cut the right length of PVC pipe from a kit to adjust the length. This will allow you to cleanly hook up your drains. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Note: A single-<strong>sink</strong> vanity will require one faucet and a double-<strong>sink</strong> vanity option will require two. 9.
