Finish it off with warm water and a clean rag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the safest ways to remove <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> from your glasses is to add a small amount of warm water with soap in it to a cotton bud or cloth.

For this, it is highly recommended to use a plastic putty knife or a razor blade.

Use it only as a last resort or when you are stuck with thick and dried up <strong>paint</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Dip a cloth or even a paper towel into a small amount of acetone (or rubbing alcohol which works slower).

These precautions include reading the warnings stated on the product label. Keep reading this article as we further discuss this topic, and it may also answer some questions you have in mind. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are other ways of getting nasty.

Take precautions when dealing with this solution and wear protective clothing. Rub the solvent onto the <strong>paint</strong> until it is off, then wipes it clean with a clean rag. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best method for removing <strong>paint</strong>ed graffiti from glass is to use a razor blade to carefully scrape it off.

Maybe you have done the best you can to cover areas, but you still somehow manage to find <strong>paint</strong> splatter on surfaces when you are finished.

Removing <strong>paint</strong> from plastic, on the other hand, can be a little more difficult as solvents can damage the surface. Thankfully, when it comes to how to remove <strong>paint</strong> from plastic, there are a few safer methods. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Use a dry, absorbent cloth to gently dab on the <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong> stain.

Use a putty knife or blade to scrape off the <strong>paint</strong>; alternatively, you may opt to scrub or brush it off as a safer option. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The main solvent for most <strong>spray</strong> <strong>paint</strong>s is either <strong>paint</strong> thinner, lacquer thinner, or acetone. These work for removal but can also smear the <strong>paint</strong>.
