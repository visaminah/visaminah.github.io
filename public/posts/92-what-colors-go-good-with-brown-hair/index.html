Bright eye colours (green, blue or hazel) or dark <strong>brown</strong> (This one is MEEEE). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Red, orange, and yellow undertones naturally combine to make up the different shades of <strong>brown</strong> hair.

Gets even better when styled with loose, chunky curls. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Many people believe that dark hair has to have warm undertones like red or orange. While warm hair is gorgeous, it doesn’t complement every skin tone. A cool ash <strong>brown</strong> hair color is your best bet for skin with olive or golden undertones because it will balance you out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Who knew that <strong>brown</strong> hair could be so diverse? In fact, brunettes have as many interesting choices for enhancing their color as blondes or redheads do. Different shades of <strong>brown</strong> hair are inspiring and expressive. We wish you to find your most flattering options! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=45><li>Classy Brunette Look. To show off the beauty and shine of naturally brunette hair, add light <strong>brown</strong> accents to the lengths and ends, avoiding the roots. Lift the midshaft slightly for a sun-kissed effect and lightweight appearance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>When caring for your ideal <strong>brown</strong> shade, stock up on products formulated for brunettes . Remember for dyed hair, you’ll need to touch-up your roots, from chestnut to light blonde, know what your hair shade ranges from. From <strong>brown</strong> shampoos to <strong>brown</strong> hair gloss , there are many products for brunettes that can easily refresh hair color. The right products can subtly brighten and deepen different tones in your <strong>brown</strong> hair as you wash for a shinier, more dimensional brunette. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Brunettes can wear almost all clothing <strong>colors</strong>; however, there are some shades that make them look more stunning and fabulous. Always remember that the key is to wear clothing <strong>colors</strong> that will accentuate and highlight your <strong>brown</strong> hair. So, what are the <strong>colors</strong> that look best on brunettes? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=16><li>Red-Carpet Long Brown Hair. The long brunette hair looks fabulous with the highlighted strands varying from deep <strong>brown</strong> to mild latte. Color small pieces of hair using different <strong>brown</strong> shades and complete the look with classy Hollywood waves. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Fortunately, there are plenty of options in hair color for pale skin. Fair skin can often act as a neutral background for a variety of <strong>colors</strong> and any color can be adapted to pale skin as long as the undertones are complemented. There are more trendy color choices than there have ever been before, and you can choose shades ranging from platinum blonde to red, ashy <strong>brown</strong> and espresso, the variety is endless! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re a brunette that has a medium skin tone with cool undertones, go for a glossy, rich chocolate <strong>brown</strong>. Alternatively, a tone with a purplish tinge, or even a blue-black colour will offset your complexion. Those with a warmer undertone should keep clear of brunette colours that have a bluish tint to them, but apart from that, anything goes; dark mahogany <strong>brown</strong>s are especially flattering. If you want to go lighter, a honey almond colour works wonders on those with warm undertones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=32><li>Light Brunette Hair with Copper Tones. Hands down, this sensual and warming, copper-rich balayage color should be on your list of hair <strong>colors</strong> to try. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Pink is one of the best clothing <strong>colors</strong> that look best on brunettes. It is a feminine shade, and almost all women have a pink-colored outfit in their closet. Fortunately, brunettes will look fabulous in pink, especially if you wear shades like hot pink and baby pink. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are a few tricks to be sure you’re choosing the right hair <strong>colors</strong> for your skin tone. First, your eyes are a great indication of your skin tone. If they are blue or green, chances are your skin tone is cool. If you find flecks of gold, then your skin tone is warm. Still not sure? Check your wrist: veins that appear blue or purple speak of cool undertones; if they appear green, then you most likely have warm undertones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Instead of chunky highlights throughout chestnut strands, achieve a sunny golden <strong>brown</strong> hair color with a sombre solution. To avoid harsh transitions and contrasting <strong>colors</strong>, the subtle technique fades from dark to light in soft, complementing types of <strong>brown</strong> hair color. Warm hues like this will work great for various skin tones with cool undertones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=14><li>Fancy Brown Hair Color. To amp up your <strong>brown</strong> hair, add different <strong>brown</strong> shades through the lengths. Set off the dark roots with lighter <strong>brown</strong> strands. Do not lift the color too much for a natural look and glamorous shine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li><ol start=33><li>Dark Browns with Rusty Balayage. Just as we’ve mentioned, rich <strong>brown</strong>s and punchy reds are a match made in heaven that works for all skin tones! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li><ol start=7><li>Brown Hair in a Cocoa Hue. Warm and fuzzy, cocoa makes you think of hot drinks by the fireplace, but it’s also one of the best shades of <strong>brown</strong>! It’s ideal for fair-skinned people but generally works for everyone! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>If you want hair <strong>colors</strong> for light skin that aren’t in the blonde family, try taking your look to the other end of the color spectrum with a rich espresso shade. Dark <strong>brown</strong> hair may be too intense for cool-toned skin but it’s ideal for those with warmer or more olive-toned skin. The contrast makes skin appear porcelain-like and suits green eyes beautifully. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You’ll want something in the chocolate or mocha family if you’re going to go with a rich <strong>brown</strong>. If your skin is warm, then a rich <strong>brown</strong> in cooler tones will give your yellow skin a beautiful, creamy look (think Miranda Kerr). It’s especially stunning if your eyes are blue. Luckily, cool <strong>brown</strong> is universally flattering on nearly everyone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Not everyone wants to keep their hair within the natural shades most people are born with. If you’re looking for a playful color but have pale skin, avoid deep jewel tones that will look too harsh on pale skin. Unicorn <strong>colors</strong> in pastels will suit fair skin best. Lavender tones are ideal for warm skin tones and light rose complement cool skin tones in a beautiful, dramatic way. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=18><li>Long Wavy Brown Hair. Long <strong>brown</strong> hair does look really good on women of all age groups. A generous bunch of light <strong>brown</strong> highlights will make your wavy hair take on a mesmerizing dimension. The cascade of sun-kissed ripple-like waves gives a fascinating vibe to this <strong>brown</strong> hair. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>For fair skin with either hazel or blue eyes, try a medium ashy <strong>brown</strong> color. The ash color carries the same properties as platinum or ash blonde, and it’s a perfect complement to a base of cool skin tones with pink or red undertones. If you’re looking for a way to achieve an ashy <strong>brown</strong>, make sure you or your stylist puts on a toner to lighten the rich tones of the <strong>brown</strong> color. Ashy <strong>brown</strong> is very popular now but looks the best on people with fair skin. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=38><li>Brown Hair Color in Copper Tones. For a softer look and overall gentler feel, add some lighter hues to your <strong>brown</strong> hair. The medium copper-<strong>brown</strong> is perfect for those with warm and fair skin tones. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>If you can’t experiment too much with color due to work or hair health reasons, there’s still a way to have fun with these dark <strong>brown</strong> hair color ideas. Ask your colorist for chunky mocha highlights that add warmth and make soft waves look more defined. The color is still striking while remaining subtle and sophisticated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=http://2bonthewater.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/Ontelaunee_Landscape_photo.340123821_std.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="What Colors Go Good With Brown Hair - What Colors Look Best with Gray Hair?"><p>Here are a few tips to help you find information about Cool Brown Hair:</p><ul><li>Look for good places to get information about Best Hair Color For Brunettes.
