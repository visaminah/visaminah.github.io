These materials are kept burning in the kiln for seven consecutive days. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In the US, modern normal <strong>brick</strong>s (controlled by the American Society for Testing and Materials i.e. ASTM) are approximately 8 × 3 5⁄8 × 2 1⁄4 in. (203 × 92 × 57 mm). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The standard <strong>brick</strong> dimensions are 7.48 X 3.54 x 3.54 (length x width x thickness) in inches. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The standard co-ordinating size for <strong>brick</strong>work is 225 mm x 112.5 mm x 75 mm (length x depth x height). This includes 10 mm mortar joints, and so the standard size for a <strong>brick</strong> itself is 215 mm x 102.5 mm x 65 mm (length x depth x height). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>According to their building standards and codes, all countries have standardized a fixed size for <strong>brick</strong>s. Bricks are made in standard sizes for better workability. So that mason can easily lift and place them in proper position. For large size <strong>brick</strong>s, it will be hard to burn them properly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The dimensions of a <strong>brick</strong> vary depending on the place of manufacture. For instance, a standard <strong>brick</strong> in Australia at present there are Australian Standards which are met fairly consistently across the country. A standard metric <strong>brick</strong> is 230 x 110 x 76mm high, and a metric <strong>modular</strong> <strong>brick</strong> is 90 x 290 x 90 high. Seven courses of a standard <strong>brick</strong> (76+10=86 mm) would make up a height of 602mm, but the bed joints are adjusted so that seven courses come to a module of 600mm. A <strong>modular</strong> metric <strong>brick</strong> and its joints occupies 300 x 100 mm on the face, so that <strong>modular</strong> dimensions of 100 and 300mm are easily met. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Different countries have different model <strong>brick</strong> measurements and proportions. Yet, <strong>brick</strong> can be prepared in many designs and dimensions, determined by its utilization. If <strong>brick</strong>s are of considerable size, it is hard to burn them correctly and they turn out to be too weighty to be put with one hand. On the contrary, if <strong>brick</strong>s are made small, extra quantity of mortar is needed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When selecting the right kind of <strong>brick</strong> for the job, it is good to consider a number of important factors such as fire resistance, moisture movement and thermal movement. In addition, it is also good to put into consideration other things like thermal characteristics, pore structure and weight. Furthermore, it is good to check out a <strong>brick</strong>’s density, surface texture and colour before buying. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With the help of the above article, you got to know what is the most common <strong>brick</strong> size used in construction. The dimensions of a standard <strong>brick</strong> are around 8 inches long x 3 ⅝ inches wide x 2 ¼ inches high. Thus, that’s all you need to know about the standard <strong>brick</strong> size. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Nevertheless, in the most significant regions of the country, the <strong>brick</strong>s available in size of 9″×4″ × 3″ which is called field <strong>brick</strong>s. The weight of this <strong>brick</strong> is about 3.0 kg. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This type of standard <strong>brick</strong> is similar to burnt clay <strong>brick</strong>s. Its size is also similar to its. But this type of standard <strong>brick</strong> has high compressive strength. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bricks are the most commonly used and essential building material for construction. The standard <strong>brick</strong> size is used to make a masonry wall to divide the room in the building. Which is used due to its durable and strong nature. Due to its low cost and durability, it has been used continuously even in modern times. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Therefore, a benchmark dimension is decided for different <strong>brick</strong> works. Existing size (or the stated size), is the genuine measurement of the <strong>brick</strong>. Nominal size is the genuine size along with the width of the mortar joint. Nearly all <strong>brick</strong>s are created in such a method that the supposed nominal sizes go along with a grid of four inch, which go along with the broadness of other construction materials such as windows, doors, and wood components. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To increase productivity, a range of <strong>brick</strong>s are available with a larger face size. In most cases they retain the standard 230 length, but vary in width and height. Most of these are not intended to be used for facework, but can be used for both internal and external walls that are intended to be rendered and painted. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Frog is a depression provided on the top side in a <strong>brick</strong>. Frog is provided along the length of a <strong>brick</strong>. It is provided to reduce the self-weight of the <strong>brick</strong> and to enhance the bonding with mortar. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Glen-Gery offers <strong>brick</strong> in many different sizes across solid, cored or frogged body types, and from Modular size all the way up to a Double Titan Plus size. The most popular <strong>brick</strong> size is a Modular <strong>brick</strong> measuring at 3-5/8" thick by 2-1/4" high and 7-5/8" long. Thin Brick are also available in many of the sizes listed below. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We know that it is not possible to produce each and every <strong>brick</strong> at accurate dimensions. So, there are tolerances on the dimensions of <strong>brick</strong>s. They are mentioned below: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Traditionally <strong>brick</strong>s for building construction were initially made of clay. Bricks have a long history from the past to the present. Which has an old history up to about 5000 bc. The use of <strong>brick</strong> as an ancient technique is found in Roman, Egyptian and Indian cultures. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bricks are used to construct masonry structures and building elements such as walls. Bricks are durable and can be extremely strong in compression. Using <strong>brick</strong>s, it is possible to construct complex-shaped structures also. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Basic mud <strong>brick</strong>s are made by mixing earth with water, placing the mixture into moulds and drying the <strong>brick</strong>s in the open air. Straw or other fibres that are strong in tension are often added to the <strong>brick</strong>s to help reduce cracking. Mud <strong>brick</strong>s are joined with a mud mortar and can be used to build walls, vaults and domes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Typical Brick Size in United States: “In the United States, current model <strong>brick</strong>s are (managed by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)) approximately 8 × 3 5⁄8 × 2 1⁄4 inches (203 × 92 × 57 millimeter). The most regularly used is the customizable <strong>brick</strong> having size 7 5⁄8 × 3 5⁄8 × 2 1⁄4 inches (194 × 92 × 57 millimeter). This customizable <strong>brick</strong> of 7 5⁄8 with a 3⁄8 mortar joint facilitates the computation of the number of <strong>brick</strong>s in a particular course.” Source: Wikipedia - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The primary materials used to create <strong>brick</strong>s are clay, concrete, and calcium silicate. The materials are known for their mechanical properties. They offer several advantages like strength, density including improved insulation, plastering support as well as reduced cost. Some <strong>brick</strong>s are designed specifically for plastering. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bricks are rectangular (cuboid) shaped blocks usually made of clay. Bricks are small, cheap, and are relatively easy to handle. Bricks are used as a replacement for stone which is more expensive and difficult to handle. There are also many alternatives of <strong>brick</strong>s available in the market these days, such as AAC Blocks, concrete blocks, etc. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So that different fields need a different size of a <strong>brick</strong>. Different shape, different formation is also required. Different countries make <strong>brick</strong> in different ways for different uses. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Brick dimension in England: “In England, the length and width of the standard <strong>brick</strong> has continued to really consistent over the millenniums but the depth has differed from about 2 inches (approximately 51 mm) or compact in previous times to about 2 and a 1/2 inches (approximately 64 mm) more freshly. In the United Kingdom, the common dimensions of a present-day <strong>brick</strong> is 215 × 102.5 × 65 millimeter (around 8 5⁄8 × 4 1⁄8 × 2 5⁄8 inches), which, with a supposed 10 mm (3⁄8 inch) mortar joint, formulates a component dimension of 225 × 112.5 × 75 millimeter (9 × 4 1⁄2 × 3 inches), for a proportion of 6:3:2.” Source: Wikipedia - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Bricks are placed in a particular style so that the required thickness and shape of the masonry element can be constructed. It is known as <strong>brick</strong> bond. The joints are filled with mortar of cement and sand. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Tolerance is provided by standard specifications such as ASTM. ASTM C216 is used as the standard specification for facing <strong>brick</strong>s. Similarly, the specifications of C652 applies to hollow <strong>brick</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Vitrification of <strong>brick</strong>s is seen due to the high iron content in this type of <strong>brick</strong>. This type of <strong>brick</strong> gives a natural shine. So that this type of <strong>brick</strong> acts as more resistant to abrasion. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Solutions for Modular <strong>brick</strong>s are of nominal size 20<em>10</em>10 cm and 20% of the volume is lost in mortar between joints. Then what is the number of <strong>modular</strong> <strong>brick</strong>s required per cubic meter of <strong>brick</strong>work ?a)520b)500c)485d)470Correct answer is option &lsquo;D&rsquo;.

This dimension is used to construct a wall that is relatively durable and strong in nature. The standard <strong>brick</strong> size dimensions vary from country to country. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although concrete masonry structures can be constructed using virtually any layout dimension, for maximum construction efﬁ ciency and economy, concrete masonry elements should be designed and constructed with <strong>modular</strong> coordination in mind. Modular coordination is the practice of laying out and dimensioning structures and elements to standard lengths and heights to accommodate <strong>modular</strong>-sized building materials. When <strong>modular</strong> coordination is not considered during the design phase, jobsite decisions must be made—often in haste and at a cost. This TEK provides recommendations for planning masonry construction to minimize cutting of masonry units or using nonstandard unit sizes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Source: IS 1077: 1992 Physical properties Bricks should have minimum compressive strength as mentioned in Table 1 for respective class when tested according to IS 3495 (1): 1992.
