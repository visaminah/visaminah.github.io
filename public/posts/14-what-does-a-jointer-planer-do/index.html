As for further searchable items pertaining to Jointer / Planer: Which Comes First?, they will likewise have anything to do with How Does A Jointer Work. 14 Tips for What Does A Jointer Planer Do | Dewalt Planer/Jointer Combo The wood planer’s only job is to mill down wood to a desired thickness from one end to another. For instance if you have a board that’s 5/8 of an inch thick and need it to be 1/2 of an inch thick, then this is where a planer should be used. Another planer tip to keep in mind is if you have thick boards that have to be transformed into a much thinner ones, mark out the thickness that you want and run them through the band saw first. - Source: Internet So this is how it works, once the board has been run through the wood jointer. The wood jointer has created a perfect flat face along with an edge that has also been shaved to a clean surface that’s perpendicular to the face. You lay the jointed face down on the planer and as the planer pulls the board through the cutting head which is above the board and at the same time pushes downward and shaves wood from the top or rough face of the board. - Source: Internet The jointer is used to square up rough lumber that has twists, bows and cupping in the wood. The jointer’s main job is to take one of the faces of the board and make it flat. When the board is run through the jointer it takes shallow cuts off of the face. - Source: Internet Now that we know what each tool does and what the differences are let’s go over how each one works starting with the wood jointer. So how does a jointer work? All wood jointers’ have two tables, an infeed and an outfeed table which both are aligned on the same plane. A cutting head made up of knives is mounted between the two tables and is at the same height as the outfeed table. The infeed table of the jointer is set at a lower depth that’s equal to the amount of wood that you want to remove. - Source: Internet With any tool that depends on your circumstances and how big your projects are or will be. For a lot of hobby woodworkers benchtop planes and jointers work fine. They’re also a little easier on the pocket book not to mention they take up less space. - Source: Internet The jointer planer combos’ do have some negative things about them. You have to adjust the machine to go from jointing mode to planing which can be a royal pain in the neck. Plus sometimes when going from mode to mode you take a chance on knocking some of the adjustments out of line such as that fence. Does this mean that it’s a bad investment. No not at all you just need to take extra care and pay attention to what you’re doing. - Source: Internet A circular saw with the help of a saw guide is an option. What about using a router and a router table with a fence attachment? Yep that will work too and something else that works well is the good ole table saw with the help of a jointing jig. Granted that these options aren’t perfect or as quick as a wood jointer, they are meant as a temporary solution until you can afford to buy one. - Source: Internet At this stage you have 2 faces and 1 edge that are ninety degrees angles to each other. The only thing to do now is cut your board to the desired width on the table saw. To do this put the edge that you ran through the jointer up against the fence of the table saw and rip it down the length which will leave you with a second edge that matches the first. - Source: Internet The jointer and planer will pay for themselves in a couple of ways. The first is through time and efficiency especially if your in the cabinet and or furniture making business. We’ve all heard the old saying that time is money. The jointer and planer are 2 good examples of that. - Source: Internet The benchtop planers are pretty close to the same price as the jointers. I encourage you to stick to the benchtop styles because once you get into 12″ to 15″ jointers and planers the price goes way up. More than double with some brands. - Source: Internet As with anything the jointer planer combos do have benefits over the others. One of the benefits is the combos have only one cutting head in the machine to worry about. This is a money saver since you only have to buy one cutting head instead of two. The combo’s take up even less space than their counter parts because it’s an all in one machine. - Source: Internet Another way the jointer and planer pay for themselves is you can buy rough cut lumber. Rough cut lumber is by far cheaper than pre-milled lumber. As time goes by and material bought you’ll find that the jointer and planer have paid for themselves and will start to earn money through labor. - Source: Internet When enough passes have gone through the jointer, all cupping or twists and bows are taken out of the board leaving you with a nice flat surface to work with. An edge of the board can be squared up to make a nice ninety degree angle to match the face that you just cleaned up. This process should be done before you run a board through the planer. - Source: Internet Make a mark that’s one half inch thick, set your fence on the bandsaw to only cut just slightly less than the thickness to make sure you get what is needed out of that piece of wood. Then if the piece you want to use is just slightly more than you need then run that piece through the planer to get it down to the thickness that you want. The other piece that you don’t need can be used for something else in the future. don’t waste anything if you can help it. - Source: Internet Here are some recommendations for locating information about Jointer Planer Combo to get you started:\r- Research Jointer Planer Combo-related information from credible sources.
